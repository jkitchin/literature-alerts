The metal-support interaction is one of the most important pillars in heterogeneous catalysis, but developing a fundamental theory has been challenging because of the intricate interfaces. Based on experimental ‎data, interpretable machine learning, theoretical derivation, and first-principles simulations, we established a ‎general theory of metal-oxide interactions grounded in ‎metal-metal and metal-oxygen interactions. The theory applies to metal nanoparticles and atoms on oxide supports and oxide films on metal supports. We found that for late-transition metal catalysts, metal-metal interactions dominated the oxide support effects and suboxide encapsulation over metal nanoparticles. A principle of strong metal-metal interactions for encapsulation occurrence is formulated and substantiated by extensive ‎experiments including 10 metals and 16 ‎oxides. The valuable insights revealed on (strong) metal-support interaction advance the interfacial design of supported metal catalysts.

The development of high-performance non-Ir/Ru catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid is critical for the applications of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a new kind of heterostructure catalyst by loading 5.8% Ag nanoparticles on MnO nanorods (Ag/MnO) for acidic OER. The as-prepared Ag/MnO requires only an overpotential of 196 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and operates in a PEMWE for over 300 h at a current density of 200 mA cm–2, representing one of the best non-Ir/Ru OER catalysts. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms that the introduction of trace Ag can promote the generation of highly active Mn3+–O sites with oxygen vacancies at a low voltage, leading to a dual-metal-site lattice oxygen-mediated pathway with faster kinetics than the adsorbate evolution mechanism. Theoretical calculations indicate that the trace Ag promotes the overlap between the d orbitals of Mn and the s, p orbitals of O, thereby activating the lattice oxygen and reducing the OER energy barrier. The dissolution of Mn is also suppressed by Ag due to the increased energy for vacancy formation of Mn, where the stability number reaches a high value of 3058, supporting improved structural stability.

Exploiting highly effective electrocatalysts is a challenge for boosting the overall efficiency of water splitting. Herein, we present a nitrogen and ruthenium dual-doping strategy to tailor the electronic structures of NiCoP(N, Ru–NiCoP), creating high-performance bifunctional electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The dual-doping approach is favorable for electronic interactions within the NiCoP and CoP, yielding a near-zero Gibbs free energy for H adsorption. Consequently, the optimized N, Ru–NiCoP electrodes exhibit exceptional bifunctional activities, with overpotentials of 53 and 405 mV at 100 mA cm–2 for the HER and OER, respectively. Notably, their performance surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts at large current densities, demonstrating their potential for industrial water splitting applications. Moreover, the overall water-splitting device achieves a current density of 10 mA cm–2 with a driving voltage of only 1.54 V. This work provides an effective heteroatom doping strategy to develop low-cost and highly active electrocatalysts.

The field of data-driven chemistry is undergoing an evolution, driven by innovations in machine learning models for predicting molecular properties and behavior. Recent strides in ML-based interatomic potentials have paved the way for accurate modeling of diverse chemical and structural properties at the atomic level. The key determinant defining MLIP reliability remains the quality of the training data. A paramount challenge lies in constructing training sets that capture specific domains in the vast chemical and structural space. This Review navigates the intricate landscape of essential components and integrity of training data that ensure the extensibility and transferability of the resulting models. We delve into the details of active learning, discussing its various facets and implementations. We outline different types of uncertainty quantification applied to atomistic data acquisition and the correlations between estimated uncertainty and true error. The role of atomistic data samplers in generating diverse and informative structures is highlighted. Furthermore, we discuss data acquisition via modified and surrogate potential energy surfaces as an innovative approach to diversify training data. The Review also provides a list of publicly available data sets that cover essential domains of chemical space.

Abstract Ir‐Ru alloys with high Ru content serve as stable and highly active catalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers (PEM‐WEs), enabling efficient operation with low Ir loadings (150 µg cm − 2 ). Despite this, the mechanisms behind their enhanced stability remain unclear. In this study, operando Wide‐Angle X‐ray Scattering (WAXS) and ex situ techniques are utilized to investigate the structural evolution of these magnetron‐sputtered alloys during a PEM‐WE operation. The findings reveal that Ru leaches from the surface upon potential application, forming a dynamic Ir‐Ru@IrO x core‐shell structure. The Ir shell, strained by the Ir‐Ru core, maintains a lower oxidation state than pure Ir catalyst, leading to superior catalytic activity and stability. Remarkably, the Ir‐Ru 25:75 catalyst demonstrates better stability over Ir‐Ru 50:50, despite its higher Ru content, due to the better protection of the subsurface Ir and Ru from oxidation and dissolution. This study not only clarifies the performance‐enhancing mechanisms of Ir‐Ru catalysts but also suggests that other, more economical materials, such as Co or Ti, could serve as effective cores in Ir‐M systems, offering a pathway to more cost‐effective catalysts for PEM‐WE applications.

Abstract Perovskite‐type oxides are widely employed as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts due to their tunable composition, diverse structure, abundant natural reserves, remarkable stability, and low cost. The intrinsic OER electrocatalytic activity of these perovskite oxides is generally enhanced by improving conductivity, increasing specific surface area, and optimizing the adsorption of oxygen‐containing intermediates. This is achieved through rationally designed strategies, including compositional engineering, defect engineering, hybridization, and surface regulation. In this review, recent advances in perovskite oxides for OER are summarized, with a focus on exploring structure‐performance relationships. This review provides a brief introduction to the application of perovskite oxides in OER, followed by the classification and characteristics of these perovskite oxides. The primary OER catalytic mechanisms, and well‐established activity descriptors are discussed. The key strategies are concentrated for enhancing OER activity, including composition engineering, defect engineering, hybridization, and surface reconstruction. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in developing high‐performance perovskite oxides as OER electrocatalysts are presented.

Enhancing the selectivity of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to valuable multicarbon (C2+) products remains a significant challenge in green synthetic chemistry. Here, we present a dual-center strategy for metal oxides that boosts the photochemical conversion of CO2 to ethanol by regulating the coordination number of metal and oxygen sites. Notably, CuO catalysts rich in low-coordinated Cu–O domains have achieved nearly perfect ethanol selectivity (96.9%), extraordinary durability (60 h), and a superior yield rate of 30.5 μmol·g–1·h–1, surpassing the performance of many existing photocatalysts in water vapor and CO2. Density functional theory calculations and operando spectroscopic results provide conclusive evidence that tricoordinated copper (Cu3c) increases the coverage of key *CO species, while bicoordinated oxygen (O2c) controls the migration of *CO species, thereby effectively reducing the energy requirement for *CO dimerization into *OC–CO intermediates (ΔG*OC–CO = −0.56 eV) in the ethanol pathway. This work offers valuable insights for designing photocatalysts that exhibit improved selectivity for C2+ fuels.

Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) is of great importance for the production of green hydrogen. The large‐scale implementation of PEMWE, however, is seriously impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which results in considerable overpotential and thus the decreased energy conversion efficiency. To overcome this problem, researchers have extensively explored efficient anode catalysts that possess high activity and prolonged stability. Up to now, Ir‐based and Ru‐based catalysts are considered to be the most efficient candidates. Especially perovskite‐based catalysts have received intensive attention due to their distinctive structures and exceptional OER catalytic performance. To further promote their practical application, considerable research efforts are devoted to structural engineering toward enhanced activity and stability. In this paper, a review of the research progress on the advanced design of Ir‐ and Ru‐based perovskite catalysts is presented, with a focus on phase engineering, doping/substitution, morphology control, and compositing with other materials for perovskite catalysts as well as some preparation methods commonly used. It also summarizes the challenges and opportunities concerning perovskite‐based catalysts in current research, yielding further comprehension of the pertinent preparation and scrutiny of perovskite catalysts in the future.

Elucidating the electronic factors dominating the adsorption properties of transition-metal oxides is essential to construct highly efficient oxygen-evolving catalysts for hydrogen production by water splitting but remains a great challenge. Electron correlation from on-site Coulomb repulsion (U) among d-electrons is generally believed to significantly affect the electronic structure of these materials; however, it has long been neglected in studying their adsorption properties. Here, by choosing ruthenium oxide as a model system, we demonstrate the role of electron correlation on the electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our density functional theory plus U calculations on rutile RuO2 reveal that the electron correlation can tune the adsorption energies for oxygenated intermediate and optimize them after the metallic oxide being a Mott insulator upon increasing U. By regulating the RuO6 octahedral network, we constructed and synthesized a series of strongly correlated ruthenium oxides, where the Mott insulating ones indeed exhibit a superior OER performance to the metallic RuO2. Our work builds a bridge between the electrochemistry and Mott physics for transition-metal oxides, opening a new avenue for designing advanced catalysts.

For solid waste management and sustainable development, the conversion of waste materials into valuable feedstocks is essential. Keeping in mind the concept of "waste-to-wealth," we have synthesized value-added microporous graphitic carbon from waste Tecoma leaves, referred to as TA, through a one-step chemical activation process and utilized it for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) and capacitive energy storage applications. The transformation of biomass into metal-free porous graphitic carbon having an ORR efficiency comparable to or even better than commercially available Pt/C is critical for renewable energy conversion technologies. The TA-900 sample, synthesized at 900 °C having a high surface area of 1429 m2 g–1, containing 4.41 atom % nitrogen and 4.74 atom % oxygen, demonstrated excellent ORR performance among the synthesized graphitic carbon samples at different temperatures. It showed an onset potential (Eonset) of 1 V and a limiting current density (JL) of 6.21 mA cm–2, comparable to 10 wt % Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the TA-900 electrocatalyst exhibited a 4e– transfer mechanism in the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O. Regarding supercapacitor application, TA-900 achieved a high specific capacitance of 546 F g–1 in acidic and 327 F g–1 in neutral aqueous electrolyte at a current density of 1 A g–1 in a three-electrode setup. The TA-900-based symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC) device has remarkable durability, retaining its 84% capacitance retention even after 3000 cycles at 1 A g–1. It also achieved a notable energy density (33 Wh kg–1 and 6.60 mWh cm–3) and a power density (6.20 kW kg–1 and 1320 mW cm–3). The findings emphasize that heteroatom-doped TA-900 electrocatalysts synthesized from waste Tecoma leaves will be a promising, affordable alternative to the high-cost Pt/C catalyst used for clean energy conversion.

Discovery of novel and promising materials is a critical challenge in the field of chemistry and material science, traditionally approached through methodologies ranging from trial-and-error to machine-learning-driven inverse design. Recent studies suggest that transformer-based language models can be utilized as material generative models to expand the chemical space and explore materials with desired properties. In this work, we introduce the catalyst generative pretrained transformer (CatGPT), trained to generate string representations of inorganic catalyst structures from a vast chemical space. CatGPT not only demonstrates high performance in generating valid and accurate catalyst structures but also serves as a foundation model for generating the desired types of catalysts by text-conditioning and fine-tuning. As an example, we fine-tuned the pretrained CatGPT using a binary alloy catalyst data set designed for screening two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) catalyst and generated catalyst structures specialized for 2e-ORR. Our work demonstrates the potential of generative language models as generative tools for catalyst discovery.

D-amino acids, found in excess in a minority of organisms and crucial for marine invertebrates, contrast with the more common L-amino acids in most life forms. The local prebiotic origin of D-amino acid enantiomeric excess in natural systems remains an unsolved conundrum. Herein, we demonstrate the formation of enantiomeric excess (ee) D-amino acids through photocatalytic reductive amination of α-keto acids on natural pyrite. Various amino acids with ee values in the range of 14.5–42.4%, are formed. The wavy arrangement of atoms on the surface of pyrite is speculated to lead to the preferential formation of D-amino acids. This work reveals the intrinsic asymmetric photocatalytic activity of pyrite, which could expand understandings on mechanism of asymmetric catalysis and chirality of inorganic crystals. Furthermore, it provides a plausible pathway for the prebiotic formation of D-amino acids, adding further evidence to the origin of D-amino acids enantiomeric excess in natural systems. Enantiomeric excess D-amino acids form via photocatalytic reductive amination of α-keto acids on natural pyrite. This provides a plausible pathway for the prebiotic formation of D-amino acids.

Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to the valuable ammonia is a green and sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber-Bosch method for ammonia synthesis, while the activity and selectivity for ammonia production remains poor at low nitrite concentrations. Herein, we report a nanoporous intermetallic single-atom alloy CuZn (np/ISAA-CuZn) catalyst with completely isolated Cu-Zn active-sites, which achieves neutral nitrite reduction reaction with a remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency over 95% and the highest energy efficiency of ≈ 59.1% in wide potential range from −0.2 to −0.8 V vs. RHE. The np/ISAA-CuZn electrocatalyst was able to operate stably at 500 mA cm−2 for 220 h under membrane electrode assembly conditions with a stabilized NH3 Faraday efficiency of ~80% and high NO2‒ removal rate of ~100%. A series of in situ experimental studies combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that strong electronic interactions of isolated Cu-Zn active-sites altered the protonation adsorption species, effectively alleviating the protonation barrier of *NO2 and thus greatly facilitating the selective reduction of NO2− into NH3. Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction is a green alternative to the Haber-Bosch process, but its ammonia production remains inefficient at low nitrite levels. Here the authors report an intermetallic single atom alloy CuZn catalyst for nitrite reduction to ammonia with high efficiency and stability at low nitrite concentration of 1−10 mM.

Abstract The development of robust and efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been the main focus of water electrolysis but remains a great challenge. Here, the synthesis of a highly active and ultra‐stable Fe‐CoOOH electrocatalyst is reported by steering raw cobalt foam via an in situ solution combustion method assisted by a galvanic replacement reaction and subsequent electrochemical reconstruction of the CoFeO x pre‐catalyst. In/ ex situ electrochemical analysis and physicochemical characterizations show that the CoFeO x undergoes quick chemical and slow morphological reconstruction to Fe‐CoOOH nanosheets. The Fe‐CoOOH possesses a semi‐crystalline nature with distinct short‐range ordering and outstanding OER activity with overpotentials as low as 271 and 291 mV at current densities of 500 and 1,000 mA cm −2 , respectively. The remarkable stability under 1,000 mA cm −2 for at least 700 h is achieved. Theoretical calculations confirm the crucial role of Fe doping in facilitating surface reconstruction, enhancing OER activity, and improving the stability of the Fe‐CoOOH. Comparative analysis with other transition metals doping reveals the unique ability of Fe to adsorb onto the CoOOH surface, thereby modulating the electronic density and facilitating faster adsorption of reaction intermediates. This work represents valuable insights into the surface reconstruction and doping processes.

Engineering microstructures of Pt and understanding the related catalytic mechanism are critical to optimizing the performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Pt dispersion and coordination are precisely regulated on hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (hNCNCs) by a thermal-driven Pt migration, from edge-hosted Pt–N2Cl2 single sites in the initial Pt1/hNCNC-70 °C catalyst to Pt clusters/nanoparticles and back to in-plane Pt–NxC4–x single sites. Thereinto, Pt–N2Cl2 presents the optimal HER activity (6 mV@10 mA cm–2) while Pt–NxC4–x shows poor HER activity (321 mV@10 mA cm–2) due to their different Pt coordination. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the low-coordinated Pt–N2 intermediates derived from Pt–N2Cl2 under the working condition are the real active sites for HER, which enable the multi-H adsorption mechanism with an ideal H* adsorption energy of nearly 0 eV, thereby the high activity, as revealed by theoretical calculations. In contrast, the high-coordinated Pt–NxC4–x sites only allow the single-H adsorption with a positive adsorption energy and thereby the low HER activity. Accordingly, with an ultralow Pt loading of only 25 μgPt cm–2, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer assembled using Pt1/hNCNC-70 °C as the cathodic catalyst achieves an industrial-level current density of 1.0 A cm–2 at a low cell voltage of 1.66 V and high durability, showing great potential applications.

Coordination structure and group modifications of single-atom catalysts are essential for regulating superficial electronic structures and reaction activities. Epoxy group-modified single-atom Co-N-C configuration demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for hydrogen peroxide production. Through the manipulation of the coordination structure of Co-N-C and the doped epoxy groups, we elucidate the origin of catalytic activity in epoxygroup-modified Co-N-C configurations. Theoretical results indicate that the second coordination sphere of the Co-N-C structure is essential for the regulation of the two-electron pathway by the epoxy groups acting as cocatalysts. This cocatalytic mechanism originates from hydrogen bonding interactions between the epoxy groups and the OOH intermediates. Three epoxy groups within the second coordination sphere of Co-N-C configuration lead to the achievement of the optimal

High Nb-containing TiAl alloys exhibit exceptional high-temperature strength and room-temperature ductility, making them widely used in hot-section components of automotive and aerospace engines. However, the lack of accurate interatomic interaction potential for large-scale modeling severely hampers a comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism of Ti-Al-Nb alloys and the development of strategies to enhance the mechanical properties. Here, we develop a general-purpose machine-learned potential (MLP) for the Ti-Al-Nb ternary system by combining the neural evolution potential framework with an active learning scheme. The developed MLP, trained on extensive first-principles datasets, demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting various lattice and defect properties as well as high-temperature characteristics such as thermal expansion and melting point for TiAl systems. Notably, this potential can effectively describe the key effect of Nb doping on stacking fault energies and formation energies. Of practical importance is that our MLP enables large-scale molecular dynamics simulations involving tens of millions of atoms with ab initio accuracy, achieving an outstanding balance between computational speed and accuracy. These results pave the way for elucidating micromechanical behaviors and failure mechanism TiAl lamellar structures and developing high-performance TiAl alloys towards applications at elevated temperatures.

Microkinetic models (MKMs) are widely used within the computational heterogeneous catalysis community to investigate complex reaction mechanisms, rationalize experimental trends, and to accelerate the rational design of novel catalysts. However, constructing these models requires computationally expensive and manually tedious density functional theory (DFT) calculations for identifying transition states for each elementary reaction within the MKM. To address these challenges we demonstrate a novel protocol that uses the open-source kinetics workflow tool Pynta to automate the iterative training of a reactive machine learning potential (rMLP). Specifically, using the silver-catalyzed partial oxidation of methanol as a prototypical example, we first demonstrate our workflow by training an rMLP to accelerate the parallel calculation of DFT-quality transition states for all 53 reactions, achieving a 7x speedup compared to a DFT-only strategy. Detailed analysis of our training curriculum reveals the shortcomings of using an adaptive sampling scheme with a single rMLP model to describe all reactions within the MKM simultaneously. We show that these limitations can be overcome using a balanced "reaction class" approach that uses multiple rMLP models, each describing a single class of similar transition states. Finally, we demonstrate that our Pynta-based workflow is also compatible with large pre-trained foundational models. For example, by fine-tuning a top-performing graph neural network potential trained on the OC20 dataset, we observe an impressive 20x speedup with an 89\% success rate in identifying transition states. This work highlights the synergistic potential of integrating automated tools with machine learning to advance catalysis research.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as a key electrode process in fuel cells and metal-air batteries, plays a pivotal role in advancing clean energy technologies. However, the slow kinetics and high overpotential of the ORR significantly limit the efficiency of these energy devices. Therefore, the development of efficient, stable, and cost-effective ORR catalysts has become a central focus of current research. Carbon-based catalysts, with their excellent conductivity, chemical stability, and tunable structural features, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional precious metal catalysts. Nevertheless, challenges remain in the design of active sites, the tuning of electronic structures, and the large-scale synthesis of carbon-based catalysts. This review systematically introduces the fundamental mechanisms and key factors influencing the ORR, providing an analysis of the critical variables that affect catalyst performance. Furthermore, it summarizes several common methods for synthesizing carbon-based catalysts, including pyrolysis, deposition, and ball milling. Following this, the review categorizes and discusses the latest advancements in metal-free carbon-based catalysts, single-atom and dual-atom catalysts, as well as metal-based nanoparticle catalysts, with a particular focus on their mechanisms for enhancing the ORR performance. Finally, the current state of research on carbon-based ORR catalysts is summarized, and future development directions are proposed, emphasizing the optimization of active sites, improvements in catalyst stability, and potential strategies for large-scale applications.

Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach for clean hydrogen production, but the process is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the spin-dependent electron transfer process. Efforts to control spin through chirality and magnetization have shown potential in enhancing OER performance. Here we harnessed the potential of topological chiral semimetals (RhSi, RhSn and RhBiS) and their spin-polarized Fermi surfaces to promote the spin-dependent electron transfer in the OER, addressing the traditional volcano-plot limitations. We show that OER activities follow the trend RhSi < RhSn < RhBiS, corresponding to the increasing extent of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). The chiral single crystals outperform achiral counterparts (RhTe 2 , RhTe and RuO 2 ) in alkaline electrolyte, with RhBiS exhibiting a specific activity two orders of magnitude higher than RuO 2 . Our work reveals the pivotal roles of chirality and SOC in spin-dependent catalysis, facilitating the design of ultra-efficient chiral catalysts.

Manipulation C-C coupling pathway is of great importance for selective CO2 electroreduction but remain challenging. Herein, two model Cu-based catalysts, by modifying Cu nanowires with Ag nanoparticles (AgCu NW) and Ag single atoms (Ag1Cu NW), respectively, are rationally designed for exploring the C-C coupling mechanisms in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Compared to AgCu NW, the Ag1Cu NW exhibits a more than 10-fold increase of C2 selectivity in CO2 reduction to ethanol, with ethanol-to-ethylene ratio increased from 0.41 over AgCu NW to 4.26 over Ag1Cu NW. Via a variety of operando/in-situ techniques and theoretical calculation, the enhanced ethanol selectivity over Ag1Cu NW is attributed to the promoted H2O dissociation over the atomically dispersed Ag sites, which effectively accelerated *CO hydrogenation to form *CHO intermediate and facilitated asymmetric *CO-*CHO coupling over paired Cu atoms adjacent to single Ag atoms. Results of this work provide deep insight into the C-C coupling pathways towards target C2+ product and shed light on the rational design of efficient CO2RR catalysts with paired active sites. Manipulating the carbon-carbon coupling pathway in CO2 electroreduction is vital yet challenging. Here, by studying two model copper-based catalysts with distinct ethylene and ethanol selectivity, authors investigate the mechanistic origins for symmetric and asymmetric carbon-carbon coupling.

The catalytic hydrogen transfer (CHT) cascade reaction coupling alcohols with nitro compounds to synthesize imines is highly significant due to its remarkable efficiency and atom economy. However, the complicated multistep reaction process makes single-site catalysts exhibit unsatisfactory catalytic performance for the CHT cascade reaction. Herein, inspired by the findings of DFT calculations that Co nanocluster (CoNC) and Co single atom (CoSA) can act as the optimal active sites for alcohol oxidation and nitro reduction, respectively, one dual-active site catalyst (CoSA-CoNC/CN), containing CoSA and CoNC sites, was synthesized by a two-step vacuum pyrolysis strategy. Benefiting from the relay-like tandem catalysis of CoNC and CoSA, CoSA-CoNC/CN achieved an impressive 93% nitrobenzene conversion and 99% imine selectivity at 160 °C in 4 h, with a record turnover frequency of 20.9 h–1. This work provides insights into the functions of single-atom and nanocluster active sites in the CHT cascade reaction and sheds light on the rational preparation of tandem catalysts.

To design new materials and understand their novel phenomena, it is imperative to predict the structure and properties of materials that often rely on first-principles theory. However, such methods are computationally demanding and limited to small systems. This topical review investigates machine learning (ML) approaches, specifically non-parametric sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR), to model the potential energy surface (PES) of materials, while starting from the basics of ML methods for a comprehensive review. SGPR can efficiently represent PES with minimal ab initio data, significantly reducing the computational costs by bypassing the need for inverting massive covariance matrices. SGPR rank reduction accelerates density functional theory calculations by orders of magnitude, enabling accelerated simulations. An optimal adaptive sampling algorithm is utilized for on-the-fly regression with molecular dynamics, extending to interatomic potentials through scalable SGPR formalism. Through merging quantum mechanics with ML methods, the universal first-principles SGPR-based ML potential can create a digital-twin capable of predicting phenomena arising from static and dynamic changes as well as inherent and collective characteristics of materials. These techniques have been applied successfully to materials such as solid electrolytes, lithium-ion batteries, electrocatalysts, solar cells, and macromolecular systems, reproducing their structures, energetics, dynamics, properties, phase-changes, materials performance, and device efficiency. This review discusses the built-in library universal first-principles SGPR-based ML potential, showcasing its applications and successes, offering insights into the development of future ML potentials and their applications in advanced materials, catering to both educational and expert readers.

Abstract In the present work, we investigates the potential of two dimensional (2D) Janus MoSH monolayer as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting using first-principles calculations. Our results shows that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits excellent structural stability and electronic properties, which are essential for efficient electrocatalysis. We find that the charge transfer mechanism between Mo and S atoms plays a crucial role in the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer. Due to the asymmetric structure of MoSH monolayer, it has intrinsic electric field with dipole moment of 0.24 D. Moreover, we demonstrate that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits high catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential 0.04 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotential 0.11 V, making it a promising candidate for overall water splitting. Our findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of 2D monolayered materials for renewable energy production. By providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of HER and OER on 2D Janus MoSH monolayer, our study paves the way for the development of efficient and sustainable electrocatalysts for water splitting. We hope that current work will be helpful in understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer and its potential applications in renewable energy production.
