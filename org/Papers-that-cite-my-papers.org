Supported nonprecious metal catalysts such as copper (Cu) are promising replacements for Pt-based catalysts for a wide range of energy-related electrochemical reactions. Direct electrochemical deposition is one of the most straightforward and versatile methods to synthesize supported nonprecious metal catalysts. However, further advancement in the design of supported nonprecious metal catalysts requires a detailed mechanistic understanding of the interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics of the deposition phenomena under realistic reaction conditions. Here, we study the electrodeposition of Cu on carbon nanotubes and graphene derivatives under electrochemical conditions using

We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of the atomic positions scheme.

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have aroused extensive attention in the field of catalysis. However, due to the integration of multiple active sites in HEA, it exhibits excessive adsorption behavior resulting in difficult desorption of active species from the catalyst surfaces, which hinders the catalytic efficiency. Therefore, adjusting the adsorption strength of the active site in HEA to enhance the catalytic activity is of great importance. By introducing rare-earth (RE) elements into the high-entropy alloy, the delocalization of 4f electrons can be achieved through the interaction between the multimetal active site and RE, which benefits to regulate the adsorption strength of the HEA surface. Herein, the RE Ce-modified hexagonal-close-packed PtRuFeCoNiZn-Ce/C HEAs are synthesized and showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with ultralow overpotentials of 4, 7 and 156, 132 mV, respectively, to reach 10 mA cm

High-throughput computational materials discovery has promised significant acceleration of the design and discovery of new materials for many years. Despite a surge in interest and activity, the constraints imposed by large-scale computational resources present a significant bottleneck. Furthermore, examples of very large-scale computational discovery carried out through experimental validation remain scarce, especially for materials with product applicability. Here, we demonstrate how this vision became reality by combining state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models and traditional physics-based models on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) resources to quickly navigate through more than 32 million candidates and predict around half a million potentially stable materials. By focusing on solid-state electrolytes for battery applications, our discovery pipeline further identified 18 promising candidates with new compositions and rediscovered a decade's worth of collective knowledge in the field as a byproduct. We then synthesized and experimentally characterized the structures and conductivities of our top candidates, the Na

Here, we investigated the adsorption of acetylene and ethylene on iron clusters and nanoparticles, which is a crucial aspect in the nascent phase of carbon nanotube growth by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD). The effect of sulfur on adsorption was also studied due to its indispensable role in the process and its commonly known impact on metal catalyst poisoning. We performed systematic density functional theory (DFT) computations, considering numerous adsorption configurations and iron particles of various sizes (Fe

Monolayer protected metal clusters comprise a rich class of molecular systems and are promising candidate materials for a variety of applications. While a growing number of protected nanoclusters have been synthesized and characterized in crystalline forms, their dynamical behavior in solution, including prenucleation cluster formation, is not well understood due to limitations both in characterization and first-principles modeling techniques. Recent advancements in machine-learned interatomic potentials are rapidly enabling the study of complex interactions such as dynamical behavior and reactivity on the nanoscale. Here, we develop an Au-S-C-H atomic cluster expansion (ACE) interatomic potential for efficient and accurate molecular dynamics simulations of thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters (Au

The mesoscale organization of molecules into membraneless biomolecular condensates is emerging as a key mechanism of rapid spatiotemporal control in cells. Principles of biomolecular condensation have been revealed through reconstitution. However, intracellular environments are much more complex than test-tube environments: they are viscoelastic, highly crowded at the mesoscale, and are far from thermodynamic equilibrium due to the constant action of energy-consuming processes. We developed synDrops, a synthetic phase separation system, to study how the cellular environment affects condensate formation. Three key features enable physical analysis: synDrops are inducible, bioorthogonal, and have well-defined geometry. This design allows kinetic analysis of synDrop assembly and facilitates computational simulation of the process. We compared experiments and simulations to determine that macromolecular crowding promotes condensate nucleation but inhibits droplet growth through coalescence. ATP-dependent cellular activities help overcome the frustration of growth. In particular, stirring of the cytoplasm by actomyosin dynamics is the dominant mechanism that potentiates droplet growth in the mammalian cytoplasm by reducing confinement and elasticity. Our results demonstrate that mesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the combined effects of crowding and active matter in the cytoplasm. These results move toward a better predictive understanding of condensate formation . Published by the American Physical Society 2024

Abstract Designing efficient, durable, and cheap bifunctional electrocatalysts is a challenging goal in water splitting. Herein, trivanadium‐substituted Keggin‐type polyoxometalate H 6 PV 3 Mo 9 O 40 (POM) and Fe 0.2 Ni 0.8 Co 2 O 4 (FNCO) are in situ grown onto nickel foam (NF) yielding a self‐supporting nanoflower‐like heterojunction via convenient hydrothermal reaction. The POM‐Fe 0.2 Ni 0.8 Co 2 O 4 /NF as HER and OER electrocatalyst, displays low overpotential (89 and 259 mV) and high electrode stability at 10 mA cm −2 . POM‐FNCO/NF as the cathode and anode requires a lower voltage (1.58 V) to provide 10 mA cm −2 for overall water splitting (OWS), which is better than that of commercial catalysts. The electronic sponge characteristics of POM provide more active sites and fast reaction kinetics for HER and OER. The synergy of POM and FNCO optimizes the electron distribution at the interface and enhances the intrinsic activity of HER/OER. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that water molecules preferentially bind to Co sites on POM‐FNCO. Additionally, POM has proton‐coupled electron transfer properties and its modified FNCO exhibits thermodynamic advantages. The synergistic effect of these two factors enables the efficient overall water splitting of POM‐FNCO. This study offers a novel pathway for the construction of self‐supporting efficient catalysts by in situ growth of POM nanoclusters and spinel oxide sub‐nanometer heterojunctions on NF.

The surface roughness of metal nanoparticles is known to be influential toward their properties, but the quantification of surface roughness is challenging. Given the recent availability of large‐scale simulated data and tools for the computation of the box‐counting dimension of simulated atomistic objects, researchers are now enabled to study the connections between the surface roughness of metal nanoparticles and their properties. Herein, the relationships between the fractal box‐counting dimension of metal nanoparticle surfaces and structural features relevant to experimental and computational studies are investigated, providing actionable insights for the manufacturing of rough nanoparticles. This approach differs from conventional concepts of roughness, but introduces a possible indicator for their functionalities such as catalytic performance that was not previously accessible. It is found that, while it remains difficult to consistently correlate the dimension with the catalytic activity of surface facets, matching trends with their surface energy, thermodynamic stability, and number of bond vacancy are observed. This highlights the potential of fractal box‐counting dimensions to rationalize catalytic activity trends among metal nanoparticles, and opens up opportunities for the design of nanocatalysts with better performance via surface engineering.

Transition metal (TM) single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this work, n–p codoping engineering is introduced to account for the modulation of photocatalytic CO2 reduction on a two-dimensional (2D) bismuth-oxyhalide-based cathode by using first-principles calculation. n–p codoping is established via the Coulomb interactions between the negatively charged TM SACs and the positively charged Cl vacancy (VCl) in the dopant–defect pairs. Based on the formation energy of charged defects, neutral dopant–defect pairs for the Fe, Co, and Ni SACs (PTM0) and the −1e charge state of the Cu SAC-based pair (PCu−1) are stable. The electrostatic attraction of the n–p codoping strengthens the stability and solubility of TM SACs by neutralizing the oppositely charged VCl defect and TM dopant. The n–p codoping stabilizes the electron accumulation around the TM SACs. Accumulated electrons modify the d-orbital alignment and shift the d-band center toward the Fermi level, enhancing the reducing capacity of TM SACs based on the d-band theory. Besides the electrostatic attraction of the n–p codoping, the PCu−1 also accumulates additional electrons surrounding Cu SACs and forms a half-occupied dx2−y2 state, which further upshifts the d-band center and improves photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The metastability of Cl multivacancies limits the concentration of the n–p pairs with Cl multivacancies (PTM@nCl (n > 1)). Positively charged centers around the PTM@nCl (n > 1) hinders the CO2 reduction by shielding the charge transfer to the CO2 molecule.

Abstract Developing efficient catalysts for syngas-based higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) remains a formidable research challenge. The chain growth and CO insertion requirements demand multicomponent materials, whose complex reaction dynamics and extensive chemical space defy catalyst design norms. We present an alternative strategy by integrating active learning into experimental workflows, exemplified via the FeCoCuZr catalyst family. Our data-aided framework streamlines navigation of the extensive composition and reaction condition space in 86 experiments, offering >90% reduction in environmental footprint and costs over traditional programs. It identifies the Fe 65 Co 19 Cu 5 Zr 11 catalyst with optimized reaction conditions to attain higher alcohol productivities of 1.1 g HA h −1 g cat −1 under stable operation for 150 h on stream, a 5-fold improvement over typically reported yields. Characterization reveals catalytic properties linked to superior activities despite moderate higher alcohol selectivities. To better reflect catalyst demands, we devise multi-objective optimization to maximize higher alcohol productivity while minimizing undesired CO 2 and CH 4 selectivities. An intrinsic trade-off between these metrics is uncovered, identifying Pareto-optimal catalysts not readily discernible by human experts. Finally, based on feature-importance analysis, we formulate data-informed guidelines to develop performance-specific FeCoCuZr systems. This approach goes beyond existing HAS catalyst design strategies, is adaptable to broader catalytic transformations, and fosters laboratory sustainability.

Heterogeneous electrocatalysis lies at the center of various technologies that could help enable a sustainable future. However, its complexity makes it challenging to accurately and efficiently model at an atomic level. Here, we review emerging atomistic methods to simulate the electrocatalytic interface with special attention devoted to the components/effects that have been challenging to model, such as solvation, electrolyte ions, electrode potential, reaction kinetics, and pH. Additionally, we review relevant computational spectroscopy methods. Then, we showcase several examples of applying these methods to understand and design catalysts relevant to green hydrogen. We also offer experimental views on how to bridge the gap between theory and experiments. Finally, we provide some perspectives on opportunities to advance the field.

MiMiC is a framework for performing multiscale simulations in which loosely coupled external programs describe individual subsystems at different resolutions and levels of theory. To make it highly efficient and flexible, we adopt an interoperable approach based on a multiple-program multiple-data (MPMD) paradigm, serving as an intermediary responsible for fast data exchange and interactions between the subsystems. The main goal of MiMiC is to avoid interfering with the underlying parallelization of the external programs, including the operability on hybrid architectures (e.g., CPU/GPU), and keep their setup and execution as close as possible to the original. At the moment, MiMiC offers an efficient implementation of electrostatic embedding quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) that has demonstrated unprecedented parallel scaling in simulations of large biomolecules using CPMD and GROMACS as QM and MM engines, respectively. However, as it is designed for high flexibility with general multiscale models in mind, it can be straightforwardly extended beyond QM/MM. In this article, we illustrate the software design and the features of the framework, which make it a compelling choice for multiscale simulations in the upcoming era of exascale high-performance computing.

Abstract In the last few years, organic corrosion inhibitors have been used as a green alternative to toxic inorganic compounds to prevent corrosion in materials. Nonetheless, the fundamental mechanisms determining their inhibition performance are still far from understood. Molecular modeling can provide important insights into those mechanisms, allowing for a detailed analysis of the corrosion inhibition (CI) process. However, CI modeling is frequently underexplored and commonly used in a standardized way following a pre-determined recipe to support experimental data. We highlight six fundamental aspects (A) that one should consider when modeling CI: (A1) the electronic properties of isolated inhibitors, (A2) the interaction of the inhibitor with the surface, (A3) the surface model, (A4) the effect of the anodic and cathodic zones on the surface, (A5) the solvent effects, and (A6) the electrodes’ potential effects. While A1-A3 are more frequently investigated, A4-A6 and some more complex surface models from A3 are usually not considered and represent gaps in the CI modeling literature. In this review, we discuss the main features of molecular modeling applied to CI, considering the aforementioned key aspects and focusing on the gaps that the emerging approaches aim to fill. Filling these gaps will allow performing more detailed simulations of the CI process, which, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) methods and multiscale approaches, might construct the bridge between the nanoscale CI modeling and the continuum scale of the CI processes.

Abstract Nanoporous gold (npAu) attracted increasing attention over the last 20 years as a highly active and selective oxidation catalyst in particular at low temperatures. Previous research mainly focused on npAu that was fabricated by corrosive dealloying of AuAg parent alloys. Yet, the use of other binary alloys, such as AuCu, promises interesting variations of the catalytic properties, when considering that residual amounts of the less noble metal were shown to be co‐catalytically involved. Aiming at providing a platform for systematic studies in this direction for Cu, we not only dealt with strategies for a reliable and reproducible preparation of npAu(Cu) catalysts from AuCu, but also with their potential for CO oxidation in comparison to npAu(Ag). We were able to develop an approach based on thermally quenched Au 0.3 Cu 0.7 alloys, providing distinct synthetic advantages as a starting material for the catalyst fabrication versus the thermodynamically more stable AuCu 3 intermetallic compound. Using PCD (potentiostatically controlled dealloying), well‐defined pore structures with ligament diameters of ∼40 nm and variable residual Cu concentrations in the range between ∼0.6 at % and ∼1.2 at % could be straightforwardly obtained. After activating such catalysts at 150 °C, they reproducibly showed catalytic activity for aerobic CO oxidation in a broad temperature window between 40 °C and 250 °C. As opposed to npAu(Ag), the activity increased with decreasing residual Cu content, outperforming the former at temperatures above ∼60 °C not only with respect to CO 2 formation rates but also with respect to thermal stability. Based on X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopic and transmission electron microscopic results, it was possible to conclude that Cu segregates to the surface and, with rising Cu bulk content, increasingly occurs in form of Cu 2+ species at the surface. While the latter are expected to be catalytically inactive, Cu and Cu + species are likely candidates for the activation of oxygen being not possible on pure Au.

Estimating the potential energy of a molecular system at a quantum level of theory is a task of paramount importance in computational chemistry. The often employed density functional theory approach allows one to accomplish this task, yet most often at significant computational costs. This prompted the community to develop so-called machine learning potentials to achieve near-quantum accuracy at molecular mechanics computational cost. In this paper, we introduce OBIWAN, a feed-forward neural network that bears some relevant structural properties that also led to the definition of a new kind of general-purpose neural network layer. Its featurization process scales efficiently with newly added atomic species. This allows one to seamlessly add new atom types without requiring to change the topology of the network. Also, this allows one to train on new data sets leveraging a previously trained OBIWAN, hence converging very quickly. This avoids training from scratch and renders the approach more compliant with a green computing perspective.
