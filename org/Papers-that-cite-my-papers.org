Surface formation markedly influences the stability and properties of nanoalloys. The surface states of nanoalloys are sensitive to the constituent elements and to the surrounding environment. In this study, Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and an evolution strategy (ES) combined with density functional theory calculations and multivariate analysis were used to explore the stable configuration of NO-adsorbed PdRu nanoalloys. FT-IR analysis indicated that the NO molecules were adsorbed on the Ru-related sites, which was inconsistent with the stable surface state of the isolated PdRu nanoalloy models. The ES revealed that the stable surface state consisted mainly of Ru atoms owing to molecular adsorption. In addition, the Pd–Ru mixing was facilitated by the adsorption. According to the multivariate analysis, the adsorption energies on the Ru-related sites were more negative than those on the Pd-related sites and became more negative as the number of neighboring Pd atoms increased. These adsorption characteristics are opposite to those of the stability of the isolated PdRu nanoalloys. The energy gain owing to NO adsorption overcomes the energy loss due to the Pd–Ru bonds and placement of Ru atoms at the surface. This study highlights the importance of understanding stable surface states in a reactive atmosphere for the application of nanoalloys.

Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)‐based catalysts have garnered significant interest as efficient materials for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) due to their abundant availability, low cost, tunable electronic structures, and unique light absorption performance. This review offers a thorough examination of the latest developments in CoPc‐based catalysts for HER. It entails a wide range of synthesis approaches, intrinsic characteristics, and catalytic mechanisms associated with these catalysts for HER. We also compare the photo/electrocatalytic performance of these catalysts using parameters like Tafel slope, exchange current density, overpotential, hydrogen yield, turnover frequency, stability, specific surface area, etc. The review shows that the commonly used electrolytes for electrocatalytic HER are KOH, LiClO 4 /PBS, and H 2 SO 4 , while for photocatalytic HER, triethylamine, water, and triethanolamine are frequently used. Among all the electrocatalysts understudied, poly[CoOTPc]‐KB and GO/4N‐CoPc are the best, owing to their lowest overpotentials and Tafel slopes. In terms of photocatalytic hydrogen production, CoPc/TiO 2 /Pt has better photocatalytic HER performance compared to its counterparts. This review also highlights the effects of incorporating CoPc with different materials on the photo/electrocatalytic HER performance. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges and prospects, emphasizing the chances for improving and incorporating CoPc‐based catalysts as a viable option for hydrogen production in the future.

Our study presents significant advancements in the handling of multimodal data through an extended Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. By integrating advanced embedding techniques, efficient retrieval mechanisms, and robust generative capabilities, our model demonstrates notable improvements in retrieval accuracy, real-time efficiency, generative quality, and scalability. The retrieval accuracy of our model reached 85%, showing a 10% improvement over existing benchmarks. Furthermore, the retrieval time was reduced by 40%, enhancing real-time application performance. The model's generative quality was also significantly improved, with BLEU and ROUGE scores increasing by 15% and 12%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and its applicability to various AI applications, including information retrieval, recommendation systems, and content creation. Future research directions include the integration of additional modalities and further optimization of retrieval mechanisms to broaden the applicability of our model.

Deployment of post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technologies is needed to reduce emissions from power and industrial sources. Comparisons between existing thermochemical CO2 capture methods and emerging electrochemical concepts can help contextualize the promise of these new approaches. Here, we investigate the required absorber sizes for three capture systems: amine scrubbing using monoethanolamine (MEA), direct electrochemical (redox-active sorbent), and indirect electrochemical (pH-swing). For the electrochemical systems, we study how column size varies as a function of molecular properties and operating conditions, finding that parameters most closely related to CO2 uptake rates (i.e., rate constants and pKa) have the greatest impact. Through a Monte Carlo analysis, we find that the direct process can be designed to have column sizes similar to the thermochemical process, however, the CO2 uptake rate in the indirect process is too slow to enable smaller columns. Broadly, this work connects system input parameters to absorber performance for electrochemical CO2 capture and provides a foundation for technoeconomic and engineering analyses.

As demand for more efficient processes keeps rising and more restrictive environmental legislation requires higher levels of both yield and purity, the process industry has now, more than ever, been looking for new ways to achieve these goals. One approach has been the implementation of Process Intensification (PI). PI aims to combine multiple unit operations into a single one, promoting efficiency gains on multiple levels. This combination, however, leads to complex process dynamics, and controlling such processes, particularly when setup as multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, presents a great challenge due to highly interactive complex process dynamics and the imposition of many operating constraints. The objectives of this research are to generate first-principles and data-driven water-gas shift membrane reactor (WGS-MR) models and to create predictive control schemes to perform effective setpoint tracking under a MIMO framework. The AVEVA Process Simulation platform is chosen for simulating the first-principles model and both Gaussian Processes using a Squared Exponential kernel (GP-SE) and Bayesian Smoothing Spline Analysis of Variance (BSS-ANOVA) are explored as possible frameworks for data-driven models. A Proportional–Integral– Derivative (PID) controller is created as a benchmark and a Quadratic Dynamic Matrix Controller (QDMC) is developed for advanced control of the system. The GP model is later used as a digital twin of the plant for calculating a control action trajectory that could be applied to the physical system in case of a desired setpoint change. The results demonstrate the superiority of the BSS-ANOVA model over the GP-SE, especially under open-loop simulation conditions. Also, both PID and QDMC perform well under the tested conditions, but the QDMC is able to deliver smoother control action, specially under noisy signals. Finally, when operating under closed-loop control, the BSS-ANOVA model is capable of providing a good representation of one of the variables being studied, namely carbon capture, with Integral of the Absolute Error (IAE) values ranging from 0.39 to 12.6, while creating a fit for the other variable, namely hydrogen recovery, with IAE measurements ranging from 3.71 to 26.7. These results indicate that the proposed framework is viable, although not universal, as each variable desired to be modeled and controlled should be tested and have its viability carefully assessed.

Anion-exchange membranes (AEMs), known for enabling the high conductivity of hydroxide anions through dense polymeric structures, are pivotal components in fuel cells, electrolyzers, and other important electrochemical systems. This paper unveils an unprecedented utilization of AEMs in an electrochemical oxygen separation process, a new technology able to generate enriched oxygen from an O2/N2 mixture using a small voltage input. We demonstrate a first-of-its-kind AEM-based electrochemical device that operates under mild conditions, is free of liquid electrolytes or sweep gases, and produces oxygen of over 96% purity. Additionally, we develop and apply a one-dimensional time-dependent and isothermal model, which accurately captures the unique operational dynamics of our device, demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data, and allows us to explore the device's potential capabilities. This novel technology has far-reaching applications in many industrial processes, medical oxygen therapy, and other diverse fields while reducing operational complexity and environmental impact, thereby paving the way for sustainable on-site oxygen generation.
