Accurately evaluating configurational integrals for dense solids remains a central and difficult challenge in the statistical mechanics of condensed systems. Here, we present a tensor network approach that reformulates the high-dimensional configurational integral for identical-particle crystals into a sequence of computationally efficient summations. We represent the integrand as a high-dimensional tensor and apply tensor-train (TT) decomposition together with a custom TT-cross interpolation. This approach circumvents the need to explicitly construct the full tensor. We introduce tailored rank-1 and rank-2 schemes optimized for sharply peaked Boltzmann probability densities, typical for identical-particle crystals. When applied to the calculation of internal energy and pressure-temperature curves for crystalline Cu and Ar at high (GPa) pressures, as well as the alpha-to-beta phase transition diagram of Sn, our method accurately reproduces molecular dynamics simulation results using tight-binding, machine learning, hierarchical interacting particle–neural network, and modified embedded atom method potentials,all within seconds of computation time.

Single-atom catalysts has emerged as a groundbreaking concept in catalysis, where individual metal atoms are anchored on supports such as carbon-based materials, oxides, or nitrides, serving as isolated active sites for catalytic reactions. In the present study, we theoretically explore the geometries, bonding properties, electronic structures, and potential catalytic performances of the recently synthesized one-dimensional (1D) M-porphyrin chains, in which the M–N4–C motif acts as the active site for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Three configurations of 1D M-porphyrin chains (M = Ni, Zn) were investigated, including (a) M-porphyrin ribbon, (b) butadiyne-linked M-porphyrin, and (c) M-porphyrin-fused graphene nanoribbons. The calculation results reveal that all those 1D M-porphyrin chains are semiconductors. Energy decomposition analysis combined with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) shows that the metal–ligand interaction in Ni-porphyrin is stronger than that in Zn-porphyrin. Compared to Zn-porphyrin chains, Ni-porphyrin chains exhibit stronger adsorption and superior electron transfer capabilities, which is attributed to enhanced orbital hybridization between the Ni 3d atomic orbitals and adsorbed oxygen 2p orbitals. The catalytic reaction pathways of these chains are similar for all those SACs and depend slightly on linker types, highlighting the importance of the local environment of the M–N4–C coordination framework. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of SACs with tailored properties, offering significant potential for applications in energy conversion and environmental catalysis.

We investigate the transferability of machine learning interatomic potentials across concentration variations in chemically similar systems, using aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions as a case study. Despite containing identical chemical species (K+, OH−, and H2O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from 30 meV Å−1 (at training concentration) to 90 meV Å−1 (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol l−1) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56–17.89 mol l−1), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide–hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations—a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.

In recent years, artificial intelligence has gained significant traction in Earth sciences, driving a shift from qualitative approaches to quantitative, data-driven methodologies. In geomorphology, artificial intelligence techniques are now applied at multiple scales and for diverse purposes, leveraging a wide spectrum of methods including supervised and unsupervised machine learning, regression algorithms, classification models, clustering techniques, neural networks, and dimensionality reduction. This study presents a structured bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature indexed in Scopus, analyzing over 2000 articles published between 1990 and 2024. Through a bibliometric approach, we explore temporal trends, the most commonly used artificial intelligence techniques, thematic domains, geographic patterns, and associated keywords. Results reveal the pervasive use of artificial intelligence in key geomorphological areas, particularly in fluvial, coastal, and erosional contexts, alongside the adoption of a rich variety of algorithms. The study also highlights the wide range of AI techniques applied in geomorphological research, spanning from traditional machine learning models to advanced neural architectures. This review provides a critical overview of the current landscape and outlines future directions to support more transparent, equitable, and integrated adoption of artificial intelligence in geomorphological research. The findings of this study are relevant to a wide range of stakeholders. Researchers and Ph.D. candidates can use the results to identify dominant thematic and methodological trajectories and detect underexplored areas. Data scientists and AI specialists may benefit from the mapped applications to implement advanced techniques in geomorphological contexts. The analysis also offers useful insights for funding agencies aiming to support strategic and equitable research development, particularly in underrepresented regions. Finally, journal editors and publishers may use emerging trends to inform the design of thematic issues and research priorities.

Abstract Low‐loading iridium (Ir) catalysts hold great promise for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their typically high Ir utilization and reduced cost. However, their practical application is limited by poor stability under the harsh acidic oxidative conditions of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Here, a controlled structural transformation strategy is presented that converts an unstable LiCoO 2 ‐supported Ir single‐atom catalyst (Ir‐LiCoO 2 ) into a corrosion‐resistant Co 3 O 4 ‐supported IrO x nanocluster catalyst (IrO x /Co 3 O 4 ), significantly enhancing catalyst durability. Strong catalyst‐support interactions between IrO x and Co 3 O 4 facilitate charge transfer, thereby stabilizing the IrO x nanoclusters against leaching and optimizing the electronic structure of the Ir active sites. As a result, IrO x /Co 3 O 4 exhibits substantially enhanced OER performance compared to Ir‐LiCoO 2 , achieving excellent operational stability over 1200 h and a low overpotential of ≈233 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 . This superior performance is further validated in PEM electrolyzers, confirming its practical applicability. Furthermore, theoretical calculations reveal that Ir sites in IrO x /Co 3 O 4 exhibit higher dissolution potentials and improve charge transfer capabilities with OER intermediates compare to those in Ir‐LiCoO 2 and IrO 2 , which effectively suppresses Ir leaching and lowers the energy barrier of the potential‐determining step.

Despite the multiple advantages of high tissue penetration depth, selectivity, and noninvasiveness of photothermal-assisted antitumor synergistic therapy, developing photothermal agents with multifunctional characteristics, desirable tumor therapeutic effects, and biological stability remains a key challenge. Herein, an electronic structure-regulated strategy is proposed to activate self-adaptive Sn–Fe electron pair centers (Sn2+/Sn4+ and Fe2+/Fe3+) through loading the electron donor Pt (Pt/SFO-1, -2, -3, -4). Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that abundant dynamic active centers can facilitate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which enables Pt/SFO samples to possess catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and oxidase (OXD) enzyme-like activities. Upon near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, Pt/SFO-2 with a Pt load of 0.9% achieves the highest ROS production, showing a 9-fold compared with SnFe2O4 and implements the synergistic therapy of photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). The electronic state regulation of inorganic photothermal agents not only improves tumor therapeutic effects but also offers a novel strategy to regulate the electron structure of active centers.

Until recently, the conversation about generative artificial intelligence in science revolved around the textual prowess of large language models such as GPT-3.5 and the promise that they might one day draft a decent literature review. Since then, progress has been nothing short of breathtaking. We now find ourselves in the era of multimodal, agentic systems that listen, see, speak and act, orchestrating cloud software and physical laboratory hardware with a fluency that would have sounded speculative in early 2023. In this review, I merge the substance of our 2024 white paper for the World Economic Forum Top-10-Technologies Report with the latest advances through mid-2025, charting a course from automated literature synthesis and hypothesis generation to self-driving laboratories, organoid intelligence and climate-scale forecasting. The discussion is grounded in emerging governance regimes—notably the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO 42001—and is written from the dual vantage-point of a toxicologist who has spent a career championing robust, humane science and of a field chief editor charged with safeguarding scholarly standards in Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence . I argue that research is entering a “co-pilot to lab-pilot” transition in which AI no longer merely interprets knowledge but increasingly acts upon it . This shift promises dramatic efficiency gains yet simultaneously amplifies concerns about reproducibility, auditability, safety and equitable access.

Abstract The hydrogenation of benzene is a key reaction in industry, and binary alloys are promising candidates for improving the catalytic efficiency of this process. In this study, the adsorption energies of benzene and hydrogen over random 150 alloys are determined using density functional theory (DFT) calculation, and varied physical properties of alloys are used as descriptors. Four machine learning (ML) models, light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBT), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) are employed to predict the adsorption energies. After feature selection and parameter optimization, LGBM model shows the highest prediction accuracy, with correlation coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.813 and 0.415 eV for benzene, as well as 0.874 and 0.176 eV for hydrogen. Therefore, LGBM model is selected to predict the adsorption energies of benzene and hydrogen (ΔEB and ΔEH), and Cu2Ni2 has excellent ΔEB and ΔEH of -4.97 and − 1.81 eV.

Abstract Design and preparation of freestanding bifunctional ordered structural catalysts with superior activity, low cost, and good reversibility, are crucial for commercial water‐splitting applications. In this study, a durable and effective NiS 2 /ReS 2 (NRS) electrocatalyst is successfully fabricated using various quantities of Re source on carbon cloth (CC) by a facile solvothermal method. Upon changing the quantities of the Re source, the catalyst dimensions and shape undergo substantial changes, enabling the control of the catalytic activity of NRS. In particular, the optimal NRS‐50@CC displays remarkable catalytic performance for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, revealing small overpotentials of 244 mV at 20 mA cm −2 and 108 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , respectively, as well as notable stability. Moreover, the NRS‐50@CC (+, −) cell device requires a voltage of ≈1.56 V at 10 mA cm −2 . This paper proposes a novel approach for the construction of durable bifunctional electrocatalysts using exceptionally active layered metal chalcogenide materials.

Abstract The photocatalytic synthesis of urea from CO 2 and N 2 co‐reduction presents a promising alternative to the conventional energy‐intensive Haber–Bosch process. However, competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface often limits selectivity and yield. Here, we designed hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) spheres, which serve as a high surface area scaffold for precise anchoring of Fe─Cu diatomic sites. Hollow architecture enhances light harvesting via inner‐scattering effects and charge separation. Each Fe─Cu site is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms, forming N 2 ─Fe 1 ─Cu 1 ─N 2 /C 3 N 4 DAC (hereafter referred to as FeCu/CN), which enables cooperative activation of CO 2 and N 2 , in contrast to monodispersed diatomic (Fe+Cu/CN), and single‐atom catalysts (Fe/CN, Cu/CN). The FeCu/CN bonded pairs serve as highly efficient active centers, facilitating the synergistic adsorption and activation of multiple reactants. Specifically, during the co‐reduction of CO 2 and N 2 , the Fe 1 site preferentially adsorbs and activates CO 2 , while bonded Cu 1 sites stabilize N 2 on FeCu/CN and enable synergistic C─N coupling through the formation of *NCON intermediates. As a result, the FeCu/CN achieves an exceptional urea yield of 7.40 mg·g cat −1 ·h −1 with a 38.58% selectivity under visible light irradiation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atomic‐level coordination in multireactants and offer insights into the C─N coupling for value‐added products using CO 2 and N 2 as feedstock.

During the recent decade, the search for catalytically active cathodes of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells and secondary metal–air batteries has been one of the priority directions of electrochemical energy applications. Existing highly efficient electrocatalysts based on very expensive and rare platinum (Pt) and Pt group elements need replacement with affordable and scalable electrode materials. In this article, we review the recent trends and progress in the research of ORR catalysts alternative to Pt group elements, namely, silver (Ag)‐based nanostructured cathodes. The following main research directions are presented: (1) the O 2 electroreduction mechanism; (2) nanostructured and nanoporous Ag surfaces; (3) Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) anchored to a carbon substrate; (4) Ag nanostructures deposited onto M x O y − carbon nanocomposites; (5) bimetallic Ag–M nanostructures. The first direction encompasses the analysis of literature data on ORR on Ag surface, which is stable in alkaline electrolytes and provides a four‐electron (4e) pathway for the ORR. In the second direction, we demonstrate the dependence of electroreduction efficiency on the size and shape of AgNPs and their nanoscale porosity. The third direction is based on the enhancement of catalytic activity via designing of fine and ultrafine AgNPs attached to highly porous carbon support nanomaterials such as carbon black, mesoporous carbon (MC), reduced graphene oxide, nitrogen‐doped graphene, multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). The fourth direction, hybrid AgNPs–M x O y /carbon nanocomposites, is one of the most promising for ORR applications. The catalytic activity of these nanocomposites is based on the synergy of the AgNPs–M x O y couple, and the nanoscale porosity of carbon materials ensures mass transport of dissolved oxygen to the electrode surface. We describe the characteristic features of electrochemical oxygen reduction for the systems of AgNPs with nanoparticles of MnO 2 , ZrO 2 , WO 3 , Fe 3 O 4 and Co 3 O 4 , which can tune Ag surface states. The fifth separate research direction is the use of bimetallic Ag–M nanostructures for electrocatalytic ORR. The most studied systems are binary, including Ag–Pd, Ag–Cu, Ag–Co and Ag–Ni. This review outlines the trends and prospects of future development of the Ag‐based nanostructured catalytically active cathodes for oxygen reduction.

Abstract Dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) display excellent activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The dual‐metal configuration allows for synergistic interactions and tailored adsorption of key intermediates, thereby breaking traditional * OH– * OOH scaling relations and enabling dissociative O 2 activation pathways. Recent studies suggest that the metal–metal (M–M) distance within DACs critically influences their electronic structure and catalytic behavior; however, a deep understanding of M–M distance effects on ORR thermodynamics and kinetics is presently lacking. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling are performed on 108 DACs with varied M–M distances (2.2–3.5 Å). Moderate M–M distances (≈3 Å) are found to weaken * OH binding, lower the * OH– * OOH scaling slope, and promote bridging O 2 adsorption for facile dissociation. The dissociative pathway lowered the effective scaling relation from ≈3.2 to 2.72 eV, approaching the theoretical value of 2.46 eV. Micro‐kinetic simulations identified O 2 activation as the rate‐determining step during ORR, with DACs possessing a M–M distance ≈3 Å exhibiting the highest turnover frequencies, due the effective balancing of active‐site availability and O 2 activation efficiency. These findings highlight the key role of M–M distance in controlling ORR activity, guiding the design of next‐generation DACs with improved efficiency.

Abstract Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered significant interest lately for all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) because of their easy processability and flexibility; however, their low ionic conductivity has to be enhanced by forming composite polymer electrolyte (CPE). Herein, a polyacrylonitrile (PAN)‐based triple‐composite solid polymer electrolyte with black phosphorus nanosheets (BPN) and SiO 2 nanoparticles (SO) is reported, which synergistically utilizes the efficient directed Li+ pathways (via BP) while reducing PAN crystallization (by SiO 2 ) and enhancing the dissociation of Li salts. Thus, an impressive ionic conductivity of 4.41 × 10 −4 S cm −1 is realised in PAN‐BPN‐SO‐LiClO4 CPE, which is 65 times higher than that of PAN‐LiClO 4 (6.8 × 10 −6 S cm −1 ). A wider electrochemical stability window (up to 4.68 V vs Li/Li + ) is also realized, enabling compatibility with high‐voltage cathodes. The BPN‐SO CPE exhibited good discharge capacities 146 mAh g −1 at 0.1C and 108 mAh g −1 at 1C rate, with 75% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The graphite/LiFePO 4 full‐cell with PAN‐BPN‐SO‐LIClO4 CPE showed a room‐temperature discharge capacity of 87 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C, which is significantly enhanced to 152 mAh g −1 at 40 °C. A CPE‐based pouch cell (12 cm 2 , 111.29 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C) performed well in folding, puncturing, and cutting performance tests. A computational modelling study is performed to elucidate the mechanism.

Abstract The photocatalytic synthesis of urea from CO 2 and N 2 co‐reduction presents a promising alternative to the conventional energy‐intensive Haber–Bosch process. However, competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface often limits selectivity and yield. Here, we designed hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) spheres, which serve as a high surface area scaffold for precise anchoring of Fe─Cu diatomic sites. Hollow architecture enhances light harvesting via inner‐scattering effects and charge separation. Each Fe─Cu site is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms, forming N 2 ─Fe 1 ─Cu 1 ─N 2 /C 3 N 4 DAC (hereafter referred to as FeCu/CN), which enables cooperative activation of CO 2 and N 2 , in contrast to monodispersed diatomic (Fe+Cu/CN), and single‐atom catalysts (Fe/CN, Cu/CN). The FeCu/CN bonded pairs serve as highly efficient active centers, facilitating the synergistic adsorption and activation of multiple reactants. Specifically, during the co‐reduction of CO 2 and N 2 , the Fe 1 site preferentially adsorbs and activates CO 2 , while bonded Cu 1 sites stabilize N 2 on FeCu/CN and enable synergistic C─N coupling through the formation of *NCON intermediates. As a result, the FeCu/CN achieves an exceptional urea yield of 7.40 mg·g cat −1 ·h −1 with a 38.58% selectivity under visible light irradiation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atomic‐level coordination in multireactants and offer insights into the C─N coupling for value‐added products using CO 2 and N 2 as feedstock.

Abstract This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the carbon capture and storage value chain, focusing on cost optimization strategies and frameworks for successful development. Through systematic evaluation of capture-transport-storage components, we identify critical cost drivers and demonstrate methodologies for economic optimization in early-stage project development. Carbon capture technologies constitute the primary cost component, accounting for 60-80% of total chain (IEA 2024), with post-combustion systems exhibiting energy penalties of 25-35% compared to 15-20% for advanced solvents (Environmental Science & Technology 2024). Transportation costs range from 0.25-55.82 euros per tonne depending on distance and flowrate, while storage costs demonstrate significant variability based on geological conditions and monitoring requirements (MDPI 2024). Cost optimization analysis confirms that cluster and hub models achieve 30-40% cost reductions compared to standalone facilities when maintaining utilization rates above 80% (World Economic Forum 2025). The Northern Lights and Porthos projects early implementation results provide encouraging indicators of successful multi-stakeholder collaboration approaches (Equinor. 2024; Port of Rotterdam. 2024). Digital cost estimation methodologies enable progressive accuracy improvement until final investment decision, supporting systematic project optimization throughout development phases.
