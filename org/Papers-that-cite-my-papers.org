The structural and dynamic properties of two polymorphs of the metal–organic framework UMCM-9 (UMCM-9-α and -β) have been studied via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in conjunction with density functional tight binding (DFTB) as well as the newly developed MACE–MP neural network potential (NNP). Based on these calculations, a novel UMCM-9-β polymorph is proposed that exhibits reduced linker strain and increased flexibility compared to UMCM-9-α, which is shown to be energetically less stable. UMCM-9-β exhibits enhanced diffusion of molecular hydrogen due to weaker host–guest interactions, whereas UMCM-9-α exhibits stronger interactions, leading to improved hydrogen adsorption. The results suggest that synthesis conditions may control the formation of both polymorphs: UMCM-9-β is likely to be the thermodynamic product, forming under stable conditions, while UMCM-9-α may be the kinetic product, forming under accelerated synthesis conditions. This study highlights the potential for optimizing MOFs for specific gas storage applications to achieve the desired structural and associated gas storage properties.

Cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) nanomaterials exhibit an efficient electrochemical catalytic performance due to their unique properties and electronic structure. The preparation of epitaxial Co9S8 thin films with varying crystal orientations and the study of their catalytic kinetics and mechanisms remain significant gaps. This study addresses the preparation of epitaxial Co9S8 thin films with orientations of (100), (110), and (111) on yttrium-doped zirconia (YSZ) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. Characterization confirmed their single-crystalline nature and consistent thickness. Electrochemical measurements revealed a similar hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance across all films but significant differences in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The (111) orientation showed the best OER activity, with a current density of 24.2 mA cm-2 at 1.8 V vs RHE, outperforming the (100) and (110) orientations, which achieved 14.5 and 6.7 mA cm-2, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the (100) orientation favored the traditional four-electron transfer mechanism, with a lower theoretical overpotential (0.37 V). In contrast, the (110) and (111) orientations demonstrated more complex adsorption behaviors, resulting in a higher overpotential of 0.49 V and a lower overpotential of 0.29 V, respectively. These results highlight the unique reactivity of different Co9S8 crystal orientations and provide valuable insights for optimizing the catalyst design to enhance the OER performance.

Abstract Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to high‐value‐added chemicals represents a promising strategy for effective CO 2 utilization, and rationally regulating the electronic structure of the catalyst is the key to enhancing photocatalytic performance. Herein, it is demonstrated that in situ doping of atomic indium into the lattice of the Cu 2 MoS 4 catalyst results in remarkable enhancements in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance. A record gas product yield of 104.1 µmol·g −1 ·h −1 is achieved under visible light irradiation (>420 nm), accompanied by a generation rate of 35.3 µmol·g −1 ·h −1 for ethylene. Detailed experimental analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the low electronegativity of indium atoms induces asymmetric charge redistribution near the doping sites. This effect facilitates the adsorption and dissociation of CO 2 molecules at the charge‐enriched Mo sites, as well as the subsequent generation of key intermediates ( * COCOH) toward ethylene formation. This work advances understanding of the potential mechanism between the electronic structure of the active site and photocatalytic performance, providing valuable insights into fabricating advanced materials for CO 2 conversion into solar fuels.

The nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method combined with ab initio calculations has been widely used to study charge transport in molecular junctions. However, the significant computational demands of high-resolution calculations for all device components pose challenges in simulating junctions with complex molecular junction structures and understanding the functionality of molecular devices. In this study, we developed a series of computational methods capable of effectively handling the molecular Hamiltonian, electrode electronic structures, and their interfacial coupling at different theoretical levels. As three-tiered hierarchical levels, they enable efficient charge transport computations ranging from individual molecules to complete junction systems, achieving an optimal balance between computational cost and accuracy. Moreover, integrated into a Question-Driven Hierarchical Computation (QDHC) framework, we show this three-tiered framework is able to address specific research objectives by isolating and analyzing the dominant factors governing charge transport, thus significantly enhancing the efficiency of analyzing charge transport mechanisms, as validated through a series of benchmark studies on diverse molecular junction systems.

Carbohydrates, essential biological building blocks, exhibit functional mechanisms tied to their intricate stereochemistry. Subtle stereochemical differences, such as those between the anomers maltose and cellobiose, lead to distinct properties due to their differing glycosidic bonds; the former is digestible by humans, while the latter is not. This underscores the importance of precise structural determination of individual carbohydrate molecules for deeper functional insights. However, their structural complexity and conformational flexibility, combined with the high spatial resolution needed, have hindered direct imaging of carbohydrate stereochemistry. Here, we employ noncontact atomic force microscopy integrated with a data-efficient, multifidelity structure search approach accelerated by machine learning integration to determine the precise 3D atomic coordinates of two carbohydrate anomers on Au(111). We observe that the stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond regulates on-surface chiral selection in carbohydrate self-assemblies. The reconstructed models, validated against experimental data, provide reliable atomic-scale structural evidence, uncovering the origin of the on-surface chirality from carbohydrate anomerism. Our study confirms that nc-AFM is a reliable technique for real-space discrimination of carbohydrate stereochemistry at the single-molecule level, providing a pathway for bottom-up investigations into the structure-property relationships of carbohydrates in biological research and materials science.

The electrochemical reduction of acetonitrile (AN) to ethylamine (EA) is an attractive yet challenging process, primarily due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This study demonstrates the ability to halt the HER at Volmer step, where protons migrate to the unsaturated bond of AN on a self-supported CuO@Cu heterostructure. The CuO@Cu catalyst exhibits nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency (FE) over the entire range of potentials tested from -0.1 to -0.4 V vs. RHE, demonstrating remarkable stability over 1000 h at a constant current density of 0.2 A cm-2. CuO is identified as the active component driving the reaction, while the metallic Cu facilitates efficient electron transfer. Theoretical simulations and experimental evidences indicate that a synergistic hydrogenation process contributes to the AN reduction reaction (ARR), which involves both surface hydrogen migration and proton addition from solution. This study provides an insight into understanding of ARR process, and suggests an efficient strategy to enhance the electrochemical hydrogenation of organic molecules by regulating the Volmer step.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the anodic reaction of many electrochemical devices, plays a crucial role in such energy conversion process. However, the poor OER stability of non-iridium-based materials has tremendously limited the large-scale application of related devices. Here, using a novel home-made operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy, for the first time we report a temperature dependent mechanism transition (TDMT) effect of RhRu3Ox, a non-iridium-based electrocatalyst, in OER process, which makes us realize the important role of temperature in triggering OER mechanism transition, and further enriches our toolbox for manipulating OER kinetics. To evaluate the potential of RhRu3Ox for practical applications, we assembled it as an anode in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, demonstrating its stability at room temperature for over 1000 hours at 200 mA cm-2 compared with the unstable pristine RuO2. Techno-economic analysis shows that the cost of H2 production using solar photovoltaic and onshore wind as power sources is already lower than the global average levelized cost of H2 from coal. Density functional theory studies reveal that the existence of kinetic barrier related to lattice oxygen activation might be the reason for the OER TDMT of RhRu3Ox at elevated temperature.

Platinum (Pt) has been documented as the top-tier fuel cell catalyst, yet it faces a notable challenge regarding its poor CO tolerance and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), particularly when using CO-contaminated blue and gray H 2 . Here, we present an interfacial metal coordination strategy to design a bifunctional platinum-cobalt (PtCo) intermetallic catalyst integrated with a tin-nitrogen-carbon (Sn–N–C) support, which forms Pt–Sn–N bonds that substantially boost both ORR activity and CO tolerance. The PtCo/Sn–N–C-made fuel cell achieves a topmost peak power density of 2.11 watts per square centimeter in 100 parts per million (ppm) of CO-containing H 2 , surpassing all previously reported PEMFCs. In addition, it operates stably at a rated voltage for over 710 hours in 100 ppm of CO/H 2 -air. This work demonstrates the feasibility of fuel cells directly using CO-contaminated gray & blue H 2 , paving the way for PEMFC-driven energy vehicles.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit tremendous advantages in the electrochemical N2 oxidation reaction (EN2OR) to HNO3, which is an eco-friendly alternative to the synthesis of conventional industrial nitric acid and nitrates, but methods to rationally design and rapidly screen high-efficiency EN2OR SACs are unclear. Herein, taking pyridinic nitrogen-doped graphene-supported SACs as an example, a simple descriptor has been proposed to evaluate the EN2OR performance through systematically constructing a surface reaction phase diagram. This descriptor is comprised of merely the geometric information and inherent atomic properties (occupied d electron number, electronegativity, and coordinate number) that can accurately predict the activity and selectivity of EN2OR, independent of DFT simulations. Based on this descriptor, high-throughput screening has been executed on partially N/C/O coordinated SACs, including 160 candidates; 13 candidates with the overpotential of less than 1.0 V are selected and then validated by DFT calculations with a mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 0.09 V, indicating the reliability of the descriptor. Meanwhile, the screened CoO2N2-G and RhO2N2-G SACs exhibit lower EN2OR overpotential of 0.64 and 0.68 V and more negative UL(EN2OR) - UL(OER) values of -0.34 and -0.44 V in comparison to other candidates, respectively, demonstrating the excellent activity and selectivity of EN2OR. This work offers a route to rapid discovery of high-performance SACs for EN2OR.

Nanozymes offer diverse therapeutic potentials for cancer treatment which is dependent on the development of nanomaterials. Quasi-metal-organic framework is a class of metal-organic framework-derived nanomaterials with a transition state from metal-organic frameworks towards metal oxide featuring porous structure and high activity. Herein an iron-based quasi-metal-organic framework nanozyme Q-MIL-53(Fe) is reported via a controlled deligandation strategy, exhibiting enhanced peroxidase-/catalase-mimic activity and glutathione depletion capacity, whose underlying mechanisms are studied via density functional theory calculations. Q-MIL-53(Fe) demonstrates biocompatibility and superior antitumor efficacy compared to pristine MIL-53(Fe). It can activate antitumor immune response by inducing ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death, promoting dendritic cell maturation and T lymphocytes infiltration. Furthermore, a combination of Q-MIL-53(Fe) and programmed cell death protein 1 antibody amplifies cancer immunotherapy. This study validates the antitumor activity of quasi-metal-organic frameworks and its immunotherapy induction potential. It would broaden the application of quasi-metal-organic frameworks and open avenues for developing antitumor nanozymes. Nanozymes offer diverse therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment. In this work, the authors report an iron-based quasi-metal organic framework nanozyme Q-MIL-53(Fe) with enhanced peroxidase and catalase-mimicking activity and glutathione depletion capacity and use it for tumor immunotherapy via inducing ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death.

The nitric oxide electroreduction reaction (NORR) has received considerable attention due to its importance in electrochemical denitrification of nitrogen oxides in groundwater and industrial waste gases and electrochemical ammonia synthesis. However, the detailed mechanism and the factors that affect product selectivity are far less understood. Employing coupled differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and attenuated total reflection-surface-enhanced infrared absorption (ATR-SEIRA) spectroscopy, adsorbed species and volatile solution products, during the adsorption of NO and NORR on Pt in both alkaline and acidic media, have been simultaneously studied, enabling us to correlate the potential-dependent product selectivity with the surface ad-species. NOad,M, NOad,B, NOad,L, and NO2,ad were identified using SEIRA spectroscopy as surface ad-species, with their potential-dependent intensities having a strong correlation with the product selectivity. N2O is the only reduction product at potentials beyond the hydrogen region and is attributed to the reduction of weakly adsorbed NO. In contrast, the formation of NH3 and NH2OH occurs only in the hydrogen region and is ascribed to the reaction between strongly adsorbed NO and adsorbed H. N2 is a minor product, and is formed through further reduction of N2O by adsorbed H. The formation of N2 is significantly suppressed in acidic media due to the fast kinetics of NO reduction to NH3/NH2OH, and thus lowering of NO coverage in the hydrogen region. To achieve the selective reduction of NO to NH3/NH2OH, the potential should remain at 0.1-0.2 V (vs RHE) in both acidic and alkaline media while a slow NO supply, and acidic media are preferred over alkaline media due to the faster kinetics. These new spectroscopic results and insights about the NORR could advance the design of more effective NORR catalysts and help develop optimal conditions for selective ammonia synthesis.

The rational design of heterojunctions by coupling two or more two-dimensional (2D) materials is regarded as a feasible strategy to efficiently enhance photocatalytic-hydrogen performance by capturing solar energy to address the increasing global energy crisis. In this work, a functional MoS2/ZnO heterojunction is proposed based on first-principles simulation. Our results reveal that the photogenerated electrons and holes in the MoS2/ZnO heterojunction follow a specific Z-scheme pathway, highly facilitating redox reactions and optimizing optical properties in the visible-light region. Under external strain, the MoS2/ZnO heterojunction demonstrates improved HER performance and remarkable optical-harvesting capabilities. Interestingly, the HER free energy for the heterojunction is only -0.04 eV under -5% compressive strain, highlighting its promising potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. We observe that the absorption edge of the spectrum shifts gradually to the infrared region with increasing tensile biaxial strains, whereas compressive biaxial strains result in a blue-shift absorption spectrum. Additionally, all heterojunctions achieve excellent solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies exceeding 10%, demonstrating their capability to store sufficient solar energy. Our work offers a novel strategy for exploring highly efficient photocatalysts in the field of hydrogen energy with the ability to modulate their activity through external strain.

Electrocatalysis is one of the principal pathways for the transition to sustainable chemistry, promising greater energy efficiency and reduced emissions. As the field has grown, our theoretical understanding has matured. The influence of the applied potential on reactivity has developed from the first-order predictions based on the Nernst equation to the implicit inclusion of second-order effects including the interaction of reacting species with the interfacial electric field. In this review, we explore these non-Nernstian field effects in electrocatalysis, aiming to both understand and exploit them through theory and computation. We summarize the critical distinction between Nernstian and non-Nernstian effects and outline strategies to address the latter in theoretical studies. Subsequently, we examine the specific energetic contributions of the latter on capacitive and faradaic processes separately. We also underscore the importance of considering non-Nernstian effects in catalyst screening and mechanistic analysis. Finally, we provide suggestions on how to experimentally unravel these effects, offering insights into practical approaches for advancing the field.

Abstract Machine learning (ML) methods enable prediction of the properties of chemical structures without computationally expensive ab initio calculations. The quality of such predictions depends on the reference data that was used to train the model. In this work, we introduce the QCML dataset: A comprehensive dataset for training ML models for quantum chemistry. The QCML dataset systematically covers chemical space with small molecules consisting of up to 8 heavy atoms and includes elements from a large fraction of the periodic table, as well as different electronic states. Starting from chemical graphs, conformer search and normal mode sampling are used to generate both equilibrium and off-equilibrium 3D structures, for which various properties are calculated with semi-empirical methods (14.7 billion entries) and density functional theory (33.5 million entries). The covered properties include energies, forces, multipole moments, and other quantities, e.g., Kohn-Sham matrices. We provide a first demonstration of the utility of our dataset by training ML-based force fields on the data and applying them to run molecular dynamics simulations.

AuPd is a miscible metal alloy that is often used in catalysis. Supported AuPd catalysts, at high Au/Pd ratios, form single-atom alloys (SAAs) that have been shown to enhance rates and/or selectivities for many catalytic reactions, including (de)hydrogenations, hydrogenolysis, and C–C and C–O coupling reactions. While many computational studies have examined the stability of AuPd structures (the arrangement of atoms within the miscible alloy), most focused on generic alloys rather than SAAs and those that have closely investigated SAAs focused on single crystal surfaces. In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate exchange energies (swapping an Au atom with a Pd atom) in a 201-atom truncated octahedral nanoparticle model with a focus on particles with high Au/Pd ratios. We calculate these exchange energies as a function of Pd location within the nanoparticle, the number of Pd atoms neighboring and near those exchange sites, and the total Pd content in the nanoparticle. These DFT-calculated exchange energies are also used to inform simple physics-based models (in contrast to cluster expansion or neural network models) that show good agreement with DFT-calculated values with relatively few regressed parameters. These models are then implemented into Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to predict the nanoparticle structure as a function of composition and temperature. The results show that Pd prefers to be in the subsurface of nanoparticles and that Pd prefers to be isolated from itself within Au. Both observations agree well with prior experimental and computational studies of single-crystal systems. We also show that the overall composition of the nanoparticle influences exchange energies by changing the electronic properties (e.g., Fermi level) of the system, which is relevant as Pd has one fewer valence electron than Au. MC simulations show that, in a vacuum, Pd begins to populate the surface of these ∼2 nm nanoparticles at around 20 mol % Pd (at 298 K) and that the number of Pd surface monomers, desired for SAA applications, goes through a maximum near 40 mol % Pd. As the temperature increases, Pd is more prevalent at the surface, but the influence of temperature is relatively muted. While AuPd structures are known to change in the presence of reactive gases (e.g., CO or O2), these studies characterize the baseline thermodynamic arrangements that can be used to understand surface restructuring during catalyst characterization and reaction studies.
