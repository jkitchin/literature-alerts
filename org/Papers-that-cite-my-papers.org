Bimetals—materials composed of two metal components with dissimilar standard reduction–oxidation (redox) potentials—offer unique electronic, optical, and catalytic properties, surpassing monometallic systems. These materials exhibit not only the combined attributes of their constituent metals but also new and novel properties arising from their synergy. Although many reviews have explored the synthesis, properties, and applications of bimetallic systems, none have focused exclusively on iron (Fe)- and aluminum (Al)-based bimetals. This systematic review addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of conventional and emerging techniques for Fe-based and Al-based bimetal synthesis. Specifically, this work systematically reviewed recent studies from 2014 to 2023 using the Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar databases, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and was registered under INPLASY with the registration number INPLASY202540026. Articles were excluded if they were inaccessible, non-English, review articles, conference papers, book chapters, or not directly related to the synthesis of Fe- or Al-based bimetals. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis was performed to evaluate the research trends on the synthesis of Fe-based and Al-based bimetals. Based on the 122 articles analyzed, Fe-based and Al-based bimetal synthesis methods were classified into three types: (i) physical, (ii) chemical, and (iii) biological techniques. Physical methods include mechanical alloying, radiolysis, sonochemical methods, the electrical explosion of metal wires, and magnetic field-assisted laser ablation in liquid (MF-LAL). In comparison, chemical protocols covered reduction, dealloying, supported particle methods, thermogravimetric methods, seed-mediated growth, galvanic replacement, and electrochemical synthesis. Meanwhile, biological techniques utilized plant extracts, chitosan, alginate, and cellulose-based materials as reducing agents and stabilizers during bimetal synthesis. Research works on the synthesis of Fe-based and Al-based bimetals initially declined but increased in 2018, followed by a stable trend, with 50% of the total studies conducted in the last five years. China led in the number of publications (62.3%), followed by Russia, Australia, and India, while Saudi Arabia had the highest number of citations per document (95). RSC Advances was the most active journal, publishing eight papers from 2014 to 2023, while Applied Catalysis B: Environmental had the highest number of citations per document at 203. Among the three synthesis methods, chemical techniques dominated, particularly supported particles, galvanic replacement, and chemical reduction, while biological and physical methods have started gaining interest. Iron–copper (Fe/Cu), iron–aluminum (Fe/Al), and iron–nickel (Fe/Ni) were the most commonly synthesized bimetals in the last 10 years. Finally, this work was funded by DOST-PCIEERD and DOST-ERDT.

Abstract Aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs) have great potential for large‐scale energy storage applications. However, the parasitic reactions, such as continuous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), seriously hamper the reversibility and cycling stability of the zinc metal anode (ZMA), limiting its practical application. In this paper, a pre‐growth interfacial layer strategy is adopted to grow the enol/ketone conversion interfacial layer on the surface of ZMA (denoted as Zn@AA). H + can be reversible “lock/unlock” during reversible enol/ketone conversion reaction. It not only broadens the capacity of AZIBs (Zn 2+ /H + co‐insertion), but also inhibits the HER reaction (the amounts of H 2 evolution decreased obviously in both Zn@AA||Zn@AA and Zn@AA||VO 2 ·H 2 O@Ppy (Ppy denote as polypyrrole) cells by on‐line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry analysis), thereby improving its stability performance. The cycle life of the assembled Zn@AA||Zn@AA cell exceeded 3200 h at 1 mA cm −2 and 1 mA h cm −2 . Furtherly, the Zn@AA||VO 2 ·H 2 O@Ppy full cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability and capacity retention. This work provides new ideas for modifying the ZMA interfacial layer to inhibit the HER, which guides the development of AZIBs.

Due to the growing threat of climate change, the pressing need for carbon dioxide capture has become a global priority in the development of innovative technologies. Multipronged approaches and multifarious research efforts are underway to efficiently capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from emission sources, ambient air, and indoor air. Currently, absorption is the dominant industrial-scale process, using different solvents and their blends to lower the energy intensity of solvent desorption and regeneration. However, adsorption is emerging as a promising alternative due to its energy efficiency, eco-friendliness, and potential for large-scale applications. High-performance sorbents with large surface areas and bio-based materials exhibit high CO2 loading and selectivity in fixed-bed and fluidized-bed systems. Cryogenic CO2 capture systems, which do not require solvents or membranes, are optimized for energy through process integration. Researchers are investigating different membrane materials in hollow fiber membrane contactors for enhanced CO2 capture efficiency. Membranes that can selectively filter CO2 from gas mixtures are also being explored. Furthermore, hybrid technologies integrating different CO2 capture approaches are being developed to reduce costs and boost overall performance to curb rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

An indirect, swift, and easy method of enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of an economically viable Fe-rich NiFeCo (NFC) alloy has been developed. This approach leverages the anodic potential sweeps applied indirectly to the counter electrode (CE) when one does cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on by potential sweeping at the working electrode (WE). In this method, NFC was intentionally corroded indirectly by using it as a CE for the potential sweeping HER experiment done with a Pt WE. The indirectly corroded NFC (NFC_IC) featuring mostly γ-NiFeOOH and γ-NiCoOOH entities on the surface was able to begin the OER at an onset overpotential of 250 mV and reach the benchmark of 10 mA cm-2 at 290 mV, which is 60 and 55 mV lesser than that of the bare NFC and RuO2, respectively, all with exceptionally faster kinetics, as evidenced by a relatively smaller Tafel slope of 30 mV dec-1. These insights into designing a trimetallic alloy-based OER electrocatalyst have opened a previously unknown avenue in the development of advanced self-supported OER electrodes for better and efficient H2 production via water electrolysis.

Noble metal electrocatalysts remain the mainstay for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, majorly due to their exceptional activity and durability in acidic media. However, conventional powder and particle catalysts intensively suffer from aggregation, shedding and poor electron conductivity in practical applications. Here, we develop a micellar brush-guided method to agglomerate and smelt metal nanoparticles into erect nanoarrays with designable constitutions on various substrates. While the nanoarrays of stacked nanoparticles show poor stability in the acidic media, the smelting treatment substantially enhances the electron conductivity by more than four order of magnitude and reinforces the nanoarray architectures. This allows the tailored fabrication of self-supported acid-durable metallic and alloy nanoarray catalysts with outstanding hydrogen evolution activity, and metal oxide nanoarray with extraordinary oxygen evolution activity. The integration of metallic Ru-nanoarray and RuOx-nanoarray in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer further enables a long-term stable water electrolysis process for more than 500 h at 1 A cm-2.

Different nanoporous graphene structures have shown great promise for a wide variety of applications. However, due to limitations in experimental or computational throughput, nanoporous graphenes have not been investigated systematically. In this work, we combine density functional theory and machine learning to study 460 structures of nanoporous graphene made from four different templates. We shed light on structure-band gap relations and perform molecular dynamics simulations and phonon calculations in order to determine the role of electron-phonon coupling on the renormalization of temperature-dependent band gaps. Our results uncover that certain subsets of nanoporous graphene exhibit a similar trend in the band gap as a function of a structural parameter as has been observed for armchair graphene nanoribbons. Furthermore, we find that electron-phonon coupling varies over a large range in the investigated nanoporous graphenes and that it drives the closing of the band gap with larger temperatures. Finally, we suggest nanoporous graphene structures for different applications, such as field-effect transistors. Thus, our work can help guide the development and improvement of nanoporous graphene-based devices.

The many-body expansion (MBE) of the lattice energy enables an ab initio description of molecular solids using correlated wave function approximations. However, the practical application of MBE requires computing the large number of n-body contributions efficiently. To this end, we employ a multi-level coupled-cluster approach which adapts the approximation level based on interaction type and intermolecular distance. The high-level method, including connected triple excitations, is applied only to monomer relaxation and dimer interactions roughly within the first and second coordination shells. Long-range dimers and trimers are treated using a simplified coupled-cluster description based on the random-phase approximation (RPA). A key feature is an energy correction which mitigates the underbinding error of the base RPA. Convergence to the bulk limit is accelerated by the addition of the periodic Hartree-Fock correction. The proposed approach is validated against recent diffusion Monte Carlo reference data for the X23 data set, achieving a mean absolute error of 3.1 kJ/mol, i.e., chemical accuracy for absolute lattice energies.

To probe the properties of single atoms is a challenging task, especially from the experimental standpoint, due to sensitivity limits. Nevertheless, it is sometimes possible to achieve this by making corresponding choices and adjustments to the experimental technique and sample under investigation. In the present case, the absolute value of the electronic charge the Fe atoms acquire when they are adsorbed on the surface of aluminum oxide α-Al2O3(0001) was measured by a set of surface-sensitive techniques: low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and work function (WF) measurements, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The main focus was the submonolayer coverage of Fe atoms in situ deposited on the well-ordered stoichiometric α-Al2O3(0001) 7 nm thick film formed on a Mo(110) crystal face. An analysis of the evolution of the Fe LVV Auger triplet upon variation of the Fe coverage shows that there is electronic charge transfer from Fe to alumina and that its value gradually decreases as the Fe coverage grows. The same trend is also predicted by the DFT results. Extrapolation of the experimental Fe charge value versus coverage plot yields an estimated value of a single Fe atom adsorbed on α-Al2O3(0001) of 0.98e (electron charge units), which is in reasonable agreement with the calculated value (+1.15e). The knowledge of this value and the possibility of its adjustment may be important points for the development and tuning of modern sub-nanometer-scale technologies of diverse applied relevance and can contribute to a more complete justification and selection of the corresponding theoretical models.

Exploring the interaction configurations between substrates and atomic or molecular systems is crucial for various scientific and technological applications, such as characterizing catalytic reactions, solvation structures, and molecular interactions. Traditional approaches for generating substrate-reactant configurations often rely on chemical intuition, symmetry operations, or random initial states, which can be inefficient and challenging for systems with low symmetry or unknown interaction mechanisms. This work introduces a systematic and automated methodology to explore the configuration space between substrates and adsorbates using symmetry-invariant features that characterize the local atomistic topology of the substrate. The approach involves three key components: (1) defining and discretizing a contact space surrounding the substrate, (2) utilizing symmetry-invariant descriptors to capture local atomic environments, and (3) employing unsupervised machine-learning techniques for clustering and hierarchical analysis of interaction sites. The method ensures comprehensive yet nonredundant sampling of the configuration space, independent of the substrate dimensionality. Applications to simple ideal substrates show that symmetry intuition and high-symmetry sites are correctly recovered. Moreover, the method is shown to translate seamlessly to less symmetric substrates.

Hydrogen-centered electrochemical technologies play a vital role in sustainable energy conversion and storage. One of the challenges in achieving cheap hydrogen is to bridge the gap between advanced electrocatalysts and highly effective electrodes. The key lies in designing electrocatalysts with high intrinsic activity and understanding the structure–activity relationship in water electrolysis. Being proposed as promising electrocatalysts, bulk oxides, with their compositional and crystal structure flexibility, provide a good platform for studying the correlation between intrinsic activity and electronic structure and also for screening superior catalysts for water electrolysis. In this review, we discuss the recent developments of oxide electrocatalysts in understanding the structure–activity relationship. Firstly, we present a thorough overview of recent advances from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Subsequently, we highlight the design principles to provide guidance for promoting performance. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives about this field are presented. This review aims to provide guidance for the design of highly advanced oxide electrocatalysts for water electrolysis and large-scale green energy supply.

Synthesizing radicals that have both long lifetimes and high chemical reactivity remains a long-term challenge. Here, persistent phenyl radicals are successfully synthesized on Ag(111) by protecting the carbon radical site by designing the precursor molecule with suitable steric hindrance. As carbon-carbon coupling is prohibited, such radicals remain intact for longer than 6 hours at room temperature on Ag(111). Taking advantage of the long lifetimes, the as-synthesized radicals are directly characterized in the real space at the single-chemical-bond scale by means of bond-resolving scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. Accompanied by the excellent stability, the radicals exhibit high chemical reactivities and facilitate the intermolecular radical transfer reactions at extreme low temperature. The preparation of persistent radicals not only favors the characterization of a surface-stabilized radical in the real space but also aids in illuminating the detailed reaction pathways of subsequent radical-assisted reactions directly.

Renewable electricity driven CO2 electroreduction into methane offers a sustainable route to mitigate our dependence on natural gas. However, this route is now limited by the unsatisfied efficiency and short durability, which originates from a kinetic disparity between water dissociation (WD) and proton-coupled electron transfer on existing catalysts. Herein, we harness the exceptional WD capability of the intermetallic electride (IE) materials for the electrocatalytic methanization from CO2. Combinative experimental and theoretical approaches strongly evidence a spontaneous WD on an IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst due to its unique electronic structure (strongly modified charge states, reversible lattice hydride ions and anionic electrons). Consequently, this catalyst exhibits improved methanization performance in alkaline flow cells, achieving a methane Faraday efficiency of 72% at -1.21 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and peak partial current density of 476.7 mA cm-2 at -1.52 V vs. RHE. Energetic calculations further establish the mechanistic link between WD and methanization processes on our catalyst, on which a lowered free energy barrier for the key *CO to *CHO transformation step is observed. This work sheds light on the pivotal role of WD and expands the repertoire of materials for efficient electrocatalytic methanization from CO2.

MXenes have emerged as promising candidates for energy storage and catalyst design. Through detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a series of new 2D composite MXene-based nanomaterials by covering excellent TM3N2 MXenes (TM = Nb, Ta, Mo, and W) with graphene or buckled silicene. Our findings demonstrate that this coating can lead to high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in these composite MXene-based systems, with silicene exhibiting superior performance compared to graphene. The relevant carbon and silicon atoms in the coated materials serve as active sites for HER due to complex electron transfer processes. Additionally, doping N or P atoms into graphene/silicene, which have similar atomic radii, but larger electronegativity than C/Si atoms, can further enhance the HER activity of adjacent carbon or silicon atoms, thus endowing the composite systems with higher HER catalytic performance. Coupled with their high stability and metallic conductivity, all these composite systems show great potential as electrocatalysts for HER. These remarkable findings offer new strategies and valuable insights for designing non-precious and highly efficient MXene-based HER electrocatalysts.

Abstract This report examines the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by iron‐polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) and pyrazine‐linked iron‐coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz‐FeTPr) conjugated organic polymer (COP) catalysts, utilizing grand‐canonical density functional theory (GC‐DFT) and microkinetic (MK) simulations. The computed half‐wave potential for AA stacking FePPc under alkaline conditions is in strong agreement with experimental findings. The ORR mechanism for AA stacking FePPc is characterized by the * O 2 mechanism (), with the Fe site serving as the active site. In the case of Pz‐FeTPr, the ORR mechanism is similarly governed by the * O 2 mechanism, with the Fe site remaining the active site at lower potentials (less than 0.5 V RHE , vs reversible hydrogen electrode). However, at higher potentials (greater than 0.5 V RHE ), the Fe site becomes obstructed by , resulting in a shift of the active site from the Fe site to a neighboring C site (designated as type A3). The corresponding ORR mechanism at the C site is denoted as mechanism (). This mechanism yields a calculated half‐wave potential that aligns well with experimental observations. The mechanisms identified for FePPc and Pz‐FeTPr can be substantiated by the Raman signals detected in experimental studies.

Abstract Aminopolymer‐based adsorbents are a prominent class of materials being used for direct air capture of CO 2 at the industrial scale. However, improving their working lifetime, specifically by increasing their resilience to oxidative degradation, remains an ongoing challenge. Toward this end, functionalization of aminopolymers with non‐amine functionalities such as hydroxyls has emerged in recent years as a promising strategy toward improving adsorbent lifetime. Although there is a growing body of work demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach and investigating the origin of this improved stability, studies to date have primarily focused on branched aminopolymer systems such as branched poly(ethylenimine). In this work, hydroxyl‐functionalized linear poly(ethylenimine) is used to continue to probe the underlying protective mechanism of this strategy. A combination of thermogravimetric analysis, NMR relaxometry, differential scanning calorimetry, and computational simulations is used to better understand the relationship between the extent of chemical functionalization, physical properties, and adsorbent performance.

Abstract This study investigates the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)₂) catalysts, focusing on the roles of oxygen vacancies (O v ), charge transfer, and silk fibroin. Spectroelectrochemical techniques, including in situ surface‐enhanced Raman (SERS) and UV–vis spectroscopy, revealed that O v formation and Ni‐to‐Au charge transfer facilitate the generation of high‐valence Ni and superoxide species. A Mars–van Krevelen mechanism is proposed to describe the participation of lattice oxygen. Silk fibroin is found to enhance catalytic activity by lowering the activation energy of key intermediates, as indicated by higher transfer coefficients and Tafel slope analysis. At +300 mV overpotential, fibroin‐modified samples exhibited intrinsic turnover frequencies (TOFs) of ≈0.7 s⁻¹, outperforming fibroin‐free counterparts (≈0.4 s⁻¹). These results highlight the synergy between structural defects and interfacial modifications in improving Ni(OH)₂‐based OER catalysts for sustainable energy applications.
