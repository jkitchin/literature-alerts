Abstract Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) combine the predictive power of Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the speed and scaling of interatomic potentials, enabling theoretical spectroscopy to be applied to larger and more complex systems than is possible with DFT. In this work, we train an MLIP for quaternary Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) alloy systems of the form Mo 1− x W x S 2−2 y Se 2 y , using the equivariant Neural Network (NN) MACE. We demonstrate the ability of this potential to calculate vibrational properties of alloy TMDs including phonon spectra for pure monolayers, and Vibrational Density of States (VDOS) and first-order Raman spectra for alloys across the range of x and y . We show that we retain DFT level accuracy while greatly extending feasible system size and extent of sampling over alloy configurations. We are able to characterize the first-order Raman active modes across the whole range of concentration, particularly for the “disorder-induced” modes.

Ammonia decomposition is a key reaction in the context of hydrogen storage, transport, and release. This study combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations with microkinetic modeling to address the promotion mechanism of Ba species for ammonia decomposition on Co catalysts. The modified adsorption properties of Co upon the addition of metallic Ba or BaO suggest that the promoters play a role in alleviating the competitive adsorption of H. Calculating the full reaction pathway of ammonia decomposition shows that limiting the investigation to the N–N association step, as done previously, overlooks the effect of the promoter on the energy barriers of the NHx dehydrogenation steps. Challenges of modeling the ammonia decomposition reaction are addressed by understanding that the NH2 intermediate is stabilized on the step sites rather than the terrace sites. When the effect of H-coverage on the adsorption of NH3 is not considered in the microkinetic simulations, the results conflict with the experiments. However, accounting for the effect of H-coverage, as performed here, shows that BaO-doped Co has higher rates than pristine Co and Ba-doped Co at the reaction temperature of 723.15 K. When H is adsorbed on the Ba-doped Co, the adsorption of ammonia becomes significantly endergonic, which makes the rates relatively slow. The superiority of the BaO-promoted catalyst is attributed to a lower energy for the transition state of the rate-determining step, coupled with a reduced impact of the hydrogen coverage on weakening the ammonia adsorption. The kinetic analysis of the influence of Ba and BaO on the Co surface shows that BaO-doped Co aligns more closely with experimental observations than Ba-doped Co. This implies that Ba on the Co surface is likely to be in an oxide form under reaction conditions. Understanding the kinetics of the ammonia decomposition reaction provides a foundation for developing highly effective catalysts to accelerate the industrial utilization of ammonia as a sustainable hydrogen carrier.

Abstract We report high throughput computational screening for magnetic ground state order in 2D materials. The workflow is based on spin spiral calculations and yields the magnetic order in terms of a two-dimensional ordering vector Q . We then include spin-orbit coupling to extract the easy and hard axes for collinear structures and the orientation of spiral planes in non-collinear structures. Finally, for all predicted ferromagnets we compute the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and determine whether or not these are strong enough to overcome the magnetic anisotropy and stabilise a chiral spin spiral ground state. We find 58 ferromagnets, 21 collinear anti-ferromagnets, and 85 non-collinear ground states of which 15 are chiral spin spirals driven by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The results show that non-collinear order is in fact as common as collinear order in these materials and emphasise the need for detailed investigation of the magnetic ground state when reporting magnetic properties of new materials.

Abstract Achieving a carbon neutral manufacturing of chemicals is imperative to accelerate the transition towards a sustainable future. Propanol electrosynthesis from CO electroreduction represents a promising alternative to the current manufacturing of this chemical. Yet, the catalyst features driving propanol formation are poorly understood, which limits further advancement in the performance. Herein, we report on a comprehensive mapping of the sensitivity of the CO electroreduction to the catalyst structure exploiting well-defined copper nanocrystals (NCs) with tunable shape and size synthesized via colloidal chemistry. In addition to clarify the dependence from the exposed surfaces, we discover that spheres uniquely promote n-propanol selectivity, which we explain mostly with strain effects. Driven by this novel insight, we achieve unprecedent n-propanol production via electrosynthesis with a copper catalyst. We demonstrate that colloidal copper nanospheres with a diameter of 4 nm deliver n-propanol faradaic efficiency of 39.6±1.4% at 119±4.2 mA/cm2 production rate, the latter being ten times the current state of the art for copper catalysts.

Abstract Nano‐single‐atom‐catalysts have the potential to combine the respective advantages of both nano‐catalysts and single‐atom‐catalysts and thus exhibit enhanced performance. Generally, the separation of active sites in space limits the interaction between single atoms and nanoparticles. Heterointerface engineering has the potential to break this limitation. Regretfully, studies on the interface effect between single atoms and nanoparticles are rarely reported. Herein, an unprecedented nano‐single‐atom heterointerface composed of Fe single‐atoms and carbon‐shell‐coated FeP nanoparticles (Fe SAC/FeP@C) is demonstrated as an efficient electrocatalyst for the nitrate reduction process from alkaline to acidic. Compared with typical nano‐single‐atom‐catalysts (Fe SAC/FePO 4 ) and single‐atom‐catalysts (Fe SAC), the constructed Fe SAC/FeP@C heterostructure exhibits dramatically enhanced nitrate‐to‐ammonia performance. Especially in acidic media, the maxmium Faradaic efficiency of ammonia (NH 3 ) can reach 95.6 ± 0.5%, with a maximum NH 3 yield of 36.2 ± 3.1 mg h −1 mg cat −1 (pH = 1.2), which is considerably higher than previously reported. Density functional theory calculations and in situ spectroscopic investigations indicate that the unique charge redistribution at the interface, together with the optimized electronic structure of Fe single‐atoms, strengthens intermediate adsorption and catalytic activity. This work provides a feasible strategy for designing nano‐single‐atom‐catalysts with unique heterointerfaces, as well as valuable insights into nitrate conversion under environmentally relevant wastewater conditions.

Platinum-Ruthenium (PtRu) bimetallic nanoparticles are promising catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) required by direct methanol fuel cells. However, existing catalyst synthesis methods have difficulty controlling their composition and structures. Here, a direct Joule heating method to yield highly active and stable PtRu catalysts for MOR is shown. The optimized Joule heating condition at 1000 °C over 50 microseconds produces uniform PtRu nanoparticles (6.32 wt.% Pt and 2.97 wt% Ru) with an average size of 2.0 ± 0.5 nanometers supported on carbon black substrates. They have a large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 239 m

Abstract Ammonia, as a high‐energy‐density carrier for hydrogen storage, is in great demand worldwide. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) provides a green NH 3 production process. However, the complex reaction pathways for NO 3 RR to NH 3 and the difficulty in controlling intermediate products limit the reduction process. Herein, by incorporating atomic‐level bismuth (Bi) into CuCo 2 O 4 hollow carbon nanofibers, the catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst for NO 3 RR is enhanced. The maximum Faradaic efficiency of Bi 1 ‐CuCo 2 O 4 is 95.53%, with an NH 3 yield of 448.74 µmol h −1 cm −2 at −0.8 V versus RHE. Density Functional Theory calculations show that the presence of Bi lowers the reaction barrier for the hydrogenation step from *NO 2 to *NO 2 H, while promoting mass transfer on the release of *NH 3 and the reactivation of surface‐active sites. Differential charge density calculations also show that after Bi doping, the charge supplied by the catalyst to NO 3 − increases from 0.62 to 0.72 e ‐ , thus reasoned for enhanced NO 3 RR activity. The established nitrate‐Zn battery shows an energy density of 2.81 mW cm −2 , thus implying the potential application.

Bolstered by their unique atomic structures and tailored compositions, nanoalloys exhibit extraordinary properties making them ideal materials to solve challenges in energy storage and conversion catalysis. However, a quantitative description of the structure-property relationships using an accurate descriptor-based model for nanoalloys, ranging from bimetallic to multimetallic compositions, is needed to drive efficient material design toward high-performance catalysis. In this work, we highlight the electronic property and catalytic activity relationship from an element specific

Abstract Ammonia electrooxidation in aqueous solutions can be a highly energy‐efficient process in producing nitrate and nitrite while generating hydrogen under ambient conditions. However, the kinetics of this reaction are slow and the role of catalyst in facilitating ammonia electrooxidation is not well understood. In this study, a high‐performance NiOOH‐Ni catalyst is introduced for converting ammonia into nitrite with Faraday efficiency of up to 90.4% and nitrate production rate of 1 mg h −1 cm −2 . By employing Operando techniques, the role of NiOOH catalyst is elucidated in the dynamic electrooxidation of ammonia. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support experimental observations and reveal the mechanism of the electrochemical oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate. Overall, this research contributes to the development of a cost‐effective and highly efficient catalyst for large‐scale ammonia electrolysis, while shedding light on the underlying mechanism of the NiOOH catalyst in ammonia electrooxidation.

We predict topological magnetic properties of B20 systems, that are organized in atomically thin multilayers. In particular, we focus on FeSi/CoSi and FeSi/FeGe superlattices with different numbers of layers and interface structures. We demonstrate that the absence of long-range magnetic order, previously observed in bulk FeSi and CoSi, is broken near the FeSi/CoSi interface, where a magnetic state with a nontrivial topological texture appears. Using the Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions calculated from first principles, we perform finite-temperature atomistic spin dynamics simulations for up to 2×106 spins to capture the complexity of noncollinear textures. Our simulations predict the formation of antiskyrmions in a [001]-oriented FeSi/CoSi multilayer, intermediate skyrmions in a [111]-oriented FeSi/CoSi system, and Bloch skyrmions in the FeSi/FeGe (001) system, with a size between 7 and 37 nm. These varieties of topological magnetic textures in the studied systems can be attributed to the complex asymmetric structure of the DM matrix, which is different from previously known magnetic materials. We demonstrate that through structural engineering both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized, where the latter are especially appealing for applications due to the zero skyrmion Hall effect. The proposed B20 multilayers show a potential for further exploration and call for experimental confirmation. Published by the American Physical Society 2024

Abstract Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered attention as potential catalysts for water splitting owing to their unique structures, diverse electronic properties, and composition from earth‐abundant elements. While certain TMD catalysts, notably MoS 2 , have shown promising activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), achieving performance comparable to traditional platinum catalysts remains a challenge. While significant effort has been invested into understanding the effect of TMD's structural properties, such as defectiveness and crystalline phases, recent work has emphasized the role of extrinsic factors on HER. This review summarizes the current understanding of the impact of commonly overlooked electrocatalytic effects that exhibit an enhanced importance in TMD‐based HER. By combining recent advances in theoretical modeling and experimental work, we review the dominating effects of extrinsic factors including electronic resistance, interfacial barriers, surface roughness, oxidation, and valence impurities. Our work aims to provide insights into optimizing TMDs as highly efficient catalysts for HER, facilitating future advancements in hydrogen generation technology.

Abstract Traditionally, Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis is performed using thermal catalysts and syngas (CO and H 2 ) under high‐pressure and high‐temperature conditions. However, this study introduces an approach that relies on FT chemistry assisted by electrochemistry, referred to here as direct electrochemical (EC) FT chemistry, under ambient conditions. A series of CH 4 , C n H 2n , and C n H 2n+2 hydrocarbons (n = 1–7) is successfully produced over gold (Au) nanoparticle‐loaded perovskite strontium titanate (SrTiO 3 ) nanostructures grown on rutile TiO 2 supported on Ti. Au (1.0 nm)–SrTiO 3 shows the best interface formation, with the highest Faradaic efficiency for C 2+ hydrocarbons. This direct EC‐FT process proceeds via a C─C coupling chain growth reaction at the Au‐SrTiO 3 interface as evidenced by the hydrocarbon weight distribution analysis and density functional theory calculations. The robust combination of experimental and computational findings reveals that optimum conditions for producing surface hydrogenation and C─C coupling polymerization, initiated by surface * CO and * H are achieved by controlling the undercoordinated Au at the perimeter sites of supported Au nanoparticles and by ensuring a harmonized density of states between Au and SrTiO 3 . This EC‐FT process opens a promising avenue for the direct conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O into value‐added long‐chain hydrocarbons.

The development of highly efficient and durable alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is crucial for achieving high-performance practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) at ampere-level current density. Herein, we report a design concept by employing Ga single atoms as an electronic bridge to stabilize the Ru clusters for boosting alkaline HER performance in practical AEMWE. Experimental and theoretical results collectively reveal that the bridged Ga sites trigger strong metal-support interaction for the homogeneous distribution of Ru clusters with high density, as well as optimize the Ru-H bond strength due to the electron transfer between Ru and Ga for enhanced intrinsic HER activity. Moreover, the oxophilic Ga sites near the Ru clusters tend to adsorb the hydroxyl species and accelerate the water dissociation for sufficient proton supplement in an alkaline medium. The Ru-Ga

Abstract Among various products from electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (CO 2 ER), HCOOH is highly profitable one. However, the slow kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction lowers overall energy efficiency, which can be replaced by an electro‐oxidation reaction with low thermodynamic potential and fast kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolysis system coupling CO 2 ER with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR). A BiOCl–CuO catalyst was designed to sustain CO 2 ER to HCOOH at partial current density of 500 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 90% and 700 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 80%. In situ and ex situ x‐ray absorption fine structure was used to capture the structure transform of BiOCl–CuO into metallic Bi and Cu during CO 2 ER process, and the presence of CuO will promote this transformation which are supported by DFT calculations. Coupling HMFOR with CO 2 ER, we realize both FE HCOOH and FE FDCA above 95% simultaneously, providing new prospects vista for the electrosynthesis of value‐added products from paired system.

The strengths of glasses are intricately linked to their atomic-level heterogeneity. Atomistic simulations are frequently used to investigate the statistical physics of this relationship, compensating for the limited spatiotemporal resolution in experimental studies. However, theoretical insights are limited by the complexity of glass structures and the accuracy of the interatomic potentials used in simulations. Here, we investigate the strengths and fracture mechanisms of 2D silica, with all structural units accessible to direct experimental observation. We develop a neural network force field for fracture based on the deep potential-smooth edition framework. Representative atomic structures across crystals, nanocrystalline, paracrystalline, and continuous random network glasses are studied. We find that the virials or bond lengths control the initialization of bond-breaking events, creating nanoscale voids in the vitreous network. However, the voids do not necessarily lead to crack propagation due to a disorder-trapping effect, which is stronger than the lattice-trapping effect in a crystalline lattice, and occurs over larger length and time scales. Fracture initiation proceeds with void growth and coalescence and advances through a bridging mechanism. The fracture patterns are shaped by subsequent trapping and cleavage steps, often guided by voids forming ahead of the crack tip. These heterogeneous processes result in atomically smooth facets in crystalline regions and rough, amorphous edges in the glassy phase. These insights into 2D crystals and glasses, both sharing SiO2 chemistry, highlight the pivotal role of atomic-level structures in determining fracture kinetics and crack path selection in materials.

First-principles electronic structure simulations are an invaluable tool for understanding chemical bonding and reactions. While machine-learning models such as interatomic potentials significantly accelerate the exploration of potential energy surfaces, electronic structure information is generally lost. Particularly in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, simulated electron band structures provide fundamental insights into catalytic reactivity. This ab initio knowledge is preserved in semiempirical methods such as density functional tight binding (DFTB), which extend the accessible computational length and time scales beyond first-principles approaches. In this paper we present Shell-Optimized Atomic Confinement (SOAC) DFTB electronic-part-only parametrizations for bulk and surface band structures of all

Diamond is a semiconductor material with remarkable structural, thermal, and electronic properties that has garnered significant interest in the field of electronics. Although hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) terminations are conventionally favored in transistor designs, alternative options, such as silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), are being explored because of their resilience to harsh processing conditions during fabrication. Density-functional theory was used to examine the non-oxidized and oxidized group-IV (Si and Ge)-terminated diamond (100) surfaces. The (3 × 1) reconstructed surfaces feature an ether configuration and show relative stability compared with the bare surface. Hybrid-functional calculations of the electronic properties revealed reduced fundamental bandgaps (&lt;1 eV) and lower negative electron affinities (NEAs) than those of H-terminated diamond surfaces, which is attributed to the introduction of unoccupied Si (Ge) states and the depletion of negative charges. Furthermore, oxidation of these surfaces enhanced the stability of the diamond surfaces but resulted in two structural configurations: ether and ketone. Oxidized ether configurations displayed insulating properties with energy gaps of ∼4.3 ± 0.3 eV, similar to H-terminated diamond (100) surfaces, whereas bridged ether configurations exhibited metallic properties. Oxidization of the metallic ketone configurations leads to the opening of relatively smaller gaps in the range of 1.1–1.7 eV. Overall, oxidation induced a shift from NEAs to positive electron affinities, except for the reverse-ordered ketone surface with an NEA of −0.94 eV, a value comparable to the H-terminated diamond (100) surfaces. In conclusion, oxidized group-IV-terminated diamond surfaces offer enhanced stability compared to H-terminated surfaces and display unique structural and electronic properties that are influenced by surface bonding.

Automatic differentiation (AD) emerged as an integral part of machine learning, accelerating model development by enabling gradient-based optimization without explicit analytical derivatives. Recently, the benefits of AD and computing arbitrary-order derivatives with respect to any variable were also recognized in the field of quantum chemistry. In this work, we present dxtb—an open-source, fully differentiable framework for semiempirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods. Developed entirely in Python and leveraging PyTorch for array operations, dxtb facilitates extensibility and rapid prototyping while maintaining computational efficiency. Through comprehensive code vectorization and optimization, we essentially reach the speed of compiled xTB programs for high-throughput calculations of small molecules. The excellent performance also scales to large systems, and batch operability yields additional benefits for execution on parallel hardware. In particular, energy evaluations are on par with existing programs, whereas the speed of automatically differentiated nuclear derivatives is only 2 to 5 times slower compared to their analytical counterparts. We showcase the utility of AD in dxtb by calculating various molecular and spectroscopic properties, highlighting its capacity to enhance and simplify such evaluations. Furthermore, the framework streamlines optimization tasks and offers seamless integration of semiempirical quantum chemistry in machine learning, paving the way for physics-inspired end-to-end differentiable models. Ultimately, dxtb aims to further advance the capabilities of semiempirical methods, providing an extensible foundation for future developments and hybrid machine learning applications. The framework is accessible at https://github.com/grimme-lab/dxtb.

We present four open-source datasets that provide results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations of ground-state properties of refractory solid solution binary alloys niobium-tantalum (NbTa), niobium-vanadium (NbV), tantalum-vanadium (TaV), and ternary alloys NbTaV ordered in body-centered-cubic (BCC) structures with 128 Bravais lattice sites. The first-principles code used to run the calculations is the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package. The calculations have been collected by uniformly sampling chemical compositions across the entire compositional range. For each chemical composition, the calculations have been run for 100 randomized arrangements of the constituents on the BCC lattice sites. This sampling methodology resulted in running DFT simulations for a total of 3,100 randomized atomic configurations over 31 chemical compositions for each of the three binary alloys Nb-Ta, Nb-V, Ta-V, and a total of 10,500 randomized atomic structures over 105 chemical compositions for the ternary alloys Nb-Ta-V. For each atomic configuration, geometry optimization has been performed, and the data released contains information about each step of geometry optimization for each atomic configuration.

Machine learning potentials have become an essential tool for atomistic simulations, yielding results close to ab initio simulations at a fraction of computational cost. With recent improvements on the achievable accuracies, the focus has now shifted on the data set composition itself. The reliable identification of erroneously predicted configurations to extend a given data set is therefore of high priority. Yet, uncertainty estimation techniques have achieved mixed results for machine learning potentials. Consequently, a general and versatile method to correlate energy or atomic force uncertainties with the model error has remained elusive to date. In the current work, we show that epistemic uncertainty cannot correlate with model error by definition but can be aggregated over groups of atoms to yield a strong correlation. We demonstrate that our method correctly estimates prediction errors both globally per structure and locally resolved per atom. The direct correlation of local uncertainty and local error is used to design an active learning framework based on identifying local subregions of a large simulation cell and performing ab initio calculations only for the subregion subsequently. We successfully utilized this method to perform active learning in the low-data regime for liquid water.
