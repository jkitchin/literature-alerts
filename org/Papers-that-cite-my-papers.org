Abstract With the net zero emission (NZE) commitment by 2050 following COP26 being pledged by country and industrial leaders, the technology focus for CCUS has shifted from high-CO2 gas field development to also include capturing CO2 from other industrial emission sources e.g. flaring and gas turbines. With the expanding scopes, careful consideration especially from process design perspective needs to be taken to ensure the overall CCUS conceptual design is techno-commercially feasible and viable to meet the CCUS end target and NZE aspiration in the long term. Process design intent shall start with the input-output specifications, where main input specifications would be looking at source or CCUS fluid (e.g. gas field/flare stack etc.) which will determine the type of CO2 capture technology required. Target output usage (storage/ utilization) will affect the tail-end process design, since both require different process setup. Other considerations would also be: (1) location (onshore vs offshore) which will affect the facilities network and logistics, (2) contaminants such as SOx and NOx which will determine other treatment requirements and affect the final use of the separated CO2-rich stream (utilization, storage strategy), and (3) material selection for the mixed contaminants stream. Depending on the concentration of CO2 in the source, a series of treatment steps may be required to get the optimum recovery for further utilization and storage. The presence of other contaminants is also discussed, which may affect the overall CCUS processes. Method to either utilize the separated CO2 stream or injection to reservoir for storage is also explored. An integrated approach is required to ensure a successful CCUS process design from start to end. Challenges and lesson-learnt from a conceptual CCUS system are analyzed including technology maturation, presence of other contaminants and final use of CO2-based products/storage. The technical and commercial aspects associated with each technology are also addressed. Key design elements are proposed with aspiration of a successful CCUS implementation in reducing future carbon footprint and realizing NZE aspiration and decarbonization goal, requiring planning for end-to-end solutions.

Margaret is an advanced R package designed to systematically extract and consolidate data pertaining to research outputs (such as publications, books, book chapters, and conference presentations) of scientific groups from the GrupLAC platform, an online application managed by Minciencias in Colombia for the registration and updating of researcher and research group information in the fields of science, technology, and innovation. The challenge of monitoring and evaluating scientific production across various web platforms presents a substantial barrier to universities in tracking their contributions effectively. To address this challenge, Margaret accepts a designated list of links corresponding to university-affiliated research groups within GrupLAC. Utilizing web-scraping techniques, the package retrieves and compiles this data into a comprehensive XLSX file. This file encompasses information across 51 distinct categories of research products, enabling research directors to meticulously assess, monitor, and enhance various strategies that aim to augment the production, quality, and impact of scientific outputs. The Shiny application is publicly accessible and can be accessed via the following link: https://ucatolicaluisamigo-investigaciones.shinyapps.io/margaret/

We adapt our recently developed constraint-based orbital-optimized excited-state method (COOX) for the computation of core excitations. COOX is a constrained density functional theory (cDFT) approach based on excitation amplitudes from linear-response time-dependent DFT (LR-TDDFT), and has been shown to provide accurate excitation energies and excited-state properties for valence excitations within a spin-restricted formalism. To extend COOX to core-excited states, we introduce a spin-unrestricted variant which allows us to obtain orbital-optimized core excitations with a single constraint. Using a triplet purification scheme in combination with the constrained unrestricted Hartree–Fock formalism, scalar-relativistic zero-order regular approximation corrections, and a semiempirical treatment of spin–orbit coupling, COOX is shown to produce highly accurate results for K- and L-edge excitations of second- and third-period atoms with subelectronvolt errors despite being based on LR-TDDFT, for which core excitations pose a well-known challenge. L- and M-edge excitations of heavier atoms up to uranium are also computationally feasible and numerically stable, but may require more advanced treatment of relativistic effects. Furthermore, COOX is shown to perform on par with or better than the popular ΔSCF approach while exhibiting more robust convergence, highlighting it as a promising tool for inexpensive and accurate simulations of X-ray absorption spectra.

Microenvironments in heterogeneous catalysis have been recognized as equally important as the types and amounts of active sites for regulating catalytic activity. Two-dimensional (2D) nanospaces between van der Waals (vdW) gaps of layered materials provide an ideal microenvironment to create novel functionalities. Here, we explore a facile method for fabricating g-C3N4/2H-MoS2 superlattice-like heterostructures based on thermochemical intercalation and polymerization reactions of formamide within enlarged vdW gaps of 2H-MoS2 nanosheets without any transfer process. DFT calculations demonstrate that the interlayer electron–electron correlations due to the intercalation effect of g-C3N4, rather than high-κ dielectric environments, lead to the improvement of intrinsic conductivity of 2H-MoS2 nanosheets. As the proof of concept in applications for the electrocatalysis field, the heterostructure for hydrogen electrochemical reaction (HER) exhibits high stability and catalytic activity in both acid and alkaline media, such as a quite low onset overpotential of 98 mV, a high exchange current density of 77.6 μA cm–2, and a small Tafel slope (52.9 mV dec–1) in an acid medium. The enhanced HER activity is attributed to the improved conductivity and nanoconfinement effect of 2D nanospaces that decrease the reaction activation energy and activate the inert basal planes.

The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms in molecular simulations has become commonplace in recent years. There now exists, for instance, a multitude of ML force field algorithms that have enabled simulations approaching ab initio level accuracy at time scales and system sizes that significantly exceed what is otherwise possible with traditional methods. Far fewer algorithms exist for predicting rotationally equivariant, tensorial properties such as the electric polarizability. Here, we introduce a kernel ridge regression algorithm for machine learning of the polarizability tensor. This algorithm is based on the bond polarizability model and allows prediction of the tensor components at the cost similar to that of scalar quantities. We subsequently show the utility of this algorithm by simulating gas phase Raman spectra of biphenyl and malonaldehyde using classical molecular dynamics simulations of these systems performed with the recently developed MACE-OFF23 potential. The calculated spectra are shown to agree very well with the experiments and thus confirm the expediency of our algorithm as well as the accuracy of the used force field. More generally, this work demonstrates the potential of physics-informed approaches to yield simple yet effective machine learning algorithms for molecular properties.

Many governments around the world have taken action to utilise carbon capture (CC) technologies to reduce CO2 emissions. This technology is particularly important to reduce unavoidable emissions from industries like cement plants, oil refineries, etc. The available literature in the public domain explores this theme from two distinct perspectives. The first category of papers focuses only on modelling the CC plants by investigating the details of the processes to separate CO2 from other gas components without considering the industrial applications and synergies between sectors. On the other hand, the second category investigates the required infrastructure that must be put in place to allow a suitable integration without considering the specific particularities of each carbon capture technology. This review gives a comprehensive guideline for the implementation of CC technologies for any given application while also considering the coupling between different energy sectors such as heating, power generation, etc. It also identifies the research gaps within this field, based on the existing literature. Moreover, it delves into various aspects and characteristics of these technologies, while comparing their energy penalties with the minimum work required for CO2 separation. Additionally, this review investigates the main industrial sectors with CC potential, the necessary transportation infrastructure from the point sources to the end users, and the needs and characteristics of storage facilities, as well as the utilisation of CO2 as a feedstock. Finally, an overview of the computation tools for CC processes and guidelines for their utilisation is given. The guidelines presented in this paper are the first attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the technologies, and their requirements, needed to achieve the cross-sector coupling of CC plants for a wide range of applications. It is strongly believed that these guidelines will benefit all stakeholders in the value chain while enabling an accelerated deployment of these technologies.

Abstract Electrochemical two‐electron water oxidation reaction (2e − WOR) driven by renewable energy offers an attractive route to produce H 2 O 2 , while the corresponding electrocatalyst still requires further improvement for the activity, selectivity, and the resulting H 2 O 2 yield. Surface‐interface engineering of electrocatalysts has great potential to advance 2e − WOR performance. This review provides a succinct yet comprehensive insight into the functional mechanisms of surface‐interfacial properties affecting 2e − WOR performance on electrocatalyst. The Gibbs free energy theoretical framework related to surface electronic structure and interfacial reactive kinetics mechanism related to electrolyte, electrode–electrolyte interface structure, and interfacial microenvironment properties are firstly discussed. Afterward, various surface‐interface engineering strategies toward high performance electrocatalysts including the regulation of surface electronic structure, the electrode–electrolyte interface structure, and the interfacial microenvironment have been overviewed. Rational manipulations of the above surface‐interfacial engineering strategies are critical to design highly efficient 2e − WOR electrocatalysts, leading to the development of the green H 2 O 2 production.

Abstract Constructing nanostructures, such as nanopores, within metallic glasses (MGs) holds great promise for further unlocking their electrochemical capabilities. However, the MGs typically exhibit intrinsic atomic‐scale isotropy, posing a significant challenge in directly fabricating anisotropic nanostructures using conventional chemical synthesis. Herein a selective leaching approach, which focuses on tailoring the uniformity of atomic ordering, is introduced to achieve pore‐engineered Pd‐Ni‐P MG. This innovative approach significantly boosts the number of exposed active sites, thereby enhancing the electrochemical sensitivity for glucose detection. Electrochemical tests reveal that the nanoporous Pd‐Ni‐P MG exhibits high sensitivity (3.19 mA m m ⁻¹ cm⁻ 2 ) and remarkable stability (97.7% current retention after 1000 cycles). During electrochemical cycling, synchrotron X‐ray pair distribution function and X‐ray absorption fine structure analyses reveal that the distance between active sites decreases, enhancing electron transport efficiency, while the medium‐range ordered structure of the Pd‐Ni‐P MG remains stable, contributing to its exceptional glucose sensing capabilities. A microglucose sensor is successfully developed by integrating the nanoporous Pd‐Ni‐P MG with a screen‐printed electrode, demonstrating the practical applicability. This study not only offers a new avenue for the design of highly active nanoporous MGs but also sheds light on the mechanisms behind the high electrochemistry performance of MGs.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a multistep proton-coupled four-electron process with sluggish kinetics, which seriously limits the hydrogen production efficiency, thus it is of great importance to develop an efficient and stable OER catalyst. In this study, a two-step differential pyrolysis strategy is employed to design a three-dimensional porous microstructured material consisting of RuOx nanoparticles coated by a thin-layer carbon, where the active particles were isolated in separate chambers and the RuOx nanoparticles mainly existed in the form of a heterogeneous interface between RuO2 and partial metallic Ru. The preparation parameters of the catalysts are optimized via combining transient and steady-state polarization properties, and the target catalyst Cat-500–1.5t shows the best OER catalytic performance after ca. 60 h of a chronopotentiometry test in an acidic medium with a much smaller performance change than other samples. The unique design of adopting a carbon layer to form separate reaction chambers largely mitigates the excessive oxidation loss of the active components under strong oxidation potential. The suitability of the catalyst with the loaded substrate and test media is explored, and in an acidic medium, the carbon paper is much better than the titanium fiber, while in an alkaline medium, the titanium fiber is obviously superior to the carbon paper. On both carbon paper and titanium fiber, the performance in an alkaline medium outperforms that in an acidic medium, and the possible reasons for the performance difference are analyzed. Herein, to obtain the actual electrocatalytic performance, the optimal design of the catalyst structure and matching suitable conductive substrate in a specific medium are quite necessary, which provides a feasible strategy for the acquisition of efficient and stable electrocatalysts and the desirable presentation of performance.

Biomolecular dynamics simulation is a fundamental technology for life sciences research, and its usefulness depends on its accuracy and efficiency1–3. Classical molecular dynamics simulation is fast but lacks chemical accuracy4,5. Quantum chemistry methods such as density functional theory can reach chemical accuracy but cannot scale to support large biomolecules6. Here we introduce an artificial intelligence-based ab initio biomolecular dynamics system (AI2BMD) that can efficiently simulate full-atom large biomolecules with ab initio accuracy. AI2BMD uses a protein fragmentation scheme and a machine learning force field7 to achieve generalizable ab initio accuracy for energy and force calculations for various proteins comprising more than 10,000 atoms. Compared to density functional theory, it reduces the computational time by several orders of magnitude. With several hundred nanoseconds of dynamics simulations, AI2BMD demonstrated its ability to efficiently explore the conformational space of peptides and proteins, deriving accurate 3J couplings that match nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and showing protein folding and unfolding processes. Furthermore, AI2BMD enables precise free-energy calculations for protein folding, and the estimated thermodynamic properties are well aligned with experiments. AI2BMD could potentially complement wet-lab experiments, detect the dynamic processes of bioactivities and enable biomedical research that is impossible to conduct at present. A study introduces AI2BMD, an artificial intelligence-based dynamics simulation program that uses protein fragmentation with a machine learning force field to accurately and efficiently model the folding and unfolding of large proteins.

Direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture species, i.e., carbamate and (bi)carbonate, can be promising for CO2 capture and conversion from point-source, where the energetically demanding stripping step is bypassed. Here, we describe a class of atomically dispersed nickel (Ni) catalysts electrodeposited on various electrode surfaces that are shown to directly convert captured CO2 to methane (CH4). A detailed study employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy (EM) indicate that highly dispersed Ni atoms are uniquely active for converting capture species to CH4, and the activity of single-atom Ni is confirmed using control experiments with a molecularly defined Ni phthalocyanine catalyst supported on carbon nanotubes. Comparing the kinetics of various capture solutions obtained from hydroxide, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines provide evidence that carbamate, rather than (bi)carbonate and/or dissolved CO2, is primarily responsible for CH4 production. This conclusion is supported by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of capture solutions as well as control experiments comparing reaction selectivity with and without CO2 purging. These findings are understood with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing that single-atom nickel (Ni) dispersed on gold (Au) is active for the direct reduction of carbamate, producing CH4 as the primary product. This is the first example of direct electrochemical conversion of carbamate to CH4, and the mechanism of this process provides new insight on the potential for integrated capture and conversion of CO2 directly to hydrocarbons.

Abstract Defect-engineered and even amorphous two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently gained interest due to properties that differ from their pristine counterparts. Since these properties are highly sensitive to the exact atomic structure, it is crucial to be able to characterize them at atomic resolution over large areas. This is only possible when the imaging process is automated to reduce the time spent on manual imaging, which at the same time reduces the observer bias in selecting the imaged areas. Since the necessary datasets include at least hundreds if not thousands of images, the analysis process similarly needs to be automated. Here, we introduce disorder into graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using low-energy argon ion irradiation, and characterize the resulting disordered structures using automated scanning transmission electron microscopy annular dark field imaging combined with convolutional neural network-based analysis techniques. We show that disorder manifests in these materials in a markedly different way, where graphene accommodates vacancy-type defects by transforming hexagonal carbon rings into other polygonal shapes, whereas in hBN the disorder is observed simply as vacant lattice sites with very little rearrangement of the remaining atoms. Correspondingly, in the case of graphene, the highest introduced disorder leads to an amorphous membrane, whereas in hBN, the highly defective lattice contains a large number of vacancies and small pores with no indication of amorphisation. Overall, our study demonstrates that combining automated imaging and image analysis is a powerful way to characterize the structure of disordered and amorphous 2D materials, while also illustrating some of the remaining shortcomings with this methodology.
