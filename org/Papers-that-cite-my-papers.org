Harnessing intrinsic properties to modulate the electronic structure of two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for clean energy conversion, but challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning intrinsic dipole is an effective strategy to enhance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of 2D Janus MXenes, which is exemplified by Mo2C_XY (X/Y = O, F, S, H, OH), using density functional theory calculations. Particularly, Mo2C_OF exhibits four intrinsic dipoles (μS↑, μM↑, μL↑, and μ↓), each characterized by distinct magnitudes and/or directions originated from the Mo3+ displacement and its phase change. We propose a single-atom dipole moment to elucidate the underlying mechanism controlling the variation of intrinsic dipole moments in Janus monolayer MXenes. It is found that intrinsic dipole significantly influences the HER activity. Specifically, the adsorption energy of H is reduced when the dipole direction points toward the adsorbed intermediate. Among them, Mo2C_OOH has the Gibbs free energy of −0.04 eV, surpassing the catalytic performance of commercial Pt. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intrinsic dipoles can be tuned via external strain or electronic doping, providing a pathway for optimizing catalytic performance.

ABSTRACT This study presents an automated framework for discovering Diarylethene derivatives with specific HOMO‐LUMO bandgaps by integrating first‐principles calculations with evolutionary optimization algorithms. We develop a protocol for performing automatic, parallel Density Functional Theory calculations using Turbomole, enabled by the Atomic Simulation Environment Python wrapper. This integration allows for fully autonomous evolutionary searches, removing the need for human intervention. To evaluate our platform, we conduct searches within the chemical space of Diarylethene using two optimization strategies: A “local” strategy, which explores local neighborhoods, and a “glocal” strategy, which combines local exploration with memory of past achievements.

Abstract Designing high‐performance catalysts based on supported metal atoms and nanoparticles necessitates rigorous assembly control, which affects reactivity. Yet, attaining synthesis precision to discern catalyst speciation and properties remains challenging. This limitation is tackled by pioneering an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology that combines a decision tree classifier and a random forest regressor sequentially to elucidate synthesis‐structure‐property‐function relationships in nanostructured catalysts, exemplified for the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. The decision tree accurately predicts the formation of single atoms versus nanoparticles for 37 metals anchored on nitrogen‐doped carbon, identifying the metal's standard reduction potential and cohesive energy as determinants of speciation. The random forest regressor correlates the electrocatalytic performance of synthesized single‐atom catalysts (SACs) to intrinsic properties, revealing a volcano‐like relationship of current density with the electronegativity of the active site and metal‐support interaction, providing insights beyond traditional adsorption energy descriptors. The integrated models are validated experimentally with an overall accuracy of over 80%, establishing user confidence. This XAI framework, adaptable to diverse synthetic protocols and material classes is a powerful tool to understand synthesis‐structure‐property‐function relationships and promote data‐informed experiments with reduced characterization efforts.

Abstract High‐loaded Pt intermetallic compounds (IMCs) present the practical application potential in low‐Pt PEM fuel cells while ordering transformation under high temperature inevitably leads to severe sintering of high‐density IMC nanoparticles (NPs), thus the decayed oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Herein, an entropy‐increase assisted anti‐sintering concept is proposed to fundamentally reduce the surface energy of NPs by increasing the mixing entropy, thus hindering the migration and coalescence of NPs. Ex/in situ electron microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) corroborate that the higher the entropy of pristine NPs, the lower the surface energy, the smaller the average size, and the more uniform distribution after annealing. The prepared Pt high‐entropy IMC (Pt‐HEI@Pt/C) demonstrates high metal loading (40.53 wt.%) and small particle size (≈3.15 nm), which endow it with an excellent ORR activity with mass activity (MA@0.9V, 0.65 A mg −1 Pt ) and durability over 20k potential‐cycling. Membrane electrode assembly integrated with this catalyst delivers a peak power density of 0.96 W cm −2 and an exceptional stability (12.5% decline in MA) under H2‐air condition at 0.1 mg Pt cm −2 . DFT reveals the reinforced strain regulation effect of the HEI core on the Pt shell, which optimizes the *OOH adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of Pt dissolution, thus simultaneously enhancing the intrinsic ORR activity and durability.

Tuning the surface strain is a powerful strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of metal nanocatalysts, yet an atomically precise catalyst with intramolecular strain to unlock the atomic-level strain-structure-activity relationship is still highly desired. Herein, we report the synthesis, structural anatomy, and catalytic performance toward cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis of an atomically precise Ag16Cu18(C≡C-C6H11)24 (Ag16Cu18) nanocluster, which has a Cu6 ring in the center. The Cu-Cu distance in the Cu6 ring is only 1.616 Å in a single crystal, the shortest Cu-Cu bond in Cu nanomaterials to date. Furthermore, once Ag16Cu18 was loaded onto carbon paper, the ultrashort Cu-Cu bond elongated to ∼2.40 Å, still showing strong intramolecular compressive strain. Ag16Cu18 exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward oxime electrosynthesis, manifested by a maximal Faradaic efficiency, yield, and yield rate of cyclohexanone oxime reaching 47.4%, 95.4%, and 2.66 mmol·h-1·cm-2 at -0.35 V, respectively. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy revealed that the Cu sites adjacent to the Ag atoms primarily reduce NO and stabilize it at the *NH2OH stage, while the Cu sites with compressive strain provide H* for NO reduction and adsorb cyclohexanone to react with *NH2OH, forming cyclohexanone oxime simultaneously. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the presence of compressive strain in the Cu6 ring, which facilitates H* formation and cyclohexanone adsorption, hence significantly contributing to oxime generation. This study not only reports a case of atomically precise clusters with intramolecular compressive strain but also provides an atomic-level understanding for employing bimetallic nanocluster-based catalysts toward the electrosynthesis of valuable organic molecules.

TrIP2 is an advanced version of the transformer interatomic potential (TrIP) trained on the expanded ANI-2x data set, including more diverse molecular configurations with sulfur, fluorine, and chlorine. It leverages the equivariant SE(3)-transformer architecture, incorporating physical biases and continuous atomic representations. TrIP was introduced as a highly promising transferable interatomic potential, which we show here to generalize to new atom types with no alterations to the underlying model design. Benchmarking on COMP6 energy and force calculations, structure minimization tasks, torsion drives, and applications to molecules with unexpected conformational energy minima demonstrates TrIP2's high accuracy and transferability. Direct architectural comparisons demonstrate superior performance against ANI-2x, while holistic model evaluations─including training data and level-of-theory considerations─show comparative performance with state-of-the-art models like AIMNet2 and MACE-OFF23. Notably, TrIP2 achieves state-of-the-art force prediction performance on the COMP6 benchmarks and closely approaches DFT-optimized structures in torsion drives and geometry optimization tasks. Without requiring any architectural modifications, TrIP2 successfully capitalizes on additional training data to deliver enhanced generalizability and precision, establishing itself as a robust and scalable framework capable of accommodating future expansions or applications to new domains with minimal reengineering.

Low-cost ruthenium-based catalysts with high activity have emerged as promising alternatives to iridium-based counterparts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but the poor stability under high current density remains as a key challenge. Here, we utilize the synergistic complementary strategy of introducing earth-abundant Mn and Nb dopants in ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) for Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 nanoparticle electrocatalyst that exhibits a low overpotential of 209 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and good stability of > 400 h at 0.2 A cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Significantly, a PEMWE device fabricated with Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 anode can operate continuously at least for 1000 h at 0.5 A cm-2 with 59 μV h-1 decay rate. Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis, differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy measurements, X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that OER reaction on Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 primarily follows the adsorbate evolution mechanism with much favorable energy barrier accompanied by a locally passivated lattice oxygen mechanism (AEM-LPLOM) and the co-existed Nb and Mn in RuO2 crystal lattice could not only stabilize the lattice oxygen, but also relieve the valence state fluctuation of Ru site to stabilize the catalyst during the reaction.

Abstract. When simulating new particle formation rates, collisions in the system are approximated as hard spheres without long-range interactions. This simplification may lead to an underestimation of the actual formation rate. In this study, we employ semi-empirical molecular dynamics (SEMD) at the GFN1-xTB level of theory to probe the sticking process of the monomers sulfuric acid (SA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), nitric acid (NA), formic acid (FA), ammonia (AM), methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), and trimethylamine (TMA) onto freshly nucleated particles (FNPs). The FNPs considered are (SA)10(AM)10, (SA)10(MA)10, (SA)10(DMA)10, and (SA)10(TMA)10. In general, we find that the hard-sphere kinetic approximation, which neglects long-range interactions, significantly underestimates the number of collisions leading to sticking. By calculating the sticking coefficient from SEMD simulations, we obtain enhancement factors of 2.3 and 1.5 for the SA + (SA)10(AM)10 and AM + (SA)10(AM)10 collisions, respectively. A comparison with OPLS (optimized potentials for liquid simulations) all-atom force field simulations shows similar enhancement factors of 2.4 and 1.6 for the SA + (SA)10(AM)10 and AM + (SA)10(AM)10 collisions, respectively. Compared to the force field simulations, SEMD exhibits a more isotropic sticking behavior, with the probability remaining near unity for small offsets before rapidly dropping to 0 % beyond a certain offset. In contrast, the force field simulations show a more gradual decline in sticking probability due to certain orientations still leading to sticking. The largest discrepancy between the two methods occurs at lower collision velocities – below 200 m s−1 for SA and below 400 m s−1 for AM – where force field simulations, even for head-on collisions, predict low or zero sticking probability. This has previously been attributed to periodic repulsions between the rotating collision partners caused by fluctuations in their charge distributions. In contrast, SEMD simulations do not exhibit this behavior. Since these low velocities are not significantly populated in our simulations, both methods yield similar enhancement factors. However, for systems with larger effective masses, where such velocities are more prevalent, we would expect the two methods to diverge.

Abstract The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for energy conversion technologies like fuel cells and metal–air batteries. However, advancing efficient and stable ORR catalysts remains a significant challenge. Iron‐based single‐atom catalysts (Fe SACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to precious metals. However, their catalytic performance and stability remain constrained. Introducing a second metal (M) to construct Fe─M dual‐atom catalysts (Fe─M DACs) is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of Fe SACs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in Fe‐based DACs for ORR. It begins by examining the structural advantages of Fe─M DACs from the perspectives of electronic structure and reaction pathways. Next, the precise synthetic strategies for DACs are discussed, and the structure–performance relationships are explored, highlighting the role of the second metal in improving catalytic activity and stability. The review also covers in situ characterization techniques for real‐time observation of catalytic dynamics and reaction intermediates. Finally, future directions for Fe─M DACs are proposed, emphasizing the integration of advanced experimental strategies with theoretical simulations as well as artificial intelligence/machine learning to design highly active and stable ORR catalysts, aiming to expand the application of Fe─M DACs in energy conversion and storage technologies.

The cobalt crystalline islands (Cocryst) were electrochemically deposited onto a glassy carbon (GC) support and then modified by a facile spontaneous deposition of platinum. The electrocatalytic activity of the resulting Cocryst-Pt core-shell catalyst was evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline medium. The XRD characterization of the Cocryst-Pt islands revealed that the cobalt core had a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystalline structure, and that the platinum shell exhibited a crystalline structure with a preferential (111) orientation. SEM images showed that the average lateral size of the Cocryst islands was 1.17 μm, which increased to 1.32 μm after adding platinum. The XPS analysis indicated that the outer layer of the bulk metallic Cocryst islands was fully oxidized. During the spontaneous deposition of platinum, the outer Co(OH)2 layer was dissolved, leaving the cobalt core in a metallic state, while the platinum shell remained only partially oxidized. The high electrochemically active surface area of the Cocryst-Pt/GC electrode, along with a suitable crystalline structure of the Cocryst-Pt islands, contributes to enhancing its ORR activity by providing a greater number of surface active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent reduction. The ORR on the Cocryst-Pt catalyst occurs via a four-electron reaction pathway, with onset and half-wave potentials of 1.07 V and 0.87 V, respectively, which exceed those of polycrystalline platinum and a commercial benchmark Pt/C.

Abstract The electrocatalytic two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) presents an environmentally sustainable approach to produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Heterostructures coupling non‐noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) with carbon materials hold promise for 2e − ORR, but face challenges in controlling morphology, phase composition, and active centers. In this study, a hierarchically porous tremella‐like heterojunction characterized by ultrafine cubic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles within the amorphous carbon (UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC) is obtained using the integrated platform of green Fe‐based deep eutectic solvent via a two‐step annealing process. UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC exhibits remarkable overall and intrinsic 2e − ORR activity, delivering 96% H 2 O 2 selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 67.5 s −1 . Notably, UFe 3 O 4 @HPAC possesses superior H 2 O 2 production capabilities, showing long‐term stability of 100 h with a H 2 O 2 production rate of 8.1 g L −1 h −1 in flow‐cell, while achieving various medical‐grade H 2 O 2 concentrations (3.0–7.8 wt%). Additionally, integrating on‐site H 2 O 2 production with electro‐Fenton achieved rapid decomposition of contaminants. The unique heterostructure, with the synergistic effect of Fe 3 O 4 and amorphous carbon, enhances electronic conductivity. Moreover, the electronic redistribution at the interface of the heterostructure triggers the thermodynamically favorable multiple active sites of Fe and C centers for the 2e − ORR. This work offers a new perspective on transition metal‐based materials for H 2 O 2 production.

Kinetic energetics of water dissociation and hydroxyl (de)stabilization are vital to surface coverage of reactive *H and surface charge for *OH reductive desorption. electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of DMPO‐H and DMPO‐OH unravel radical nature of water‐dissociated *H and *OH. coherent synergism of interfacial ensemble and electronic effects realizes TOF/η−ɛ d volcano as the net result of work‐function‐directed competition between interfacial water dissociation (covalent control) and *OH reductive desorption (ionic control) kinetics, manifesting that alkaline HER volcano shaped by d‐band descriptor originates from intricate balance guided by work function descriptor. Orchestrated with alkali metal cations on fine‐tuning covalent/ionic interaction between catalyst surface and water‐derived intermediates, microrod‐array N–MoCoNiAl/NF electrode (NF═Ni foam) drives 10 mA cm −2 at overpotential of 10 mV in 1 m KOH. The proposed pathway may provide insight into how the peculiar electronic structure of multi‐site heterojunction and the interfacial hard‐soft covalent/electrostatic interactions impact molecular‐level mechanism for efficient Volmer kinetics.

Abstract Ferroelectric materials exhibit inherent polarization characteristics that render them viable options for improving photocatalytic performance via efficient charge carrier separation. Nonetheless, the majority of two dimensional (2D) materials exhibit an absence of ferroelectric properties owing to their elevated symmetry, which presents obstacles for their utilization in photocatalysis. This study presents two novel strategies for inducing ferroelectricity in 2D materials: intralayer polarization, accomplished by substituting phosphorus atoms in black phosphorus (BP) with elements like nitrogen (N), arsenic (As), or antimony (Sb); and interlayer polarization, realized through a controlled heterostructure design. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that these tailored materials demonstrate markedly diminished overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), with values as low as 1.04 and 1.12 eV, respectively. The materials exhibit competitive Gibbs free energy profiles for the hydrogen evolution process (HER), highlighting their adaptability. The findings provide a framework for utilizing intralayer and interlayer engineering to improve the ferroelectric characteristics of 2D materials, facilitating advanced applications in photocatalysis and renewable energy conversion.

As predicted by the Hume-Rothery rules, forming solid solutions of rutile IrO2 with other metal oxides that have different crystal structures is thermodynamically challenging. Consequently, achieving high solubility of foreign elements in Ir-based solid-solution oxides has been significantly limited. We demonstrate that hexagonal-perovskite BaIrO3 can serve as a flexible matrix oxide capable of incorporating a wide spectrum of (post)transition-metal cations with different electronic structures, ranging from d0 to d10 configurations. Among 12 cation solutes, Ta5+, Nb5+, and Zr4+ are found to be stable without substantial leaching during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic condition. Acceptor-type trivalent cations, including Sc3+, In3+, and Fe3+, are identified to leach out gradually from the particle surface while enhancing the OER catalytic activity. Both X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently show that the robust face-sharing [IrO6] octahedral framework of the solid solutions remains unperturbed unless electrochemical leaching rapidly occurs. As a result, notably high S-numbers, on the order of 106, are achievable at pH = 1. Although our work focuses on single-element incorporation, it is suggested that the solid-solution methodology is an effective strategy for developing stable, long-lasting OER catalysts with further reduced Ir usage for acidic water oxidation.

High-valent iron oxido species, central to many enzymatic and biomimetic catalyzed organic oxidative transformations, can be generated by direct electrochemical oxidation, circumventing high-energy O atom donor reagents. Electrochemical generation necessitates knowledge of the redox potentials involved, which is hindered by the lack of well-defined Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox waves in the voltammetry of many iron-based catalysts. Hence, other approaches including chemical oxidation and bulk spectro(electro)chemical methods need to be taken. In the case of the well-studied oxidation catalyst, [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+, where N4Py is 1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine, estimates of the Fe(III/IV) redox potentials range from 0.4 to 1.3 V vs SCE. Here, we show that electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy reveals "hidden" redox waves, and hence redox potentials, when coupled with cyclic voltammetry. Rapid spectral acquisition (>2 Hz) of surface-enhanced Raman spectra at electrochemically roughened gold electrodes enables real-time spectral acquisition during cyclic voltammetry. We show that the Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox potential of [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+ is close to that determined earlier by chemical redox titrations (0.85 V vs SCE). Furthermore, comproportionation and adsorption processes are shown to impact the rates of electron transfer observed, which rationalizes the absence of a distinct Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox wave in its cyclic voltammetry.
