Seamless management of atomistic data sets is a critical prerequisite for the successful development and deployment of machine learning potentials (MLPs). Here, we present dpdata, an open-source Python library designed to streamline every aspect of MLP data handling. Built upon a flexible, plugin-based architecture, dpdata supports reading, writing, and converting between a broad range of file formats─from popular quantum-chemistry packages and molecular-dynamics engines to specialized MLP frameworks. Users may define custom data types, formats, drivers, and minimizers, enabling effortless extension to emerging software. Key utilities include automated train-test splitting, coordinate perturbation for active learning, outlier-energy removal, Δ-learning data set generation, error-metric computation, and unit conversion. Through efficient NumPy-backed storage and system-level operations, dpdata achieves significant memory saving and inference speedups over configuration-by-configuration tools such as ASE. We also highlight practical impact, with dpdata used across published studies, for format conversion, data storage, coordinate perturbation, and utilization in other projects for data processing.

The oxygen evolution reaction, as the anodic reaction of many electrochemical devices, plays a crucial role in energy conversion. However, the insufficient stability of non-iridium-based materials during the oxygen evolution reaction has severely limited the large-scale application of such devices. Here, using a home-made operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry system, we show a temperature dependent mechanism evolution effect of RhRu3Ox in the oxygen evolution process, which highlights the role of temperature in triggering mechanism evolution. This effect enriches the strategies for pathway manipulation. Since different kinetic pathways can influence catalyst stability, this finding suggests that temperature-dependent pathway regulation may serve as an approach to optimize stability. To evaluate the potential of RhRu3Ox for practical applications, we assemble it into a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer and demonstrate its stability at room temperature for over 1000 hours at a current density of 200 mA cm−2. Density functional theory studies suggest that the existence of a kinetic barrier related to lattice oxygen activation might be the reason for the observed temperature dependent behavior of RhRu3Ox at elevated temperatures. The oxygen evolution reaction enables many clean energy technologies, but most acid-unstable catalysts still block deployment. Here the authors report a temperature dependent mechanistic evolution in RhRu3Ox that links reaction pathways to stability, enabling durable acidic water electrolysis.

An efficient electrochemical hydrogen generation catalyst composed of robust ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) was synthesized through a simple one-pot hydrothermal reaction, where formaldehyde was employed as a reductant and low-molecular-weight poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) was employed as a stabilizing agent. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were initially characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, which confirmed their hexagonal, close-packed ruthenium phase. Structural analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which disclosed PVP-stabilized nanoflowers composed of Ru NPs with an average diameter of 5 nm. Further, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed the presence of ruthenium and carbon, and their oxidation states were also studied with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-synthesized PVP-supported Ru NPs exhibited remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, with overpotentials of 51 and 39 mV at a cathodic current density of −10 mA cm–2 and corresponding Tafel slopes of 23 and 40 mV dec–1 in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Such a high performance of the PVP-protected Ru NPs was further evaluated in a continuous manner by using an electrolyzer flow cell, and our findings were supported by the corresponding density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Calculations of the Gibbs free energy for varied surface coverage on the (002) facet revealed that the individual site activity improved with an increase in surface coverage, enhancing the continuous HER performance. Besides reinforcing the exploitation of eco-friendly raw materials for nanocatalyst development, this work serves as a prelude to our upcoming systematic investigations on the influence of the molecular weight of the PVP polymer on the size of metallic nanoparticles.

Abstract The rational design of stable, earth-abundant quantum dots with tunable electronic and optical properties is crucial for advancing sustainable optoelectronic and photocatalytic technologies. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is employed to investigate pristine and 3d transition-metal (TM)-doped armchair hexagonal silicon carbide quantum dots (AH-SiC-QDs, Si₅₇C₅₇H₃₀). Structural analysis reveals that pristine AH-SiC-QDs exhibit high stability (5.612 eV), surpassing previously reported SiC- and AlN-based QDs. Upon TM incorporation, stability remains robust, with Ni-doping providing the strongest binding and Sc-doping the weakest. Electronic structure calculations show significant dopant-induced modifications in HOMO–LUMO distributions and bandgaps, where Ti- and Sc-doped systems achieve remarkable bandgap narrowing (1.056 and 0.919 eV), enhancing electronic coupling with the host lattice. Optical absorption studies demonstrate pronounced red-shifts into the visible and near-infrared regions, with Sc- and V-doped systems offering extended light-harvesting potential. Mulliken charge and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses confirm strong donor–acceptor interactions, orbital rehybridization, and enhanced charge transfer, directly linking dopant chemistry to improved catalytic and optoelectronic behavior. These findings establish TM-doped AH-SiC-QDs as versatile and highly tunable platforms for next-generation photocatalysis and energy conversion applications.

Current strategies for stabilizing 2D borophene sheets and compensating for boron's electron deficiency primarily rely on transition metals, many of which are heavy and costly, thereby limiting their practical applications. In contrast, the use of light‐metal elements to stabilize borophene has remained largely unexplored. This work demonstrates that the light‐metal beryllium (Be) can effectively stabilize 2D boron sheets. Through swarm‐intelligence structural searches combined with first‐principles calculations, three stable monolayers of beryllium tetraboride (BeB 4 )—the α‐, β‐, and γ‐phases—are predicted. The α‐BeB 4 phase is metallic, while β‐ and γ‐BeB 4 are indirect semiconductors with bandgaps of 0.39 and 1.65 eV, respectively. Notably, biaxial strain can reversibly tune β‐BeB 4 between semiconducting and metallic states. Furthermore, γ‐BeB 4 exhibits a high visible‐light absorption coefficient (3.80 × 10 5 cm − 1 ) and an out‐of‐plane negative Poisson's ratio, indicating auxetic behavior. Remarkably, α‐BeB 4 demonstrates a near‐zero Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption, suggesting excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. These unique properties position BeB 4 monolayers as promising, lightweight, and cost‐effective candidates for next‐generation energy conversion and optoelectronic applications.

Abstract The efficient development of electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has been greatly challenging due to the high stability of the N≡N bond and the competitive interference from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work innovatively designs a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (g‐C 16 N 19 ) with a super‐large pore structure based on the self‐doping strategy and first‐principles calculations, and constructs TM@g‐C 16 N 19 (TM = Ti ∼ Au) single‐atom catalyst systems. By establishing a “Four‐Step” screening model, it is found that W@g‐C 16 N 19 exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance, with an ultralow limiting potential (U L ) of ‐0.23 V. Combining electron structure analyses such as charge density difference, ICOHP value, Bader charge, and spin magnetic moment, the micro‐mechanism of W@g‐C 16 N 19 effectively activating the σ/π bonds of N 2 molecules through strong d‐p orbital hybridization is revealed. Furthermore, based on the pH‐ and potential‐dependent adsorption‐free energy results calculated by the constant potential model, pH‐potential coupling analysis shows that the configuration has a decisive influence on activity: the E‐I/S‐V mode dominates in alkaline media, while the E‐O/S‐O pathway is predominant under acidic conditions. In the E‐I configuration, the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (PDS) of NRR decreases with the decrease of the electrode potential; conversely, the energy barrier of the PDS of NRR in the E‐O/S‐V/S‐O configuration increases with the decrease of the electrode potential.

Abstract Accurately identifying and enhancing catalytic activity in metal‐free, carbon‐based electrocatalysts remains a fundamental challenge, largely due to the difficulty of concurrently optimizing hydrophilicity and oxygen affinity at active sites. Herein, a hydrogen‐bonding‐driven strategy is presented to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). By integrating hydrazone linkages with alkoxy‐functionalized pore walls, a hydrophilic skeleton capable of forming tunable intramolecular hydrogen‐bonding networks is constructed. These interactions induce asymmetric electron distributions that enhance the simultaneous adsorption of water and oxygen molecules. Consequently, the hydrazone‐linked COFs exhibit a half‐wave potential of 0.78 V, outperforming all previously reported metal‐free COF‐based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the improved activity originates from favorable * OOH and * OH adsorption energies at hydrogen‐bonding centers, along with stabilized O 2 /H 2 O binding. This synergistic modulation of the local microenvironment—through hydrogen bonding and electronic structure engineering—affords enhanced activity, selectivity, and long‐term durability. This work offers a rational design paradigm for advancing metal‐free COF electrocatalysts toward sustainable energy conversion.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are widely used in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR) due to their distinctive electronic configuration and coordination environment. However, designing catalysts with porous structures that provide more active sites is a challenge in practice. Herein, we utilized the porous network structure of melamine foam (MF) and high temperature calcination to increase the number of nickel atoms to promote the formation of Ni-N<sub>x</sub> active sites, resulting in nitrogen-coordinated nickel SACs with high catalytic activity. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test demonstrates that the optimal calcination temperature of 900 °C can achieve a Ni-N<sub>x</sub> site content of 9.47 at.%, which is significantly higher than that of other temperature conditions. This confirms that the calcination temperature has a decisive regulatory effect on the nitrogen-doped configuration and the formation of active sites. Furthermore, MF facilitated efficient electron transfer, resulting in improved catalytic performance. The Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE<sub>CO</sub>) could reach 91% at -0.66 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ Infrared Spectroscopy for real-time monitoring has demonstrated a linear relationship between Ni-N<sub>x</sub> and the reaction intermediate <sup>*</sup>CO content, indicating that an elevated Ni-N<sub>x</sub> content may facilitate the generation of more active sites and expedite the kinetic process of CO<sub>2</sub>RR. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni-N<sub>2</sub> coordination in the Ni-N<sub>x</sub> surface is responsible for the superior catalytic activity of CO<sub>2</sub>RR due to the moderate adsorption strength of <sup>*</sup>COOH with less negative U<sub>L</sub> (-0.87 V). This experiment provides an innovative way to increase the active site content of SACs in CO<sub>2</sub>RR.

The processes that determine the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on metal surfaces remain a topic of discussion despite their long-standing importance in improving the efficiency of hydrogen generation. A major cause of this uncertainty is the extreme heterogeneity of the environment at the water–metal interface, which complicates the construction of simple models. To make progress, computationally efficient modeling methods need to be developed to handle the intricate nature of the water interface. In this paper, we use an implicit electrolyte approach suitable for ab initio dynamics, which allows the surface chemistry to be explicitly modeled with density functional theory while approximating the electrolyte with a continuum method. This approach incorporates ionic screening in the electrolyte via a Poisson–Boltzmann model, enabling the modeling of charged electrochemical interfaces in a dynamic, fluctuating environment. Our results qualitatively reveal a new factor that is likely important in understanding the HER: the location and structure of the interface where hydrogen is generated differ from where protons are exchanged between the water and metal. In particular, hydrogen is generated in regions where the water density is low (i.e., where the water film has dewetted from the substrate), while the adatom–water exchange reaction occurs in regions of high water density. Thus, the diffusion of hydrogen between these regions needs to be considered in the overall kinetics and may be a rate-limiting step.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on axial modification have received much attention with respect to the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Revealing the action mechanism of ligands and, at the same time, constructing the interaction relationship between ligands and the structure and activity of catalysts can provide important guidance for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2RR. In this paper, the mechanism of the reduction of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH) on 19 transition metal-coordinated nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N4-C) and axial F atom modified M-N4-C (M-N4F-C) was studied through density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the influence of axial F atoms on M-N4F-C catalytic activity was further revealed. The electrocatalytic reduction activity of M-N4-C SACs toward CO2 depends strongly on the outermost d-shell electron number and electronegativity of the selected metal. The incorporation of axial atoms alters the coordination structure and charge distribution of the central metal atoms, which not only enhances the stability (especially the electrochemical stability) of the M-N4F-C SACs but also modulates the adsorption strength of the intermediate species, thereby either increasing or decreasing the catalytic activity. The catalytic activity is determined by the intrinsic properties of the ligands and metal atoms. Four SACs (Mn-N4-C, Zn-N4-C, Co-N4F-C, and Ru-N4F-C) that can be utilized for the CO2RR are used in the experiments, exhibiting remarkable catalytic activity and stability. Importantly, the electronegativity of the ligands (ηACL), the number of lone pairs of electrons in the ligand (m), and the electronegativity of the central metal atom (ηM) are proposed as key factors to describe the interaction relationship between the ligand and the metal center. Based on these parameters, a ligand interaction strength (λ) is introduced to quantitatively evaluate this interaction. Furthermore, several ligands with different λ values (CN < F < O < N) were employed for axial modification, demonstrating that λ can effectively elucidate the influence of ligands on the geometric and electronic structures of SACs. By correlating λ with the adsorption energy of critical intermediate *OCHO, V-N4CN-C, Cr-N4CN-C, and Mo-N4CN-C were identified as promising electrocatalysts for the CO2RR. Our study provides useful guidance for understanding the influence of axial ligands on the electrocatalytic CO2RR and for designing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts.

Combining the numerous advantages of copper foil and borophene, the electrochemical performance of copper foil-supported borophene loaded with 4d transition-metal single-atom catalysts (CF@α-B_TM) in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated using density functional theory (DFT). We systematically analyze the CF@α-B_TM catalyst stability, electronic properties, and catalytic activity in the hydrogen-oxygen electrode reaction. In the oxygen electrode reaction, as the atomic number of the loaded metal atoms increases, the adsorption energy of intermediates on CF@α-B-TM gradually increases, while the adsorption ability gradually decreases. Afterward, it was calculated that the OH-modified CF@α-B_Rh_OH exhibited excellent ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic activities with ORR and OER overpotentials of 0.35 and 0.47 V. In the hydrogen electrode reaction, CF@α-B_Mo exhibited high HER catalytic activities with overpotentials of 0.05 V.

Abstract The kinetics of sulfur catalytic reactions serve as a fundamental cornerstone for maximizing both the capacity and stability of lithium‐sulfur batteries (LSBs). Recently, investigations into Li‐S catalysts predominantly center around the optimization of energy levels to bolster adsorption and catalytic conversion processes. However, a significant oversight persists, as the profound influence of electron spin states on charge transfer dynamics and orbital interactions is frequently neglected. Herein, NH 4 MnF 3 is synthesized as a sulfur host due to the strongly polarized Mn‐F bonds, which generate a stronger ligand field and endow it with remarkable electrochemical activity. By capitalizing on the electric field‐induced effect exerted by adjacent Co atoms, the crystal structure of NH 4 MnF 3 is optimized, successfully inducing spin‐orbit splitting at the Mn centers. This achievement significantly enhances the overlap with the p z orbitals of polysulfides, effectively expediting the kinetic processes of sulfur redox reactions within LSBs. Notably, the Co‐NH 4 MnF 3 demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance. Specifically, at a high rate of 2 C, it retains a remarkable specific capacity of 686 mAh g −1 even after 1000 cycles. This work unveils the pivotal role played by the electron spin states of active centers in sulfur catalytic conversion.

A design strategy of metal-boron (M-B) hybrid dual-atom catalysts (HDACs) anchored on g-C2N (M-B@C2N) and a mechanism of protonated N≡N bond breaking promoting C-N coupling has been proposed for electrocatalytic reduction of N2 to urea with CO (NCR). Using density functional theory calculations, the stability, activity, and selectivity of 13 M-B@C2N HDACs are systematically evaluated. V-B@C2N has been screened as an excellent HDAC using a four-step screening strategy. N2 can be adsorbed on V and B atoms of V-B@C2N with a side-on configuration, and it can be activated by reversible dynamic evolution of the interatomic distance between the V and B atoms and by charge transport differences between the two N atoms and V-B sites. The inert N≡N bond is gradually weakened by two successive protonation steps until broken to form 2*NH with a kinetic energy barrier of 0.72 eV, further promoting two-step C-N coupling of 2*NH and *CO coadsorbed on V-B sites to form *NHCONH with kinetic energy barriers of 0.08 and 0.03 eV. V-B@C2N not only exhibits excellent activity and selectivity for urea electrosynthesis with a limiting potential of only -0.44 V but also suppresses the competitive N2 reduction (NRR) and hydrogen evolution reactions.

Catalysis is inherently complex. The lack of precise knowledge available to experimental researchers about the microenvironment, catalytic sites, mechanisms, and changes that occur under reaction conditions has hindered the effectiveness of deep-learning artificial intelligence algorithms to predict catalyst behavior under reaction conditions. Given the type and quality of data available in the scientific literature, there are still open questions on how machine learning can be used by experimentalists working in the field of catalysis to accelerate catalyst design. Here, we present a framework that leverages large language models to extract textual data from known and trusted sources to automatically generate large, but relatively low-fidelity, experimental catalysis data sets across many research groups. We also show that instead of using deep-learning models, which require high-quality data, shallow learning models with posthoc interpretability can extract valuable information about experimental catalytic systems from these low-fidelity data sets. The innovation of this work lies not in the model development but in the prompt engineering, data encoding, and question architectures employed to extract meaningful information. We applied this framework to two different model reactions: the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide and the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. We showcase that this framework has the ability to uncover known and established facts within the catalysis community, such as the catalytic properties of Cu, as well as novel insights, including the critical role of voltages above a certain threshold in producing multicarbon products from CO2. We anticipate that this proposed framework will serve as an entryway for experimental catalytic researchers to utilize machine learning to rapidly process literature, generate novel hypotheses, and design experiments to accelerate catalyst development.

The energy difference between two iso-electronic systems can be approximated by the first order Hellmann–Feynman derivative with respect to the linear alchemical coupling parameter, evaluated using the electron density of the corresponding averaged Hamiltonian. This approximation is exact up to third order because even-order contributions cancel out. This finding holds for any iso-electronic compound pair (dubbed “alchemical diastereomers”), regardless of differences in configuration, composition, or energy, and consequently, relative energy estimates for all possible iso-electronic alchemical diastereomer pairs require only O(1) self-consistent field cycles for any given averaging reference Hamiltonian. We discuss the relation to the Verlet algorithm, alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) [Krug et al., J. Chem. Phys. 162, 044101 (2025)], relative properties such as forces, ionization potential or electron affinities, and Levy’s formula for relative energies among iso-electronic systems that uses the averaged electron density of the two systems [Levy, J. Chem. Phys. 70, 1573 (1979)]. Density functional theory based estimates accurately reflect trends in the charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomic molecule series with 14 protons (N2, CO, BF, BeNe, LiNa, HeMg, HAl), with systematically increasing errors. Using alchemical Hellmann–Feynman derivatives for toluene, we demonstrate the concept’s broader applicability by estimating relative energies for all 36 possible alchemical diastereomer pairs from vertical iso-electronic charge-neutral antisymmetric BN doping of toluene’s aromatic ring, with mean absolute errors of a few milli-Hartrees.
