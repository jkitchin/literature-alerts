Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) can be very effective for catalyzing both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we present theoretical evidence of a new class of highly active DACs, namely, the double-atom embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene sheet 2M-N-C (M = Mn, Fe) on the basis of density functional theory calculations. Importantly, we find that the double active sites of 2M-N-C DACs entail an unconventional catalytic reaction pathway for ORR and OER. We also show that the local coordination environment of the active sites can significantly affect the stability and oxygen catalytic activity of 2M-N-C DACs. In particular, MnFe-N-C DAC not only exhibits good stability but also possesses outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic activity with the potential difference (Δ

In this study, deuterium boride (DB) nanosheets were synthesized as deuterated borophane through the ion exchange of magnesium cations in magnesium diboride with deuterons from a deuterium-type ion-exchange resin in acetonitrile. The Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectrum of DB exhibited clear isotope effects, namely the shift in the absorption peak of the B-H stretching vibrational mode to a lower wavenumber. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) from a mixture of DB and hydrogen boride (HB) nanosheets yielded a more intense hydrogen-deuterium (HD) signal compared to the H

Abstract Electro‐valorization of biomass‐derived chemicals has ensured sustainable production of value‐added products, an effective approach for reducing carbon footprint, through renewable energy. Electrochemical oxidation and reduction reactions in aqueous media using H 2 O as a potential source for active hydrogenated and oxygenated species fulfill the purpose. In this study, Ru─Co 2 P nanorods are explored as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward valorization of Organics at basic media. The in‐situ electrogenerated Co 3+ and Co 4+ species act as active oxidants toward product selectivity. An overpotential of 68 mV is found for hydrogen evolution reaction (1 m NaOH) with Ru─Co 2 P. Further, used as cathode, Ru─Co 2 P effectively reduces furfuraldehyde to furfuryl alcohol and p ‐nitrophenol to p ‐aminophenol. Ru doping enables ease of formation of active species both for reduction and oxidation, faster charge transfer between catalyst to absorbates. Density Functional Theory calculation establishes Ru incorporation in Co 2 P surface results in enhanced adsorption of substrates. Ru doping modulates the electronic structure of Co 2 P which changes the density of states resulting in faster water dissociation and water splitting. To reach 10 mA cm −2 current density only 1.6 V is required for water electrolysis, whereas 1.4 V is enough for substrate‐paired electrolysis with simultaneous oxidation of benzyl alcohol and reduction of p ‐nitro phenol.

Abstract The continuous quest of finding optimum catalysts for photo‐electrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting has been revolving around 2D ultrathin materials because of the fact of exploiting both the surface area. In this work, a threefold impact is envisaged route to enhance the activity both in terms of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the emerging Zirconium Tri‐sulfides (ZrS 3 ) based pseudo‐monolayers. Due to the unique and distinct electronic properties of the tri‐chalcogenide systems as compared to the di‐chalcogenide counterpart of Zirconium, one could afford to explore the implications of not only single‐atom functionalization and vacancy defect, but also the external strain to expedite the bifunctional catalytic activity in this promising material. Rigorous electronic structure calculations have been performed for the mentioned threefold effect on not only the band‐edge alignment, but going beyond to it by further constructing the reaction coordinate mapping corresponding to HER and OER mechanism. The repercussion of external strain in addition to the single atom functionalization and vacancy defect on the adsorption free energies of the prime intermediates of HER and OER reaction has been further correlated with the work function variation in this pseudo‐monolayer system.

Interfacial processes involving metal (oxyhydr)oxide phases are important for the mobility and bioavailability of nutrients and contaminants in soils, sediments, and water. Consequently, these processes influence ecosystem health and functioning, and have shaped the biological and environmental co-evolution of Earth over geologic time.

Abstract The demand for renewable energy sources has become more urgent due to climate change and environmental pollution. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in green energy sources. This article primarily explores the potential of using non‐noble metals, such as transition and rare earth metals, to enhance the efficiency of the OER process. Due to their cost‐effectiveness and unique electronic structure, these non‐noble metals could be a game‐changer in the field. ′Doping,′ which is the process of adding a small amount of impurity to a material to alter its properties, and ′synergistic effects,′ which refer to the combined effect of two or more elements that is greater than the sum of their individual effects, are two key concepts in this field. Transition and rare earth metals can reduce the overpotential, a measure of the excess potential required to drive a reaction, thus enhancing the OER process by engineering the electronic and surface molecular structure. This article summarizes the roles of various non‐noble metals in the OER process and highlights opportunities for researchers to propose innovative ways to optimize the OER process.

Abstract Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are excellent precursors for preparing transition metal and nitrogen co‐doped carbon catalysts, which have been widely utilized in the field of electrocatalysis since their initial development. However, the original MOFs derived catalysts have been greatly limited in their development and application due to their disadvantages such as metal atom aggregation, structural collapse, and narrow pore channels. Recently, surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts have attracted much attention from researchers due to their advantages such as hierarchical porous structure, increased specific surface area, and many exposed active sites. This review mainly focuses on the synthesis methods of surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts and comprehensively introduces the action of surfactants in MOFs derived materials and the structure‐activity relationship between the catalysts and the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Apparently, the aims of this review not only introduce the status of surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis but also contribute to the rational design and synthesis of MOFs derived catalysts for fuel cells, metal–air cells, and electrolysis of water toward hydrogen production.

Abstract Research on the production and utilization of hydrogen energy is essential to overcome the environmental issues caused by fossil fuels. Herein, we anchor PtNi nanoalloy clusters (Pt‐Ni NACs) on nitrogen‐doped graphene oxide (NrGO) by a facile microwave‐assisted synthesis and analyze the variations of catalyst properties based on the PtNi composition and the presence of nitrogen. Ni inclusion in the Pt matrix can induce lattice strain and change the electronic structure, while the doped nitrogen into the graphene can enhance electron transfer and improve the durability of the catalyst through strong chemical bonding with the alloy clusters. TEM analysis discovers that the NACs are uniformly decorated in a few‐nanometer‐size on the graphene surface, and the formation of the PtNi NACs and structural changes according to composition are confirmed through XRD and XPS. In addition, the structural changes due to N‐doping and its bonding with the NACs are observed through Raman spectroscopy and XPS. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Pt 2.6 Ni NACs/NrGO exhibits the highest ORR onset potential (0.893 V) and the lowest HER overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 (22 mV) among other catalysts, and those activities are almost unchanged under long‐term durability tests. From these results, Pt 2.6 Ni NACs/NrGO is utilized in a zinc‐air battery (ZAB) system, demonstrating better battery performance than commercial Pt and Ir‐based catalysts. Moreover, it is applied to hydrogen collection, showing linear trend in hydrogen production over time, confirming the catalyst's availability in hydrogen production and utilization. image

Abstract Molecularly‐modified electrode materials that maintain stability over a broad pH range are rare. Typically, each electrochemical transformation necessitates a specifically tuned system to achieve strong binding and high activity of the catalyst. Here, we report the functionalisation of mesoporous indium tin oxide (mITO) electrodes with the macrocyclic host molecule pillar[6]arene (PA[6]). These electrodes are stable within the pH range of 2.4–10.8 and can be equipped with electrochemically active ruthenium complexes through host–guest interactions to perform various oxidation reactions. Benzyl alcohol oxidation serves as a model reaction in acidic media, while ammonia oxidation is conducted to assess the systems performance under basic conditions. PA[6]‐modified electrodes demonstrate catalytic activity for both reactions when complexed to different guest molecules and can be reused by reabsorption of the catalyst after its degradation. Furthermore, the system can be employed to perform subsequent reactions in electrolyte with varying pH, enabling the same electrode to be utilised in multiple different electrocatalytic reactions.

Abstract Single‐atom catalysis is gaining interest also because of its potential applications in a broad spectrum of electrochemical reactions. The reactivity of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) is typically modeled with first principles approaches taking insight from heterogenous catalysis. An increasing number of studies show that the chemistry of SACs is more complex than often assumed, and shares many aspects in common with coordination chemistry. This evidence raises challenges for computational electrocatalysis of SACs. In this perspective we highlight a few fundamental ingredients that one need to consider to provide reliable predictions on the reactivity of SACs for electrochemical applications. We discuss the role of the local coordination of the metal active phase, the need to use self‐interaction corrected functionals, in particular when systems have magnetic ground states. We highlight the formation of unconventional intermediates with respect to classical metal electrodes, the need to include the stability of SACs in electrochemical conditions and the role of solvation in the analysis of new potential catalytic systems. This brief account can be considered as a tutorial underlining the importance of treating the reactivity of SACs. In fact, neglecting some of these aspects could lead to unreliable predictions failing in the design of new electrocatalysts.

Developing efficient electrocatalysts for acidic electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) holds considerable significance, while the selectivity and stability of most materials are compromised under acidic conditions. Herein, we demonstrate that constructing amorphous platinum–selenium (Pt–Se) shells on crystalline Pt cores can manipulate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway to efficiently catalyze the electrosynthesis of H2O2 in acids. The Se2‒Pt nanoparticles, with optimized shell thickness, exhibit over 95% selectivity for H2O2 production, while suppressing its decomposition. In flow cell reactor, Se2‒Pt nanoparticles maintain current density of 250 mA cm−2 for 400 h, yielding a H2O2 concentration of 113.2 g L−1 with productivity of 4160.3 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for effective organic dye degradation. The constructed amorphous Pt–Se shell leads to desirable O2 adsorption mode for increased selectivity and induces strain for optimized OOH* binding, accelerating the reaction kinetics. This selenization approach is generalizable to other noble metals for tuning 2e‒ ORR pathway. Developing efficient catalysts for acidic electrosynthesis of H2O2 is desirable, while most materials are compromised in acidic conditions. Here, the authors report that constructing amorphous Pt–Se shells on crystalline Pt cores can regulate the reaction pathway to efficiently produce H2O2 in acid.

While high-entropy alloys (HEAs) present exponentially large compositional space for alloy design, they also create enormous computational challenges to trace the compositional space, especially for the inherently expensive density functional theory calculations (DFT). Recent works have integrated machine learning into DFT to overcome these challenges. However, often these models require an intensive search of appropriate physics-based descriptors. In this paper, we employ a 3D convolutional neural network over just one descriptor, i.e., the charge density derived from DFT, to simplify and bypass the hunt for the descriptors. We show that the elastic constants of face-centered cubic multi-elemental alloys in the Ni–Cu–Au–Pd–Pt system can be predicted from charge density. In addition, using our recent PREDICT approach, we show that the model can be trained only on the charge densities of simpler binary and ternary alloys to effectively predict elastic constants in complex multi-elemental alloys, thereby further enabling easier property-tracing in the large compositional space of HEAs.

During the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) on copper catalysts, linear-bonded CO (*COL) is commonly regarded as the key intermediate for the CO-CO coupling step, which leads to the formation of multicarbon products. In this work, we unveil the significant role of bridge-bonded *CO (*COB) as an active species. By combining in situ Raman spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we show that adsorbed *OH domains displace *COL to *COB. The electroreduction of a 12CO+13CO2 cofeed demonstrates that *COB distinctly favors the production of acetate and 1-propanol, while *COL favors ethylene and ethanol formation. This work enhances our understanding of the mechanistic intricacies of eCO(2)RR and suggests new directions for designing operational conditions by modifying the competitive adsorption of surface species, thereby steering the reaction toward specific multicarbon products.

Microstructurally distorted Pt-based nanoalloys with unusual structural defects like Guinier–Preston (GP) zones with in situ coherency strain fields may be suitable for substantially improving their electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions. Herein, GP zones contributing PtCu nanoalloys were first fabricated by additive manufacturing, starting with the formation of metallic Cu clusters as orderly crystal nuclei on ZIF-8-derived carbon, followed by the additive manufacturing of chemically reduced Pt and Cu on the formed clusters in ethylene glycol at 190 °C. The atomic-scale GP zones give rise to high-level coherent strain fields across the nanocrystals, boosting the ORR kinetics. This catalyst exhibits an ultrahigh oxygen reduction half-wave potential of 0.934 V (vs RHE) and a mass activity (MA) of 0.68 A mgPt–1. After the accelerated degradation test of 50,000 cycles, the achieved MA improved instead of decreasing, rising from 0.68 to 0.89 A mgPt–1, surpassing that of commercial Pt/C significantly. The significantly improved activity is attributed to the coherency strain fields reshaping the band structure and reconstructing a favorable charge density for active Pt sites. Importantly, the interface-anchored GP zones, maintaining a completely coherent relationship with the matrix, can effectively impede metal atom migration, segregation, or leaching, thus enhancing long-term stability. Therefore, the novel GP-type alloys may pave another way for designing advanced catalysts in the realm of current energy storage and conversion fields like fuel cells.

Abstract We report the results of systematic ab initio modelling of various configurations of iron and cobalt impurities embedded in the (110), (101), and (100) surfaces of anatase TiO 2 , with and without oxygen vacancies. The simulation results demonstrate that incorporation into interstitial voids at the surface level is significantly more favourable than other configurations for both iron and cobalt. The calculations also demonstrate the crucial effect of the facet as well as the lesser effects of other factors, such as vacancies and strain on the energetics of defect incorporation, magnetic moment, bandgap, and catalytic performance. It is further shown that there is no tendency towards the segregation or clustering of impurities on the surface. The calculated free energies of the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media predict that iron impurities embedded in the (101) surface of anatase TiO 2 can be a competitive catalyst for this reaction.

Abstract The rational design and fabrication of 2D heterojuctions are proven a promising strategy for boosting the performance of electrocatalysts. Although 2D platinum diselenide (PtSe 2 ) exhibits catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the catalytic performance is still unsatisfactory due to its inert basal plane, wide bandgap, and poor electron transfer ability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to construct PtSe 2 /PtCo heterojunctions by partial selenization of PtCo alloy for high‐efficiency HER electrocatalyst, which exhibits a low overpotential of 38 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm −2 , a small Tafel slope of 22 mV dec −1 , and a superior stability over 24 h and 1000 cycles. The outstanding HER activity of the catalyst arises from the strong electronic interactions between PtSe 2 and PtCo in the heterojunctions, which induce electron transferring from PtSe 2 to PtCo and the d‐band center down shifting, and thus optimize the H * adsorption/desorption. This work provides a novel strategy for constructing highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts, which facilitates the applications of hydrogen energy conversion.
