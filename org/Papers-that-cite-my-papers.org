Developing stable and effective catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been a long-standing pursuit. In this work, we propose a series of single-atom catalysts (SACs) by importing transition-metal atoms into the carbon and vanadium vacancies of tetragonal V2C2 and V3C3 slabs, where the transition-metal atoms refer to Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. By means of first-principles computations, the possibility of applying these SACs in HER catalysis was investigated. All the SACs are conductive, which is favorable to charge transfer during HER. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔGH*) during hydrogen adsorption was adopted to assess their catalytic ability. For the V2C2-based SACs with V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Cu located at the carbon vacancy, excellent HER catalytic performance was achieved, with a |ΔGH*| smaller than 0.2 eV. Among the V3C3-based SACs, apart from the SAC with Mn located at the carbon vacancy, all the SACs can act as outstanding HER catalysts. According to the ΔGH*, these excellent V2C2- and V3C3-based SACs are comparable to the best-known Pt-based HER catalysts. However, it should be noted that the V2C2 and V3C3 slabs have not been successfully synthesized in the laboratory, leading to a pure investigation without practical application in this work.

Abstract The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO 3 RR) holds significance in both NH 3 synthesis and nitrate contamination remediation. However, achieving industrial‐scale current and high stability in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer remains challenging due to inherent high full‐cell voltage for sluggish NO 3 RR and water oxidation. Here, Cu 2 NCN with positive surface electrostatic potential V S (r) is applied as highly efficient NO 3 RR electrocatalysts to achieve industrial‐current and low‐voltage stable NH 3 production in MEA electrolyzer with coupled anodic glycerol oxidation. This paired electro‐refinery (PER) system reaches 4000 mA cm −2 at 2.52 V and remains stable at industrial‐level 1000 mA cm −2 for 100 h with the NH 3 production rate of 97000 µg NH3 h −1 cm −2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 83%. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the asymmetric and electron‐withdrawing [N−C≡N] units enhance polarization and V S (r), promoting robust and asymmetric adsorption of NO 3 * on Cu 2 NCN to facilitate O−N bond dissociation. A comprehensive techno‐economic analysis demonstrates the profitability and commercial viability of this coupled system. Our work opens a new avenue and marks a significant advancement in MEA systems for industrial NH 3 synthesis.

Abstract Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit great potential in electrocatalytic water splitting due to the unique 2D feature and an adjustable structure composed of different metal centers. In addition, LDHs have the advantage of being inherently inexpensive compared to other catalysts and have good stability in electrocatalytic water splitting. Up to now, numerous methods have been put forward to improve the activity of LDHs in electrocatalytic water splitting, a comprehensive introduction and comb to the fabrication methods and modification strategies is helpful for the followers to get a clear vein to carry out efficient manipulation to the development of high promising LDHs catalysts.

Abstract Developing efficient electrocatalysts that improve the rate‐determining step (RDS) kinetics is crucial to addressing the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study introduces ruthenium (Ru)‐cobalt(II) hydroxide (Co(OH)₂) electrocatalysts for high‐performance OER by combining compositional and thermodynamic surface engineering. Density functional theory (DFT) is employed to identify the ideal composition, with experimental validation conducted through electrodeposition, enabling facile control over a wide range of compositions for nanowire catalyst synthesis. Pourbaix diagram analysis helps establish precise synthesis conditions for developing surface nanostructures. The optimized Ru‐Co(OH)₂ catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving overpotentials of 189 mV at 10 mA cm⁻ 2 and 292 mV at 50 mA cm⁻ 2 , significantly outperforming other compositions. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to two key factors: strengthened OH adsorption energy due to optimal composition, which lowers the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step in the OER, and increased specific surface area resulting from surface nanostructure formation.

Abstract New anodic electrocatalysts with high performance and cost‐effectiveness at large current densities help advance the emerging anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) technology. To this end, a ruthenium (Ru) single atoms and sulfur (S) anions dual‐doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Ru‐S‐NiFe LDH) catalyst is reported with remarkably low alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials, high mass activities and prolonged stabilities at high current densities. Inspiringly, the AEMWE performance on Ru‐S‐NiFe LDH is also superior to the NiFe LDH. In‐depth mechanism investigations reveal that Ru single atoms not only act as the highly active sites, but also facilitate the conductivity of NiFe LDH. Meanwhile, S anions accelerate the electrochemical reconstruction of NiFe LDH to OER‐active NiFeOOH and alleviate the over‐oxidation issue on Ru active sites. Benefiting from these, Ru‐S‐NiFe LDH shows significantly enhanced OER activity and stability. Theoretical calculations further validate the decreased OER free energy difference brought about by the Ru single atoms and S anions dual‐doping. This study offers a proof‐of‐concept that the noble metal single atoms and anions dual‐doping is a feasible strategy to construct the promising 3 d transition metal‐based electrocatalysts toward the practical alkaline water electrolyzer.

High-entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles are rising as promising catalysts but face challenges in both facile synthesis and correlation of the structure with properties. Herein, utilizing the highly reductive carbon-centered isopropyl alcohol radicals generated by UV irradiation, we report a simple yet robust wet chemical method to synthesize HEA nanoparticles under ambient conditions. These isopropanol radicals verified by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy impose very large overpotentials to reduce diverse metal ions into HEA nanoparticles with five to seven different elements. Specially, the PtPdIrRhAuAgCu HEA nanoparticles on a reduced electrochemical graphene oxide (rEGO) support (PtPdIrRhAuAgCu-rEGO) demonstrate superior activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) across the entire pH range, with very small overpotentials of 11, 30, and 31 mV to deliver a current density of -10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH, 1 M phosphate buffer saline, and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The excellent HER performance of PtPdIrRhAuAgCu-rEGO surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and most contemporary HER catalysts in the literature. Density functional theory calculations using random structures mimicking the chemical disordering in PtPdIrRhAuAgCu HEA confirm its superior HER activity and imply a possible correlation between HER activity and d-band centers of the nearest atoms in a face-centered cubic hollow site.

Heteroatom-doped Fe-N-C catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives to noble metals for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their lower cost. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for their enhanced performance, particularly electrochemical stability, remain a subject of debate. This study leverages density functional theory calculations coupled with a constant potential and implicit solvent model to investigate the electrochemical stabilities and activities of pyridinic (PD-) and pyrrolic FeN4C (PL-FeN4C) catalysts. Our findings reveal that the hydrogenation susceptibility of coordinating nitrogen atoms is a critical determinant of electrochemical stability within FeN4C catalysts. Moreover, we demonstrate that oxygen and sulfur doping exerts similar effects on enhancing the overall ORR performance of PD-FeN4C catalysts: (1) by reducing the p-band center of the coordinating nitrogen, thereby improving their resistance to hydrogenation, and (2) by increasing the valence electrons of iron, leading to stronger adsorption of reaction intermediates and consequently enhanced ORR activity. Finally, our predictions suggest that O/S-doped PL-FeN4C catalysts could achieve significantly improved electrochemical stability and superior ORR performance in both acidic and alkaline environments. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of microenvironment engineering in single-atom catalysts (SACs) and offer valuable guidelines for the development of unprecedented M-N-C catalysts.

Imidazolium-based ionic liquids have led to enhanced CO2 electroreduction activity due to cation effects at the cathode surface, stabilizing the reaction intermediates and decreasing the activation energy. In aqueous media, alkali cations are also known to improve CO2 reduction activity on metals such as Ag, with the enhancement attributed to electrical double layer effects and trending with the size of the alkali cation. However, the effect of a mixed catholyte solution of alkali cations in the presence of an imidazolium-based ionic liquid has not been well-explored. Herein, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [EMIM][BF4], in water was investigated with alkali salts to unravel the interaction effects for CO2 electroreduction on Ag. Although both [EMIM]+ and alkali cations have individually improved CO2 to CO conversion on Ag in water, electrochemical results showed that alkali cations hindered imidazolium-mediated CO2 electroreduction in most conditions. Li+, in particular, was sharply inhibitory compared to other alkali cations and strongly redirected the selectivity to hydrogen evolution. The nature of the alkali cation inhibition was investigated with spectroscopic techniques, including in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS). Along with computational insights from density functional theory (DFT), the electrochemical and spectroscopic data suggest that alkali cations inhibit [EMIM]-mediated CO2 reduction by competing for surface adsorption sites, preventing the potential-dependent structural reorientation of imidazolium, and promoting hydrogen evolution by bringing solvated water to the cathode surface.

Through first-principles structure search calculations, we have identified ten hitherto unknown two-dimensional (2D) Janus-wrinkled TMTe monolayers (TM = Ni, Pd, Pt, Co, Rh, Ir, Fe, Ru, Os, and Hf) by screening 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal atoms. These monolayers exhibit high stability and metallic conductivity. Among the discovered materials, the 2D PdTe (ηOER/ORR = 0.46/0.22 V) and PtTe (ηOER/ORR = 0.46/0.32 V) monolayers can demonstrate superior bifunctional catalytic performance for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (OER/ORR), with lower overpotential than the state-of-the-art IrO2 for OER and Pt (111) for ORR, respectively. The TM- and Te-sides originating from the unique Janus configurations play a crucial role in the high OER and ORR catalytic activities, respectively. Furthermore, by stacking the monolayer structures, eight new (TMTe)2 bilayers with high stability and metallic conductivity can be achieved, which possess an internal metal layer, forming a rich electron pool. This effectively improves oxygen adsorption and activity on some bilayers, including (PdTe)2, (PtTe)2, (RhTe)2, and (IrTe)2, by transferring more electrons to the adsorbed O2 molecule, leading to considerably high ORR catalytic performance (ηORR = 0.16–0.44 V). Moreover, detailed analyses of the catalytic mechanisms have been conducted. These intriguing findings can offer new insights for designing low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts for OER and ORR reactions, with the potential to replace related noble metal catalysts used in water splitting, fuel cells, metal-air batteries, etc.

The acidic electroreduction of CO2 into multicarbon (C2+) products is much attractive for the improved carbon utilization than alkaline or neutral electroreduction. How to improve the efficiency of C2+ products generation by acidic electroreduction of CO2, is important, especially at high current density and in electrolyte with low K+ concentration. Herein, we propose a strategy of capping Cu surface with a polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) adlayer for boosting the acidic electrocatalytic CO2 conversion to C2+ products at high current densities (ampere-level) and low K+ concentration. In the electrolyte with a relatively low K+ concentration (1.0 M), the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products reaches 82.2% under a current density 1.0 A·cm−2 in acidic environment (pH=1.8). Particularly, when the current density is as high as 1.5 A·cm−2, the C2+ FE still keeps 75.8%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the presence of PIL adlayer on Cu catalyst can well inhibit H+ diffusion to catalyst surface, enrich more K+ and facilitate C-C coupling reaction. Acidic electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is a promising way for CO2 utilization, of which the selectivity and activity need improvement. Here, the authors report polymeric ionic liquid can boost the acidic electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into multicarbon products on Cu at ampere level current density.

The concept of precatalyst is widely accepted in electrochemical water splitting, but the role of precatalyst activation and the resulted changes of electrolyte composition is often overlooked. Here, we elucidate the impact of potential-dependent changes for both precatalyst and electrolyte using Co2Mo3O8 as a model system. Potential-dependent reconstruction of Co2Mo3O8 precatalyst results in an electrochemically stable Co(OH)2@Co2Mo3O8 catalyst and additional Mo dissolved as MoO42− into electrolyte. The Co(OH)2/Co2Mo3O8 interface accelerates the Volmer reaction and negative potentials induced Mo2O72− (from MoO42−) further enhances proton adsorption and H2 desorption. Leveraging these insights, the well-designed MoO42−/Mo2O72− modified Co(OH)2@Co2Mo3O8 catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 99.9% and a yield of 1.85 mol h−1 at −0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for hydrogen generation. Moreover, it maintains stable over one month at approximately 100 mA cm−2, highlighting its industrial suitability. This work underscores the significance of understanding on precatalyst reconstruction and electrolyte evolution in catalyst design. The significance of precatalyst activation and its impact on electrolyte properties in water electrocatalysis is crucial but often overlooked. The authors report an efficient transition metal catalyst for hydrogen production by manipulating both precatalyst reconstruction and electrolyte composition.

Abstract We introduce the MORE-Q dataset, a quantum-mechanical (QM) dataset encompassing the structural and electronic data of non-covalent molecular sensors formed by combining 18 mucin-derived olfactorial receptors with 102 body odor volatilome (BOV) molecules. To have a better understanding of their intra- and inter-molecular interactions, we have performed accurate QM calculations in different stages of the sensor design and, accordingly, MORE-Q splits into three subsets: i) MORE-Q-G1: QM data of 18 receptors and 102 BOV molecules, ii) MORE-Q-G2: QM data of 23,838 BOV-receptor configurations, and iii) MORE-Q-G3: QM data of 1,836 BOV-receptor-graphene systems. Each subset involves geometries optimized using GFN2-xTB with D4 dispersion correction and up to 39 physicochemical properties, including global and local properties as well as binding features, all computed at the tightly converged PBE+D3 level of theory. By addressing BOV-receptor-graphene systems from a QM perspective, MORE-Q can serve as a benchmark dataset for state-of-the-art machine learning methods developed to predict binding features. This, in turn, can provide valuable insights for developing the next-generation mucin-derived olfactory receptor sensing devices.

Lattice dynamics (LD) plays a crucial role in investigating thermal transport in terms of not only underlying physics but also novel properties and phenomena. Recently, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools in computational physics and chemistry, showing great potential in providing reliable predictions of thermal transport properties with high efficiency. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guideline for MLIPs’ development and how they are used for the computational modeling of thermal transport. Using atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as the paradigmatic potential, we introduce the essential fundamentals of MLIPs, including data construction, model training, and hyperparameter optimization. With the developed ACE potentials, we further showcase their applications in the LD modeling of thermal transport for crystalline silicon and amorphous carbon. The corresponding code implementations for MLIP applications in calculating thermal conductivity are also provided for beginners to follow.

Ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts have demonstrated promising utilization potentiality to replace the much expensive iridium (Ir)-based ones for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) due to their high electrochemical activity and low cost. However, the susceptibility of RuO2-based materials to easily be oxidized to high-valent and soluble Ru species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media hinders the practical application, especially under current density above 500 mA cm–2. Here, a manganese-doped RuO2 catalyst with the hydroxylated metal sites (i.e., H–Mn0.1Ru0.9O2) is synthesized for acidic OER assisted by hydrogen peroxide, where the hydroxylation results in the valence state of the Ru sites below +4. The H–Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 169 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and promising stability for an OER over 1000 h in an acidic electrolyte. A PEMWE device fabricated with the H–Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 catalyst as the anode shows a current density of 1 A cm–2 at ∼1.65 V, along with a low degradation over continuous tens of hours. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) results and theoretical calculations confirm that H–Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 performs the OER through the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway, where the synergistic effect of hydroxylation and Mn doping in RuO2 can effectively enhance the stability of Ru sites and lattice oxygen atoms.

Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) offer a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, however, their commercial potential is hindered by sluggish proton-involved oxygen reduction reaction (P-ORR) kinetics and inadequate durability of cathode materials. Here, a novel single-atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3-δ (BCF) perovskite, synthesized by a facile and scalable solid-state approach, as a potential cathode for PCFCs is reported. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the single-atom Ru on BCF, characterized by a unique 4-coordinate Ru-O-Fe configuration, not only induces reverse hydrogen spillover but also acts as an active site for P-ORR. The application of the optimized 2Ru-BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode in a single cell delivers an exceptional peak power density of 1.78 W cm-2 at 700 °C, along with excellent operational stability over 200 h. These findings provide new insights into single-atom engineering, advancing the commercial viability of PCFCs.

Aqueous phase heterogeneous catalysis is important to various industrial processes, including biomass conversion, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and electrocatalysis. Accurate calculation of solvation thermodynamic properties is essential for modeling the performance of catalysts for these processes. Explicit solvation methods employing multiscale modeling, e.g., involving density functional theory and molecular dynamics have emerged for this purpose. Although accurate, these methods are computationally intensive. This study introduces machine learning (ML) models to predict solvation thermodynamics for adsorbates on a Pt(111) surface, aiming to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In particular, ML models are developed using a combination of molecular descriptors and fingerprints and trained on previously published water–adsorbate interaction energies, energies of solvation, and free energies of solvation of adsorbates bound to Pt(111). These models achieve root mean square error values of 0.09 eV for interaction energies, 0.04 eV for energies of solvation, and 0.06 eV for free energies of solvation, demonstrating accuracy within the standard error of multiscale modeling. Feature importance analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and solvent density, together with the properties of the adsorbate, are critical factors influencing solvation thermodynamics. These findings suggest that ML models can provide rapid and reliable predictions of solvation properties. This approach not only reduces computational costs but also offers insights into the solvation characteristics of adsorbates at Pt(111)–water interfaces.

The uniform dispersion and loading of phthalocyanine molecular catalysts on conductive carbon substrates are crucial for exposing their active sites. The significant amount of solvent needed to achieve appropriate dispersion of phthalocyanine leads to the risk of reaggregation during solvent evaporation. Hence, a solventless strategy is adopted by many to bypass the use of a solvent. In this study, we showcase the deposition of transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules onto a self-supporting conductive carbon cloth electrode using an environmentally friendly sublimation technique for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. We meticulously investigated the preparation conditions, including the heating temperature and TMPc type, to assess their impact on the CO2 reduction activity. The as-prepared CC-CoPc-450 electrode demonstrated an outstanding comprehensive performance, showcasing a remarkable maximum CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97.1% at -0.86 V with a current density of 8.3 mA cm-2. The electrode exhibited excellent stability during the 16 h long-term eCO2RR process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the role of d-orbitals in TM-N4 and the synergy with π-conjugation electrons in facilitating the efficient electron transfer process in eCO2RR. This study offers a fresh perspective on the eco-friendly dispersion of TMPcs on conductive substrates and provides insights into the design of π-species macrocyclic electrocatalyst electrodes.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated theoretically on modified rutile(110) surfaces at density functional theory level in search for inexpensive but active catalyst materials required for water electrolysis. Ti substitution by Nb in rutile and furthermore adding adlayers of transition metal (TM) oxides, with TM =${ = }$ Ir, Ru and Rh, substantially improves titania OER activity. The catalytic activity was assessed by the overpotential of the OER which was calculated from adsorption energies of the intermediates M-O, M-OH and M-OOH. Different reaction mechanisms were suggested depending on the presence or absence of M-OOH. Materials with iridium dioxide in the top layer have similar overpotentials, both as adlayer on (doped) TiO2${{\rm{TiO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ and as pure IrO2${{\rm{IrO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ . Thus, the percentage of this expensive and scarce element can be drastically reduced without deteriorating the activity. A monolayer of RuO2${{\rm{RuO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ on rutile TiO2${{\rm{TiO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ has an even lower overpotential compared to pure RuO2${{\rm{RuO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ . In addition, RhO2${{\rm{RhO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ and RhO2${{\rm{RhO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ : Nb1/3Ti2/3O2${{\rm{Nb}}_{{\rm{1/3}}} {\rm{Ti}}_{{\rm{2/3}}} {\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}} }$ were identified as catalysts with higher OER activity than IrO2${{\rm{IrO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ .

The photovoltaic-alkaline water (PV-AW) electrolysis system offers an appealing approach for large-scale green hydrogen generation. However, current PV-AW systems suffer from low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies (e.g., <20%) at practical current densities (e.g., >100 mA cm −2 ), rendering the produced H 2 not economical. Here, we designed and developed a highly efficient PV-AW system that mainly consists of a customized, state-of-the-art AW electrolyzer and concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) receiver. The highly efficient anodic oxygen evolving catalyst, consisting of an iron oxide/nickel (oxy)hydroxide (Fe 2 O 3 -NiO x H y ) composite, enables the customized AW electrolyzer with unprecedented catalytic performance (e.g., 1 A cm −2 at 1.8 V and 0.37 kgH 2 /m −2 hour −1 at 48 kWh/kgH 2 ). Benefiting from the superior water electrolysis performance, the integrated CPV-AW electrolyzer system reaches a very high STH efficiency of up to 29.1% (refer to 30.3% if the lead resistance losses are excluded) at large current densities, surpassing all previously reported PV-electrolysis systems.

During seawater electrolysis, chloride ion (Cl–) adsorption at the anode leads to an inevitable competitive chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), compromising the long-term stability of the electrolysis process. Furthermore, Ni-based OER electrocatalysts are challenged by activity degradation due to the overoxidation of Ni3+. In response, we present a design of oxygen-vacancy-regulated asymmetric Nb–O–Ni bonds aimed at selective seawater oxidation. The experimental and in situ characterization results indicate that the blocking effect of oxygen vacancies effectively alleviates the electron release of Ni3+ and the electron enrichment of Nb5+ on asymmetric Nb–O–Ni bonds, achieving a stable and selective OER in alkaline seawater. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that oxygen vacancies in Nb–O–Ni bonds optimize the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates and break up the scaling relationship between *OH and *OOH intermediates. The constructed anion exchange membrane electrolysis cell achieves a cost efficiency of $1.07 per GGE (gasoline gallon equivalent) for H2 production at a current density of 1000 mA cm–2, maintaining operational stability for 100 h at 500 mA cm–2.

Accurately controlling the interactions and dynamic changes between multiple active sites (e.g., metals, vacancies, and lone pairs of heteroatoms) to achieve efficient catalytic performance is a key issue and challenge in the design of complex catalytic reactions involving 2D metal-supported catalysts, metal-zeolites, metal-organic catalysts, and metalloenzymes. With the aid of machine learning (ML), descriptors play a central role in optimizing the electrochemical performance of catalysts, elucidating the essence of catalytic activity, and predicting more efficient catalysts, thereby avoiding time-consuming trial-and-error processes. Three kinds of descriptors─active center descriptors, interfacial descriptors, and reaction pathway descriptors─are crucial for understanding and designing metal-supported catalysts. Specifically, vacancies, as active sites, synergize with metals to significantly promote the reduction reactions of energy-relevant small molecules. By combining some physical descriptors, interpretable descriptors can be constructed to evaluate catalytic performance. Future development of descriptors and ML models faces the challenge of constructing descriptors for vacancies in multicatalysis systems to rationally design the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts. Utilization of generative artificial intelligence and multimodal ML to automatically extract descriptors would accelerate the exploration of dynamic reaction mechanisms. The transferable descriptors from metal-supported catalysts to artificial metalloenzymes provide innovative solutions for energy conversion and environmental protection.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable the precise and controlled synthesis of single-atom catalysts with uniformly distributed active metal centers, offering opportunities to elucidate the impact of subtle coordination environment changes on the catalytic performance. Inspired by N-confused porphyrins, we designed 20 metalloporphyrin-based COFs with either M-N3C1 or M-N4 centers, where M refers to 3d transition metals from Sc to Zn, for the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Density functional theory calculations predicted Co-based COFs to be the best ORR catalysts among the screened catalysts. Hence, Co-N3C1-COF and Co-N4-COF with a high crystallinity were synthesized. The Co-N3C1-COF exhibited improved ORR performance over the parent Co-N4-COF, as it had a reduced overpotential and increased four-electron selectivity, corroborating theoretical predictions. The enhanced performance was ascribed to the increase in electron density on Co as the coordination environment transits from Co-N4 to Co-N3C1. This not only facilitated the adsorption of O2 and critical intermediates but also changed the potential-determining step, which in turn made the ORR free energy profile of Co-N3C1-COF approach equilibrium for all elementary steps, thus leading to a reduced overpotential. This combined theoretical and experimental work exemplified carbon coordination in porphyrin-based COFs as an effective strategy to facilitate the catalytic capability for ORR. A descriptor was also provided to guide the design of coordination-varied Por-COFs catalysts.

Abstract Chalcogenides, despite their versatile functionality, share a notably similar local structure in their amorphous states. Particularly in electronic phase‐change memory applications, distinguishing these glasses from neighboring compositions that do not possess memory capabilities is inherently difficult when employing traditional analytical methods. This has led to a dilemma in materials design since an atomistic view of the arrangement in the amorphous state is the key to understanding and optimizing the functionality of these glasses. To tackle this challenge, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to separate electronic phase‐change materials (ePCMs) from other chalcogenides, based upon subtle differences in the short‐range order inside the glassy phase. Leveraging the established structure–property relations in chalcogenide glasses, we select suitable features to train accurate machine learning models, even with a modestly sized dataset. The trained model accurately discerns the critical transition point between glass compositions suitable for use as ePCMs and those that are not, particularly for both GeTe–GeSe and Sb 2 Te 3 –Sb 2 Se 3 materials, in line with experiments. Furthermore, by extracting the physical knowledge that the ML model has offered, we pinpoint three pivotal structural features of amorphous chalcogenides, that is, the bond angle, packing efficiency, and the length of the fourth bond, which provide a map for materials design with the ability to “predict” and “explain”. All three of the above features point to the smaller Peierls‐like distortion and more well‐defined octahedral clusters in amorphous ePCMs than non‐ePCMs. Our study delves into the mechanisms shaping these structural attributes in amorphous ePCMs, yielding valuable insights for the AI‐powered discovery of novel materials. image

Copper-based electrocatalysts, which hold great promise in selectively reducing CO2 into multicarbon products, have attracted significant recent interest, both experimentally and theoretically. While many studies have suggested a strong dependence of catalytic selectivity on the concentration of the *CO reaction intermediate on the Cu surface, it remains challenging for a direct experimental probe of the CO coverage. This necessitates a reliable computational method that can accurately establish the theoretical coverage-dependent phase diagram of CO adsorbates on the catalyst. Here we propose a scheme composed of density functional theory calculations, machine-learning force fields and graph neural networks as a solution. This method enables a fast screening of 7 million adsorption configurations based on a small set of density functional theory data, with a balance between accuracy and efficiency tuned by the combinatorial use of machine-learning force field and graph neural network models. We have investigated eight different Cu facets and discovered that the high-index facets such as (310), (210) and (322) exhibit a much higher CO coverage than the low-index counterparts such as (111), leading to an increased opportunity for C-C coupling for the former. Our results can provide a new perspective for the understanding of the fundamental role of CO coverage on the Cu surface for electrochemical CO2 reduction.

Computational modeling is an integral part of catalysis research. With it, new methodologies are being developed and implemented to improve the accuracy of simulations while reducing the computational cost. In particular, specific machine-learning techniques have been applied to build interatomic potential from ab initio results. Here, we report an energy-free machine-learning calculator that combines three individually trained neural networks to predict the energy and atomic forces of metallic particles. The investigated structures were a monometallic Pd nanoparticle, a bimetallic AuPd nanoalloy, and supported Pd metal crystallites on silica. Atomic energies were predicted via a graph neural network, leading to a mean absolute error (MAE) within 0.004 eV from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The task of predicting atomic forces was split over two feed-forward networks, one predicting the force norm and another its direction. The force prediction resulted in a MAE within 0.080 eV/Å against DFT results. The interpretability of the graph neural network predictions was demonstrated by underlying the physics of the monometallic particle in the form of cohesion energy.
