Abstract Alkaline water electrolysis is the promising technical pathway of large‐scale green hydrogen production. However, its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is hindered by the alkaline environment, leading to slow H 2 O splitting kinetics, especially for NiMoCu alloy catalysts which are considered potential alkaline HER catalysts. In this work, the Ru‐substrate modified NiMoCu 20 porous electrode is designed by a continuous multistep electrodeposition method. It shows the good alkaline HER performance at the high current density of 1000 mA cm −2 , which is attributed to the synergistic charge‐reconfiguration effects between Ru‐substrate and NiMoCu alloy by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman spectra analysis. It indicates that the Ru‐substrate is capable of encouraging H‐OH* bond breakage and optimizing transition‐state H* adsorption. Further, the overall water electrolysis results of the alkaline water electrolysis cell (30 wt% KOH) at 70 °C show that it has good performance at the large current density of 1000 mA cm −2 with 2.05 V and good stability at 600 mA cm −2 up to 500 h. It provides the possibility of designing the high‐performance HER electrode from the view of industrial applications.

Abstract Context The study of platinum (Pt) clusters and nanoparticles is essential due to their extensive range of potential technological applications, particularly in catalysis. The electronic properties that yield optimal catalytic performance at the nanoscale are significantly influenced by the size and structure of Pt clusters. This research aimed to identify the lowest-energy conformers for Pt $$_{18}$$    18    , Pt $$_{19}$$    19    , and Pt $$_{20}$$    20    species using Density Functional Theory (DFT). We discovered new low-symmetry conformers for Pt $$_{19}$$    19    and Pt $$_{20}$$    20    , which are 3.0 and 1.0 kcal/mol more stable, respectively, than previously reported structures. Our study highlights the importance of using density functional approximations that incorporate moderate levels of exact Hartree-Fock exchange, alongside basis sets of at least quadruple-zeta quality. The resulting structures are asymmetric with varying active sites, as evidenced by sigma hole analysis on the electrostatic potential surface. This suggests a potential correlation between electronic structure and catalytic properties, warranting further investigation. Methods An equivariant graph neural network interatomic potential (NequIP) within the Atomic Simulation Environment suite (ASE) was used to provide initial geometries of the aggregates under study. DFT calculations were performed with the ORCA 5 package, using functional approximations that included Generalized Gradient Approximation (PBE), meta-GGA (TPSS, M06-L), hybrid (PBE0, PBEh), meta-GGA hybrid (TPSSh), and range-separated hybrid ( $$\omega $$  ω  B97x) functionals. Def2-TZVP and Def2-QZVP as well as members of the cc-pwCVXZ-PP family to check basis set convergence were used. QTAIM calculations were performed using the AIMAll suite. Structures were visualized with the AVOGADRO code.

In the past few years, supercapacitors (SCs) have received remarkable attention in the field of energy conversion and storage systems in sustainable nanotechnologies because of their unique properties such as better cycling life, low processing cost, and excellent specific power than that of batteries. The carbon material, metal oxide, and conductive polymers are three electrode materials that have been utilized for processing the SCs owing to their superior electrochemical performances. However, machine learning (ML) techniques have placed great significance on quickly developing applications in a number of domains, including physics, chemistry, and material science, where vast amounts of data are available, to estimate the capacitance of electrode materials for SCs. In order to discover and tailor the energy storage material for electrochemical performance, ML plays an imperative role and also optimizes the properties of electrode materials in terms of high specific capacitance for SC applications. This chapter is intended to portray the contemporary technological applications, fundamental key concepts, and prospective domain of ML, in order to predict the electrode materials for design, development, and applications of SCs. Also, it will provide a platform for in-depth insight into ML to study the relationship between various parameters of electrode materials linked to SC performance, such as charge–discharge cycle, power, energy density, and specific surface area.

The large production volumes of commodity polyolefins (specifically, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chloride)), in conjunction with their low unit values and multitude of short-term uses, have resulted in a significant and pressing waste management challenge. Only a small fraction of these polyolefins is currently mechanically recycled, with the rest being incinerated, accumulating in landfills, or leaking into the natural environment. Since polyolefins are energy-rich materials, there is considerable interest in recouping some of their chemical value while simultaneously motivating more responsible end-of-life management. An emerging strategy is catalytic depolymerization, in which a portion of the C-C bonds in the polyolefin backbone is broken with the assistance of a catalyst and, in some cases, additional small molecule reagents. When the products are small molecules or materials with higher value in their own right, or as chemical feedstocks, the process is called upcycling. This review summarizes recent progress for four major catalytic upcycling strategies: hydrogenolysis, (hydro)cracking, tandem processes involving metathesis, and selective oxidation. Key considerations include macromolecular reaction mechanisms relative to small molecule mechanisms, catalyst design for macromolecular transformations, and the effect of process conditions on product selectivity. Metrics for describing polyolefin upcycling are critically evaluated, and an outlook for future advances is described.

The doping of zirconia to enhance its activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has been studied intensively in experiments, but a thorough theoretical understanding of the factors that decide whether a dopant has a positive or negative influence on the reactivity is lacking. In this work, we conduct a mechanistic investigation using density functional theory and microkinetic modeling, considering the ZrO2(101) surface doped with 16 different metals. This analysis elucidates the following two criteria for enhanced reactivity. One, the ability of the surface to facilitate the dissociation of H2 and provide the H* species necessary for the catalytic reaction is deemed a necessary but not sufficient criterion. Two, dopants that are thermodynamically stable under reaction conditions in a 2+ or 3+ oxidation state are beneficial, since this entails the introduction of O vacancies, which stabilize O-containing reaction intermediates such as formate and lower key transition states. We construct linear scaling relations that can reliably predict transition state energies in terms of less computationally costly adsorption energies. It is revealed that dopants that are stable in the 4+ state (e.g., Ti), and thereby lack O vacancies, follow a different scaling relation with a higher intercept for formate formation, which can explain their reduced reactivity. Overall, our microkinetic models can successfully predict the trends for dopants that have been found active in experiments (Zn2+, Cd2+, Ga3+, In3+) and not. Together with the established reactivity criteria, this paves the way for computational screening of oxides for the important CO2-to-methanol process.

ABSTRACT Ni, Fe‐based nitrides have been widely studied for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, displaying electrocatalytic activities similar to Pt and other noble metal electrocatalysts. The incorporation of small amounts of Mo or W on these Ni, Fe‐based nitrides is expected to have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance of these materials, especially for the HER activity. In this work, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) with the empirical formula Ni 1+ x Fe 3− x − y A y N (A = Mo, W), were obtained in two steps: synthesis of the transition metal oxide precursors by an easy, one‐pot sol–gel polymerization method followed by nitridation under ammonia atmosphere to obtain the final TMNs. Their HER and OER catalytic performances in alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH solution) were studied and it was observed that the incorporation of small quantities of Mo or W in these Ni, Fe‐based nitrides (Ni 1+ x Fe 3− x − y A y N, where y = 0.1) results in improved HER and OER activities, especially in the TMN that contains W (i.e., Ni 1+ x Fe 2.9− x W 0.1 N), where the overpotentials were 348 mV for OER and 269 mV for HER. These values are lower than those obtained for Ni 1+ x Fe 3− x N, which are 395 mV for OER and 368 mV for HER.

A comprehensive understanding of the intricate surface environments of practical nanocatalysts at the atomic level is essential for advancing our knowledge of catalytic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate PtCu octahedral nanoparticles with varying microstrains engineered by Cu dispersion. A detailed analysis of the atom configuration and corresponding microstrain is conducted. The intimate mixing of Cu and Pt results in increased randomness in atom displacement within the lattice and a more pronounced distribution of alternating microstrain on the surfaces. Specifically, we observe that the PtCu concave octahedral nanoparticles with alternating microstrain demonstrate a substantial oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of 3.95 mA cm–2 in area-specific activity. The significant impact of shear microstrain is further underscored, as evidenced by an 86.9% decrease in the ORR activity upon the removal of the alternating shear microstrain. This study sheds light on the effects of microstrain toward the ORR and provides valuable insights into designing advanced Pt-based electrocatalysts.

Abstract Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), noted for their rich nitrogen content, have attracted significant attention as promising photocatalysts. However, the structural complexity introduced by the diversity of nitrogen atoms in nitrogen‐rich CTFs poses a substantial challenge in discovering high‐performance CTFs. To address this challenge, a machine‐learning approach is developed to rationally design nitrogen‐rich CTFs, which is subsequently validated through experimental methods. A framework is employed based on the special orthogonal group in three dimensions (SO(3))‐invariant graph neural networks to predict photocatalytic properties of CTFs structures. This approach achieves exceptionally high accuracies with R 2 scores exceeding 0.98. From a dataset of 14920 CTFs structures, this framework identifies 45 high‐performance candidates. Guided by these predictions, a novel CTF structure, pyridine‐2,5‐dicarbaldehyde (CTF‐DCPD) is selected and successfully synthesized, which exhibits an ultrahigh hydrogen evolution rate of 17.70 mmol g −1 h −1 . This rate significantly surpasses that of the widely studied CTF‐1,4‐dicyanobenzene (CTF‐DCB, 10.41 mmol g −1 h −1 ). This work provides a new paradigm for machine learning to accelerate materials development, which can be generalized to the development of other functional materials.

Plasmonic catalysis has been employed to enhance molecular transformations under visible light excitation, leveraging the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in plasmonic nanoparticles. While plasmonic catalysis has been employed for accelerating reaction rates, achieving control over the reaction selectivity has remained a challenge. In addition, the incorporation of catalytic components into traditional plasmonic-catalytic antenna-reactor nanoparticles often leads to a decrease in optical absorption. To address these issues, this study focuses on the synthesis of bimetallic core@shell Au@AuPd nanoparticles (NPs) with ultralow loadings of palladium (Pd) into gold (Au) NPs. The goal is to achieve NPs with an Au core and a dilute alloyed shell containing both Au and Pd, with a low Pd content of around 10 atom %. By employing the (photo)electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO

A promising route toward room-temperature ironmaking is electrowinning, where iron ore dissolution is coupled with cation electrodeposition to grow pure iron. However, poor faradaic efficiencies against the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a major bottleneck. To develop a mechanistic picture of this technology, we conduct a first-principles thermodynamic analysis of the Fe110 aqueous electrochemical interface. Constructing a surface Pourbaix diagram, we predict that the iron surface will always drive toward adsorbate coverage. We calculate theoretical overpotentials for terrace and step sites and predict that growth at the step sites are likely to dominate. Investigating the hydrogen surface phases, we model several hydrogen absorption mechanisms, all of which are predicted to be endothermic. Additionally, for HER we identify step sites as being more reactive than on the terrace and with competitive limiting potentials to iron plating. The results presented here further motivate electrolyte design toward HER suppression.

The accurate mapping of potential energy surfaces (PESs) is crucial to our understanding of the numerous physical and chemical processes mediated by atomic rearrangements, such as conformational changes and chemical reactions, and the thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility of these processes. Stochastic electronic structure theories, e.g., Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, enable highly accurate total energy calculations that in principle can be used to construct the PES. However, their stochastic nature poses a challenge to the computation and use of forces and Hessians, which are typically required in algorithms for minimum-energy pathway (MEP) and transition state (TS) identification, such as the nudged elastic band (NEB) algorithm and its climbing image formulation. Here, we present strategies that utilize the surrogate Hessian line-search method, previously developed for QMC structural optimization, to efficiently identify MEP and TS structures without requiring force calculations at the level of the stochastic electronic structure theory. By modifying the surrogate Hessian algorithm to operate in path-orthogonal subspaces and at saddle points, we show that it is possible to identify MEPs and TSs by using a force-free QMC approach. We demonstrate these strategies via two examples, the inversion of the ammonia (NH3) molecule and the nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction F– + CH3F → FCH3 + F–. We validate our results using Density Functional Theory (DFT)- and Coupled Cluster (CCSD, CCSD(T))-based NEB calculations. We then introduce a hybrid DFT-QMC approach to compute thermodynamic and kinetic quantities, free energy differences, rate constants, and equilibrium constants that incorporates stochastically optimized structures and their energies, and show that this scheme improves upon DFT accuracy. Our methods generalize straightforwardly to other systems and other high-accuracy theories that similarly face challenges computing energy gradients, paving the way for highly accurate PES mapping, transition state determination, and thermodynamic and kinetic calculations at significantly reduced computational expense.

Belitic cements are a greener alternative to Ordinary Portland Cement due to the lower CO2 associated with their production. However, their low reactivity with water is currently a drawback, resulting in longer setting times. In this study, we utilize a combination of evolutionary algorithms and machine learning atomic potentials (MLPs) to identify previously unreported belite polymorphs that may exhibit higher hydraulic reactivity than the known phases. To address the high computational demand of this methodology, we propose a novel transfer learning approach for generating MLPs. First, the models are pretrained on a large set of classical data (ReaxFF) and then retrained with density functional theory (DFT) data. We demonstrate that the transfer learning enhanced potentials exhibit higher accuracy, require less training data, and are more transferable than those trained exclusively on DFT data. The generated machine learning potential enables a fast, exhaustive, and reliable exploration of the dicalcium silicate polymorphs. This includes studying their stability through phonon analysis and calculating their structural and elastic properties. Overall, we identify ten new belite polymorphs within the energy range of the existing ones, including a layered phase with potentially high reactivity.

Gallium nitride nanowires (GaN NWs) have shown great potential in applications to photocatalysis, including photocatalytic hydrogen evolution for solar energy storage. Previous studies have shown that GaN NWs can undergo self-improvement under light irradiation, which is attributed to surface oxidation, forming gallium oxynitride (GaON). However, the exact oxidation pathways and the effect of surface oxidation on catalytic performance remain to be understood at the molecular level. In this study, we combine computational modeling at the density functional theory (DFT) level with linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometric measurements to investigate the photoinduced surface oxidation of GaN NWs. We find that the oxidation of GaN to GaON is competitive with water oxidation. The oxidized surface shows almost no change in its water oxidation capabilities, although the potential required for hydrogen evolution is significantly reduced. Oxidation of the surface also leads to changes in the electronic structure, shifting the valence band edge states toward the surface adsorbed hydroxide, making hole localization there more likely. Calculations are consistent with the observation of shifts in the onset potential for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution toward more positive potentials over an extended 18 h period. The reported findings on the mechanism of photoinduced surface oxidation of GaN NWs and the effect of surface oxidation on hydrogen evolution provide valuable insights for the development of more efficient GaN NW-based photocatalytic surfaces for hydrogen evolution.

Rechargeable lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries are known for their ultrahigh theoretical energy density among chemical batteries. However, the low catalytic activity and poor stability of the cathode catalyst are the root issues limiting their practical applications. In this work, a design strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of the TiC material was devised by C surface modification. The carbon-coated core–shell TiC@C nanomaterial was designed, which combined the good electrical conductivity and low density of carbon materials with the excellent catalysis of TiC. The calculated catalytic activities of TiC (100) with and without C coating were compared by first-principles calculations, showing that the TiC (100)@C surface has a lower ORR/OER overpotential. The C layer enhances the conductivity of the TiC (100) surface significantly. This work fully demonstrates the synergistic catalysis of TiC material and C coating, which not only effectively accelerates the practical process by improving the charging and discharging kinetic rate of Li–O2 batteries but also provides an efficient catalyst design strategy for other energy-catalytic industries.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an effective strategy to tackle energy crises and mitigate greenhouse gas effects. The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts has been a research hotspot in the field. In this study, we designed four Co-doped single-atom catalysts (Co–Nχ@C) using carbon nanotubes as carriers, these catalysts included tri- and dicoordinated N-doped carbon nanoribbons, as well as tri- and dicoordinated N-doped graphene, respectively denoted as H3(H2)-Co/CNT and 3(2)-Co/CNT. The stable configurations of these Co–Nχ@C catalysts were optimized using the PBE+D3 method. Additionally, we explored the reaction mechanisms of these catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into four C1 products, including CO, HCOOH, CH3OH and CH4, in detail. Upon comparing the limiting potentials (UL) across the Co–Nχ@C catalysts, the activity sequence for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 was H2–Co/CNT > 3-Co/CNT > H3–Co/CNT > 2-Co/CNT. Meanwhile, our investigation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with four catalysts elucidated the influence of acidic conditions on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process. Specifically, controlling the acidity of the solution was crucial when using the H3–Co/CNT and H2–Co/CNT catalysts, while the 3-Co/CNT and 2-Co/CNT catalysts were almost unaffected by the solution's acidity. We hope that our research will provide a theoretical foundation for designing more effective CO2 reduction electrocatalysts.

The widespread concern about the burning of fossil fuels and its effects on the environment has driven our research efforts toward sustainable energy solutions. As a result, there is a strong drive to improve the eco-friendly production of chemical compounds sourced from renewable resources. Here, we report a first-principle mechanistic study of the conversion of ethanol to butanol using a hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst. Basically, we combined density functional theory calculations, the unity bond index-quadratic exponential potential approximation to analyze the reaction mechanism, and microkinetic simulations to address the influence of the kinetic parameters on the chemical distribution of formed species on the HAP catalyst. From our calculations and analyses, the sequence of elementary reaction steps follows the Guerbet reaction pathway, which involves ethanol dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, and subsequent hydrogenation steps. The results indicate that the bifunctional nature of the HAP surface is key to facilitate the initial dehydrogenation of ethanol and subsequent C–C coupling via aldol condensation, determining reactions to the formation of C4 species. Furthermore, microkinetic analysis shows that butanol is the main product, with minimal formation of other C4 byproducts. However, higher initial ethanol coverages decrease the rate of conversion because of limited active sites. The conversion of the aldol intermediate is crucial for efficient butanol production. These findings provide valuable information for the future development of HAP-based catalysts for sustainable biofuel production.

Abstract For the first time, a Co and Fe bimetallic metal‐organic framework (BMOF) nanosheet array (NSA) employing 5,5′,5′'‐(1,3,5‐triazine‐2,4,6‐triyl)tris(azanediyl)triisophthalic acid (H 6 TDPAT) as the organic ligand is in situ controllably self‐assembled on iron foam (IF). The obtained IF@CoFe‐TDPAT NSA exhibits an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity much superior to most reported catalysts and even Ru and Ir‐based ones and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity higher than most metal‐organic framework (MOF)‐based catalysts. The excellent bifunctional activities are ascribed to the superhydrophilic (3D) vertically aligned, interconnected NSA of CoFe‐TDPAT MOF with in situ activated coordinatively unsaturated metal sites remarkably enhancing OH − and H 2 O adsorption, accelerating electron transfer and transport, and facilitating O 2 /H 2 diffusion. When adopted as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, it achieves 300 mA cm −2 at 1.753 V and exhibits negligible current decay after 100 h. This performance is the highest of recently reported noble‐metal‐free water electrolyzers, and even much higher than those using commercial noble metal‐based catalysts. This work offers an economical, facile, and controllable strategy to fabricate low‐cost, highly efficient, and bifunctional BMOF nanostructured array electrodes for large‐current‐density water splitting, and also sheds light on the mechanisms for in situ self‐assembly and outstanding OER and HER performance of 3D free‐standing complex‐organic‐ligand‐based BMOF nanoarchitectures.

Catalysis involves complex reactions with dynamic changes in catalyst morphology, challenging the capabilities of traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. To address this, we present the Catalytic Large Atomic Model (CLAM), a machine-learning-based interatomic potential designed for heterogeneous catalysis. Trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes metals, alloys, oxides, clusters, zeolites, 2D materials, and small molecules, CLAM ensures high accuracy across diverse catalytic systems. We also introduce a "local fine-tuning" algorithm that enhances the model’s applicability by accelerating structural optimizations and transition state searches while maintaining precision. Additionally, CLAM facilitates rapid reaction network construction and efficient kinetic analysis. This work advances computational catalysis by providing a universal and robust tool for catalyst design and mechanism exploration.

Aminoacetaldehyde (glycinal, NH2CH2CHO) is a first-generation oxidation product of monoethanolamine (MEA, NH2CH2CH2OH), a solvent widely used for CO2 gas separation, which is proposed as the basis for a range of carbon capture technologies. A complete oxidation mechanism for MEA is required to understand the atmospheric transformation of carbon capture plant emissions, as well as the degradation of this solvent during its use and the oxidative destruction of waste solvent. In this study, we have investigated the •OH radical-initiated oxidation chemistry of aminoacetaldehyde using quantum chemical calculations and RRKM theory/master equation kinetic modeling. This work predicts that aminoacetaldehyde has a tropospheric lifetime of around 6 h and that the reaction predominantly produces the NH2CH2C•O radical intermediate at room temperature, along with minor contributions from NH2•CHCHO and •NHCH2CHO. The dominant radical intermediate NH2CH2C•O is predicted to promptly dissociate to NH2•CH2 and CO, where NH2•CH2 is known to react with O2 under tropospheric conditions to form the imine NH = CH2 + HO2. The NH2•CHCHO radical experiences captodative stabilization and is found to form a weakly bound peroxyl radical upon reaction with O2. Instead, the major oxidation product of NH2•CHCHO and the aminyl radical •NHCH2CHO is the imine NH = CHCHO (+HO2). In the atmosphere, the dominant fate of imine compounds is thought to be hydrolysis, where NH = CH2 will form ammonia and formaldehyde, and NH = CHCHO will produce ammonia and glyoxal. Efficient conversion of the dominant first-generation oxidation products of MEA to ammonia is consistent with field observations and supports the important role of imine intermediates in MEA oxidation.

While multistep reactions in electrochemistry are ubiquitous, their analytical treatment has been incomplete and at times misleading. Several misconceptions have led to incorrect conclusions, derailing the analysis of electrochemical processes. In this work we present a rigorous application of the Butler-Volmer model and develop a coherent nomenclature and methodology on how to analyze multistep reactions. We discuss how a universal definition of the exchange current density does not exist for multistep reactions, clarify the meaning of the Tafel slope, often misinterpreted in the electrochemical literature. Eventually we discuss the classically proposed HOR/HER mechanisms on platinum, briefly discuss their origin, show how mass transport effects should be correctly analyzed by introduce a new equation that complements the Koutecký-Levich equation in the micropolarization region. We then perform a thorough experimental investigation of the HOR/HER kinetics over a wide range of combination of cations, anions, concentration, and buffers. There we reveal that buffers seem to take directly part in the HOR/HER and discuss the supposed “cation-effect”. Through the analysis of the micropolarization, Tafel region, and kinetics of the H-upd we propose a new mechanistic description of the HOR/HER with substantial experimental agreement and discuss how anions in the interface play a deciding role in the HOR/HER and H-upd on polycrystalline platinum.

This paper investigates the existence of weak solutions to two problem sets of elliptic equations in adjoining domains, with Beavers-Joseph-Saffman and regularized Butler-Volmer boundary conditions being prescribed on the common interfaces, porous-fluid and membrane, respectively.Mathematically, the modeling tool is the coupled Stokes/Darcy system, completed by the thermoelectrochemical (TEC) system, in the multiregion domain.The Stokes/Darcy system consists of the Stokes equation on one part of the domain coupled to the Darcy equation, where the flow velocities are small and mainly driven by the pressure gradient in porous medium.The TEC system consists of the energy equation and the mass transport associated with electrochemical reactions, where the fluxes are given by generalized Fourier, Fick and Ohm laws, by including the Dufour-Soret and Peltier-Seebeck cross effects.The present model includes macrohomogeneous models for both hydrogen and methanol crossover.The novelty in the presented model lies in the presence of the Joule effect into the Stokes/Darcy-TEC system altogether to the quasilinear character given by temperature dependence of the physical parameters such as the viscosities and the diffusion coefficients, by the concentration-temperature dependence of cross-effect coefficients, and by the pressure dependence of the permeability.The purpose of the present work is to derive quantitative estimates of the solutions to clarify smallness conditions on the data.We use fixed point and compactness arguments based on the quantitative estimates of approximated solutions.

Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of biased behaviors exhibited by robots utilizing large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications, focusing on five experimental scenarios: customer service, education, healthcare, recruitment, and social interaction. The analysis reveals significant differences in user experiences based on race, health status, work experience, and social status. For instance, the average satisfaction score for white customers is 4.2, compared to 3.5 for black customers, and the response accuracy for white students is 92%, versus 85% for black students. To address these biases, we propose several mitigation methods, including data resampling, model regularization, post-processing techniques, diversity assessment, and user feedback mechanisms. These methods aim to enhance the fairness and inclusivity of robotic systems, promoting healthy human-robot interactions. By combining our quantitative data analysis with existing research, we affirm the importance of bias detection and mitigation, and propose various improvement strategies. Future research should further explore data balancing strategies, fairness-constrained models, real-time monitoring and adjustment mechanisms, and cross-domain studies to comprehensively evaluate and improve the performance of LLM-based robotic systems across various tasks.

Abstract Climate change mitigation by decreasing worldwide CO2 emissions is an urgent and demanding challenge that requires innovative technical solutions. This work, inspired by vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), introduces an integrated electrochemical process for carbon capture and energy storage. It utilizes established vanadium and ferricyanide redox couples for pH modulation for CO2 desorption and absorbent regeneration. The developed process consumes electricity during the daytime—when renewable electricity is available—to desorb CO2 and charge the cell, and it can regenerate the absorbent for further CO2 absorption while releasing electricity to the grid during nighttime when solar power is unavailable. This research explores the process fundamentals and scalability potential, through an extensive study of the system's thermodynamics, transport phenomena, kinetics, and bench-scale operations. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was utilized to study the thermodynamics of the process, mapping the redox profiles to identify ideal potential windows for operation. The CV results pinpointed a 0.3 V Nernstian overpotential as the thermodynamic minimum required for cell operation. Additionally, polarization studies were conducted to select the practical operating potential, identifying 0.5 V as optimal for the CO2 desorption cycle to provide sufficient polarity to overcome activation barriers in addition to the Nernstian potential. Mass transfer analysis balanced conductivity and desorption efficiency, with a 1:1 ratio identified as optimal for redox-active species and background electrolyte concentration. To further enhance the kinetics of the redox reactions, plasma treatment of electrode surfaces was implemented, resulting in a 43% decrease in charge transfer resistance, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Finally, a bench-scale operation of the system demonstrated an energy consumption of 54 kJ/mol CO2, which is competitive with other electrochemical carbon capture technologies. Besides its energy competitiveness, the process offers multiple additional advantages, including the elimination of precious metal electrodes, oxygen insensitivity in flue gas, scalability inspired by VRFB technology, and the unique ability to function as a battery during the absorbent regeneration process, enabling efficient day-night operation.

Our study systematically evaluates the performance of various supervised learning algorithms in credit risk assessment and fraud detection, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Tree, and Neural Network. The results show that in credit risk assessment, the Gradient Boosting Tree performed best with an accuracy of 90.5% and a ROC-AUC of 0.84, followed by Random Forest and Neural Network, with accuracies of 89.2% and 88.8%, and ROC-AUCs of 0.82 and 0.81, respectively. In the fraud detection task, the Neural Network performed best with an accuracy of 97.5% and a ROC-AUC of 0.88, while Gradient Boosting Tree and Random Forest achieved accuracies of 97.1% and 96.3%, and ROC-AUCs of 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. Feature importance analysis indicates that repayment history, credit limit, bill amount, and repayment amount are key features in credit risk assessment, while transaction amount, transaction time, and location are crucial for fraud detection. Data preprocessing and feature engineering played critical roles in enhancing model performance. Further optimization of model hyperparameters and addressing data imbalance issues will help improve model performance. In conclusion, ensemble learning methods and Neural Networks exhibit significant advantages in credit risk assessment and fraud detection. By employing scientific data preprocessing and feature engineering, combined with advanced machine learning algorithms, financial institutions can significantly enhance their risk management effectiveness.

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics heralds significant advancements in human-robot interaction, enabling robots to perform complex tasks involving natural language understanding, common sense reasoning, and human modeling. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs pose substantial ethical and safety concerns, particularly the risk of enacting discrimination, violence, and unlawful actions. This study conducts a comprehensive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)-based evaluation of several highly-rated LLMs, focusing on their bias and safety criteria. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant biases across diverse demographic groups and frequently produce unsafe or unlawful responses when faced with unconstrained natural language inputs. These results underscore the urgent need for systematic risk assessments and robust ethical guidelines to ensure the responsible deployment of LLM-driven robots. We propose detailed strategies for mitigating these risks, including advanced bias detection techniques, robust safety mechanisms, and collaborative standards development. By addressing these critical issues, we aim to pave the way for the development of safer, fairer, and more reliable robotic systems.

Our study presents the development and implementation of a neural network-based smart city security monitoring system tailored for the urban environment of Beijing. Leveraging multimodal data integration, the system processes over 1,200 hours of video footage, 800 hours of audio recordings, and 400 hours of thermal data to provide comprehensive surveillance and real-time anomaly detection. The system achieved high accuracy rates of 96% for overcrowding detection, 93% for unauthorized access, and 90% for unattended objects, with corresponding precision rates of 96%, 95%, and 93%. The recall rates were slightly lower, at 89%, 87%, and 85%, respectively. Our system's implementation of edge computing enabled rapid response times, recorded at 1.5 seconds for subway stations, 2.0 seconds for Tiananmen Square, and 1.2 seconds for public transport hubs. These results underscore the system's effectiveness in delivering real-time monitoring and timely alerts, crucial for managing high-density areas and critical infrastructure in Beijing. The integration of advanced AI techniques, including transfer learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), further enhanced the system's adaptability and robustness in detecting rare and unlabeled events. This study highlights the system's potential to significantly improve urban security infrastructure, offering a scalable and efficient solution for smart city applications.

Intermetallic compounds are promising materials in numerous fields, especially those involving surface interactions, such as catalysis. A key factor to investigate their surface properties lies in adsorption energy maps, typically built using first-principles approaches. However, exploring the adsorption energy landscapes of intermetallic compounds can be cumbersome, usually requiring huge computational resources. In this work, we propose an efficient method to predict adsorption energies, based on a Machine Learning (ML) scheme fed by a few Density Functional Theory (DFT) estimates performed on
