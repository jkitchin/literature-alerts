Electronic structure modulation is a promising approach to enhance the properties of intrinsically inert metals in an electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, a molybdenum (Mo) single atom (Mo SAs) catalyst with pyrrole-rich nitrogen/oxygen double coordination has been designed and synthesized (defined as Mo SAs/N-C). The pyrrole-nitrogen (Pyrr-N) coordination was shown to effectively regulate the metal-centered electronic structure of Mo. This coordination strategy enables Mo SAs/N-C to exhibit superior catalytic activity and enhanced 4e- transfer selectivity. The electrochemical performance evaluations revealed that Mo SAs/N-C exhibit exceptional durability (with only a 2.0 mV half-wave potential decay after 5000 cycles) and resistance to methanol toxicity, outperforming commercial Pt/C (20%). Notably, as an air-cathode catalyst for zinc-air batteries, Mo SAs/N-C achieved a peak power density of 242 mW cm-2. Combining experimental results with density functional theory calculations, it was found that Pyrr-N effectively modulates the adsorption of OOH* intermediates on Mo atoms, promoting the 4e- transfer pathway and significantly enhancing the performance of the ORR. This study provides valuable insights into the role of Pyrr-N coordination in improving the performance of single-atom catalysts.

Electrified solid-liquid interfaces play a crucial role in energy conversion, storage, photoconversion, sensors, and corrosion processes. While computational chemistry simulations can provide detailed insights into reaction mechanisms, aligning experimental and simulation results remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce the FDT-SJM method for ab initio molecular dynamics simulations under potential control, where the electrode charge fluctuates around an average value following the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), and electrode charges are screened by the solvated jellium method (SJM). The FDT-SJM is developed in GPAW, a Python-based open-source DFT code. We validate this approach by simulating the Au(111) interface in pure water, KOH, LiOH, Li, and K solutions at several electrode potentials. We analyze water reorientation in response to changes in the electrode surface charge and demonstrate that the method enables the estimation of interface capacitance and the potential of zero charge, yielding values consistent with experimental data.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer exceptional atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, particularly in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where effective mass transport and electronic structure control are critical. However, many SACs suffer from suboptimal hydrogen adsorption energies and limited synergy with the support matrix, which restrict their intrinsic activity and durability. Overcoming these limitations requires an integrated strategy that simultaneously optimizes both the atomic coordination environment and the support architecture. Here, we present a dual-template strategy for synthesizing ultrathin mesoporous hollow carbon (MHC) with tunable mesopores, which enhances ion transport and structural accessibility. Ni single atoms are stabilized within the MHC framework via a tailored N2O2 coordination environment, which fine-tunes the electronic structure of Ni and facilitates efficient hydrogen adsorption and HER kinetics. This coordination environment and the hierarchical porous framework collectively enhance HER activity, significantly reducing the overpotential to 68 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and resulting in remarkable mass activity (5 A mgNi-1 at 50 mV) and enhanced durability over 5000 cycles. Spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory calculations reveal that the N2O2 coordination fine-tunes the electronic structure of Ni, promoting efficient hydrogen adsorption and evolution. These findings highlight the synergistic effects of atomic-level Ni dispersion and tailored support, offering a robust strategy for fabricating single-atom electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

The projection of sustainable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly energy technologies demands innovation of electrocatalysts utilizing earth-abundant materials. The current study aims to improve the catalytic activity of spinel zinc ferrite (ZF), which is an earth-abundant and economically viable material, via a doping strategy. The spinel ZF shows a weak catalytic activity for water splitting, whereas the substitution of Cu ions at octahedral sites results in improving the catalytic performance in both acidic and basic electrolytes. Structural characterization using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction demonstrates that, depending on the Cu concentration, Cu ions either incorporate into spinel Zn-ferrite oxide as doping agents or form CuO nanocomposites, where Cu-induced construction of a composite containing ZCF nanoparticles and CuO nanophase coexists. Substituting Zn with Cu in the octahedral sites of the ZF crystal structure leads to a decrease in the unit cell lattice parameter, and the crystal symmetry is impacted, including the creation of strain and dislocation density. HRTEM analyses provide evidence that the ZF particles nucleate and grow randomly due to the asymmetric reaction dynamics of spinel oxide and the lack of surfactant, while the ZCF nanoparticles are elongated in preferential orientation, forming oriented nanoparticles with a greater surface-to-volume ratio. To attain the current density of 10 mA cm-2, the nanocomposite of the ZCF-50 electrode shows the lowest overpotential of 280 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) among other electrodes. The Tafel slope also decreases significantly in which the nanocomposite of ZCF-50 shows the lowest value of 80 mV dec-1. The measured double-layer capacitance (Cdl) for the nanocomposite structure of ZCF-50 offers the highest value of 27 mF cm-2, which indicates that the nanocomposite contains the largest electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The catalytic activity of Cu-doped spinel ZCF for hydrogen evolution reaction is also evaluated. The nanocomposite of ZCF-50 shows the lowest onset overpotential of 60 mV compared to 200 mV for the ZF electrode. The obtained Cdl over cathodic potentials for the ZCF-50 electrode shows the highest value of 11.3 mF cm-2 compared with other electrodes. These results confirm that ZCF-50 contains the largest ECSA and highest electrochemical activity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies also demonstrate that the ZCF-50 electrode shows the lowest charge-transfer resistance, indicating that the catalytic OER is improved significantly at its interfaces. We realize that Cu doping into the ferrite structure and the formation of the CuO semishells synergistically can improve interparticle and transparticle charge transfer.

Abstract MoS 2 has emerged as a promising low‐cost candidate for the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, its catalytic performance is limited by the chemical inertness of the dominating MoS 2 ‐basal plane. Herein, it is reported that the catalytic activity of MoS 2 for HER can be significantly boosted by the synergy of MoS 2 lattice‐confined Fe and Co atoms (FeCo‐MoS 2 ). The catalyst exhibits a superior activity with a low overpotential of 356 mV at an industrial‐level high current density of 1 A cm −2 , markedly surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst and previously reported MoS 2 ‐based non‐noble metal catalysts, and works stably for over 350 h. Multiple characterizations combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the co‐confinement of Fe and Co atoms synergistically optimizes the energy levels of valence electronic states of neighboring sulfur atoms compared with the situations of solely confining Fe or Co, thereby improving the adsorption of protons and facilitating the electron‐transfer kinetics in the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps of HER.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a crucial role in both the chemical and energy industries. Despite substantial advancements in theoretical, computational, and experimental studies, identifying both the in situ activity and selectivity in ORR electrocatalysis remains a major challenge. Here, using a suite of correlative operando scanning electrochemical probe and electrochemiluminescence microscopy techniques, we establish a link between the morphological structure and the local ORR activity and selectivity of single Au and Au@Pt platelets at the subparticle level. It is clearly shown that the edge facets of Au and Au@Pt platelets exhibit higher activity for 4e- ORR compared to basal planes, whereas the basal planes of both Au and Au@Pt platelets demonstrate superior 2e- selectivity relative to the edge facets. These findings deepen our understanding of ORR activity and selectivity across different facets at the subparticle level, which offers valuable guidance for the rational design of highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts.

Abstract The rational design of active and stable electrodes is crucial for the development of efficient and durable water electrolyzers. However, theoretical studies exploring the structural factors that dictate catalytic activity and dissolution stability remain scarce. This study investigates several factors by examining the trends in activity, stability, and the oxidation state of Ir single atoms during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, the structure of Ir single‐atom catalysts (SACs) is analyzed across a range of oxidation states, which is influenced by electrode potential and environmental pH. The findings indicate that applying potential to Ir SAC‐supported covalent organic framework (COF) in the range of 0.5 ∼ < U ∼ < 1.1 can lead to the formation of an OIrOH structure, resulting in outstanding OER activity. Importantly, while applying the electrode potential is not necessary to overcome the potential‐limiting step, it is crucial for the formation and stabilization of the highly active Ir SAC structure. This work offers valuable insights to guide experimental efforts in designing high‐performance Ir SACs with enhanced OER activity.

Nickel phosphides (NixPy) are recognized as promising alternatives to noble-metal catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). NiP, consisting of the equal stoichiometric ratio of Ni and P, could help quantify the catalytic effect of P and Ni. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is employed to investigate the OER mechanism on NiP surfaces. We found that P atoms help stabilize O* at the adsorption sites. The rich electron donation from the Ni atom can alter the local charge distribution and enhance the interaction between O* and P atoms. Both oxygen intermediate adsorption energy and OER overpotential exhibit linear correlations with the charge of adsorption sites. Electron loss at the site induces the overall system to exhibit Lewis acidic characteristics, facilitating the OER and leading to a substantial overpotential reduction of up to 0.61 V compared to Lewis basic structures. Leveraging electronic structure theory and Lewis acid–base theory, we offer a new insight into the OER mechanism on the NiP surface, demonstrating that the catalytic activity of bulk metallic surface materials like NiP can be optimized by tailoring the local surface chemical environment.

Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are promising noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting due to their distinctive physical and chemical properties, but they usually undergo complicated structure reconfiguration during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Precisely controlling the in situ reconfiguration of TMSs for in situ generation of high-activity real active sites still remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose to in situ reconfigure heterostructure active-sites on transition metal sulfides via heterojunction engineering and achieve high OER performances on (Ni,Fe)S2/MoS2 catalysts. The continuous leaching of Mo and S during electrooxidation induces the reconfiguration, and the strong electronic interaction of (Ni,Fe)S2 and MoS2 generates the special Ni(OH)2/NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure sites via an asynchronous reconfiguration of Fe and Ni. The (Ni,Fe)S2/MoS2 heterostructure catalyst therefore exhibits excellent OER activity (a small overpotential of 228 mV at 100 mA cm-2) and a low voltage in an alkaline water electrolyzer (1.44 V at 10 mA cm-2), outperforming the homogeneous Mo-free NiFe sulfide catalysts with conventional reconfiguration of Ni-doped FeOOH. This work sheds light on the precise structures design under complicated electrochemical reconstruction and broadens the horizon of reconstruction chemistry to design low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis stands as a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, although its viability hinges on minimizing platinum (Pt) usage without sacrificing catalytic efficiency. Central to this challenge is enhancing the intrinsic activity of Pt while ensuring the stability of the catalyst. We herein present a Mo2TiC2 MXene-supported Pt nanocluster catalyst (Mo2TiC2-PtNC) that requires a minimal Pt content (36 μg cm-2) to function, yet remains highly active and stable. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical simulation provide evidence for anomalous charge transfer from the MXene substrate to PtNC, thus generating highly efficient electron-rich Pt sites for robust hydrogen evolution. When incorporated into a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, the catalyst affords more than 8700 h at 200 mA cm-2 under ambient temperature with a decay rate of just 2.2 μV h-1. All the performance metrics of the present Mo2TiC2-PtNC catalysts are on par with or even surpass those of current hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts under identical operation conditions, thereby challenging the monopoly of high-loading Pt/C-20% in the current electrolyzer design.

Foundation models of interatomic potentials, the so called universal potentials, may require fine-tuning or residual corrections when applied to specific subclasses of materials. In the present work, we demonstrate how such an augmentation can be accomplished via Δ-learning based on the representation already embedded in the universal potentials. The Δ-model introduced is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model, and various types of aggregation (global, species-separated, and atomic) of the representation vector are discussed. Employing a specific universal potential, CHGNet [Deng et al., Nat. Mach. Intell. 5, 1031 (2023)], in a global structure optimization setting, we find that it correctly describes the energetics of the “8” Cu oxide, which is an ultra-thin oxide film on Cu(111). The universal potential model even predicts a more favorable structure compared with that discussed in recent density functional theory-based literature. Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111), the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections. We demonstrate that these are efficiently provided via the GPR-based Δ-model formulated on CHGNet’s own internal atomic embedding representation. The need for corrections is tracked to the scarcity of metal–sulfur atomic environments in the materials project database that CHGNet is trained on, leading to an overreliance on sulfur–sulfur atomic environments. Other universal potentials trained on the same data, MACE-MP0, SevenNet-0, and ORB-v2-only-MPtrj, show a similar behavior but with varying degrees of error, demonstrating the general need for augmentation schemes for universal potential models.

Abstract The need to constrain the use of fossil fuels causing global warming is motivating the development of a variety of photocatalysts for solar‐to‐fuel generation and chemical synthesis. In particular, semiconductor‐based photocatalysts have been extensively exploited in solar‐driven organic synthesis, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion into value‐added products, and hydrogen (H 2 ) generation from water (H 2 O) splitting. Recently, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as an important class of semiconductors for heterogeneous photocatalysis owing to their interesting properties. Despite key issues with long‐term stability and degradation in polar solvents due to their ionic character, there has been significant progress in halide perovskite‐based photocatalysts with improving their stability and performance in the gas and liquid phases. This review discusses the state‐of‐the‐art for using halide perovskite‐based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysis in hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO 2 reduction into value‐added chemicals, and various organic chemical transformations. The different types of halide perovskites used, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents, and the efficiencies achieved are discussed. Furthermore, the outstanding challenges associated with the use of polar electrolytes and how the stability and performance can be improved are discussed.

Abstract Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are considered to be the most efficient catalyst for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, they are expensive and unstable, because of agglomeration and Ostwald ripening. It is critically necessary for developing a better catalytic support to stabilize the Pt nanoparticles at low loading amounts. One efficient route to improving both catalytic activity and durability is metal catalysts stably anchored on heteroatom functionalized carbon supports via their strong interactions. Nevertheless, the interactions between “metallic” catalysts and “nonmetallic” heteroatom functionalized carbon supports are still unsatisfactory. Here, “metalloid” antimony (Sb) functionalized graphitic nanoplatelets (SbGnP) are reported to stably anchor Pt nanoparticles. The resulting Pt@SbGnP catalyst shows a record high acidic HER performance, attributable to the unique nature of Sb functional groups on SbGnP. Unlike typical low‐period nonmetallic heteroatoms on carbon supports, high‐period metalloid Sb with various oxidation states of SbO x provided strong binding sites to stably anchor Pt nanoparticles, suppressing particle aggregation, and thus sustaining catalytic activity and stability.

Abstract Electrochemical co‐reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrates (CO 2 NO 3 RR) holds promise for sustainable urea production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sixteen‐electron transfer and unclear mechanistic understanding strongly impede its development. Here, combined experimental and computational approaches are employed to screen a series of metal phthalocyanine as model catalysts (MPcs, M = Zn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Fe) to uncover the activity‐selectivity trends in electrochemical CO 2 NO 3 RR. The theoretical simulations reveal that the thermodynamics of urea synthesis is significantly influenced by key intermediates, where the enhanced adsorption of *HOOCNO, coupled with reduced adsorptions of *N and *COOH, and moderate adsorption of *H 2 O, can significantly promote the urea production. ΔG *HOOCNO −ΔG *N −ΔG *COOH +ΔG *H2O as a potential descriptor is proposed for predicting the efficiency of CO 2 NO 3 RR toward urea formation. The findings provide systematic guidance for the future design of high‐efficiency catalysts for urea electrosynthesis, addressing a crucial need for sustainable nitrogen fixation.

Abstract Polyolefins are versatile materials for various purposes, but their functionality should be fine‐tuned for target applications including the mitigation of adverse environmental impacts. Producing such polymers with desired properties requires catalysts that can control polymerization at an atomistic level. However, complex reaction mechanisms and very limited experimental data make it difficult to design new efficient catalysts using conventional computational and data‐driven approaches. Here, we present a pragmatic strategy based on data‐efficient predictive models combined with a genetic algorithm to design new catalysts for controlled ethylene/hexene copolymerization. By deriving the chemically intuitive descriptors from the mechanistic analysis of the polymerization, we achieved the promising predictive models with small data applicable to various core structures and different experimental conditions, respectively. We screened catalysts through a virtual screening scheme combining a genetic algorithm and predictive models using chemically intuitive descriptors and considered their synthesizability through the manual inspections of experts. As a result, we successfully designed nine catalysts with desired comonomer ratios and diverse core structures.

Electrochemically mediated carbon capture presents an energy-efficient and cost-effective strategy to combat climate change due to its ability to utilize renewable energy and operate at ambient conditions. However, many current approaches suffer from operational instability and limited scalability potential due to a lack of reliable, low-cost redox-active absorbent materials. Here, we introduce a class of chemically robust and economical redox-tunable Brønsted acids to electrify amine carbon capture. The redox-tunable acids exhibit a reversible tunability in pKa spanning over 20 units in organic solvents in response to electrochemical potential, thereby enabling the regeneration of classic amines for CO2 separation via proton-coupled electron transfer. Remarkably, the RAs maintain their chemical integrity for over 400 h of operation in a symmetric carbon capture flow cell under 10% CO2 and 21% O2 at ambient temperature and pressure. By harnessing electrification, our approach can effectively mitigate shortcomings inherent to thermochemical carbon capture processes, facilitating a more sustainable drop-in replacement for incumbent amine scrubbing.
