Abstract Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to their 100% atomic utilization efficiency. The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to CO using SAC offers a promising approach for CO 2 utilization, but achieving facile CO 2 adsorption and CO desorption remains challenging for traditional SACs. Instead of singling out specific atoms, we propose a strategy utilizing atoms from the entire lanthanide (Ln) group to facilitate the CO 2 RR. Density functional theory calculations, operando spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate the bridging adsorption mechanism for a representative erbium (Er) single-atom catalyst. As a result, we realize a series of Ln SACs spanning 14 elements that exhibit CO Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. The Er catalyst achieves a high turnover frequency of ~130,000 h − 1 at 500 mA cm − 2 . Moreover, 34.7% full-cell energy efficiency and 70.4% single-pass CO 2 conversion efficiency are obtained at 200 mA cm − 2 with acidic electrolyte. This catalytic platform leverages the collective potential of the lanthanide group, introducing new possibilities for efficient CO 2 -to-CO conversion and beyond through the exploration of unique bonding motifs in single-atom catalysts.

Alkyl sulfonated polyimides (ASPIs), as alternative polymer electrolytes for fuel cells, are known to exhibit lyotropic liquid crystalline behavior upon water uptake, forming organized lamellar structures and achieving high proton conductivity. Previous experimental studies have shown that ASPIs with planar backbones exhibit enhanced proton conductivity (0.2 S/cm) compared to those with bent backbones (0.03 S/cm). To explain this difference at the atomistic level, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted using a universal neural network potential. The appearance of monomer unit length in planar ASPIs, indicating higher molecular order, was found to correlate with higher proton conductivity compared to that of bent ASPIs. Despite the similar deprotonation and solvation of sulfonic acid groups in both planar and bent ASPIs, the proton conductivity was independent of these factors. Directional mean square displacement analysis provided further insights into the differences in proton conductivity between planar and bent types.

Two-dimensional materials hold substantial promise for photocatalytic water splitting, primarily due to their unique structural properties and high-efficiency light absorption. However, finding such applicable materials poses a huge challenge because there are many strict requirements to meet. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to design and evaluate two monolayers, Sc2Se2X2 (X = Cl, Br), highlighting their potential as high-performance photocatalysts. these materials exhibit low activation energy barriers for water-splitting redox reactions, which facilitate high catalytic performance. The photogenerated electric field promotes oxygen adsorption, accelerating the overall reaction. The structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermodynamic stabilities of these materials are confirmed through comprehensive analyses. With band gaps of 2.65 and 2.40 eV, respectively, these materials meet the band gap requirements for photocatalytic water splitting. Furthermore, a prominent characteristic of these materials is their significantly high electron mobility along the y-axis, reaching 26,560.74 and 17,634.01 cm2 V-1 s-1, which far surpasses the hole mobility. This characteristic effectively reduces electron-hole recombination and enhances photocatalytic performance. With solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies of 13.60% and 20.58%, respectively, these materials surpass the 10% threshold required for commercial photocatalytic applications. These findings indicate that monolayer Sc2Se2X2 (X = Cl, Br) has great theoretical potential for photocatalytic water splitting.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized molecular simulation by providing efficient and accurate models for predicting atomic interactions. MLPs continue to advance and have had profound impact in applications that include drug discovery, enzyme catalysis, and materials design. The current landscape of MLP software presents challenges due to the limited interoperability between packages, which can lead to inconsistent benchmarking practices and necessitates separate interfaces with molecular dynamics (MD) software. To address these issues, we present DeePMD-GNN, a plugin for the DeePMD-kit framework that extends its capabilities to support external graph neural network (GNN) potentials.DeePMD-GNN enables the seamless integration of popular GNN-based models, such as NequIP and MACE, within the DeePMD-kit ecosystem. Furthermore, the new software infrastructure allows GNN models to be used within combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) applications using the range corrected ΔMLP formalism.We demonstrate the application of DeePMD-GNN by performing benchmark calculations of NequIP, MACE, and DPA-2 models developed under consistent training conditions to ensure fair comparison.

Abstract The dissolution and inactivation of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts remain significant barriers to the development of acidic water electrolysis. Here, the activity and stability of BaIrO 3 (BIO) perovskite are enhanced through the controlled regulation of metal‐oxygen octahedra via B‐site substitution with Co (BICO). During OER process, the dissolution of Ba and Co leads to the formation of highly active IrCoO x nanoparticles on the amorphous surface layers of BICO. The introduction of Co not only increases the concentration of high‐valence Ir species with high activity but also prevents the excessive oxidation and dissolution of Ir by taking over its oxidation role during the reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal a substantial reduction in the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (RDS) after Co doping. BICO‐2 electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional OER performance, requiring an overpotential of 216 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , while maintaining continuous operation for over 140 h without significant degradation, and boasting a stability number (S‐number) of 4.3 × 10 5 . Additionally, BICO‐2 exhibits excellent activity and durability in proton exchange membranes (PEM) water electrolysis. This work introduces a novel approach for designing and fabricating efficient, long‐lasting electrocatalysts, offering significant insights for advancing acidic water electrolysis technologies.

Transition metal oxides often undergo dynamic surface reconstruction under oxygen evolution reaction conditions to form the active state, which differs in response to the electrolyte pH. The resulting pH dependency of catalytic activity is commonly observed but poorly understood. Herein we track Co oxidation state changes at different pH-directed (hydr)oxide/electrolyte interfaces using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations. Combined with in situ electrochemical analyses, we establish correlations between Co redox dynamics, the flat band potential and Co oxidation state changes to explain the pH dependency of the oxygen evolution activity. Alkaline environments provide a low flat band potential that yields a low-potential Co redox transformation, which favours surface reconstruction. Neutral and acidic environments afford an anodic shift of the Co redox transformation that increases the catalytic overpotential. The larger overpotential in neutral environments is attributable to poor Co atom polarizability and slow Co oxidation state changes. These findings reveal that interfacial Co oxidation state changes directly determine the pH dependency of the oxygen evolution reaction activity.

Although noble metals Ag and Au have similar chemical reactivities, their catalytic selectivity for NO electroreduction is significantly different. Namely, hydroxylamine is often considerably produced on Ag while not observed on the Au electrode. In this study, first-principles calculations and the electric field controlling constant potential (EFC-CP) method are adopted to unveil the underlying reasons. We first reveal a distinct NO* adsorption configuration, vertical on Ag and inclined on Au, leading to different reduction pathways to NOH* and HNO*, respectively. Via complete electrochemical barrier calculations and detailed kinetic analysis, we find the hydroxylamine selectivity difference between Ag and Au is mainly induced by adsorption strength of NH2OH*. On Ag, the obtained NH2OH* prefers to desorb and produce hydroxylamine, while NH2OH* is bonded strongly to Au and favors further reduction to ammonia. The study advances our understanding of factors regulating product selectivity, providing crucial insights for designing NO electroreduction catalysts toward hydroxylamine production.

Developing efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for the continuous activation of oxidants is crucial to mitigating the global water resource crisis. Guided by computational predictions, this research achieved this goal through the synthesis of a modified graphitic carbon nitride with enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Its intrinsic activity was further amplified by dynamic in-situ reconstruction using the I−/I3− redox mediator system during photoreactions. Impressively, this reconstructed catalyst demonstrated the capability for at least 30 regeneration cycles while maintaining high purification efficacy. The mechanism underlying the in-situ reconstruction of active sites for periodate functionalization was elucidated through theoretical calculations, coupled with semi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical analyses. The system's capacity to detoxify recalcitrant pollutants was demonstrated through successful Escherichia coli cultivation and Zebrafish embryo experiments. The economic feasibility and environmental impacts are quantitatively assessed by the Electrical Energy per Order (EE/O) metric and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), confirming the system's scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. This dual-site constrained interlayer insertion, and controllable in-situ catalyst reconstruction achieve durable robustness of the photocatalyst, paving the way for the development of sustainable catalytic water purification technologies. Efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for sustained oxidant activation are vital for solving the global water crisis but elusive. Here, the authors explore the in situ dynamic reconstruction of graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts with iodine redox mediators, to develop a solar-driven Fenton-like system that activates periodate for effective and sustainable wastewater regeneration.

Abstract The stability and electronic properties of 2‐D conducting metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) play a crucial role in their potential applications in energy‐related processes. In this study, The structural stability and electronic characteristics of M 3 (C 6 Se 6 ) (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt) are systematically investigated using first‐principles calculations. Formation energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm the excellent thermodynamic and thermal stability of these frameworks. Additionally, density of states (DOS) analysis reveals that nine of these structures exhibit high electrical conductivity, making them promising for electronic and electrocatalytic applications. To further understand their electronic structure, the d ‐band center and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) are analyzed, providing insight into the bonding characteristics and electronic interactions within the frameworks. Moreover, the catalytic performance of the conductive MOFs is evaluated as multifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This study highlights the robust stability and tunable electronic properties of M 3 (C 6 Se 6 ), serving as a foundation for future investigations into their functional applications in energy conversion and storage technologies.

Abstract The primary hurdle faced in the practical application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) involves improving the intrinsic kinetic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts while concurrently enhancing their durability. Although electrocatalysts based on lattice oxygen‐mediated mechanism (LOM) have the potential to significantly enhance the activity in OER without being restricted by scaling relationships, they are neglected in acidic electrolytes due to limited durability. In this study, an innovative approach is presented to simultaneously promote the activation of lattice oxygen and improve the durability of LOM‐based OER electrocatalysts by incorporating d 0 metal ions into the RuO 2 electrocatalyst. Leveraging the unique electronic properties of the d 0 metal ion, the O 2p band center and Ru‐O covalency of the electrocatalyst are successfully engineered, resulting in the change in OER mechanism. Furthermore, in a single cell of PEMWE, the LOM‐based electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding performance, achieving 3.0 A cm −2 at 1.81 V and maintaining durability for 100 h at 200 mA cm −2 , surpassing commercial RuO 2 . This innovative strategy challenges the traditional viewpoint that suppressing lattice oxygen activation in OER is essential for enhancing PEMWE durability, offering new perspectives for the development of OER electrocatalysts in acidic electrolytes.

Designing efficient ligand-free heterogeneous catalysts for ethylene hydroformylation to produce C3 oxygenates is of importance for both fundamental research and practical applications, but it is often hindered by insufficient catalytic activity and selectivity. This work designs isolated rhodium-cobalt (Rh-Co) sites confined within a ZSM-5 zeolite to enhance ethylene hydroformylation rates and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability. By adjusting the Co/Al ratio in Co-ZSM-5, different sizes of Co are formed; subsequent Rh introduction produces isolated Rh1Cox clusters with different Rh-Co coordination numbers (CNs). In-situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that a Rh-Co CN of 3, corresponding to an isolated Rh1Co3 site, provides optimal bindings to reaction intermediates and thus achieves the highest hydroformylation rates among supported Rh-based catalysts. This study demonstrates the role of coordination-tuning via a secondary metal in effectively controlling the reaction pathway over single Rh atom catalysts.

Coal resources, due to their cheapness and high-energy density, are widely used in large quantities, causing greenhouse gas emissions in turn, and thus need to be utilized in a resourceful way to reduce carbon emissions. Herein, we designed an alternative route of value-added utilization using coal-based activated carbon support loaded with Fe nanoparticles for CO2 hydrogenation to liquid fuels. The coal-based derived carbon support with tunable structure, elemental composition, defects, and special surface area controlled by a proposed two-step coking-activation strategy, in which special scale-like or alveolate structures were obtained. It was demonstrated by characterization that the structure and defect of the carbon support affect the carburization behavior of iron species, and then the highest Fe5C2 content was found on FeK@AC-2.0-750 catalyst. The high level of exposure of active χ-Fe5C2 sites presents benign liquid fuel selectivity. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and DFT calculation further support the improved carbon chain propagation over χ-Fe5C2 rather than θ-Fe3C. Compared with commercial carbon supports, its loaded Fe-based catalyst has a better performance with 29.3% CO2 conversion and 58.8% C5+ selectivity, respectively. These results provide new insights into the development of novel nanocarbons and the efficient utilization of coal-based resources as well as broaden the design of efficient iron-based catalysts for C1 chemistry.

The electrochemical synthesis of commodity chemicals such as epoxides and glycols offers a sustainable alternative to conventional methods that involve hazardous chemicals. Efforts to improve the yield and selectivity of propylene oxidation using Pd-based catalysts have been shown to be highly sensitive to applied potential, pH, and electrochemical cell design. Record efficiencies and yields were obtained by substitution of PdO by 4d or 5d transition metals, including Pt, with thus far little rationale regarding the origin for the improvement. Through electrochemical analysis, scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the mechanism of propylene oxidation on Pd-based catalysts. We demonstrate that adsorbates forming on PdO, where Pd adopts a square-planar coordination [PdO4], differ from that forming on the surface of oxidized metallic Pd catalysts with an oxo intermediate mediating propylene oxidation on PdO. We further show that Pt substitution in PdO does not modify this oxo intermediate. Varying pH, we found that the onset for propylene oxidation is pH independent, indicating a potential-determining step where the proton is not involved in and similar reaction pathway in acidic and near-neutral conditions. Finally, our work undoubtedly demonstrates that high Faradaic efficiency toward propylene glycol and propylene oxide formation, such as those previously reported in the literature, can be achieved by means of electrode engineering and mastery of mass transport and local pH. Notably, we achieved ≈100% faradaic efficiency for propylene glycol at 1.7 V vs RHE in acidic media using a Pt-substituted PdO catalyst loaded onto a gas diffusion electrode.

Unveiling structure-activity correlations at the sub-nanoscale remains an essential challenge in catalysis science. During electrocatalysis, dynamic structural evolution drives the ambiguous entanglement of crystals and electrons degrees of freedom that obscure the activity origin. Here, we track the structural evolution of Ni-based model pre-catalysts (Ni(OH)2, NiS2, NiSe2, NiTe), detailing their catalytically active state during water oxidation via operando techniques and theoretical calculations. We reveal the sub-nanometric structural difference of NiO6 unit with a regular distortion in the reconstructed active phase NiOOH, codetermined by the geometric (bond lengths) and electronic (covalency) structure of the pre-catalysts on both spatial and temporal scales. The symmetry-broken active units induce the delicate balance of the p and d orbitals in NiOOH, further steering the modulation of catalytic intermediate configurations and mechanisms, with improved performance. This work recognizes the fine structural differences of the active phases from the sub-nanometer scale, and quantitatively explains their influence on activity. Our findings provide a more intuitive design framework for high-efficiency materials through targeted symmetry engineering of active units. Unveiling structure-activity correlations is essential in catalysis science. Here, the authors report the structural evolution of Ni-based pre-catalysts during the reaction and demonstrate how sub-nanometric variations affect catalytic performance in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.

Electrocatalysis is one of the key technologies for developing sustainable and fossil resource free routes to produce fuels and chemicals. The limiting potential (UL), defined by the reaction free energy of the most difficult electrochemical step in a given pathway, is an effective descriptor for establishing the activity trend of a set of electrocatalysts, allowing high throughput screening of new catalysts. However, the reaction network of electrocatalytic processes is rather complex, especially for the reactions with necessary thermochemical steps, e.g., the synthesis of valuable C–N bond-containing chemicals. Thermochemical steps cannot be significantly enhanced by electrode potentials, where kinetics is a non-negligible issue at even high overpotentials. This makes it challenge by using limiting potential to accurately describe activity trends for the reactions with necessary thermochemical steps. To this end, we propose an effective scheme to determine an improved descriptor. We suggest refining the rather complex reaction network at first. In particular, it is suggested to decouple electro- and thermochemical steps and exclude the unfavorable pathways with an excessively high thermochemical barrier. Then, a global comparison among the other pathways can be made, to determine the optimal pathway and the improved descriptor (the reaction free energy of the most difficult step of the optimal pathway, defined as ΔGrRPD-limiting). In addition, the studies on reaction kinetics are also suggested to understand the exception of the best catalysts and provide the direction of experimental optimization. This scheme is of a great compromise between practical efficiency and the accuracy toward the rational design of electrocatalysts.

We present the first six-dimensional quantum dynamics study of HCl on a strained pseudomorphic monolayer of Au deposited on a Cu(111) substrate, utilizing a newly developed machine learning-based potential energy surface. The strain in the surface lattice, resulting from a 12.62% compression of the Au monolayer, induces a significant high barrier height (1.81 eV) and a tight saddle point. These effects lead to a marked suppression of the reactivity of ground-state HCl (v = 0) on Au/Cu(111), while the dissociation probability of vibrationally excited (v = 1) HCl increases substantially. As a result, the vibrational efficiency is notably higher compared to those for HCl on pure Au(111) and alloyed Au/Ag(111) surfaces. In addition, the surface strain induces a distinctive rotational alignment effect in the title reaction, where for HCl in the (v = 0, j) states, dissociation is most favorable when an HCl molecule collides with its rotation perpendicular to the Au/Cu(111) surface (the cartwheel alignment). In contrast, for HCl in the (v = 1, j) states, the opposite (helicopter) alignment is preferred. This leads to a pronounced difference in the effects of rotational excitation, depending on whether HCl is initially in the ground or excited vibrational state.

It is challenging to clarify modulation mechanisms and structure-activity relationships in the ion-regulation engineering of multinary copper chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs) for solar-to-hydrogen conversion. Herein, quaternary 2D Cu-In-Zn-S NCs are fabricated using various indium precursors to expose a high proportion of (0002) crystal facets that are positively correlated with their photocatalytic activities. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the specific adsorption of anions on the crystal facets significantly influences their anisotropic growth and, in turn, photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, 2D Cu-In-Ga-Zn-S (CIGZS) NCs are prepared by partially or completely substituting In3+ with Ga3+ cations. As the Ga3⁺ content gradually increases, the resulting photocatalytic activities follow a bell-shaped trend. The initial increase is attributed to a synergistic effect of optimized catalytic ability and a stronger electron driving force introduced by Ga3⁺ incorporation. However, excessive Ga3⁺ substitution widens the bandgap, reducing light absorption and conversion, ultimately leading to a decline in photocatalytic activities. Notably, the photocatalytic activity of Cu-Ga-Zn-S NCs with the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1566.8 µmol g-1 h-1 under visible light surpassed those of all In-based NCs due to enhanced electron-hole separation efficiency and highly effective active sites. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of multinary copper-based photocatalysts for solar-driven hydrogen production.

Efficient precision livestock farming relies on having timely access to data and information that accurately describes both the animals and their surrounding environment. This paper advances classification of goat vocalizations leveraging a publicly available dataset recorded at diverse farms breeding different species. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored for classifying goat vocalizations, yielding an average classification rate of 95.8% in discriminating various goat emotional states. To this end, we suitably augmented the existing dataset using pitch shifting and time stretching techniques boosting the robustness of the trained model. After thoroughly demonstrating the superiority of the designed architecture over the contrasting approaches, we provide insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the proposed CNN by carrying out an extensive interpretation study. More specifically, we conducted an explainability analysis to identify the time-frequency content within goat vocalisations that significantly impacts the classification process. Such an XAI-driven validation not only provides transparency in the decision-making process of the CNN model but also sheds light on the acoustic features crucial for distinguishing the considered classes. Last but not least, the proposed solution encompasses an interactive scheme able to provide valuable information to animal scientists regarding the analysis performed by the model highlighting the distinctive components of the considered goat vocalizations. Our findings underline the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques in bolstering classification accuracy and highlight the significance of leveraging XAI methodologies for validating and interpreting complex machine learning models applied to animal vocalizations.
