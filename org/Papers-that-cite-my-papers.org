Abstract Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are excellent precursors for preparing transition metal and nitrogen co‐doped carbon catalysts, which have been widely utilized in the field of electrocatalysis since their initial development. However, the original MOFs derived catalysts have been greatly limited in their development and application due to their disadvantages such as metal atom aggregation, structural collapse, and narrow pore channels. Recently, surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts have attracted much attention from researchers due to their advantages such as hierarchical porous structure, increased specific surface area, and many exposed active sites. This review mainly focuses on the synthesis methods of surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts and comprehensively introduces the action of surfactants in MOFs derived materials and the structure‐activity relationship between the catalysts and the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Apparently, the aims of this review not only introduce the status of surfactants‐assisted MOFs derived catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis but also contribute to the rational design and synthesis of MOFs derived catalysts for fuel cells, metal–air cells, and electrolysis of water toward hydrogen production.

Abstract Research on the production and utilization of hydrogen energy is essential to overcome the environmental issues caused by fossil fuels. Herein, we anchor PtNi nanoalloy clusters (Pt‐Ni NACs) on nitrogen‐doped graphene oxide (NrGO) by a facile microwave‐assisted synthesis and analyze the variations of catalyst properties based on the PtNi composition and the presence of nitrogen. Ni inclusion in the Pt matrix can induce lattice strain and change the electronic structure, while the doped nitrogen into the graphene can enhance electron transfer and improve the durability of the catalyst through strong chemical bonding with the alloy clusters. TEM analysis discovers that the NACs are uniformly decorated in a few‐nanometer‐size on the graphene surface, and the formation of the PtNi NACs and structural changes according to composition are confirmed through XRD and XPS. In addition, the structural changes due to N‐doping and its bonding with the NACs are observed through Raman spectroscopy and XPS. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Pt 2.6 Ni NACs/NrGO exhibits the highest ORR onset potential (0.893 V) and the lowest HER overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 (22 mV) among other catalysts, and those activities are almost unchanged under long‐term durability tests. From these results, Pt 2.6 Ni NACs/NrGO is utilized in a zinc‐air battery (ZAB) system, demonstrating better battery performance than commercial Pt and Ir‐based catalysts. Moreover, it is applied to hydrogen collection, showing linear trend in hydrogen production over time, confirming the catalyst's availability in hydrogen production and utilization. image

Abstract Molecularly‐modified electrode materials that maintain stability over a broad pH range are rare. Typically, each electrochemical transformation necessitates a specifically tuned system to achieve strong binding and high activity of the catalyst. Here, we report the functionalisation of mesoporous indium tin oxide (mITO) electrodes with the macrocyclic host molecule pillar[6]arene (PA[6]). These electrodes are stable within the pH range of 2.4–10.8 and can be equipped with electrochemically active ruthenium complexes through host–guest interactions to perform various oxidation reactions. Benzyl alcohol oxidation serves as a model reaction in acidic media, while ammonia oxidation is conducted to assess the systems performance under basic conditions. PA[6]‐modified electrodes demonstrate catalytic activity for both reactions when complexed to different guest molecules and can be reused by reabsorption of the catalyst after its degradation. Furthermore, the system can be employed to perform subsequent reactions in electrolyte with varying pH, enabling the same electrode to be utilised in multiple different electrocatalytic reactions.

Abstract Single‐atom catalysis is gaining interest also because of its potential applications in a broad spectrum of electrochemical reactions. The reactivity of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) is typically modeled with first principles approaches taking insight from heterogenous catalysis. An increasing number of studies show that the chemistry of SACs is more complex than often assumed, and shares many aspects in common with coordination chemistry. This evidence raises challenges for computational electrocatalysis of SACs. In this perspective we highlight a few fundamental ingredients that one need to consider to provide reliable predictions on the reactivity of SACs for electrochemical applications. We discuss the role of the local coordination of the metal active phase, the need to use self‐interaction corrected functionals, in particular when systems have magnetic ground states. We highlight the formation of unconventional intermediates with respect to classical metal electrodes, the need to include the stability of SACs in electrochemical conditions and the role of solvation in the analysis of new potential catalytic systems. This brief account can be considered as a tutorial underlining the importance of treating the reactivity of SACs. In fact, neglecting some of these aspects could lead to unreliable predictions failing in the design of new electrocatalysts.

Developing efficient electrocatalysts for acidic electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) holds considerable significance, while the selectivity and stability of most materials are compromised under acidic conditions. Herein, we demonstrate that constructing amorphous platinum–selenium (Pt–Se) shells on crystalline Pt cores can manipulate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway to efficiently catalyze the electrosynthesis of H2O2 in acids. The Se2‒Pt nanoparticles, with optimized shell thickness, exhibit over 95% selectivity for H2O2 production, while suppressing its decomposition. In flow cell reactor, Se2‒Pt nanoparticles maintain current density of 250 mA cm−2 for 400 h, yielding a H2O2 concentration of 113.2 g L−1 with productivity of 4160.3 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for effective organic dye degradation. The constructed amorphous Pt–Se shell leads to desirable O2 adsorption mode for increased selectivity and induces strain for optimized OOH* binding, accelerating the reaction kinetics. This selenization approach is generalizable to other noble metals for tuning 2e‒ ORR pathway. Developing efficient catalysts for acidic electrosynthesis of H2O2 is desirable, while most materials are compromised in acidic conditions. Here, the authors report that constructing amorphous Pt–Se shells on crystalline Pt cores can regulate the reaction pathway to efficiently produce H2O2 in acid.

While high-entropy alloys (HEAs) present exponentially large compositional space for alloy design, they also create enormous computational challenges to trace the compositional space, especially for the inherently expensive density functional theory calculations (DFT). Recent works have integrated machine learning into DFT to overcome these challenges. However, often these models require an intensive search of appropriate physics-based descriptors. In this paper, we employ a 3D convolutional neural network over just one descriptor, i.e., the charge density derived from DFT, to simplify and bypass the hunt for the descriptors. We show that the elastic constants of face-centered cubic multi-elemental alloys in the Ni–Cu–Au–Pd–Pt system can be predicted from charge density. In addition, using our recent PREDICT approach, we show that the model can be trained only on the charge densities of simpler binary and ternary alloys to effectively predict elastic constants in complex multi-elemental alloys, thereby further enabling easier property-tracing in the large compositional space of HEAs.

During the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) on copper catalysts, linear-bonded CO (*COL) is commonly regarded as the key intermediate for the CO-CO coupling step, which leads to the formation of multicarbon products. In this work, we unveil the significant role of bridge-bonded *CO (*COB) as an active species. By combining in situ Raman spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we show that adsorbed *OH domains displace *COL to *COB. The electroreduction of a 12CO+13CO2 cofeed demonstrates that *COB distinctly favors the production of acetate and 1-propanol, while *COL favors ethylene and ethanol formation. This work enhances our understanding of the mechanistic intricacies of eCO(2)RR and suggests new directions for designing operational conditions by modifying the competitive adsorption of surface species, thereby steering the reaction toward specific multicarbon products.

Microstructurally distorted Pt-based nanoalloys with unusual structural defects like Guinier–Preston (GP) zones with in situ coherency strain fields may be suitable for substantially improving their electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions. Herein, GP zones contributing PtCu nanoalloys were first fabricated by additive manufacturing, starting with the formation of metallic Cu clusters as orderly crystal nuclei on ZIF-8-derived carbon, followed by the additive manufacturing of chemically reduced Pt and Cu on the formed clusters in ethylene glycol at 190 °C. The atomic-scale GP zones give rise to high-level coherent strain fields across the nanocrystals, boosting the ORR kinetics. This catalyst exhibits an ultrahigh oxygen reduction half-wave potential of 0.934 V (vs RHE) and a mass activity (MA) of 0.68 A mgPt–1. After the accelerated degradation test of 50,000 cycles, the achieved MA improved instead of decreasing, rising from 0.68 to 0.89 A mgPt–1, surpassing that of commercial Pt/C significantly. The significantly improved activity is attributed to the coherency strain fields reshaping the band structure and reconstructing a favorable charge density for active Pt sites. Importantly, the interface-anchored GP zones, maintaining a completely coherent relationship with the matrix, can effectively impede metal atom migration, segregation, or leaching, thus enhancing long-term stability. Therefore, the novel GP-type alloys may pave another way for designing advanced catalysts in the realm of current energy storage and conversion fields like fuel cells.

Abstract We report the results of systematic ab initio modelling of various configurations of iron and cobalt impurities embedded in the (110), (101), and (100) surfaces of anatase TiO 2 , with and without oxygen vacancies. The simulation results demonstrate that incorporation into interstitial voids at the surface level is significantly more favourable than other configurations for both iron and cobalt. The calculations also demonstrate the crucial effect of the facet as well as the lesser effects of other factors, such as vacancies and strain on the energetics of defect incorporation, magnetic moment, bandgap, and catalytic performance. It is further shown that there is no tendency towards the segregation or clustering of impurities on the surface. The calculated free energies of the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media predict that iron impurities embedded in the (101) surface of anatase TiO 2 can be a competitive catalyst for this reaction.

Abstract The strength and nature of adsorption of imidazolium‐based tetraflouroborate ionic liquid (IL) on platinum surface has been investigated via first principle‐based density functional theory method. Adsorption of both IL cation and IL ion‐pair as a function of increasing alkyl chain length is taken into consideration. Three different orientations of ionic liquid cations are found to be stable with higher adsorption energy noticed for the alkyl chain parallel to the platinum surface. The anions are found to stabilize the IL cation orientation where the alkyl chain is oriented perpendicular the platinum surface. These results are further corroborated by the charge transfer analysis and electron density difference maps. The significant charge transfer between the ionic liquid pair and the surface indicates electrochemical applications for systems involving electrolytes and metal surface, where electrostatic interactions play a major role. The results of this investigation can be helpful for further analysis of electrode–electrolyte systems as well as the development of force field parameters for these systems.

Abstract Proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells demand highly efficient catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction, and core-shell structures are known for maximizing precious metal utilization. Here, we reported a controllable “carbon defect anchoring” strategy to prepare Pt 1 Ni 1 @Pt/C core-shell nanoparticles with an average size of ~2.6 nm on an in-situ transformed defective carbon support. The strong Pt–C interaction effectively inhibits nanoparticle migration or aggregation, even after undergoing stability tests over 70,000 potential cycles, resulting in only 1.6% degradation. The stable Pt 1 Ni 1 @Pt/C catalysts have high oxygen reduction reaction mass activity and specific activity that reach 1.424 ± 0.019 A/mg Pt and 1.554 ± 0.027 mA/cm Pt 2 at 0.9 V, respectively, attributed to the optimal compressive strain. The experimental results are generally consistent with the theoretical predictions made by our comprehensive microkinetic model which incorporates essential kinetics and thermodynamics of oxygen reduction reaction. The consistent results obtained in our study provide compelling evidence for the high accuracy and reliability of our model. This work highlights the synergy between theory-guided catalyst design and appropriate synthetic methodologies to translate the theory into practice, offering valuable insights for future catalyst development.

Understanding the atomic-level mechanism of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on MXene materials is crucial for developing affordable HER catalysts, while their complex surface terminations present a substantial challenge. Herein, employing constant-potential grand canonical density functional theory calculations, we elucidate the reaction kinetics of the HER on MXenes with various surface terminations by taking experimentally reported Mo

The electrocatalytic performance of VSe2 doped with nonmetals (NMs) was studied using density functional theory, in which NM atoms (C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I) replaced Se or V (denoted as NM@Se or NM@V). Notably, P@V and Br@V monolayers exhibit high catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction activity with the lowest ΔGH* = 0.08 eV and −0.03 eV, respectively, surpassing Pt (ΔGH* = −0.1 eV). By applying the scaling relationship of ΔGH* of H*, which is an intermediate for each volcano, the exchange current density diagrams are established. Based on thermodynamic analysis, P@V and Br@V monolayers produce exchange currents of about −1.42 and −0.70i0/(A cm−2), respectively. The oxygen evolution reaction activity of the I@Se monolayer (ηOER = 0.95 V) is the best among all the monolayers. Among the oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, the O@Se monolayer displays high activity with a low ηORR (0.82 V), which is even better than that of binary Pt and Pd alloys (0.9–0.87 V).

Machine-learning interatomic potential models based on graph neural network architectures have the potential to make atomistic materials modeling widely accessible due to their computational efficiency, scalability, and broad applicability. The training datasets for many such models are derived from density-functional theory calculations, typically using a semilocal exchange-correlation functional. As a result, long-range interactions such as London dispersion are often missing in these models. We investigate whether this missing component can be addressed by combining a graph deep learning potential with semiempirical dispersion models. We assess this combination by deriving the equations of state for layered pnictogen chalcohalides BiTeBr and BiTeI and performing crystal structure optimizations for a broader set of V–VI–VII compounds with various stoichiometries, many of which possess van der Waals gaps. We characterize the optimized crystal structures by calculating their x-ray diffraction patterns and radial distribution function histograms, which are also used to compute Earth mover’s distances to quantify the dissimilarity between the optimized and corresponding experimental structures. We find that dispersion-corrected graph deep learning potentials generally (though not universally) provide a more realistic description of these compounds due to the inclusion of van der Waals attractions. In particular, their use results in systematic improvements in predicting not only the van der Waals gap but also the layer thickness in layered V–VI–VII compounds. Our results demonstrate that the combined potentials studied here, derived from a straightforward approach that neither requires fine-tuning the training nor refitting the potential parameters, can significantly improve the description of layered polar crystals.

Heterogeneous catalysis, as a key technology in modern chemical industries, plays a vital role in social progress and economic development. However, its complex reaction process poses challenges to theoretical research. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are gradually becoming a key tool in this field as they can intrinsically learn atomic representation and consider connection relationship, making them naturally applicable to atomic and molecular systems. This article introduces the basic principles, current network architectures, and datasets of GNNs and reviews the application of GNN in heterogeneous catalysis from accelerating the materials screening and exploring the potential energy surface. In the end, we summarize the main challenges and potential application prospects of GNNs in future research endeavors.
