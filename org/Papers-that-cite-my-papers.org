To address the ongoing challenges posed by the SARS-CoV-2 and potentially stronger viruses in the future, the development of effective methods to fabricate patterned graphene (PG) and other precisely functional products has become a new research frontier. Herein, we modeled the "checkerboard" graphene (CG) and stripped graphene (SG) as representatives of PG, and studied their interaction mechanism with the target protein (M

Using an ultrahigh resolution (ΔE∼0.1eV) setup to measure electronic features in x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments at the European XFEL in Germany, we have studied the collective plasmon excitation in aluminium at ambient conditions, which we can measure very accurately even at low momentum transfers. As a result, we can resolve previously reported discrepancies between time-dependent density functional theory simulations and experimental observations. The demonstrated capability for high-resolution XRTS measurements will be a game changer for the diagnosis of experiments with matter under extreme densities, temperatures, and pressures, and unlock the full potential of state-of-the-art x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities to study planetary interior conditions, to understand inertial confinement fusion applications, and for material science and discovery.

Altermagnets (AM) is a recently discovered class of collinear magnets that share some properties (anomalous transport, etc) with ferromagnets, some (zero net magnetization) with antiferromagnets, while also exhibiting unique properties (spin-splitting of electronic bands and resulting spin-splitter current). Since the moment compensation in AM is driven by symmetry, it must be possible to identify them by analyzing the crystal structure directly, without computing the electronic structure. Given the significant potential of AM for spintronics, it is very useful to have a tool for such an analysis. This work presents an open-access code implementing such a direct check.

Abstract Theory‐guided materials design is an effective strategy for designing catalysts with high intrinsic activity whilst minimizing the usage of expensive metals like platinum. As proof‐of‐concept, herein it demonstrates that using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental validation that intermetallic PtCo 3 alloy nanoparticles offer enhanced electrocatatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to Pt nanoparticles. DFT calculations established that PtCo 3 (111) surfaces possess better intrinsic ORR activity compared to Pt(111) surfaces, owing to the synergistic action of adjacent Pt and Co active sites which optimizes the binding strength of ORR intermediates to boost overall ORR kinetics. With this understanding, a PtCo 3 /NC catalyst, comprising PtCo 3 nanoparticles exposing predominantly (111) facets dispersed on an N‐doped carbon support, is successfully fabricated. PtCo 3 /NC demonstrates a high specific activity (3.4 mA cm −2 mg Pt −1 ), mass activity (0.67 A mg Pt −1 ), and cycling stability for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH, significantly outperforming a commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, a zinc‐air battery (ZAB) assembled with PtCo 3 /NC as the air‐electrode catalyst delivered an open‐circuit voltage of 1.47 V, a specific capacity of 775.1 mAh g Zn −1 and excellent operation durability after 200 discharge/charge cycles, vastly superior performance to a ZAB built using commercial Pt/C+IrO 2 as the air‐electrode catalyst.

We present in situ measurements of spectrally resolved X-ray scattering and X-ray diffraction from monocrystalline diamond samples heated with an intense pulse of heavy ions. In this way, we determine the samples’ heating dynamics and their microscopic and macroscopic structural integrity over a timespan of several microseconds. Connecting the ratio of elastic to inelastic scattering with state-of-the-art density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations allows the inference of average temperatures around 1300 K, in agreement with predictions from stopping power calculations. The simultaneous diffraction measurements show no hints of any volumetric graphitization of the material, but do indicate the onset of fracture in the diamond sample. Our experiments pave the way for future studies at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, where a substantially increased intensity of the heavy ion beam will be available.

Development of low temperature catalytic pyrolysis technology for heated tobacco sheets is expected to increase the aroma of heated tobacco products and improve their overall smoking quality. In this study, the low temperature pyrolysis performances of heated tobacco sheets catalyzed by various anionic sodium salts were investigated using TG-DTG, Py-GC-MS technology and smoke routine chemical composition analysis. The results showed that the total weight loss between 100°C and 300°C increased by 7.8%–13.15% after adding various anionic sodium salts, among which, sodium acetate and sodium tartrate showed a relatively higher weight loss. The relative content of free hydroxyacetone, furfuryl alcohol, butyrolactone and megastigmatrienone in the pyrolysis gas increased, while the relative content of free nicotine decreased. With the change of anionic species, the catalytic decomposition ability of cellulose, lignin, and other substances may change, resulting in the distribution alteration of compounds in the pyrolysis gas. After adding sodium acetate and sodium citrate, the release of total particulate matter (TPM), glycerol, and nicotine in flue gas increased. Overall, the addition of sodium acetate and sodium citrate showed a higher low temperature pyrolysis performance of heated tobacco sheets. The research results in this paper provide data support for changing the low temperature catalytic pyrolysis performance of heated tobacco sheets by adjusting the type of anions in sodium salts.

In the recent era of green and sustainable energy, the demand for effective and efficient energy harvesting has dramatically increased. Piezoelectric energy harvesting, which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, is considered a viable strategy to achieve this goal. Janus-type nanomaterial, a noncentrosymmetric material with different elemental species in the upper and lower atomic layers, has gained interest due to its exotic properties compared to conventional bulk and symmetric materials. In this work, we systematically design and investigate a new class of Janus nanomaterials with enhanced intrinsic polarization via the successive ionic exchange method. Multiple layers of stability standards, including both thermodynamic and dynamic stabilities, are employed in the high-throughput screening procedure of novel Janus-type nanomaterials. The newly proposed Janus-type nanomaterials exhibit more than 10 times higher piezoelectric response compared to that of reported low-dimensional materials and even comparable to that of bulk materials.

Abstract The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells (HEMFCs) are promising but lack of high‐performance anode hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) electrocatalysts. The platinum group metals (PGMs) have the HOR activity in alkaline medium two to three orders of magnitude lower than those in acid, leading to the high required PGMs amount on anode to achieve high HEMFC performance. The mechanism study demonstrates the hydrogen binding energy of the catalyst determines the alkaline HOR kinetics, and the adsorbed OH and water on the catalyst surface promotes HOR. Iridium (Ir) has a unique advantage for alkaline HOR due to its similar hydrogen binding energy to Pt and enhanced adsorption of OH. However, the HOR activity of Ir/C is still unsatisfied in practical HEMFC applications. Further fine tuning the adsorption of the intermediate on Ir‐based catalysts is of great significance to improve their alkaline HOR activity, which can be reasonably realized by structure design and composition regulation. In this concept, we address the current understanding about the alkaline HOR mechanism and summarize recent advances of Ir‐based electrocatalysts with enhanced alkaline HOR activity. We also discuss the perspectives and challenges on Ir‐based electrocatalysts in the future.

Abstract Methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, has a high energy density and is widely used as chemical feedstocks or fuels. Converting CO 2 to methane through electrochemical reduction offers a promising strategy for managing the global carbon balance, but is a challenge due to the lack of effective electrocatalysts. Herein, the Co single atom catalyst supported by MoS 2 antisite defect (Co‐Mo S2 ) is designed from both the activity and selectivity aspects. By virtue of i) moderately electron‐deficient state (Co δ+ ) ensuring efficient CO 2 activation and HER suppression; ii) the strong adsorption capability for intermediate enhancing selectivity; iii) the single atomic active site avoiding the formation of C 2 products, Co‐Mo S2 could selectively convert CO 2 to CH 4 with a limiting potential of −0.45 V vs . RHE, which outperforms most of the present catalysts, and is expected to be a promising substitution for Cu‐based catalysts.

Abstract Electrocatalytic selectivity is often discussed at the atomic level on the basis of the active site, while ignoring more subtle effects of mesoscopic mass transport. Here we show how transport controls selectivity through the exchange of surface-bound reaction intermediates between the electrode and bulk electrolyte. We argue that the arising kinetic competition changes with the catalyst’s surface area and can become relevant for technologically important reactions including, for example, different products during the electrochemical CO 2 reduction on Cu-based catalysts. Combining microkinetic and transport modelling in a multi-scale approach, we specifically explore and quantify this effect for various showcase examples in the experimental literature. Despite its simplicity, our model correctly reproduces selectivity trends with respect to catalyst roughness on all meso-, micro- and atomic scales. The resulting insight provides an alternative or, at least, complementary explanation to changes in electrocatalytic selectivity that have otherwise been attributed to nano-structuring of active sites or electronic effects due to doping or alloying.

Interfacial charge transfer reactions involving cations and electrons are fundamental to (photo/electro) catalysis, energy storage, and beyond. Lithium-coupled electron transfer (LCET) at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is a preeminent example to highlight the importance of charge transfer in modern-day society. The thermodynamics of LCET reactions define the minimal energy for charge/discharge of LIBs, and yet, these parameters are rarely available in the literature. Here, we demonstrate the successful incorporation of tungsten oxides (WO x ) within a chemically stable Zr-based metal−organic framework (MOF), MOF-808. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the composite, WO x @MOF-808, in Li + -containing acetonitrile (MeCN)-based electrolytes showed an irreversible, cathodic Faradaic feature that shifted in a Nernstian fashion with respect to the Li + concentration, i.e., ∼59 mV/log [(Li + )]. The Nernstian dependence established 1:1 stoichiometry of Li + and e − . Using the standard redox potential of Li +/0 , the apparent free energy of lithiation of WO x @MOF-808 (ΔG app,Li ) was calculated to be −36 ± 1 kcal mol −1 . ΔG app,Li is an intrinsic parameter of WO x @MOF-808, and thus by deriving the similar reaction free energies of other metal oxides, their direct comparisons can be achieved. Implications of the reported measurements will be further contrasted to proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions on metal oxides.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting offers an advancing approach to producing highly pure hydrogen and oxygen, motivated by the prevalence of a low‐carbon economy and the goal of a sustainable future. The customized modulation of electronic structures enables the electrocatalyst to directionally promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a promising shortcut to overall water splitting (OWS). Herein, 3D homologous WSeS/CoSeS heterojunction nanoarrays (WSeS/CoSeS NAs) and W‐doped CoSeS nanoarrays (W‐CoSeS NAs) are investigated. Abundant heterointerfaces within WSeS/CoSeS NAs facilitate HER kinetics, boosting mass diffusivity, and increasing carrier separation and transfer process. High‐valence W 6+ doping into CoSeS prevents phase separation and stabilizes Co sites by charge offset effect, leading to enhanced OER. Consequently, the WSeS/CoSeS NAs and W‐CoSeS NAs reach 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of 43.8 and 233.3 mV in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, when asymmetrically engaged as an electrolyzer, this configuration exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performances (cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm −2 ) with satisfying stability and mechanical robustness (over 1000 h at 1000 mA cm −2 ). The modulation and manufacture of reaction‐property‐oriented materials are experimentally and theoretically validated potential, illuminating the light of inspiration for multiple applications.

Abstract Although lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs) hold great promise as future energy storage systems, they are impeded by insulated discharge product Li 2 O 2 and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution revolution (ORR/OER) kinetics. The application of a highly efficient cathode catalyst determines the LOBs performance. The d‐band modulation and catalytic kinetics promotion are important concept guidelines for the performance enhancement of cathode catalysts. In this work, the homogeneous in‐plane distortion‐derived synergistic catalytic capability of an Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 catalyst with modulated d‐band centers and promoted ORR/OER kinetics is demontrated. The uniform elongation of Ag─O bonds and compression of Mo─O bonds in (020) plane leads to d‐band splitting and d‐band center optimization and delivers improved adsorption behavior for high ORR/OER capability. Furthermore, the spatial and energy overlap of Ag d xz and O 2 anti‐bonding π * orbitals facilitate electron injection during ORR process and reduce the energy barrier for charge transfer and O 2 desorption during OER process, accelerating the ORR/OER kinetics. As a result, the (020) plane‐exposed Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 cathode exhibits ultralong cycle stability of 817 cycles at 500 mA g −1 and large specific discharge/charge capacities of 15898/15180 mAh g −1 . This work provides facile concept guidance for optimizing catalytic capability through controlled lattice distortion in cathode catalysts for LOBs.

Molecular volcano plots, which facilitate the rapid prediction of the activity and selectivity of prospective catalysts, have emerged as powerful tools for computational catalysis. Here, we integrate microkinetic modeling into the volcano plot framework to develop "microkinetic molecular volcano plots". The resulting unified computational framework allows the influence of important reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, and concentration, to be quickly incorporated and more complex situations, such as off-cycle resting states and coupled catalytic cycles, to be tackled. Compared to previous generations of molecular volcanoes, these microkinetic counterparts offer a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic behavior, in which selectivity and product ratios can be explicitly determined by tracking the evolution of each product concentration over time. This is demonstrated by examining two case studies, rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation and metal-catalyzed hydrosilylation, in which the unique insights provided by microkinetic modeling, as well as the ability to simultaneously screen catalysts and reaction conditions, are highlighted. To facilitate the construction of these plots/maps, we introduce mikimo, a Python program that seamlessly integrates with our previously developed automated volcano builder, volcanic.

The electrochemical synthesis of urea under mild conditions is considered a promising alternative to the harsh industrial Haber-Bosch process. However, the development of highly active and selective electrocatalysts remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a novel mechanism for urea synthesis on dual-atom catalysts (DACs) using two gas pollutants (NO and CO) is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that urea can be synthesized through consecutive C–N coupling and hydrogenation steps on heteronuclear DACs, in which the stable adsorption of NO and CO on DACs significantly contributes to the excellent performance for urea formation. Notably, only CoZn, CoCu, and FeZn@N6/C can continuously accept proton–electron and ultimately achieve urea formation, exhibiting low limiting potentials of −0.27, −0.30, and −0.60 V, respectively. Furthermore, it is also determined that an alternative mechanism is preferable on three DACs. Moreover, competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, as well as reductions of CO and NO reductions, can be effectively suppressed, thereby endowing high selectivity for urea generation. Importantly, this study not only advances a novel mechanism for urea production utilizing gas pollutants but also broadens the applicability of DACs in electrocatalysis.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a pivotal process in hydrogen fuel cells crucial for enhancing fuel cell performance through suitable catalysts, remains a challenging aspect of development. This study explores the catalytic potential of germanene on Al (111), taking advantage of the successful preparation of stable reconstructed germanene layers on Al (111) and the excellent catalytic performance exhibited by germanium-based nanomaterials. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the O2 molecule can be effectively activated on both freestanding and supported germanene nanosheets, featuring kinetic barriers of 0.40 and 0.04 eV, respectively. The presence of the Al substrate not only significantly enhances the stability of the reconstructed germanene but also preserves its exceptional ORR catalytic performance. These theoretical findings offer crucial insights into the substrate-mediated modulation of germanene stability and catalytic efficiency, paving the way for the design of stable and efficient ORR catalysts for future applications.

Hydrogen as a potential future energy source provides a number of benefits in terms of sustainability, high energy density, and zero emissions. The production of hydrogen via water splitting is regarded as the cleanest and sustainable process. In contrast, fossil fuel combustion causes significant environmental problems through the production and release of secondary gases such as NO x , SO 2 , and CO 2 . It is vital to focus on reducing these harmful gases. CO 2 , a major pollutant produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and various human activities, plays a central role in the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. It is therefore imperative to actively eliminate and mitigate CO 2 levels to preserve the global environment. MXenes and MXene‐based catalysts exhibit both outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and CO 2 reduction. In this review, recent progress is systematically examined and discussed in the preparation and utilization of MXenes as catalysts for HER and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The discussion begins with a concise overview of the fabrication and characteristics of MXenes, followed by a comprehensive exploration of their efficacy as catalysts for HER and CO 2 RR.

Abstract Efficient, stable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts are essential to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process during water electrolysis applications. 2D transition metal carbides (MXene) show great potential in functional heterogeneous interface engineering for electrocatalytic OER. However, it is still a challenge to regulate the interlayer space and realize the heterogeneous layer‐by‐layer ordered embedding for MXene. Herein, a simple hydrothermal‐assisted strategy is proposed to prepare highly conductive Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene supported by synergized Ni 2+ , Co 2+ , and Fe 3+ with bilayer H 2 O, which significantly enlarges the interlayer distances and improves the interlayer ion concentrations. Benefiting from modulated interface chemistry, embedded metal ions undergo multi‐directional in situ growth on the MXene substrate, thereby forming a stable 0D/2D@2D nano‐hybrid material (NiFe/MX‐HT). Combining density functional theory calculations with experiments demonstrates that MXene offers a framework for electron transfer, enhances the exposure of active sites, modulates the electronic structure, and greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step in the process of OER. Thus, NiFe/MX‐HT requires only 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 and maintains stability even after operating at 100 mA cm −2 for 150 h. This work offers new insights into exploring various functional MXene‐based heterogeneous materials.

Abstract Elemental phosphorus in its various allotropes has received tremendous research attention recently due to its intriguing electronic and structural properties. Notably, the application of nanostructured materials to overcome the inherent flaws in bulk materials is promising. However, many challenges need to be addressed before its widespread implementation. Thus, a specific tenet to design novel and robust nanomaterials is a decisive factor in the desired outcome, and the most daunting task before realizing this is solving the Schrödinger equation. First principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations have emerged as an insightful and accurate design tool to investigate the structural, electronic, and possible synthesis scenarios of yet undiscovered materials at atomic levels. In this review, the basic principles and the importance of DFT are discussed, followed by a summary of recent advances in the first principle study of elemental phosphorus‐based nanomaterials. Elemental phosphorus‐based nanomaterials and their allotropes have attracted growing interest in the renewable energy community due to their modulable product selectivity. However, the understanding of the physical phenomena of allotropic modification is still lacking. Therefore, the aim is to motivate experimental researchers to conduct DFT studies and experiments to comprehend relevant engineered nanomaterials better. Finally, the challenges and potential future research directions for further theoretical and computational development of phosphorus‐based nanomaterials are outlined.
