The significant increase in CO2 emissions from heavy fossil fuel utilization has raised serious concerns, highlighting the need for effective methods to convert CO2 into value-added chemicals. Here, we report a computational investigation on the catalytic activity of ZrO2-on-Cu inverse catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, considering highly dispersed ZrO2 trimers on Cu (111). Such clusters present a large ensemble of formate-containing configurations, Zr3On(OH)m(OCHO)l, making the evaluation of the catalytic activity very challenging. We found that the sites on the various catalyst configurations exhibit markedly different activities for formate hydrogenation, despite their similar free energy and composition. To understand these differences in reactivity, we examined the structural and electronic nature of the low free-energy catalyst configurations and identified that the energy of the lowest unoccupied orbital of the reacting formate, modified by its binding with the catalytic site, is a descriptor for the reaction energy of the formate hydrogenation step. From there, we screened an ensemble of catalyst structures using this descriptor to predict highly active metastable catalyst configurations and computed the reaction pathways and transition states for formate hydrogenation. From this investigation, we distinguished reactive from nonreactive sites and formate species on the ZrO2/Cu inverse catalyst based on structural and electronic features. We showed that rare metastable configurations control the activity. Additionally, an efficient method for examining the reactivity of a large number of coexisting catalyst structures was developed.

ABSTRACT Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media has been spotlighted for hydrogen production since it is a favourable kinetics with the supplied protons from a counterpart compared to that within alkaline environment. However, there is no choice but to use a platinum‐based catalyst yet. As for a noble metal‐free electrocatalyst, incorporation of earth‐abundant transition metal (TM) atoms into nanocarbon platforms has been extensively adopted. Although a data‐driven methodology facilitates the rational design of TM‐anchored carbon catalysts, its practical application suffers from either a simplified theoretical model or the prohibitive cost and complexity of experimental data generation. Herein, an effective and facile catalyst design strategy is proposed based on machine learning (ML) and its model verification using electrochemical methods accompanied by density functional theory simulations. Based on a Bayesian genetic algorithm ML model, the Ni‐incorporated carbon quantum dots (Ni@CQD) loaded on a three‐dimensional reduced graphene oxide conductor are proposed as the best HER catalyst amongst the various TM‐incorporated CQDs under the optimal conditions of catalyst loading, electrode type, and temperature and pH of electrolyte. The ML results are validated with electrochemical experiments, where the Ni@CQD catalyst exhibited superior HER activity, requiring an overpotential of 151 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec −1 and impressive durability in acidic media up to 100 h. This methodology can provide an effective route for the rational design of highly active electrocatalysts for commercial applications.

Abstract The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a crucial process in electrochemical energy technologies, featuring fuel cells and metal‐air batteries in the coming carbon‐neutral society. Carbon materials have garnered significant attention as economical, sustainable alternatives to precious metal catalysts. In particular, there have been increasing reports recently that pentagons introduced into graphitic carbons promote catalytic activity for ORR. In addition, interesting studies are reported on carbon materials’ synthesis, characterization, and spin polarization properties with pentagonal defects. This review comprehensively summarizes the formation mechanism, characterization, spin, oxygen (O 2 ) adsorption, and ORR catalytic activity of carbon catalysts with pentagonal defects. By connecting the dots between theoretical insights and experimental results, this review elucidates the fundamental principles governing pentagon‐related activity and offers perspectives on future directions for designing efficient ORR catalysts based on carbon materials.

Abstract Alkaline water electrolysis holds potential for large‐scale, high‐purity hydrogen production. However, the slow kinetics of water dissociation and challenging conditions in alkaline environments complicate the search for an electrocatalyst with both high activity and durability. In this study, a highly active and stable amorphous electrocatalyst is introduced, 3Ni─Co─S─O, developed via a straightforward electrodeposition method for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the surface of the 3Ni─Co─S─O catalyst undergoes a compositional reconstruction during alkaline HER, yet maintains its amorphous structure. This reconstruction spans roughly 6 µm, leading to a gradual decrease in Ni and S content and a corresponding increase in O concentration toward the surface, thereby forming a stable, gradient active layer. Benefitting from this layer and its amorphous nature, the 3Ni─Co─S─O catalyst demonstrates superior alkaline HER activity—requiring only 170 mV to achieve an industrial HER current density of 1000 mA cm −2 . It also showcases remarkable stability, with a mere 15 mV increase in overpotential during continuous HER at 300 mA cm −2 for 24 h, outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The research provides a novel approach to designing high‐performance amorphous alkaline HER electrocatalysts cost‐effectively and contributes insights for understanding and developing advanced amorphous catalysts across various applications.

Na-birnessite is a promising low-cost positive electrode material for aqueous sodium-ion batteries. However, its sodium storage capability is limited by narrow potential window and low redox activity in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a Na-rich birnessite (NaMnO2•0.1H2O) with a highly ordered layered structure is reported as an advanced positive electrode for aqueous sodium-ion batteries, greatly suppressing Mn migration and its accompanying domino degradation effect, which enables a promoted upper charging cut-off potential up to 1.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), an enhanced specific capacity of 199.9 mAh g-1 at a specific current of 0.2 A g-1 based on the mass of active material for positive electrode, and greatly improved structural stability. In particular, a 3.0 V NaxH2-xTi2O5||NaMnO2•0.1H2O aqueous full cell prototype is validated, exhibiting a large specific energy of 117.1 Wh kg-1 based on the total mass of active materials in both positive and negative electrodes as well as a long cycle life. This work elucidates how interlayer chemistry and structural defects influence sodium ion storage in layered structures and provides opportunities for developing high-voltage aqueous batteries with large specific energy.

Abstract Photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (psUAAs) play a crucial role in the engineering of light-sensitivity in enzymes, which holds significant promise for diverse applications such as biotherapy and biocatalysis. Besides near-quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co-translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase-psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.

A cost-effective nickel-iron (Ni-Fe) alloy with a predominant face-centered cubic(111) crystallographic orientation is demonstrated as a high-performance electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This alloy demonstrates mutual hybridization of Ni and Fe d-orbitals, bringing its valence energy level close to the Fermi level, comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. While water-splitting electrocatalysts typically undergo surface structural evolution after each reaction cycle, the time scale of surface reconstruction during HER remains uncharted. This study presents a NiFe/NF alloy with an enriched (111) orientation, an active surface area of 24,217 ± 0.1 cm2, an average crystallite size of 14.5 nm, and 0.634% lattice strain as an HER electrocatalyst. The electrocatalyst exhibits excellent performance towards HER, achieving a current density exceeding 800 mA/cm2, an overpotential of -133 mV, and a hydrogen turnover frequency of 2.8 × 1012 s-1, and maintaining stable operation over 100 h. The distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis is introduced to deconvolute the HER process. A distinct high-frequency peak is attributed to interfacial charge transfer with a 2.38 × 10-6 s relaxation time. Additionally, medium- and low-frequency peaks represent ion transport and hydrogen adsorption/desorption at 277.4 × 10-6 and 905.1 × 10-6 s relaxation times, respectively. The assignments can serve as a reference on the bulk and interfacial relaxation times critical for understanding electrocatalyst surface evolution using the DRT method, regardless of the material or type of electrochemical reaction. These findings are useful for advancing the design of low-cost, transition-metal-based alloys as catalysts for clean energy systems.

Seawater electrocatalysis is highly desired for various energy storage and conversion systems, such as water splitting using seawater as an electrolyte and metal fuel cells. However, the adsorption of chloride ions (Cl-) on the active sites of cathodes would worsen the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability, thus lowering the battery performance. Herein, the coupling active sites of graphitic N-regulated adjacent pentagon defects in carbon nanosheets (GAP/CN) were first synthesized by a low-boiling-point metal-mediated partial N-removal strategy. Experimental and theoretical results affirm the advantageous cooperative effect between adjacent pentagons and graphitic N toward the ORR in a harsh seawater environment, where adjacent pentagons act as the authentic highly effective ORR active sites and surrounding graphitic N site serves as the structural regulator to weaken the binding strength of harmful Cl- to prevent catalyst poisoning. As a result, GAP/CN delivers excellent ORR activities in diverse electrolytes, including 0.1 M KOH (half-wave potential of 0.87 V), alkaline artificial seawater (half-wave potential of 0.87 V), and natural seawater (half-wave potential of 0.71 V), and also good long-term stability, which can be comparable to commercial Pt/C. This study provides valuable guidance for the rational design of ORR electrocatalysts for seawater-related energy-conversion devices.

Abstract Electrosynthesis of NH3 from low-concentration NO (NORR) in neutral media offers a sustainable nitrogen fixation strategy but is hindered by weak NO adsorption, slow water dissociation, and sluggish hydrogenation kinetics. Herein, we propose a new strategy that successfully overcomes these limitations through using an electron-donating motif to modulate NO-affinitive catalysts, thereby creating dual active site with synergistic functionality. Specifically, we integrate electron-donating nanoparticles into a Fe single-atom catalyst (FeSAC), where Fe sites ensure strong NO adsorption, while electron-donating motifs promote water dissociation and NO hydrogenation. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), and theoretical calculations reveal that electron-donating motifs increase Fe site electron density, strengthening NO adsorption. Additionally, these motifs also promote water dissociation, supplying protons to lower the NO hydrogenation barrier. This synergistic interplay enables a cascade reaction mechanism, delivering a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.3% and a NH3 yield rate of 709.7 µg h− 1 mgcat.−1 under 1.0 vol% NO in neutral media, outperforming pure FeSAC (NH3 yield rate: 444.2 µg h− 1 mgcat.−1, FE: 56.6%) and prior high-NO-concentration systems. Notably, a record NH3 yield of 3123.8 µg h− 1 mgcat.−1 was achieved in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer under a 1.0 vol% NO. This work establishes a new paradigm in NORR by simultaneously enhancing NO adsorption, water dissociation, and hydrogenation kinetics, providing a scalable route for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis from dilute NO sources.

Citation metrics influence academic reputation and career trajectories. Recent works have highlighted flaws in citation practices in the Neurosciences, such as the under-citation of women. However, self-citation rates—or how much authors cite themselves—have not yet been comprehensively investigated in the Neurosciences. This work characterizes self-citation rates in basic, translational, and clinical Neuroscience literature by collating 100,347 articles from 63 journals between the years 2000-2020. In analyzing over five million citations, we demonstrate four key findings: 1) increasing self-citation rates of Last Authors relative to First Authors, 2) lower self-citation rates in low- and middle-income countries, 3) gender differences in self-citation stemming from differences in the number of previously published papers, and 4) variations in self-citation rates by field. Our characterization of self-citation provides insight into citation practices that shape the perceived influence of authors in the Neurosciences, which in turn may impact what type of scientific research is done and who gets the opportunity to do it.

Abstract The development of high‐performance ORR catalysts is challenged by the understanding how the delocalized electrons in s ‐ and p ‐orbitals influence oxygen intermediate adsorption and overall catalytic performance. To address these challenges, the from active unit to bulk catalyst (FAUC) design strategy is employed to investigate the roles of s‐ and p‐ orbitals in ORR activity. Specifically, six M‐N 4 ‐OH (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) catalyst systems are constructed and analyzed using density functional theory (DFT), this study reveals that, compared to d ‐orbitals, the delocalized electrons in the s‐ and p‐ orbitals (N s,p ) exhibit a significant volcano relationship with ORR activity. This superior predictive capability arises from the weaker dependence of s‐ and p‐ orbitals on the local coordination environment. Additionally, a structure‐activity relationship is established where shortening M─O and M─N bond lengths significantly increases N s,p . Through modification strategies such as doping and loading, the Co─N bond lengths are regulated in Co‐N 4 ‐OH‐C, resulting in shorter bonds and increased N s,p , which shifted ORR catalytic activity closer to the volcano peak. These findings validate the N s,p descriptor's rationality and universality across various 3 d transition metals, providing new insights for the design of high‐performance ORR catalysts.

Abstract Materials with the same chemical composition can exhibit distinct properties depending on their crystal phases. Here, the synthesis of two types of mesoporous Bi 2 Se 3 films at different reduction potentials is reported and their application in electrochemical glucose sensing. Mesoporous Bi 2 Se 3 is synthesized by incorporating block copolymer micelle assemblies into the deposition solution and applying a reduction potential. To characterize the crystal phases accurately, Bi 2 Se 3 films are heat‐treated at 200 °C for 1 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. The results reveal that the Bi 2 Se 3 films synthesized under different conditions exhibit clearly distinct phases: rhombohedral ( R ‐Bi 2 Se 3 ) and orthorhombic ( O ‐Bi 2 Se 3 ). The R ‐Bi 2 Se 3 ‐8 nm, featuring 8 nm pores and synthesized at a more negative reduction potential, outperforms its nonporous counterpart, achieving a glucose sensing sensitivity of 0.143 µA cm −2 µM −1 and a detection limit of 6.2 µM at pH 7.4 in 0.1 M phosphate‐buffered saline solution. In contrast, the O ‐Bi 2 Se 3 , prepared at a relatively positive potential, exhibits no glucose‐sensing activity. The inactivity of O ‐Bi 2 Se 3 for glucose oxidation is likely due to the energetically unfavorable intermediates, as predicted by density functional theory calculations. These findings underscore the critical role of crystal phase control in porous nanomaterials and pave the way for developing innovative porous systems.

The development of renewable energy-powered water electrolysis technology serves as a crucial prerequisite for realizing the large-scale application of hydrogen economy. Currently, commercial catalysts for water electrolysis predominantly rely on platinum-group noble metals, whose scarcity and exorbitant costs significantly hinder practical implementation of hydrogen production through water splitting. As promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable research attention due to their high intrinsic catalytic activity and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the catalytic performance of TMDs still lags behind that of noble metal benchmarks, prompting extensive and systematic investigations into performance enhancement and catalytic mechanisms. This review comprehensively summarizes strategic approaches for optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of TMDs in water electrolysis, integrating fundamental reaction principles, rational design philosophies for electrocatalysts, and the structure-property relationships of TMDs. Finally, we provide insightful perspectives on current challenges and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Molecular catalysts with functional group decorations are promising for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction to produce valuable chemicals and fuels. Using nickel phthalocyanine derivatives with cyano, methoxy, and dimethylamino groups, this study unveils why decorating molecular catalysts with either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups can enhance their activity. Notably, the dimethylamino group–decorated catalyst demonstrated stable and nearly 100% CO 2 -to-CO reduction selectivity over a wide potential range and high CO partial current densities up to 300 milliamperes per square centimeter. Theoretical and in situ spectroscopic analyses revealed the critical role of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in activating the metal center, which can be facilitated by the decoration of electron-withdrawing groups. Conversely, electron-donating groups, although requiring higher energy for protonation, enhance the synergy between metal centers and protonated sites, favoring the formation of key *COOH intermediates and improving CO selectivity at higher bias. This study underscores the importance of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in optimizing functionalized molecular catalysts for enhanced CO 2 RR activity.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction provides a sustainable route to combat climate change by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals by using sunlight. This study presents both experimental and theoretical insights into the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH using biomass-derived carbon dots embedded onto phytochemical-based CdS quantum dots. The 0D CDs/CdS QDs(bio) composites exhibit rich sulfur vacancies and a more negative conduction band, effectively inhibiting CdS photocorrosion (SO42-) while enhancing the CO2 adsorption and photocurrent response. Additionally, it reduced PL intensity and increased decay time, suggesting the enhancement of charge separation and suppression of charge recombination. The optimal 0.4CDs/CdS QDs(bio) composite exhibited a remarkable CO2 reduction to HCOOH formation yield of 439.51 μmol g-1 h-1 (apparent quantum yield of 3.81%) while retaining its structural and morphological stability. Density functional theory calculations reveal HCOO* as a key intermediate, confirming the thermodynamic preference for HCOOH formation over CO with a free energy change of -0.71 eV. This study introduces a novel bio-based CdS QDs composite modified with biomass-derived CDs, providing mechanistic insights into photocatalytic CO2 reduction for sustainable fuel production.

We introduce a shadow molecular dynamics (MD) approach based on the Atom-Condensed Kohn-Sham second-order (ACKS2) charge-potential equilibration model. In contrast to regular flexible charge models, the ACKS2 model includes both flexible atomic charges and potential fluctuation parameters that allow for physically correct charge fragmentation and improved scaling of the polarizability. Our shadow MD scheme is based on an approximation of the ACKS2's flexible charge-potential energy function, in combination with extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer MD. Utilizing this shadow charge-potential equilibration approach mitigates the costly overhead and stability problems associated with finding well-converged iterative solutions to the charges and potential fluctuations of the ACKS2 model in an MD simulation. Our work provides a robust and versatile framework for efficient, high-fidelity MD simulations of diverse physical phenomena and applications.

Non-platinum group metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions were developed using a CoN4 complex with a 14-membered-ring hexaazamacrocyclic ligand (Co-14MR). The carbon-supported Co-14MR catalyst (Co-14MR/C) showed higher ORR and HER activities than a conventional carbon-supported 16-membered-ring Co phthalocyanine (CoPc/C) catalyst. Heat treatment of Co-14MR/C at 600 °C further enhanced its ORR and HER activity through structural modification of the Co active center via deprotonation of ligand amine groups. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the structural modifications of Co-14MR induced by heat treatment adjusted the adsorption energies of important intermediates in the ORR and HER toward optimal values, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. The Co-14MR/C catalysts also exhibited higher durability in the ORR and HER than CoPc/C and Fe-14MR/C catalysts. Structural analysis suggested that the short Co-N bond lengths and small distortion of the CoN4 active site of the Co-14MR catalysts are the reasons for their high durability. These findings suggest that the Co-14MR structure is a promising design for non-platinum group metal catalysts for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells and water splitting.

Abstract High entropy oxides (HEOs) have recently emerged as excellent alternative catalysts that can potentially replace noble metal catalysts such as RuO 2 and IrO 2 for water splitting applications. However, existing methods of synthesizing these catalysts are often tedious. In this work, a straightforward method is proposed using ultra‐fast laser irradiation to synthesize heavily wrinkled noble metal‐free (CoCuFeMnNi) 3 O 4 HEO 2‐D sheets on nickel foam for excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. These sheets facilitate the OER at a low overpotential of only 245 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 and is stable after 100 h of testing. This performance outmatches the majority of recently reported noble and noble metal‐free HEA and HEO catalysts. As an anode in anion exchange water electrolyzer (AEMWE), a remarkably high current density of 1.722 A cm −2 is achieved at 2.0 V with negligible catalyst deterioration despite 70 h of testing. This result outranks the majority of other state‐of‐the‐art AEMWE catalysts reported today. This work proves that laser irradiation synthesis enables the synthesis of efficient HEO catalysts, and is a pioneer synthesis of HEO 2‐D interconnected sheets using laser irradiation. Crucially, this work proves that noble‐metal free HEOs are highly efficient and durable catalysts in industrial AEMWE devices.

Abstract Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis holds promise for green hydrogen production. One of the main challenges is the preparation of highly efficient electrodes with scalable techniques. Herein, a novel Fe‐modulating Raney‐Ni electrode (NFA‐CA) is developed through atmospheric plasma spraying and chemical etching techniques. The resulting electrode demonstrates high bifunctional catalytic activities with low overpotentials and Tafel slopes (HER: 27 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , 20 mV dec −1 ; OER: 169 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , 49 mV dec −1 ), competing for precious‐metal catalysts and leading transition‐metal‐based compounds reported in the literature. Moreover, the corresponding AEM electrolyzer only requires 1.56 V to drive 1 A cm −2 and exceptional durability for 1000 h. Moreover, the AEM cell can reach 2 A cm −2 at 1.79 V, exceeding the United States Department of Energy target for AWE systems (2 A cm −2 at 1.80 V). The highly efficient and durable performance is attributed to the NiFe nanocrystals (core)‐NiFe hydroxide (shell) nanostructures created by the treatment. This structure not only facilitates superior electrocatalytic properties but it is also maintained after 1000 h of continuous operation. It is consider that the present approach can offer an attractive route for scalable fabrication of NiFe‐based electrodes for industrial AEM water electrolyzers.

Stable, nonprecious catalysts are vital for large-scale alkaline water electrolysis. Here, we report a grafted superstructure, MOF@POM, formed by self-assembling a metal-organic framework (MOF) with polyoxometalate (POM). In situ electrochemical transformation converts MOF into active metal (oxy)hydroxides to produce a catalyst with a low overpotential of 178 millivolts at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. An anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporating this catalyst achieves 3 amperes per square centimeter at 1.78 volts at 80°C and stable operation at 2 amperes per square centimeter for 5140 hours at room temperature. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the synergistic interactions between metal atoms create a fast electron-transfer channel from catalytic iron and cobalt sites, nickel, and tungsten in the polyoxometalate to the electrode, stabilizing the metal sites and preventing dissolution.

The graphitized carbon blocks are used as cathode and anode materials on modern aluminum electrolyzers, which provide a reaction interface between molten salts and a graphitized cathode for the electrochemical reaction. The first-principle calculations were performed to clarify the defluorination mechanism of fluoro-aluminates on graphite cathodes in aluminum electrolysis for energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction. The adsorption behaviors of intermediates involved in defluorination reactions on graphite surfaces are analyzed, revealing their spontaneous adsorption based on their adsorption energies and charge density differences. Furthermore, the defluorination pathways of both single Na3AlF6 clusters and fluoride-aluminate polymers are elucidated. Notably, Na3AlF6, after undergoing the thermochemical defluorination process to obtain AlF3, preferentially undergoes electrochemical defluorination via Al-F-Al polymerization. The key findings indicate that the chemical defluorination of Na3AlF6 leading to NaAlF4 serves as a pivotal step, facilitating the overall defluorination process and enhancing the aluminum production efficiency. This work provides fundamental insights into optimizing aluminum electrolysis processes.

Water's ability to autoionize into hydroxide and hydronium ions profoundly influences surface properties, rendering interfaces either basic or acidic. While it is well-established that protons show an affinity to the air-water interface, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and further away from it. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals local polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.

Abstract The stability of a nanoparticle catalyst during electrochemical reaction is crucial for its application. Despite increasing interest in multi-metallic alloy nanoparticles, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs), for electrocatalysis and emerging models for their catalytic activity, there is limited work on frameworks that can predict the metastability of these alloys under reaction conditions, including stability against electrochemical surface dissolution. Incorporating electrochemical stability in multi-objective optimization would advance HEAs as a catalyst discovery platform. To address the knowledge gap on electrochemical stability, we propose a methodology for simulating the dissolution of n-element alloy nanoparticles comprised of density functional theory and machine-learning regression to calculate the dissolution potentials of the surface atoms. We demonstrate the methodology for the Ag–Au–Cu–Ir–Pd–Pt–Rh–Ru HEA system with the conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction. We investigated trends in stability against dissolution through a compositional grid search for the octo-metallic composition space, uncovering two alloying strategies to increase stability against electrochemical surface dissolution: Alloying with a noble metal or a metal with high relative surface energy. In the simulations, stabilization ensues from forming a protective surface layer, and consequently, the dissolution of persistent alloyed nanoparticles results in core–shell structures. The model enables tracing the evolution of the surface and dissolved composition during electrochemical dissolution, forming paths of dissolution and revealing unretainable surface compositions.

Abstract For neural network potentials (NNPs) to gain widespread use, researchers must be able to trust model outputs. However, the blackbox nature of neural networks and their inherent stochasticity are often deterrents, especially for foundation models trained over broad swaths of chemical space. Uncertainty information provided at the time of prediction can help reduce aversion to NNPs. In this work, we detail two uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. Readout ensembling, by finetuning the readout layers of an ensemble of foundation models, provides information about model uncertainty, while quantile regression, by replacing point predictions with distributional predictions, provides information about uncertainty within the underlying training data. We demonstrate our approach with the MACE-MP-0 model, applying UQ to the foundation model and a series of finetuned models. The uncertainties produced by the readout ensemble and quantile methods are demonstrated to be distinct measures by which the quality of the NNP output can be judged.
