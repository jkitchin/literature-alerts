Electrochemical conversion of nitrate offers an efficient approach to mitigate nitrate pollution and ammonia synthesis but is still challenged by the slow kinetics and selectivity issues of active sites. Herein, by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we report a double-atom catalyst of PdCu–C7N6 by incorporating Pd and Cu together embedded in C7N6 frameworks, which not only shows outstanding catalytic performance with a low limiting potential of 0.36 V, but also can effectively inhibit the competing hydrogen evolution reactions. The high NO3RR activity on PdCu–C7N6 is well explained by the polarizable bond length as well as the asymmetric charge distribution of Pd–Cu dual active sites. This DFT work opens an avenue for developing highly efficient multicomponent NO3RR electrocatalysts.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) stands as a pivotal process in electrochemistry, finding applications in various energy conversion technologies such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and chlor-alkali electrolyzers. Hereby, a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) investigation is presented into the proposed conventional and unconventional ORR mechanisms using single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) as model systems. Several reaction intermediates have been identified that appear to be more stable than the ones postulated in the conventional mechanism, which follows the *OOH, *O, and *OH intermediates. This finding particularly holds for adsorbed *O2, which can have different adsorption geometries, ranging from η1Ο2 or η2Ο2 superoxo complexes as well as sin and anti complexes, with the two O-related ligands binding on the same or opposite sides, respectively. In the case of M@NG (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pt), the ORR follows these unconventional *O2 intermediates, whereas for Cr@NG and Cu@NG classical and unconventional *O2 intermediates compete. We approximate the electrocatalytic activity using the concept of the thermodynamic overpotential and demonstrate that the conventional mechanism gives rise to a smaller overpotential compared to mechanisms following unconventional intermediates during the four proton-coupled electron transfer steps. Our trend study indicates that transition metals with fewer d electrons reveal smaller electrocatalytic activity due to a larger thermodynamic overpotential. Among the investigated SAC systems, Co emerges as a promising candidate, with thermodynamic overpotential and limiting potential values of 0.38 and 0.85 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode, respectively, with the conventional mechanism being favored, and with Cu appearing as the second-best candidate.

Phase change materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) are ideal candidates for next-generation, non-volatile, solid-state memory due to the ability to retain binary data in the amorphous and crystal phases and rapidly transition between these phases to write/erase information. Thus, there is wide interest in using molecular modeling to study GST. Recently, a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) was trained for GST to reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies and forces at a fraction of the computational cost [Zhou et al., Nat. Electron. 6, 746 (2023)]; however, simulations of large length and time scales are still challenging using this GAP model. Here, we present a machine-learned (ML) potential for GST implemented using the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework. This ACE potential shows comparable accuracy to the GAP potential but performs orders of magnitude faster. We train the ACE potentials both directly from DFT and also using a recently introduced indirect learning approach where the potential is trained instead from an intermediate ML potential, in this case, GAP. Indirect learning allows us to consider a significantly larger training set than could be generated using DFT alone. We compare the directly and indirectly learned potentials and find that both reproduce the structure and thermodynamics predicted by the GAP and also match experimental measures of GST structure. The speed of the ACE model, particularly when using graphics processing unit acceleration, allows us to examine repeated transitions between crystal and amorphous phases in device-scale systems with only modest computational resources.

We present an implementation of the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method for periodic systems using GPU accelerated QM methods, a distributed multipole formulation of the electrostatics, and a pseudobond treatment of the QM/MM boundary. We demonstrate that our method has well-controlled errors, stable self-consistent QM convergence, and energy-conserving dynamics. We further describe an application to the catalytic kinetics of chorismate mutase. Using an accurate hybrid functional reparametrized to coupled cluster energetics, our QM/MM simulations highlight the sensitivity in the calculated rate to the choice of quantum method, quantum region selection, and local protein conformation. Our work is provided through the open-source PySCF package using acceleration from the GPU4PySCF module.

Abstract As the demand for sustainable energy solutions grows, developing efficient energy conversion and storage technologies, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries, is vital. Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) is a significant limitation in electrochemical systems due to its slower kinetics. Although Pt-based catalysts are commonly used to address this challenge, their high cost and suboptimal performance remain significant obstacles to further development. This review offers a comprehensive overview of advanced support materials aimed at improving the efficiency, durability, and cost-effectiveness of Pt-based catalysts. By examining a range of materials, including mesoporous carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and metal oxides, the review clarifies the relationship between the structural properties of these supports and their influence on ORR performance. Additionally, it discusses the fundamental characteristics of these materials, their practical applications in fuel cells, and explores potential solutions and future directions for optimizing Pt-based catalysts to advance sustainable energy conversion technologies. Future research could focus on nano-engineering and composite material development to unlock the full potential of Pt-based catalysts, significantly enhancing their economic viability and performance in energy applications.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an indispensable electrochemical reaction in fuel cells. However, the performance of fuel cells has been affected by the slack kinetics of the ORR. Hence, the development of efficient and affordable electrocatalysts for the reduction of O2 is necessary for the large-scale commercialization of fuel cells. Here, we present a Ni2 dual-atom anchored on a N-doped carbon nanotube (Ni2_N3_CNT and Ni2_N4_CNT) and a Ni single-atom anchored on N-doped carbon nanotube (Ni1_N3_CNT and Ni1_N4_CNT) catalysts with two possible active sites, namely, Ni-site and N-site, as efficient catalysts toward the ORR. We have analyzed the energetically favorable active site for O2 reduction on the surface of the Ni1_N3_CNT, Ni1_N4_CNT, Ni2_N3_CNT, and Ni2_N4_CNT catalysts by employing the density functional theory method with van der Waals (vdW) dispersion corrections (in short the DFT-D3) method. Among all possible configurations, Ni2_N3_CNT is a more favorable configuration with the Ni catalytic active site toward the ORR. Then, we have studied the structural, electronic, and catalytic activity of Ni2_N3_CNT by using the same DFT-D3 method. The analysis of the ORR intermediate species reveals that the associative reaction pathway is a more favorable path for reducing the O2 into H2O at the Ni catalytic site of Ni2_N3_CNT than the dissociative reaction pathway. In the free energy profile, all of the ORR reaction intermediate steps are downhill, indicating the good catalytic activity of Ni2_N3_CNT toward the ORR. Moreover, we have also studied the structural and electronic properties of all of the reaction intermediate steps by employing the same DFT-D3 method. These findings point out that the Ni2 dual-atom catalysts provide an efficient electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR, and it holds great promise as a replacement for Pt-based catalysts in future proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. This work highlights the potential and importance of the subject material as a durable electrocatalyst for the ORR, offering insights into Ni2 dual-atom electrochemistry and the design of advanced catalysts, which may be a promising candidate to substitute for Pt electrodes, and it is an excellent material for fuel-cell components.

Renewable hydrogen generation from water electrolysis offers a viable path to decarbonization if the costs can be reduced. The iridium-based anode catalyst is one of the most expensive components in electrolyzers. We propose reducing iridium usage by substituting Ir with Co, a more affordable metal, in the mixed oxide phase to enhance the catalytic activity while minimizing Ir consumption. A modified surfactant-assisted Adams fusion synthesis technique was developed as a scalable method for producing IrCo oxide nanoparticles. The synthesized material outperforms the commercial baseline, iridium oxide with carbon (IrOx_C), in both acidic and alkaline media. Acid etching (IrCo_ae) further enhances activity by selectively removing Co to expose more active sites. IrCo_ae achieved a significantly lower overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 compared to IrOx_C, with reductions of approximately 18% under acidic conditions and 14% under alkaline conditions. This work demonstrates that the proposed synthesis method enables efficient Ir utilization and can be adapted to enhance catalyst stability for renewable hydrogen production.

This study investigates the effects of two-dimensional (2D) confinement on CO oxidation reaction over Pt(111) surfaces, emphasizing the structural, electronic, and dynamical aspects of CO2 formation and desorption. Using pristine and single-defect hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as overlayers, we found that confinement by nitrogen-vacancy h-BN (NV) induces a significant reduction, greater than that of graphene (Gr), in the activation energy barrier for CO2 formation. The confinement effect on adsorption depends on the reference states chosen for adsorption energy calculations. Reference states, such as stable or original intersurface gaps, can yield either positive or negative confinement energy values, indicating adsorption weakening or strengthening, respectively. Importantly, adsorption weakening correlates better with barrier reduction. Post-transition-state dynamical simulations of CO2 desorption revealed pronounced vibrational oscillations. NV and Gr confinement led to complex vibrational features, indicating stronger interactions between CO2 and the 2D cover. This study highlights the profound impact of 2D confinement on catalytic processes, providing insights into how 2D materials modulate the electronic structure and vibrational dynamics of reactions. The findings could guide the design of efficient catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in heterogeneous catalysis.

Ir-based catalysts are the best in terms of activity and stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in proton exchange water electrolysis. Due to their cost, efforts have been made to decrease their load without a loss of activity. In this paper, Ir nanoparticles measuring 2–3 nm were loaded on TiO2 anatase supports of submicrometric size in different amounts using the microwave polyol method to optimize their mass activity. Using anatase particles with a diameter of about 100 nm and titania nanotubes (TNTs), Ir/TiO2 catalysts with Ir contents of 5, 10, 20, and 40 wt.% were synthesized and characterized via structural and electrochemical techniques. It was shown that the amount of Ir must be regulated to obtain continuous coverage on titania with strong Ir–TiO2 interactions which, for the 100 nm diameter anatase, is limited to about 20 wt.%. A higher percentage of Ir over 40 wt.% can be dispersed over the TNTs. Exceeding one layer of coverage leads to a decrease in the catalyst’s utilization. Ir/TiO2(10:90), Ir/TiO2(20:80), and Ir/TiO2(40:60) presented the highest pseudocapacitive currents per unit of Ir mass. The electrochemical active areas and mass activities for these later catalysts were also the highest compared to Ir/TiO2(05:95), Ir/TNT(40:60), and the unsupported catalysts and increased from 40 to 10 wt.% Ir. They also presented the lowest overpotentials of about 300 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER, with Ir/TiO2(10:90) presenting the best specific activities and surface turnover frequencies, thus showing that the size of the support can be regulated to decrease the Ir content of the catalyst without a loss of activity.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO 2 /N 2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal‐air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen–oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

Abstract Rapid kinetics and stable atom configuration of the catalysts are essential and greatly sought after for bifunctional oxygen reactions and energy conversion devices, but remain unsatisfactory. Herein, the Se dual atoms structure consisting of the periodically arranged Se‐P‐Se configurations within graphitic nitrogen carbon framework (P‐Se dual atoms‐NC) is constructed by P directionally mediated single atoms deposition strategy. The in situ/ex situ experiments combining the theoretical calculations reveal that both the inter‐site distance effect of the adjacent Se atoms in the NC and the Se‐P binding effect endow P‐Se dual atoms‐NC with a stable atom configuration and ultra‐durable lifespan, and the locally polarized electronic micro‐environment built by P 2 p ‐Se 3 d ‐C 2 p orbital hybridization and the electrons transfer significantly promotes H 2 O‐O 2 coupling, boosts the adsorption/desorption of O‐intermediates and accelerates the electron transport kinetics. Moreover, the adjacent Se atoms with a periodically arranged structure could provide more sites for the absorption and conversion of reactants. Thus, the as‐prepared catalyst exhibits the top‐level bifunctional activity with an ultra‐low potential difference (Δ E ) of 0.58 V and delivers the outstandingly low‐temperature specific capacity of 796.41 mAh g Zn −1 and the ultra‐durable lifespan over 1000 h for assembled zinc‐air batteries at −40 °C.

The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is severely limited by the poor stability, low activity, and high cost of available catalysts. Enhancing intrinsic activity while maintaining stability and reducing reliance on precious metals is crucial. The typical adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) leads to high overpotentials and low activity, making the transition to alternative mechanisms, such as the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) or oxide path mechanism (OPM), highly desirable due to their lower overpotentials. Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with experimental validation to enhance the activity and stability of β-MnO2 via co-substitution with ruthenium (Ru) and iridium (Ir), enabling the transition from AEM to OPM. DFT calculations reveal that AEM is hindered by the weak nucleophilicity of water, while LOM suffers from high kinetic barriers due to structural distortions. In contrast, OPM demonstrates a significantly lower kinetic barrier, facilitated by the synergistic interaction between Ru and Ir. Experimentally, IrRuMnOx was synthesized through co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, showing an 80-fold improvement in mass activity and a 96-fold increase in stability compared to commercial IrO2, with minimal noble metal leaching, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). IrRuMnOx exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 475 mV at 1 A·cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 44.26 mV·dec–1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, maintaining stable performance for over 100 h. Moreover, the IrRuMnOx-based membrane electrode, with a low Ir loading of 0.075 mgIr·cm–2, achieved remarkable current densities of 1.0 A·cm–2 at 1.66 V and 2.0 A·cm–2 at 1.91 V at 80 °C. This performance surpasses that of both unsupported and conventional supported Ir-based catalysts at comparable Ir loading levels. This study offers critical insights into OER mechanisms in acidic media and paves the way for developing efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.

Abstract Engineering nanomaterials at single‐atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO 2 ‐based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi‐RuO 2 single‐atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) RuBi single‐atom alloy. This Bi‐RuO 2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192 mV and superb stability over 650 h at 10 mA cm −2 , enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm −2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate‐evolving mechanism on Bi‐RuO 2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi 1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high‐performance electrocatalysts at atomic‐level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

Abstract Integration of different active sites by heterostructure engineering is pivotal to optimize the intrinsic activities of an oxygen electrocatalyst and much needed to enhance the performance of rechargeable Zn–air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a biphasic nanoarchitecture encased in in situ grown N‐doped graphitic carbon (MnO/Co‐NGC) with heterointerfacial sites are constructed. The density functional theory model reveals formation of lattice oxygen bridged heterostructure with pyridinic nitrogen atoms anchored Co species, which facilitate adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Consequently, the well‐designed catalyst with accessible active sites, abundant oxygen vacant sites, and heterointerfacial coupling effects, simultaneously accelerate the electron/mass transfer and thus promotes the trifunctional electrocatalysis. The assembled aqueous ZAB delivers maximum power density of ≈268 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 797.8 mAh g zn −1 along with excellent rechargeability and extremely small voltage gap decay rate of 0.0007 V h −1 . Further, the fabricated quasisolid‐state ZAB owns a remarkable power density of 163 mW cm −2 and long cycle life, outperforming the benchmark air‐electrode and many recent reports, underlining its robustness and suitability for practical utilization in diverse portable applications.

In area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD), small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) play a critical role in directing surface selectivity, preventing unwanted deposition on non-growth surfaces, and enabling precise thin-film formation essential for semiconductor and advanced manufacturing processes. This study utilizes grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to investigate the competitive adsorption characteristics of three SMIs─aniline, 3-hexyne, and propanethiol (PT)─alongside trimethylaluminum (TMA) precursors on a Cu(111) surface. Single-component adsorption analyses reveal that aniline attains the highest coverage among the SMIs, attributed to its strong interaction with the Cu surface; however, this coverage decreases by approximately 42% in the presence of TMA, underscoring its susceptibility to competitive adsorption effects. By contrast, 3-hexyne displays minimal alteration in adsorption when it is in competition with TMA, effectively inhibiting TMA adsorption and indicating its suitability as a robust SMI for AS-ALD. PT also demonstrates moderate inhibitory capability against TMA, although it is less effective than 3-hexyne in this regard. These findings highlight the importance of intermolecular forces and adsorption energies in determining SMI effectiveness in blocking TMA on non-growth surfaces. Mechanistic insights from this study reveal the nuanced influence of specific SMI–precursor interactions, emphasizing the necessity of selecting SMIs tailored to precursor characteristics and surface interactions. This work provides essential contributions to the rational design of SMIs in AS-ALD, with implications for improving deposition precision and optimizing AS-ALD parameters in nanomanufacturing applications.

Abstract Designing cost‐effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge in green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two OWS half‐cell reactions. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesiz hierarchical heterostructure MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH and MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low IR‐corrected overpotentials of 156 and 61 mV with at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 under light assistance. The MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH‐MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH OWS cell achieves a low cell voltage of 1.46V at 10 mA cm −2 during light‐assisted water electrolysis. Both materials exhibited exceptional stability under industrially relevant HER and OER conditions, maintaining a current density of 1 A cm −2 with minimal alterations in their potential and performance. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping the LDH matrix with high‐valence Mo atoms and MoS 2 quantum dots improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the electrocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the thermodynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, this work develops a facile synthesis method to design highly active and stable MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.

Three different cathodic materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) consisting of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) supported onto a bare and two doped reduced graphene oxides (r-GO) have been studied. Ru NPs have been synthesized in situ by means of the organometallic approach in the presence of each reduced graphene support (bare (rGO), N-doped (NH2-rGO) and P-doped (P-rGO)). (HR)TEM, EDX, EA, ICP-OES, XPS, Raman and NMR techniques have been used to fully characterize the obtained rGO-supported Ru materials. These materials have been deposited onto a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (GC-RDE) to assess their HER electrocatalytic activity at acidic pH. The results show that all three materials are stable under reductive conditions for at least 12 h, and that the heteroatom-doping of the graphene structure extremely increases the activity of the electrodes, especially for the case of Ru@P-rGO, where the overpotential at −10 mA·cm–2 decreases to only 2 mV. Realistic (based on experimental compositional data) modeling of the three rGO supports combined with DFT computational analysis of the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of the hybrid nanocatalysts allows attributing the observed electrocatalytic performances to a combination of interrelated factors such as the distance of the Ru atoms to the dopped rGO support and the hydride content at the Ru NP surface.

An ideal water-splitting electrocatalyst is inexpensive, abundant, highly active, stable, selective, and durable. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the main bottleneck for H2 production with a complex and not fully resolved mechanism, slow kinetics, and high overpotential. Nickel oxide-based catalysts (NiOx) are highly active and cheaper than precious metal catalysts. However, rigorous catalyst tests and DFT calculations are still needed to rationally optimize NiOx catalysts. In this work, we combine plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) and density functional theory (DFT) to address the role of dopants in promoting NiOx OER activity. Ultrathin films of NiOx doped with Zn2+, Al3+, and Sn4+ presented improved intrinsic activity, stability, and durability for the OER. The results show a low to high catalytic performance of ZnNiOx < NiOx < AlNiOx < SnNiOx, which we attribute to an increase in the concentration of valence band (VB) holes combined with conduction band (CB) electron conductivity, characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of doping on the electronic structure and catalytic activity was investigated using advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (PEB0/pob-TZVP). DFT complements the experimental results, showing that the dopant charge states and orbital hybridization enhance the OER by improving the charge carrier concentration and mobility, thus allowing optimal binding energies and charge dynamics and delocalization. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PE-ALD-doped nanofilms NiOx and DFT to rationally design and develop catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

Reactive CO2 capture (RCC) is a promising strategy for process intensification of carbon capture and conversion for production of low-carbon fuels and chemicals. As state-of-the-art sorbent materials in point source and direct air capture systems, solid-supported amines are a natural choice to pair with supported CO2 hydrogenation catalysts (e.g., metallic nanoparticles) for developing high-capacity sorbent-catalyst materials for use in RCC. In this Perspective, we summarize the relevant literature combining solid-supported amines with metallic nanoparticles for thermocatalytic RCC and detail two of our own case studies using RCC to synthesize methane and methanol. Our observations suggest that the temperature mismatch between CO2 desorption and reaction, along with potential catalyst site poisoning by grafted aminosilanes, is a significant obstacle to realizing the potential of amine-based RCC materials in the decarbonization of chemical production. This stands in contrast to literature detailing successful RCC using liquid amines and solid catalysts, which may benefit from more favorable mass transfer dynamics, as well as early stage reports into RCC solid-phase amine-Pd materials, whose findings we were not able to replicate. More judicious reaction selection and synthetic design strategies to match materials with process conditions offer alternative pathways for future research.

The range of chemical databases available has dramatically increased in recent years, but the reliability and quality of their data are often negatively affected by human-error fidelity. The size of chemical databases can make manual data curation/checking of such sets time consuming; thus, automated tools to help this process are highly desirable. Herein, we propose the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identifying potential stereochemical misassignments in the primary asymmetric catalysis literature. Our method relies on the use of an ensemble of GNN models to predict the expected stereoselectivity of exemplars for a particular asymmetric reaction. When the majority of these models do not correlate to the reported outcome, the point is labeled as a possible stereochemical misassignment. Such identified cases are few in number and more easily investigated for their cause. We demonstrate the use of this approach to spot potential literature stereochemical misassignments in the ketone products resulting from catalytic asymmetric 1,4-addition of organoboron nucleophiles to Michael acceptors in two different databases, each one using a different family of chiral ligands (bisphosphine and diene ligands). Our results demonstrate that this methodology is useful for curation of medium-sized databases, speeding this process significantly compared to complete manual curation/checking. In the datasets investigated, human expert checking was reduced to 2.2% and 3.5% of the total data exemplars.

Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have gained much attention as a powerful source of actuation due to their improved performance, reduced size, and reduced complexity between components as well as having a high work output density. Their primary mechanism of actuation relies on a non-diffusional cyclic phase transformation from martensite to austenite, where the amount of thermal energy needed per cycle is directly associated with the hysteresis width between the austenite final and martensite final temperatures. Consequently, a narrower gap between those two temperature ranges requires a much lower energy demand to produce the actuation needed. Previous studies have indicated that the hysteresis width is linked to a strong coherence between the austenite/martensite interface. It has been shown that elemental additions to NiTi-based SMAs can further improve this coherency. Another huge challenge facing this unique technology is linked with its thermo-mechanical stability. Binary NiTi SMAs often exhibit significant transformation temperature shifts after each thermo-mechanical cycle, which can contribute to a shorter lifespan. The primary goal of this project is to identify and develop thermo-mechanically stable, low hysteresis shape memory alloys (LHSMAs) for actuator applications. To accomplish this goal, elemental additions of Cu, Co, Hf, and Pd were incorporated into NiTi-based SMAs and the results were compared in respect to their hysteresis width and thermo-mechanical stability through differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, and compressive thermo-mechanical testing. Two quaternary SMAs containing small additions of Cu and Pd were shown to exhibit promising results with respect to hysteresis width and good thermo-mechanical stability.
