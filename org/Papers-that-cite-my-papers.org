Hydrogen emerges as a pivotal clean and versatile energy carrier amid global energy challenges, urging a shift towards renewable hydrogen production. The efficiency of the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hinges on catalyst choice, ambient conditions, and electrolyte pH. In transitioning away from costly and scarce catalysts like Pt or Ru, researchers explore Earth-abundant alternatives, notably transition metal-based quantum dots (QDs) and MXenes. QDs offer high surface area and customizable properties, while MXenes demonstrate exceptional conductivity and surface area. QDs, despite challenges such as agglomeration, prove effective when engineered into composites. MXenes, with their unique stacked structure and chemical robustness, hold promise for HER catalysis. As discussed, QDs and MXenes exhibit schematic HER representations, emphasizing their potential as catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production and their adaptability to span diverse fields, offering scalable solutions towards a renewable energy future.

Hydrogen is regarded as a vital resource for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. Electrocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a viable technique for producing ultra-pure hydrogen. The electrocatalyst, which can catalyze the electrochemical process to decrease the overpotential by increasing the current density, is critical to the effectiveness of this approach. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have become recognized as possible electrocatalysts in recent years due to their exposed surface active sites, evenly distributed interconnected pore structure, and adjustable shape. Thus, the significance of homogeneous and heterogeneous MOFs and their derivatives for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution process (HER) is summarized in this chapter. The chapter begins with an overview of the fundamentals of the electrocatalytic HER, after which the importance of various transition metal-based pristine MOFs and their derivatives towards the HER is examined. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement given their sub-par intrinsic activity and weak conductivity. Various MOF-derived composites, as well as new methodologies and procedures, are given to solve intrinsic activity and conductivity issues, emphasizing progress in MOF-based materials for a more effective HER electrocatalyst in large-scale hydrogen production.

Abstract The concentrated alkaline passivates the monolithic electrode for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) industry. Herein, a surface engineering of cathodic protection via one‐step co‐electrodeposition of P into NiCuV is presented and the achieved monolithic electrode exhibits an enhanced electrochemical catalytic behavior and constant durability with a feedback potential of −0.75 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under an extremely high current density of 1A cm −2 for more than 270 h in alkaline media. The strategy of cathodic protection optimises the charge density redistribution by forming a phosphate surface layer. This preserves the particular metal (alloy) phase from oxidation while also modulating the heterarchical porous structure through P incorporation. Furthermore, an anion‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with the NiCuVP serving as the HER catalyst and the NiFeCr LDH as the OER catalyst is constructed, which exhibits a current density of 912 mA cm −2 at 2 V at 80 °C with 30 wt.% KOH electrolytes. The resultant factors for activity and durability such as the electrochemical specific area, redox behaviors and surface hydrophilicity are also systematically discussed. This research presents a practical protocol for the anticorrosion and active enhancement of AWE and AEMWE cathodes.

Proton transfer plays a crucial role in various chemical and biological processes. A major theoretical challenge in simulating proton transfer arises from the quantum nature of the proton. The constrained nuclear-electronic orbital (CNEO) framework was recently developed to efficiently and accurately account for nuclear quantum effects, particularly quantum nuclear delocalization effects, in quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we systematically investigate challenging proton transfer modes in a series of shared-proton systems using CNEO density functional theory (CNEO-DFT), focusing on evaluating existing electron–proton correlation functionals. Our results show that CNEO-DFT accurately describes proton transfer vibrational modes and significantly outperforms conventional DFT. The inclusion of the epc17-2 electron–proton correlation functional in CNEO-DFT produces similar performance to that without electron–proton correlations, while the epc17-1 functional yields less accurate results, comparable with conventional DFT. These findings hold true for both asymmetrical and symmetrical shared-proton systems. Therefore, until a more accurate electron–proton correlation functional is developed, we currently recommend performing vibrational spectrum calculations using CNEO-DFT without electron–proton correlation functionals.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to alleviating global warming and emerging energy crises. Yet, the CO2RR efficiency is impeded by the need for electrocatalysts with good selectivity and efficiency. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention in electrocatalysis and are more efficient than traditional metal-based catalysts. In this study, we modeled a Cu single atom embedded on MoX2 (X = Se and Te) monolayer with a single chalcogen (X) vacancy as SAC. Employing the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) method, the electrocatalytic CO2RR activity of the Cu-MoX2 SACs is systematically investigated through significant descriptors, such as the Gibbs free energy change, charge density difference, and COHP analysis. The stability of SACs, CO2 adsorption configurations, and all possible reaction pathways for the formation of C1 products (HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, and CH4) were examined. All of the Cu-MoX2 SACs are stable and show high catalytic selectivity for the CO2RR by significantly suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We found that the catalytic activity is mainly due to the level of antibonding states filling between the Cu atom and *OCHOH intermediate. Among the C1 products, CH4 is selectively produced in all three SACs. Notably, there is a decrease in the limiting potential (UL) when X changes from S to Te in Cu-MoX2. Among these three SACs, Cu-MoTe2 SAC is the most promising catalyst for reducing CO2 to CH4, with as low as UL of −0.34 V vs RHE. Our results demonstrate that the local coordination environment in SACs has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of CO2RR.

From the photoelectric effect to the development of contemporary photocatalysts, the hunt for efficient energy conversion has been a tale of invention and discovery. Since 1972, water-splitting photocatalysis has evolved as an effective strategy for advancing toward sustainable energy. The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, formed by the vertical stacking of two distinct 2D materials, exhibit unique electronic properties. The weak vdW interactions tend to provide the benefit of efficient carrier separation, thus making them promising candidates for photocatalysis. However, analyzing all possible combinations of 2D materials is impractical through traditional approaches, necessitating the development of predictive models to automate and accelerate the quest. Herein, we propose a hybrid approach using machine learning (ML) in conjugation with first-principles calculations to predict the properties of hexagonal vdW bilayers for application in photocatalysis. Our ML workflow comprises the following major steps: (1) constructing a vast material space of bilayers and their descriptors using a 2D material database, (2) labeling a diverse set of bilayers using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, (3) training the supervised ML models on a labeled data set for binding energy, interlayer distance, band gap, work function, and band edges of heterostructures, (4) evaluating the performance of models on the validation set, and (5) predicting the properties of the unlabeled data set and screening the bilayers feasible for overall water-splitting (OWS) photocatalysis. The computational framework presented here tends to establish the relationship between 2D monolayers and vdW bilayers. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach in accelerating the search for novel photocatalysts by efficiently and accurately predicting their properties, thereby contributing to the broader goal of sustainable energy production.

The modification of Pt surfaces with organic compounds like melamine enhances oxygen reduction reaction activity and catalyst durability. Through first-principles free energy calculations utilizing thermodynamic integration and finite-temperature molecular dynamics, enhanced by machine learning force fields for efficient sampling of nanosecond-scale interfacial water fluctuations and incorporating corrections to accurately reproduce first-principles free energies, we demonstrate that melamine destabilizes OH adsorbates, facilitating their removal and enhancing catalytic activity. Unlike alloys, where OH destabilization is driven by changes in electronic structure and surface strain, melamine disrupts hydrogen bonding between OH and interfacial water. Structural and vibrational analyses reveal that melamine alters the water solvation structure, which is evident in modified radial distribution functions and a blue shift in the O–H stretching vibrations. These findings indicate that manipulating interfacial solvation with organic compounds could be a promising approach to enhance catalytic activity without compromising durability.

Developing highly efficient non-iridium-based active sites for acidic water splitting is still a huge challenge. Herein, unique Ru–B–Cr moieties have been constructed in RuO2 nanofibers (NFs) to activate Ru sites for water electrolysis, which overcomes the bottleneck of RuO2-based catalysts usually possessing low activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and poor stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated Cr, B-doped RuO2 NFs exhibit low overpotentials of 205 and 379 mV for acidic HER and OER at 1 A cm–2 with outstanding stability lasting 1000 and 188 h, respectively. The assembled acidic electrolyzer also possesses great hydrogen production efficiency and durability at a high current density. Experimental and theoretical explorations reveal that the formation of Ru–B–Cr moieties effectively optimizes the atomic configurations and modulates the adsorption/desorption free energy of reaction intermediates to achieve exceptional HER and OER performance.

The electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia is considered a feasible strategy to address the imbalance of the global nitrogen cycle by eliminating N-containing pollutants in wastewater while producing ammonia in a sustainable way. In this work, we systematically investigate the reduction of nitrate to ammonia on p-block indium (In), noble metal ruthenium (Ru), and their alloys (InRu3, In3Ru). We found that pure In and Ru candidates exhibit various performances for nitrate reduction with low limiting potentials for the potential-determining step of −0.31 V and −0.14 V, respectively. However, the incorporation of In into Ru to create alloys leads to excellent activity for the reduction of nitrate to ammonia. Ammonia production on InRu3 and In3Ru alloys demonstrates higher catalytic activity and selectivity as the byproducts of NO2 and NO can be inhibited, while the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can also be significantly suppressed. Our work not only proposes efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction but also provides a new strategy for the rational design of alloy catalysts for improved catalytic performance.

The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3–RR) involves multiple hydrogenation and deoxygenation steps, which compete with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Therefore, NO3–RR driven in acidic media is challenging in spite of advantageous fast hydrogen transfers in its elementary steps. The findings presented in this article first demonstrate that the NO3–RR is significantly activated even in acidic lithium nitrate solutions at LiNO3 concentrations exceeding 6 m on a Pt electrode (the highly effective catalyst for HER) by the formation of a "hydronium-in-salt" electrolyte (HISE), a new type of aqueous high concentration salt electrolyte. The observed enhancement of NO3–RR while the suppression of HER-activity in the LiNO3 based HISE was verified by scanning electrochemical microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, UV–vis/IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. The formation of a HISE in acidic LiNO3 solutions contrasts with that of a "water-in-salt" electrolyte in LiTFSI with the same concentration. The mechanism of NO3–RR activation in a HISE suggests facilitated proton-coupled electron transfers (PCETs) from H3O+ to NO3– and subsequent reactive intermediates owing to the proximity between the two ions induced by the unique solvation structure blended with all ions together (Li+ + NO3– + H3O+). In contrast, all the ions are separately hydrated at low concentrations of LiNO3 electrolytes. On the other hand, PCET from H2O to NO3– in a high concentration LiNO3 electrolyte (e.g., 9 m) is not kinetically preferred, probably owing to the slow dissociation kinetics of H2O, and therefore, H2O reduction is not suppressed by the NO3–RR.

Abstract This study introduces a strategic buffer layer approach to mitigate thermal‐induced pixel shrinkage in top‐emission organic light‐emitting diodes (TEOLEDs), enhancing both thermal stability and efficiency. A new cathode composed of binary alloy from silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) is developed for their moderately high binding energy, improving film uniformity and boosting optical and electrical performance. High surface energy metals, aluminum (Al) and Cu are employed as buffer layers to regulate the growth mechanism, resulting in an exceptionally smooth cathode film. The optimal device is designed by incorporating a bilayer electron injection layer consisting of lithium fluoride (LiF) and ytterbium (Yb) along with the buffer layer. The TEOLEDs achieved an impressive efficiency of 178 cd A −1 and luminance of 247,000 cd m − 2 while demonstrating superior thermal stability, with the absence of cathode shrinkage after 240 h at 85 °C. This stability is attributed to the suppression of thermal diffusion and aggregation, facilitated by the high surface energy buffer layer and innovative cathode compositions employed.
