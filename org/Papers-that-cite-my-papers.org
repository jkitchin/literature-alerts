ABSTRACT This work presents the extension of the semi‐empirical density functional tight binding method, DFTB3, to include zirconium for biomedical and material science applications. The parametrization of Zr has been carried out in consistency with already established 3OB parameters including the elements C, H, N, O, S, P, Mg, Zn, Na, K, Ca, F, Cl, Br, and I. Zirconium‐ligand association and reaction energies have been compared with results from quantum chemical calculations obtained at MP2 and DFT (PBE and B3LYP) level of theory, as well as with those from the semi‐empirical methods DFTB2/PTBP and GFN2‐xTB. A structural validation has been carried out on 1,897 compounds reported in the Cambridge Structural Database, revealing an average root mean square deviation comparable to that obtained at semi‐empirical (DFTB2/PTBP and GFN2‐xTB) level of theory and via the novel neural network potential MACE‐MP‐0. To provide a critical validation of the newly derived parameters, the structure of the biomedically relevant Zr‐DFO complex has been evaluated with respect to a DFT (B3LYP) reference calculation. In addition, extensive DFTB3 MD simulations of the two prominent metal‐organic frameworks UiO‐66 and UiO‐67 have been performed. The results demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed parameters for the study of zirconium‐containing metal‐organic frameworks, when compared to experimental measurements, as well as computational approaches.

Abstract Hydrous cobalt phosphate (CoPO) is a promising OER catalyst, but its activity is limited by poor electron transport and weak intermediate binding. This study reveals how 3d transition metal dopants can be used to tune these properties through first‐principles calculations. Sc, Ti, V, and Cr improve catalytic activity by promoting electron transfer and stabilizing *O intermediates, while Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn reduce performance. Among all candidates, Ni doping strikes the optimal balance, enhancing conductivity and providing moderate *O binding energy that minimizes overpotential. These trends follow electronic descriptors such as d‐band center and electronegativity, and are validated by volcano plot analysis. Ni‐CoPO emerges as the most effective design, offering a clear strategy for improving OER catalysts by controlling dopant identity and electronic structure.

The design of advanced electrocatalysts is often hindered by uncertainties in identifying and controlling the active surfaces and catalytic centers within heterogeneous materials. Here we present the synthesis of single-site Co catalysts, substitutionally doped into surface-controlled TiO2 anatase nanocrystals, aimed at enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Grand canonical quantum mechanics calculations reveal that the kinetics of the OER, following an adsorbate evolution mechanism, is markedly influenced by the coordination environment of Co. The simulations suggest significantly higher turnover frequencies when Co is doped into the (001) surface of TiO2 compared to the (101) surface. Consistent with the computational findings, experimental results show that Co-doped TiO2 (Co-TiO2) nanoplates with selectively exposed {001} surfaces exhibit enhanced current densities and turnover frequencies compared to Co-TiO2 nanobipyramids with {101} surfaces. This study highlights the synergy between theoretical calculations and precision synthesis in the development of more effective catalysts.

Hydrogen is considered the “future fuel” due to its zero‐carbon emissions, high gravimetric energy density, and sustainability. However, the generation of hydrogen through the splitting of water requires highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts to overcome the sluggish kinetics of each half‐cell reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Various emerging materials, including metal‐organic frameworks, 2D materials, single‐atom catalysts, high‐entropy alloys, perovskites, and MXenes, have shown great potential for OER and HER. However, the synthesis strategies for these materials vary significantly based on their unique physicochemical properties. There has been no proper study on synthesis strategies for each class of the emerging materials or synchronization of the heterostructures formed. The variety in emerging materials and available synthesis routes presents ample opportunity for further exploration of target‐oriented materials with unique properties. This review covers recent advancement of emerging materials and their synchronization with existing synthesis strategies for high electrocatalytic activities in water splitting. The review further discusses the challenges and future opportunities for utilizing such emerging materials in water splitting.

Bimetals—materials composed of two metal components with dissimilar standard reduction–oxidation (redox) potentials—offer unique electronic, optical, and catalytic properties, surpassing monometallic systems. These materials exhibit not only the combined attributes of their constituent metals but also new and novel properties arising from their synergy. Although many reviews have explored the synthesis, properties, and applications of bimetallic systems, none have focused exclusively on iron (Fe)- and aluminum (Al)-based bimetals. This systematic review addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of conventional and emerging techniques for Fe-based and Al-based bimetal synthesis. Specifically, this work systematically reviewed recent studies from 2014 to 2023 using the Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar databases, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and was registered under INPLASY with the registration number INPLASY202540026. Articles were excluded if they were inaccessible, non-English, review articles, conference papers, book chapters, or not directly related to the synthesis of Fe- or Al-based bimetals. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis was performed to evaluate the research trends on the synthesis of Fe-based and Al-based bimetals. Based on the 122 articles analyzed, Fe-based and Al-based bimetal synthesis methods were classified into three types: (i) physical, (ii) chemical, and (iii) biological techniques. Physical methods include mechanical alloying, radiolysis, sonochemical methods, the electrical explosion of metal wires, and magnetic field-assisted laser ablation in liquid (MF-LAL). In comparison, chemical protocols covered reduction, dealloying, supported particle methods, thermogravimetric methods, seed-mediated growth, galvanic replacement, and electrochemical synthesis. Meanwhile, biological techniques utilized plant extracts, chitosan, alginate, and cellulose-based materials as reducing agents and stabilizers during bimetal synthesis. Research works on the synthesis of Fe-based and Al-based bimetals initially declined but increased in 2018, followed by a stable trend, with 50% of the total studies conducted in the last five years. China led in the number of publications (62.3%), followed by Russia, Australia, and India, while Saudi Arabia had the highest number of citations per document (95). RSC Advances was the most active journal, publishing eight papers from 2014 to 2023, while Applied Catalysis B: Environmental had the highest number of citations per document at 203. Among the three synthesis methods, chemical techniques dominated, particularly supported particles, galvanic replacement, and chemical reduction, while biological and physical methods have started gaining interest. Iron–copper (Fe/Cu), iron–aluminum (Fe/Al), and iron–nickel (Fe/Ni) were the most commonly synthesized bimetals in the last 10 years. Finally, this work was funded by DOST-PCIEERD and DOST-ERDT.

Abstract Aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs) have great potential for large‐scale energy storage applications. However, the parasitic reactions, such as continuous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), seriously hamper the reversibility and cycling stability of the zinc metal anode (ZMA), limiting its practical application. In this paper, a pre‐growth interfacial layer strategy is adopted to grow the enol/ketone conversion interfacial layer on the surface of ZMA (denoted as Zn@AA). H + can be reversible “lock/unlock” during reversible enol/ketone conversion reaction. It not only broadens the capacity of AZIBs (Zn 2+ /H + co‐insertion), but also inhibits the HER reaction (the amounts of H 2 evolution decreased obviously in both Zn@AA||Zn@AA and Zn@AA||VO 2 ·H 2 O@Ppy (Ppy denote as polypyrrole) cells by on‐line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry analysis), thereby improving its stability performance. The cycle life of the assembled Zn@AA||Zn@AA cell exceeded 3200 h at 1 mA cm −2 and 1 mA h cm −2 . Furtherly, the Zn@AA||VO 2 ·H 2 O@Ppy full cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability and capacity retention. This work provides new ideas for modifying the ZMA interfacial layer to inhibit the HER, which guides the development of AZIBs.

Due to the growing threat of climate change, the pressing need for carbon dioxide capture has become a global priority in the development of innovative technologies. Multipronged approaches and multifarious research efforts are underway to efficiently capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from emission sources, ambient air, and indoor air. Currently, absorption is the dominant industrial-scale process, using different solvents and their blends to lower the energy intensity of solvent desorption and regeneration. However, adsorption is emerging as a promising alternative due to its energy efficiency, eco-friendliness, and potential for large-scale applications. High-performance sorbents with large surface areas and bio-based materials exhibit high CO2 loading and selectivity in fixed-bed and fluidized-bed systems. Cryogenic CO2 capture systems, which do not require solvents or membranes, are optimized for energy through process integration. Researchers are investigating different membrane materials in hollow fiber membrane contactors for enhanced CO2 capture efficiency. Membranes that can selectively filter CO2 from gas mixtures are also being explored. Furthermore, hybrid technologies integrating different CO2 capture approaches are being developed to reduce costs and boost overall performance to curb rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

An indirect, swift, and easy method of enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of an economically viable Fe-rich NiFeCo (NFC) alloy has been developed. This approach leverages the anodic potential sweeps applied indirectly to the counter electrode (CE) when one does cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on by potential sweeping at the working electrode (WE). In this method, NFC was intentionally corroded indirectly by using it as a CE for the potential sweeping HER experiment done with a Pt WE. The indirectly corroded NFC (NFC_IC) featuring mostly γ-NiFeOOH and γ-NiCoOOH entities on the surface was able to begin the OER at an onset overpotential of 250 mV and reach the benchmark of 10 mA cm-2 at 290 mV, which is 60 and 55 mV lesser than that of the bare NFC and RuO2, respectively, all with exceptionally faster kinetics, as evidenced by a relatively smaller Tafel slope of 30 mV dec-1. These insights into designing a trimetallic alloy-based OER electrocatalyst have opened a previously unknown avenue in the development of advanced self-supported OER electrodes for better and efficient H2 production via water electrolysis.

Noble metal electrocatalysts remain the mainstay for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, majorly due to their exceptional activity and durability in acidic media. However, conventional powder and particle catalysts intensively suffer from aggregation, shedding and poor electron conductivity in practical applications. Here, we develop a micellar brush-guided method to agglomerate and smelt metal nanoparticles into erect nanoarrays with designable constitutions on various substrates. While the nanoarrays of stacked nanoparticles show poor stability in the acidic media, the smelting treatment substantially enhances the electron conductivity by more than four order of magnitude and reinforces the nanoarray architectures. This allows the tailored fabrication of self-supported acid-durable metallic and alloy nanoarray catalysts with outstanding hydrogen evolution activity, and metal oxide nanoarray with extraordinary oxygen evolution activity. The integration of metallic Ru-nanoarray and RuOx-nanoarray in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer further enables a long-term stable water electrolysis process for more than 500 h at 1 A cm-2.

Different nanoporous graphene structures have shown great promise for a wide variety of applications. However, due to limitations in experimental or computational throughput, nanoporous graphenes have not been investigated systematically. In this work, we combine density functional theory and machine learning to study 460 structures of nanoporous graphene made from four different templates. We shed light on structure-band gap relations and perform molecular dynamics simulations and phonon calculations in order to determine the role of electron-phonon coupling on the renormalization of temperature-dependent band gaps. Our results uncover that certain subsets of nanoporous graphene exhibit a similar trend in the band gap as a function of a structural parameter as has been observed for armchair graphene nanoribbons. Furthermore, we find that electron-phonon coupling varies over a large range in the investigated nanoporous graphenes and that it drives the closing of the band gap with larger temperatures. Finally, we suggest nanoporous graphene structures for different applications, such as field-effect transistors. Thus, our work can help guide the development and improvement of nanoporous graphene-based devices.

The many-body expansion (MBE) of the lattice energy enables an ab initio description of molecular solids using correlated wave function approximations. However, the practical application of MBE requires computing the large number of n-body contributions efficiently. To this end, we employ a multi-level coupled-cluster approach which adapts the approximation level based on interaction type and intermolecular distance. The high-level method, including connected triple excitations, is applied only to monomer relaxation and dimer interactions roughly within the first and second coordination shells. Long-range dimers and trimers are treated using a simplified coupled-cluster description based on the random-phase approximation (RPA). A key feature is an energy correction which mitigates the underbinding error of the base RPA. Convergence to the bulk limit is accelerated by the addition of the periodic Hartree-Fock correction. The proposed approach is validated against recent diffusion Monte Carlo reference data for the X23 data set, achieving a mean absolute error of 3.1 kJ/mol, i.e., chemical accuracy for absolute lattice energies.

Nevertheless, it is sometimes possible to achieve this by making corresponding choices and adjustments to the experimental technique and sample under investigation. In the present case, the absolute value of the electronic charge the Fe atoms acquire when they are adsorbed on the surface of aluminum oxide α-Al2O3(0001) was measured by a set of surface-sensitive techniques: low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and work function (WF) measurements, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The main focus was the submonolayer coverage of Fe atoms in situ deposited on the well-ordered stoichiometric α-Al2O3(0001) 7 nm thick film formed on a Mo(110) crystal face. An analysis of the evolution of the Fe LVV Auger triplet upon variation of the Fe coverage shows that there is electronic charge transfer from Fe to alumina and that its value gradually decreases as the Fe coverage grows. The same trend is also predicted by the DFT results. Extrapolation of the experimental Fe charge value versus coverage plot yields an estimated value of a single Fe atom adsorbed on α-Al2O3(0001) of 0.98e (electron charge units), which is in reasonable agreement with the calculated value (+1.15e). The knowledge of this value and the possibility of its adjustment may be important points for the development and tuning of modern sub-nanometer-scale technologies of diverse applied relevance and can contribute to a more complete justification and selection of the corresponding theoretical models.

Exploring the interaction configurations between substrates and atomic or molecular systems is crucial for various scientific and technological applications, such as characterizing catalytic reactions, solvation structures, and molecular interactions. Traditional approaches for generating substrate-reactant configurations often rely on chemical intuition, symmetry operations, or random initial states, which can be inefficient and challenging for systems with low symmetry or unknown interaction mechanisms. This work introduces a systematic and automated methodology to explore the configuration space between substrates and adsorbates using symmetry-invariant features that characterize the local atomistic topology of the substrate. The approach involves three key components: (1) defining and discretizing a contact space surrounding the substrate, (2) utilizing symmetry-invariant descriptors to capture local atomic environments, and (3) employing unsupervised machine-learning techniques for clustering and hierarchical analysis of interaction sites. The method ensures comprehensive yet nonredundant sampling of the configuration space, independent of the substrate dimensionality. Applications to simple ideal substrates show that symmetry intuition and high-symmetry sites are correctly recovered. Moreover, the method is shown to translate seamlessly to less symmetric substrates.

Hydrogen-centered electrochemical technologies play a vital role in sustainable energy conversion and storage. One of the challenges in achieving cheap hydrogen is to bridge the gap between advanced electrocatalysts and highly effective electrodes. The key lies in designing electrocatalysts with high intrinsic activity and understanding the structure–activity relationship in water electrolysis. Being proposed as promising electrocatalysts, bulk oxides, with their compositional and crystal structure flexibility, provide a good platform for studying the correlation between intrinsic activity and electronic structure and also for screening superior catalysts for water electrolysis. In this review, we discuss the recent developments of oxide electrocatalysts in understanding the structure–activity relationship. Firstly, we present a thorough overview of recent advances from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Subsequently, we highlight the design principles to provide guidance for promoting performance. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives about this field are presented. This review aims to provide guidance for the design of highly advanced oxide electrocatalysts for water electrolysis and large-scale green energy supply.

This study investigates the immobilization of dinuclear iridium‐imidazole complexes onto indium tin oxides for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media. The immobilized iridium complexes show exceptional catalytic activity and stability, which are attributed to the facile cleavage of the elongated μ O bonds between the two iridium metal centers. This cleavage leads to the formation of dangling oxygen, which plays a crucial role in facilitating thermochemical water dissociation. O 2 is released through a dangling oxygen–participated mechanism, accompanied by the regeneration of the μ O bonds. This unique OER mechanism, possibly specific to immobilized (strained) molecular catalysts, resembles the lattice oxygen participation mechanism reported for unstable oxides, but with the advantage of high stability in acidic media. This study not only identifies a new mechanism but can also inform the design of immobilized molecular catalysts with enhanced performance.
