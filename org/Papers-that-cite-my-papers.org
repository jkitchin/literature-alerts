Electrocatalytic water splitting to generate green H 2 with renewable energy inputs is attractive to relieve the environmental contamination and energy dilemma. Restricted by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and single functionality of cathode/anode catalysts, conventional overall water splitting (OWS) suffers from high overpotentials and respective synthesis of monofunctional electrocatalysts, leading to high cost. Moreover, the generated O 2 bears low value and its possible mixing with H 2 poses safety issues. In response, hybrid water splitting (HWS) that integrates hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with favorable oxidative upgrading reactions over bifunctional electrocatalysts can generate H 2 and value-added chemicals simultaneously with lower energy input and avoid the explosive H 2 /O 2 mixtures. Hence, this chapter focuses on the recent progress in bifunctional electrocatalyst–driven HWS for energy-saving coproduction of highly valuable chemicals and green H 2 . Firstly, the fundamentals of HER, OER, OWS, and HWS are introduced, followed by a discussion on the electrochemical reconstruction of bifunctional electrocatalysts during OWS and HWS. Next, the HWS based on bifunctional electrocatalysts is summarized, wherein the alternative oxidation reactions include upgrading of alcohol, aldehydes, amines, biomass, and plastic waste. Finally, a brief overview of current challenges and perspective for bifunctional electrocatalyst–driven HWS is discussed.

Abstract Bimetallic nickel‐iron based oxides are regarded as one of the most promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we show that the precursor metal salts can affect the OER activity of the resulting Ni/Fe oxide under the same hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Pure sulfate, pure nitrate and mixed sulfate/nitrate metal salts were used to fabricate NiFe based oxide materials and to study the importance of the precursor choice for the OER. The results show that the nature of the precursor used in the synthesis of the bimetallic nickel‐iron materials can influence different multi‐phase catalysts to form which effects the OER.

Abstract We present the Python package , which provides a modular approach to the cluster expansion (CE) method. can treat a wide variety of substitutional systems, including one-, two-, and three-dimensional alloys, in a general multi-component and multi-sublattice framework. It is capable of dealing with complex materials comprising several atoms in their parent lattice . uses state-of-the-art techniques for the construction of training data sets, model selection, and finite-temperature simulations. The user interface consists of well-documented Python classes and modules ( http://sol.physik.hu-berlin.de/cell/ ). also provides visualization utilities and can be interfaced with virtually any ab initio package, total-energy codes based on interatomic potentials, and more. The usage and capabilities of are illustrated by a number of examples, comprising a Cu-Pt surface alloy with oxygen adsorption, featuring two coupled binary sublattices, and the thermodynamic analysis of its order-disorder transition; the demixing transition and lattice-constant bowing of the Si-Ge alloy; and an iterative CE approach for a complex clathrate compound with a parent lattice consisting of 54 atoms.

Three-dimensional organic-inorganic perovskites are rapidly evolving materials with diverse applications. This study focuses on their two representatives - acetamidinium manganese(II) formate (AceMn) and formamidinium manganese(II) formate (FMDMn) - subjected to varying temperature and pressure. We show that AceMn undergoes atypical pressure-induced structural transformations at room temperature, increasing the symmetry from ambient-pressure P2

Abstract We present ichor , an open‐source Python library that simplifies data management in computational chemistry and streamlines machine learning force field development. Ichor implements many easily extensible file management tools, in addition to a lazy file reading system, allowing efficient management of hundreds of thousands of computational chemistry files. Data from calculations can be readily stored into databases for easy sharing and post‐processing. Raw data can be directly processed by ichor to create machine learning‐ready datasets. In addition to powerful data‐related capabilities, ichor provides interfaces to popular workload management software employed by High Performance Computing clusters, making for effortless submission of thousands of separate calculations with only a single line of Python code.

Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) is considered one of the most hazardous chemicals used in industrial plants. Even small exposures to HF can have fatal consequences if not promptly and properly treated. Various research teams have presented numerous substances with the objective of capturing or detecting toxic HF gas. In this study, we explore the impact of HF gas on a single layer of SnS by employing density functional theory (DFT). The interaction nature between the gas molecule and the adsorbent is elucidated by analyzing the related adsorption energy, electronic structure properties and differential charge transfer. The findings indicate that HF is physically adsorbed on the pristine SnS with an adsorption energy value of -0.63 eV. By introducing a Sn mono vacancy defect, the modification of SnS enhances the adsorption energy to -1.26 eV, resulting in a chemisorption process. Molecular fluorine (F2) was discovered to undergo a barrierless reaction with SnS, resulting in the formation of fluorine-substituted SnS. It has been discovered that the substitution of fluorine atoms enhances the reactivity of SnS towards hydro- gen fluoride gas. The adsorption potential of the studied structures towards HF gas was determined to be in the following order: F2SnS > VSn-SnS > VS-SnS ∼ SnS. The current study is anticipated to offer new molecular insights that could lead to the creation of innovative devices for detecting or eliminating HF toxic gas from a specific atmosphere.

Abstract Perovskite oxides are considered highly promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to their low cost and adaptable electronic structure. However, modulating the electronic structure of catalysts without altering their nanomorphology is crucial for understanding the structure‐property relationship. In this study, a simple plasma bombardment strategy is developed to optimize the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides. Experimental characterization of plasma‐treated LaCo 0.9 Fe 0.1 O 3 (P‐LCFO) reveals abundant oxygen vacancies, which expose numerous active sites. Additionally, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X‐ray absorption fine structure analyses indicate a low Co valence state in P‐LCFO, likely due to the presence of these oxygen vacancies, which contributes to an optimized electronic structure that enhances OER performance. Consequently, P‐LCFO exhibits significantly improved OER catalytic activity, with a low overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , outperforming commercial RuO 2 . This work underscores the benefits of plasma engineering for studying structure‐property relationships and developing highly active perovskite oxide catalysts for water splitting.

The lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) battery, renowned for its exceptionally high theoretical energy density, is poised to revolutionize next-generation energy storage systems. However, its practical application depends on overcoming several challenges, particularly the high cathode overpotential, which significantly diminishes the battery's energy efficiency and durability. This study delves into the interactions at the cathode surface during oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER), extending the analysis beyond the initial reaction stages to encompass the extensive charge–discharge process. We introduce and define the concepts of intrinsic equilibrium potential and intrinsic overpotential, demonstrating that these critical parameters are predominantly influenced by the growth of discharge products, rather than the catalysts, thereby underscoring the inherent properties of the battery. This shift in focus from merely enhancing cathode catalysts to understanding and leveraging the intrinsic characteristics of the battery discharge process opens new avenues for optimizing and enhancing the performance of large-scale Li–O2 batteries. Furthermore, our findings indicate potential broader applications to other metal–oxygen systems, paving the way for the design of high-capacity, high-efficiency energy storage technologies.

The treatment of highly concentrated and recalcitrant organic pollutants in industrial wastewater has garnered significant attention, with Fenton oxidation emerging as a promising approach. However, traditional iron-based Fenton reagents present certain limitations, and copper-based Fenton systems are often less efficient. Thus, it is necessary to develop innovative copper-based Fenton catalytic materials. In this study, Cu₂O and Ag-modified activated carbon fibers (Cu₂O-Ag@ACF) were synthesized via liquid-phase reduction. The composition, structure, and morphology of Cu₂O-Ag@ACF were systematically characterized. The Cu₂O-Ag@ACF was employed as a functionalized cathode in the electro-Fenton process to degrade a highly concentrated organic pollutant solution, with methylene blue serving as a model contaminant. The loading of Cu₂O and Ag not only enhances the electrochemical performance of ACF but also improves its Fenton oxidation efficiency. Cu₂O-Ag@ACF exhibitd less than 1% performance degradation after five cycles of use, highlighting its potential for industrial applications under simulated realistic conditions. Moreover, the electro-Fenton system parameters, including current density, pH, electrode spacing, and solution temperature, were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the degradation rate of methylene blue by Cu₂O-Ag@ACF reached 92.8% within 120 minutes. Kinetic analysis indicated that the reaction followed a first-order kinetic model, with a rate constant of 0.253 min⁻¹. Furthermore, this study revealed that trace silver doping significantly accelerated the generation of reactive oxygen species, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the Cu-based Fenton-like catalysts. In conclusion, this work presents a convenient strategy for the sustainable and efficient purification of industrial wastewater, contributing to the improvement of human life quality.

The bigger pictureChallenges and opportunities:•The scarcity of active sites limits the large-scale application of metal oxides as commercial oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. However, the rational design of defect structures can boost their catalytic activity•The precise design of catalyst defect structures requires a comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationship between defects and OER performance. Current research primarily focuses on the correlation between defects and thermodynamic parameters. However, our understanding of the intrinsic relationship between defects and the kinetics and mechanisms of OERs remains limited•In the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), defect structures can accelerate the evolution of active surfaces, promote OH⁻ adsorption and deprotonation, and facilitate the desorption of the product O₂. In the lattice oxygen intermediate mechanism (LOM), defect structures can enhance the covalency of metal–oxygen bonds and provide OH⁻ adsorption sites, facilitating their involvement in lattice oxygen oxidation processesSummaryThe development of electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis for hydrogen production and rechargeable metal-air batteries, offers promising solutions to the energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, challenges like sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and scarce active sites in transition metal oxides hinder large-scale commercial applications. Defect engineering has emerged as a promising strategy to optimize transition metal oxides by improving their electronic structure, conductivity, and active site availability. Early research focused on static thermodynamic parameters, such as impedance, overpotential, and band gap, neglecting dynamic factors like catalyst surface restructuring and mechanism transformation during reactions. This perspective highlights the intrinsic connection between defect structures, catalyst surface reconstruction, and reaction mechanisms. It also discusses the need for advanced experimental and theoretical computational studies to better understand the surface evolution of catalysts during OERs.Graphical abstract

With density functional theory (DFT), it is possible to calculate the formation energy of charged point defects and in turn to predict a range of experimentally relevant quantities, such as defect concentrations, charge transition levels, or recombination rates. While prior efforts have led to marked improvements in the accuracy of such calculations, comparatively modest effort has been directed at quantifying their uncertainties. However, in the broader DFT research space, the development of Bayesian Error Estimation Functionals (BEEF) has enabled uncertainty quantification (UQ) for other properties. In this paper, we investigate the utility of BEEF as a tool for UQ of defect formation energies. We build a pipeline for propagating BEEF energies through a formation-energy calculation and test it on intrinsic defects in several materials systems spanning a variety of chemistries, bandgaps, and crystal structures, comparing to prior published results where available. We also assess the impact of aligning to a deep-level transition rather than to the VBM (valence band maximum). We observe negligible dependence of the estimated uncertainty upon a supercell size, though the relationship may be obfuscated by the fact that finite-size corrections cannot be computed separately for each member of the BEEF ensemble. Additionally, we find an increase in estimated uncertainty with respect to the absolute charge of a defect and the relaxation around the defect site without deep-level alignment, but this trend is absent when the alignment is applied. While further investigation is warranted, our results suggest that BEEF could be a useful method for UQ in defect calculations.

The design of small molecules is crucial for technological applications ranging from drug discovery to energy storage. Due to the vast design space available to modern synthetic chemistry, the community has increasingly sought to use data-driven and machine learning approaches to navigate this space. Although generative machine learning methods have recently shown potential for computational molecular design, their use is hindered by complex training procedures, and they often fail to generate valid and unique molecules. In this context, pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for molecular design, as they appear to be capable of creating and modifying molecules based on simple instructions provided through natural language prompts. In this work, we show that the Claude 3 Opus LLM can read, write, and modify molecules according to prompts, with impressive 97% valid and unique molecules. By quantifying these modifications in a low-dimensional latent space, we systematically evaluate the model's behavior under different prompting conditions. Notably, the model is able to perform guided molecular generation when asked to manipulate the electronic structure of molecules using simple, natural-language prompts. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs as powerful and versatile molecular design engines.

Ferroelectric semiconductors hold great promise in the field of photocatalysis due to their spontaneous polarization that can suppress the recombination of photogenerated charges, but the mechanism of the effect of ferroelectric polarization and the intensity of polarization on surface catalytic reactions have never been approached. Here, we have comparatively investigated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic process on surfaces in polarized and unpolarized orientations of the intrinsic ferroelectric semiconductor β-CuGaO

We have examined the case of light atom (B, N) doped and co-doped graphitic films grown on copper for the anode-free Li Metal Battery (AFLMB) application. For nitrogen doping, the depositions were carried out by laser ablating pure graphite (Gr) in the presence of Nitrogen (N2) or Ammonia (NH3). In another interesting case, 5 wt. % Boron nitride (BN) was added into the graphite target itself to obtain BN-doped graphite films. It was found that the growth condition mediated film constitution and properties significantly influence the Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability of the cells when tested for AFLMB. The cycle life demonstrated by the cells of pure graphitic film (Gr) was only about 110 cycles, while the N-doped graphite films obtained using N2 gas (N2–Gr) exhibited stability up to about 300 cycles. Interestingly the N-doped films obtained using NH3 gas (NH3–Gr) exhibited a stability of 715 cycles and B, N co-doped graphite (BN–Gr) film resulted in an even longer cycle life of 795 cycles. Density functional theory calculations were also performed to deeply understand the interaction and binding energy of Lithium within the undoped and doped graphene sheets modeled through the addition of light elements. It was found that the binding of Li is stronger in the (B, N) co-doped graphene as compared to the N-doped graphene and undoped graphene but much weaker than the B-doped graphene. Therefore, an improved lateral Li diffusion in the (B, N) co-doped graphene is observed where the Li binding strength is optimum resulting in better cycling stability.

Abstract In this study, we developed and parametrized a friction model for finite element (FE) cutting simulations of AISI4140 steel, combining experimental data and numerical simulations at various scales. Given the severe thermomechanical loads during cutting, parametrization of friction models based on analogous experiments has been proven difficult, such that the cutting process itself is often used for calibration. Instead, our model is based on the real area of contact between rough surfaces and the stress required to shear adhesive micro contacts. We utilized microtextured cutting tools and their negative imprint on chips to orient chip and tool surfaces, enabling the determination of a combined surface roughness. This effective roughness was then applied in contact mechanics calculations using a penetration hardness model informed by indentation hardness measurements. Consistent with Bowden and Tabor theory, we observed that the fractional contact area increased linearly with the applied normal load, and the effective roughness remained insensitive to cutting fluid application. Additionally, we calculated the required shear stress as a function of normal load using DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations for a tribofilm formed at the interface, with its composition inferred from ex-situ XPS depth profiling of the cutting tools. Our friction model demonstrated good agreement with experimental results in two-dimensional FE chip forming simulations of orthogonal cutting processes, evaluated by means of cutting force, passive force, and contact length prediction. This work presents a proof of concept for a physics-based approach to calibrate constitutive models in metal cutting, potentially advancing the use of multiscale and multiphysical simulations in machining.

Abstract Defect engineering is a powerful strategy for enhancing the catalytic properties of monolayer VSe 2 . In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the impact of point defects and hydrogen adsorption sites on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of VSe 2 . We analyzed the formation energies and hydrogen adsorption behavior of single and double vacancies in VSe 2 . The results show that V vacancy defect (D2), consecutive V-Se double vacancy defect (D3), and separate V-Se double defect (D4) exhibit the enhanced HER activity with Gibbs free energies (Δ G H * = 0.04 eV, 0.04 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively) even surpassing that of platinum (Δ G H * = − 0.1 eV). This study highlights the potential of defect-engineered VSe 2 for efficient hydrogen evolution.

Predicting the error in density functional theory (DFT) calculations due to the choice of exchange-correlation (XC) functional is crucial to the success of DFT, but currently, there are limited options to estimate this a priori. This is particularly important for high-throughput screening of new materials. In this work, the structure and elastic properties of binary and ternary oxides are computed using four XC functionals: LDA, PBE-GGA, PBEsol, and vdW-DF with C09 exchange. To analyze the systemic errors inherent to each XC functional, we employed materials informatics methods to predict the expected errors. The predicted errors were also used to better the DFT-predicted lattice parameters. Our results emphasize the link between the computed errors and the electron density and hybridization errors of a functional. In essence, these results provide "error bars" for choosing a functional for the creation of high-accuracy, high-throughput datasets as well as avenues for the development of XC functionals with enhanced performance, thereby enabling the accelerated discovery and design of new materials.

Deployment of post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technologies is needed to reduce emissions from power and industrial sources. Comparisons between existing thermochemical CO2 capture methods and emerging electrochemical concepts can help contextualize the promise of these new approaches. Here, we investigate the required absorber sizes for three capture systems: amine scrubbing using monoethanolamine (MEA), direct electrochemical (redox-active sorbent), and indirect electrochemical (pH-swing). For the electrochemical systems, we study how column size varies as a function of molecular properties and operating conditions, finding that parameters most closely related to CO2 uptake rates (i.e., rate constants and pKa) have the greatest impact. Through a Monte Carlo analysis, we find that the direct process can be designed to have column sizes similar to the thermochemical process, however, the CO2 uptake rate in the indirect process is too slow to enable smaller columns. Broadly, this work connects system input parameters to absorber performance for electrochemical CO2 capture and provides a foundation for technoeconomic and engineering analyses.

Abstract Regulating the adsorption of an intermediate on an electrocatalyst by manipulating the electron spin state of the transition metal is of great significance for promoting the activation of inert nitrogen molecules (N 2 ) during the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR). However, achieving this remains challenging. Herein, a novel 2D/2D Mott–Schottky heterojunction, Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P, is developed as an eNRR catalyst. This is achieved through the in situ growth of cobalt sulfide (Co 9 S 8 ) nanosheets over a Nb 2 CT x MXene using a solution plasma modification method. Transformation of the Co spin state from low (t 2g 6 e g 1 ) to high (t 2g 5 e g 2 ) is achieved by adjusting the interface electronic structure and sulfur vacancy of Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P. The adsorption ability of N 2 is optimized through high spin Co(II) with more unpaired electrons, significantly accelerating the *N 2 →*NNH kinetic process. The Co 9 S 8 /Nb 2 CT x ‐P exhibits a high NH 3 yield of 62.62 µg h −1 mg cat. −1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 30.33% at −0.40 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m HCl. Additionally, it achieves an NH 3 yield of 41.47 µg h −1 mg cat. −1 and FE of 23.19% at −0.60 V versus RHE in 0.1 m Na 2 SO 4 . This work demonstrates a promising strategy for constructing heterojunction electrocatalysts for efficient eNRR.
