Abstract Proton‐exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) require durable and efficient catalyst supports to overcome the limitations of Pt‐based catalysts and conventional low‐crystalline carbon (LCC) supports, such as high cost, susceptibility to corrosion, and poor electrochemical durability. While highly crystalline carbon (HCC) offers improved stability, its intrinsic hydrophobicity and low defect density hinder Pt nanoparticles (NPs) nucleation and dispersion. In this study, a spin‐on‐dopant (SOD) approach is employed to synthesize phosphorus‐incorporated HCC (HCC P ) providing stable anchoring sites that facilitate uniform Pt NPs distribution. Compared to commercial Pt/LCC, Pt/HCC P exhibits enhanced thermal stability and oxidation resistance, with an oxidation onset temperature ≈90 °C higher. Accelerated durability tests reveal only a 2 mV half‐wave potential shift and a minimal electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss of 1.9% after 20 000 cycles, significantly lower than the 47.1% ECSA loss observed for Pt/LCC. Single‐cell tests further confirm that Pt/HCC P retains 92.4% of its initial power density, outperforming Pt/LCC. The incorporation of phosphorus improves Pt NPs stabilization on the superhydrophobic HCC surface, enhancing Pt utilization and long‐term durability. This study provides valuable insights into the development of high‐performance carbon supports for PEMFC catalysts.

The development of advanced catalysts with innovative nanoarchitectures is critical for addressing energy and environmental challenges such as the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Herein, the synthesis of an innovative copper–sulfur planar structure, Cu–S–BDC, within a metal–organic framework (MOF) catalyst is presented, which demonstrates 100% selectivity toward formate as the sole carbon product. Structural analysis and surface characterizations reveal that Cu–S–BDC exhibits quasi‐2D inorganic building units, with Cu bonded to two S‐CH groups and one BDC linker, while carboxylate groups adopt a bridging coordination mode. This unique arrangement not only imparts remarkable structural stability but also enhances the electronic properties of the MOF, as evidenced by a narrow bandgap of 1.203 eV that facilitates efficient charge transfer and increased electrochemical current density in CORR. Notably, it offers a Faradaic efficiency of 92% for formate at an overpotential as low as −0.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an aqueous electrolyte of 1 m KOH, as well as a current density of −25.8 mA cm 2 at −0.9 V versus RHE, averaged over 24 h of electrolysis. This study highlights a fresh perspective in the field of MOF electrocatalysts by demonstrating that engineering the metal coordination environment can significantly enhance the electronic properties and consequently improve the electrocatalytic performance of these materials.

This review provides an overview of recent advancements in cathode materials for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), focusing on their role in catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This begins with a fundamental discussion of the ORR mechanism, including two‐electron and four‐electron pathways. The review then explores a wide range of electrocatalyst materials, starting with precious metal catalysts, particularly platinum‐based materials, along with alloying strategies and composite structures. This then delves into nonprecious metal catalysts, encompassing metal‐free ORR electrocatalysts, carbon‐supported composite materials (including heteroatom doping and metal‐carbon composites), and transition metal oxides. The review further examines metal phthalocyanines, biomass‐derived catalysts, bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticles supported on carbon matrices, and chalcogenides (oxides, sulfides, and selenides) as ORR electrocatalysts. Advanced materials such as single‐ and dual‐atom catalysts, high‐entropy alloys, and metal organic frameworks derived electrocatalysts are also discussed. We analyze the identification of reaction sites and the effect of structure on catalytic activity. Furthermore, the review covers electrochemical measurements in PEMFCs and explores technological applications and industrial relevance, including products and patents. Finally, this review concludes by addressing future perspectives and challenges in the field of cathode materials for PEMFCs.

Abstract Peroxidase (POD)‐like nanozymes have emerged as effective alternatives to natural enzymes owing to their stability and cost‐effectiveness in biosensors. In particular, single‐atom nanozymes (SAzymes) featuring Fe–N 4 active sites have attracted significant attention for their high catalytic performance. However, their 2D exposed active sites result in limited reaction selectivity and strong pH dependence, restricting their functionality under neutral conditions. This study introduces Ru‐centered SAzymes coordinated out‐of‐plane with chlorine ligands (RuNC_Cl), achieving monofunctional POD‐like activity. RuNC_Cl exhibited remarkable POD‐like activity, which is 38‐fold greater than its catalase (CAT)‐like activity, indicating strong suppression of the competing CAT‐like reaction. Density functional theory calculations and Bader charge analysis of RuNC_Cl reveal that repulsive forces preventing secondary H 2 O 2 adsorption contribute to an increased energy barrier for the CAT‐like reaction. This selective POD‐like activity enables the precise detection of multiple biomarkers through a one‐pot cascade reaction under near‐neutral conditions. This advancement paves the way for the precise regulation of reaction pathways, enhancing the practicality of nanozymes for biosensing and related applications.

Abstract Dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) embedded in nitrogen‐doped graphene have been widely studied for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R), primarily yielding CO. However, achieving selectivity for C1 hydrocarbons remains challenging. Here, 32 Janus DACs (J‐M'M) are designed and investigated for CO 2 R using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, identifying 13 capable of producing methanol and methane. Notably, J‐FeCo and J‐CoNi exhibit favorable limiting potentials (−0.38 and −0.45 V vs. RHE) for CH 3 OH and CH 4 production, respectively, based on constant‐potential calculations. Compared to normal DACs (N‐M'M), Janus DACs demonstrate enhanced initial CO 2 hydrogenation and stronger CO adsorption. Oxygen coordination in J‐FeCo and J‐CoNi induces a downshift/upshift of majority‐/minority‐spin energy levels of d z2 , d yz , and d xz orbitals toward the Fermi level relative to N‐FeCo and N‐CoNi, strengthening the bonding state and weakening the antibonding state, thereby improving CO adsorption. Furthermore, an effective descriptor based on atomic features is identified to evaluate *CO binding strength. This work highlights the critical role of partial oxygen coordination in DACs for C1 hydrocarbons production and proposes a robust descriptor to guide the design of related catalysts.

There is a growing interest in anionic redox chemistry to improve the energy densities of rechargeable batteries, and the reversible chlorine/chloride reactions are a promising option for low-temperature applications. As such, understanding Cl adsorption on the cathode surfaces is important in revealing the intimate connection between catalysis and charge storage via the reversible surface Cl2/Cl− redox chemistry. In this work, we investigate the adsorption of Cl on various SrBO3 perovskites, with B being 3d transition metals, by using density functional theory calculations and interpretable machine learning. We identify the electronic structure descriptors crucial for Cl adsorption. Our findings reveal that SrCoO3 exhibits optimal Cl adsorption at the top of the volcano curve for Cl2 evolution, suggesting its potential as a catalyst to enable a low-temperature, liquid Cl2 electrode.

Abstract Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is a promising approach to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet effectively enhancing the lattice oxygen participation remains a significant challenge. Herein, we aim to enhance the lattice oxygen participation of spinel Co 3 O 4 in OER through introducing rare‐earth europium (Eu) and constructing the [Eu‐O‐Co] unit. The constructed [Eu‐O‐Co] unit facilitates electron donation from Eu to surrounding Co‐O sites, thereby altering the redox sequence of transition metal and lattice oxygen. This structural innovation enables Eu‐Co 3 O 4 to present outstanding OER performance including a low overpotential of 305 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , robust long‐term stability, and high efficiency in rechargeable Zn‐air batteries. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the [Eu‐O‐Co] unit enhances lattice oxygen redox dynamics and enables direct O─O bond formation. The occupied Eu‐4f spin‐up orbitals near the Fermi level play a crucial role in activating highly labile lattice oxygen at Eu‐neighboring oxygen sites, promoting lattice oxygen participation in the non‐concerted proton‐electron transfer process, and lowing the thermodynamically limiting potential of LOM pathway. These findings underscore the importance of rare‐earth elements in modulating lattice oxygen redox dynamics, offering valuable insights for advancing the design of OER catalysts.

In this work, we systematically investigate the structure of Sr and Mg doped lanthanum gallate single crystals using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis revealed the presence of multiple domains with distinct lattice parameters. High-resolution TEM and integrated differential phase contrast imaging captured two regions, one with 90° symmetry and the other with non-90° symmetry. In addition, ordered oxygen vacancies in the non-90° region were revealed, while vacancies in the 90° region were randomly distributed. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy confirmed that the difference in the doping level of the two regions is within the detectability limits. However, the electron energy loss near-edge structure revealed detectable differences in their bonding character.

ABSTRACT Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) with high activity and selectivity are regarded as excellent OER catalysts, but easily corroded under acidic environment. Here, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to design a series of SACs protected by twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) “chainmail.” Charge transfer analysis showed that the carbon layer could serve as an intermediate between transition metal atom and reactants. In addition, rotation operation on bilayer graphene was applied to further enhance the catalytic performance. Thermodynamic free energy diagrams of eight types metal atoms and five rotation angles were systematically discussed. A volcano plot of overpotentials among all the studied single metal atom twisted bilayer graphene catalysts can be described by (). The designed Ni‐tBLG catalyst (rotation angle is 21.8°) exhibited the best performance with the lowest OER overpotential of 0.35 V. These results revealed that the selected single metal atom twisted bilayer graphene catalysts with high activity and stability could be treated as efficient OER catalysts.

ABSTRACT The molecular structure of phenyl‐substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (PSCCA, C 12 H 14 O 2 ; 3‐methyl‐3‐phenylcyclobutane‐1‐carboxylic acid ) was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and X‐ray crystallography techniques. Following structural confirmation, its molecular geometry was optimized at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level. The van der Waals interactions were accurately accounted for using the DFT‐D3 method in the CP2K program. Understanding the adsorption behavior of organic molecules on metal surfaces is of great significance for applications in catalysis, sensor design, surface functionalization, and corrosion prevention. In this context, the adsorption properties of the PSCCA molecule on Al and Cu surfaces were investigated in detail using DFT‐based CP2K calculations. By optimizing different adsorption configurations, the binding energies of the most stable structures were calculated and compared. The obtained results indicate that the PSCCA molecule strongly binds to both Al and Cu surfaces, with a higher adsorption energy on the Al surface compared to the Cu surface. In addition, Mulliken population analysis revealed distinct electronic charge transfer characteristics upon adsorption, with substantially stronger electron transfer observed on the Cu(111) surface due to enhanced d‐band–ligand orbital hybridization. This electronic behavior correlates with the adsorption strength and highlights the critical role of metal electronic structure in governing surface interactions. Electron density difference analyses suggest that PSCCA interacts with both surfaces via a physisorption mechanism. Furthermore, assessments in the context of surface inhibitor efficiency reveal that PSCCA has the potential to passivate active surface regions and hinder surface reactions. Analyses conducted under different pH conditions indicate that the inhibitory effect of PSCCA is particularly pronounced in acidic environments. These findings suggest that PSCCA, exhibiting higher adsorption energy and stability on the Al surface, can be considered an effective protective agent and may play a crucial role in the design of metal–organic interfaces.

The rational design of heterointerfaces with optimized charge dynamics and defect engineering remains pivotal for developing advanced non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for water splitting. A comparative study of NiCo2S4–MoS2 heterostructures was conducted to elucidate the impact of interfacial architecture and defect engineering on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. A core@shell NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal growth method, inducing lattice distortion and strong interfacial coupling, while supported NiCo2S4/MoS2 heterostructures were prepared by ultrasonic-assisted deposition. A detailed structural and spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculation demonstrated that the core@shell configuration promotes charge redistribution across the NiCo2S4–MoS2 interface and generates abundant sulfur vacancies, thereby increasing the density of electroactive sites. Electrochemical measurements reveal that NiCo2S4@MoS2 markedly outperforms the supported heterostructure, single-component NiCo2S4, and MoS2 when serving as the HER catalyst in acid solution. These findings establish a dual-optimization strategy—combining interfacial design with vacancy modulation—that provides a generalizable paradigm for the deliberate design of high-efficiency non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for water splitting reactions.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to useful chemicals holds promise for a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the key factors that control the pathways to various desired products remain unresolved, partially due to the limited knowledge of reaction intermediates on the electrode surface. To address this, we utilize in situ electrochemical shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory calculation to examine the potential-dependent composition of adsorbed species during CO2 reduction on polycrystalline copper. The results reveal that carbonate anion adsorption outcompetes other carbon-containing species, including adsorbed CO2 activation intermediate *COO- and *CO, which has the effect of anodically shifting the onset potential of *CO formation in electrolyte solutions with a lower carbonate concentration. These results suggest that the competitive binding of carbonate impedes the reduction of CO2 on the Cu surface. Monte Carlo simulations show that both potential dependent electrode surface change and electrode-carbonate Coulomb interaction are key to understanding the competitive binding process. Our findings suggest that reducing the competitive binding of carbonate may be a promising route to improve the CO2 reduction on Cu electrodes at low overpotentials.

Hydrogen is a promising clean energy carrier, yet the high energy demand of water electrolysis limits its widespread adoption. Catalysis is crucial to enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production and lower energy costs. However, conventional catalyst design guided by the d-band theory faces inconsistencies in predicting adsorption behavior, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major efficiency bottleneck. To address these challenges, we developed a strain-engineered Rh single-atom catalyst anchored on curved WS2 supported by carbon nanotubes (RhSA/WS2@CNT) to modulate the electronic structure. The resultant catalyst achieves an ultralow overpotential of 17.4 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a mass activity ∼65 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the H* adsorption trend contradicts d-band theory predictions but is explained by orbital symmetry adaptation, where the strain-modulated dxz orbital plays a major role in governing adsorption energetics. Beyond catalyst design, the HER catalyst was coupled with a photocatalytic iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) to replace the OER and reduce the water-splitting voltage to 0.7 V. This study not only introduces a strain-engineering strategy to optimize single-atom catalysts but also demonstrates a coupled electro-photo system that enhances energy efficiency, offering an alternative approach for sustainable hydrogen production.

Abstract Hydrogen stands at the forefront of next‐generation clean energy solutions. Specifically, electrochemical water splitting represents a cutting‐edge, environmentally benign approach for sustainable green hydrogen generation. The development of next‐generation highly efficient electrocatalysts with high efficiency and durability is pivotal to overcome the intrinsic kinetic limitations of both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Contextually, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), owing to their ultrahigh surface area, tuneable nanostructures, and exceptional porosity, have emerged as a versatile class of materials for designing advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, a nickel‐metal complex ( NMC ) and a nickel‐metal–organic framework ( NMF ) was rationally synthesized. Electrochemical analyses revealed that the NMF exhibited superior bifunctional activity, with low overpotentials of 144 mV for HER and 347 mV for OER at the current density of 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline media. Remarkably, the NMF || NMF catalyst delivered a low overall water splitting cell voltage of 1.647 V at 10 mA cm −2 , along with outstanding long‐term stability. Comprehensive experimental and in silico insights confirm that NMF dramatically lowers the energy barrier for hydrogen adsorption. These findings highlight the NMF as a state‐of‐the‐art electrocatalyst, underscoring its potential to enable next‐generation, advanced water electrolysis techniques for green hydrogen production.

For most organic structures, the donor-acceptor (D-A) effect can effectively regulate the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance. However, the internal correlation between the structure and charge transportation, especially at the molecular level, is insufficiently explored. Herein, Cu3(PyCA)3 (PyCA = pyrazolate-4-carboxaldehyde), tris(4-aminophenyl) amine, and [2,2'-bipyridine]-5,5'-diamine were employed to prepare two metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), namely, Tap-MCOF and Bpy-MCOF, both of which are D-A-type structure. In accordance, Tap-MCOF exhibits improved conversion of H2O and O2 to H2O2 in the absence of sacrificial agent, achieving the H2O2 production rate of 288.58 μmol g-1 h-1, which is approximately 2.7-fold higher than that of Bpy-MCOF. It is considered due to the intensified D-A effect within Tap-MCOF, it presents a narrower band gaps and greater separation of photoinduced carriers, compared with that of Bpy-MCOF. The transient photocurrent response intensity of Tap-MCOF is significantly higher than that of Bpy-MCOF, indicating its superior charge separation and transport efficiency. These results not only provide a strategy for manipulating the carrier separation efficiency of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also furnish insights into the effective photocatalytic ORR and WOR transformations of organic semiconducting catalysts.

Carbon capture and utilization or sequestration (CCUS) from industrial point sources and direct air capture (DAC) are both necessary to curb the rising atmospheric levels of CO2. Amine scrubbers, the current leading carbon capture technology, suffer from poor oxidative and thermal stability, limiting their long-term cycling stability under oxygen-rich streams such as air and the emissions from natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants. Herein, we demonstrate that the hydroxide-based cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (CD-MOF) Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST possesses high CO2 capacities from dry dilute streams at low temperatures and humid streams at elevated temperatures. Additionally, it displays good thermal, oxidative, and cycling stabilities and selective CO2 capture under mixed gas conditions in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Unexpectedly, under dry, hot conditions, a shift in the CO2 adsorption mechanism─from reversibly formed bicarbonate to irreversibly formed carbonate─is observed, as supported by gas sorption and spectroscopic studies coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This mechanistic switch, akin to urea formation in amine-functionalized sorbents, has not been previously reported in a hydroxide-based material and sheds new light on the interplay between bicarbonate and carbonate species during CO2 capture. Our findings provide valuable insight for the design of next-generation materials containing oxygen-based nucleophiles for carbon capture applications.

Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic boron nitride-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. The rules predict the electric response properties more accurately than the magnetizabilities. The electric response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the field of atomistic materials simulation, both due to their remarkable accuracy and their computational efficiency compared to established ab initio methods. Very recently, several general purpose MLIPs have been reported, which are broadly applicable across the periodic table. These represent a fascinating opportunity for materials discovery, provided that they are robust and transferable. In order to stress test current general purpose MLIPs, we evaluate the performance of M3GNet and MACE models in element‐substitution based structure prediction workflows for a diverse range of inorganic, crystalline materials. Importantly, these results are compared with a full density functional based workflow, shifting the focus from merely evaluating single‐point energy and force predictions of MLIPs toward an end‐to‐end perspective. We find that general purpose MLIPs are in general well‐suited to accelerate computational materials discovery and structure prediction, but also display certain systematic biases. To address these, a simple metric to quantify MLIP reliability for materials discovery is introduced. As a by‐product, we also predict novel ground state structures for 15 out of 100 analyzed compositions.

In this work, we highlight the need for dynamic workflow managers in self‐driving laboratories (SDLs) and optimizers for Materials Acceleration Platforms (MAPs). While MAPs leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to accelerate materials discovery, static workflow managers limit scalability, and flexibility. We demonstrate the benefits of modular, adaptable orchestrators by integrating PerQueue, a dynamic workflow manager, into a color‐mixing robot, streamlining task coordination and AI‐driven optimization. Additionally, we assess various MAP‐relevant methodologies based on their maturity and readiness for integration. This assessment underlines the importance of flexible workflow managers in advancing SDLs and optimizers, paving the way for more effective future MAP implementations. Achieving seamless integration requires addressing challenges like ensuring data provenance, adhering to findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable principles, and adapting workflows to changing experimental conditions—key elements for the successful deployment of MAPs.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can enable simulations of ab initio accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. However, their effectiveness hinges on the availability of considerable data sets to ensure robust generalization across chemical space and thermodynamic conditions. The generation of such data sets can be labor-intensive, highlighting the need for innovative methods to train MLPs in data-scarce scenarios. Here, we introduce transfer learning of potential energy surfaces between chemically similar elements. Specifically, we leverage the trained MLP for silicon to initialize and expedite the training of an MLP for germanium. Utilizing classical force field and ab initio data sets, we demonstrate that transfer learning surpasses traditional training from scratch in force prediction, leading to more stable simulations and improved temperature transferability. These advantages become even more pronounced as the training data set size decreases. We also observe positive transfer learning effects for most out-of-target properties. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning across chemical elements is a promising technique for developing accurate and numerically stable MLPs, particularly in a data-scarce regime.
