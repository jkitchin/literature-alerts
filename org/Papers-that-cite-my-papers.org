Electrochemical hydrogenation, powered by renewable electricity, represents a promising sustainable approach for organic synthesis and the valorization of biomass-derived chemicals. Traditional strategies often rely on alkaline conditions to mitigate the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, posing challenges in sourcing hydrogen atoms for hydrogenation, which can be addressed through localized water dissociation on the electrode surface. In this study, we present a computationally guided design of electrochemical hydrogenation catalysts by optimizing hydrogen coverage density and binding strength on the electrode. Our theoretical investigations identify Cu, Au, and Ag - metals with moderate hydrogen coverage - as promising catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenations in alkaline media. These predictions are experimentally validated using a model organic substrate (acetophenone), achieving yields and faradaic efficiencies of up to 90%. Additionally, Cu, a nonprecious metal, is demonstrated to selectively hydrogenate a wide range of unsaturated compounds, including C═O, C═C, C≡C, and C≡N bonds, at low potentials with moderate to excellent conversion rates and chemoselectivities. This work highlights the potential of tailoring hydrogen coverage on electrode surfaces to rationally design nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for efficient organic hydrogenations. The insights gained here are expected to inform the development of more effective catalysts for organic hydrogenations and other industrially relevant chemical transformations.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has, in recent years, attracted great interest from scientists because of its prime role in a number of renewable energy technologies. It is one of the reactions that occurs during hydrogen production through water splitting, is used in rechargeable metal–air batteries, and plays a fundamental role in regenerative fuel cells. Therefore, there is an emerging need to develop new, active, stable, and cost-effective materials for OER. This review presents the latest research on various groups of materials, showing their potential to be used as OER electrocatalysts, as well as their shortcomings. Particular attention has been paid to metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives, as those materials offer coordinatively unsaturated sites, high density of transition metals, adjustable pore size, developed surface area, and the possibility to be modified and combined with other materials.

Abstract Pt nanoparticles dispersed on carbon supports (Pt/C) are the benchmark oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, their widespread application is hindered by severe stability degradation under high potentials and acidic environments, primarily due to carbon support corrosion. To address this challenge, a multiscale template‐assisted method is proposed, combined with ethylene glycol reduction, to fabricate Pt nanoparticles supported onto multiscale porous conductive antimony tin oxides (Pt/PT‐SSO). Both theoretical and experimental approaches have shown that the strong interaction between Pt and support markedly accelerates electron transfer and optimizes the adsorption strength of key intermediates on the Pt surface. Furthermore, the unique multiscale porous structure of support not only provides an ideal platform for the uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles but also greatly enhances confinement effect, effectively preventing Pt aggregation. As a result, the Pt/PT‐SSO exhibits superior ORR activity and durability compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Specifically, its mass activity at 0.9 V (vs RHE) reaches 0.617 A mgPt⁻¹, which is twice that of Pt/C, while maintaining outstanding stability over 50 h. Notably, PEMFCs utilizing Pt/PT‐SSO achieve a high power density of 1.173 W cm⁻ 2 and retain 94.9% after 30,000 cycles of accelerated durability testing.

This study presents a machine learning (ML)-augmented framework for accurately predicting excited-state properties critical to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. By integrating the computational efficiency of semi-empirical PPP+CIS theory with a Δ-ML approach, the model overcomes the inherent limitations of PPP+CIS in predicting key properties, including singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) energies, singlet–triplet gaps (ΔEST), and oscillator strength (f). The model demonstrated exceptional accuracy across datasets of varying sizes and diverse molecular features, notably excelling in predicting oscillator strength and ΔEST values, including negative regions relevant to TADF molecules with inverted S1–T1 gaps. This work highlights the synergy between physics-inspired models and machine learning in accelerating the design of efficient TADF emitters, providing a foundation for future studies on complex systems and advanced functional materials.

Abstract Molecular graphene provides an attractive man‐made artificial system to realize designer Dirac fermions with exotic properties and significant implications in electronics/spintronics, but its large‐scale fabrication remains a challenge as the available approach involves molecule‐by‐molecule manipulation of CO on a metal surface using a scanning tunneling microscopy tip. Here, we propose the epitaxial growth of molecular graphene on metal surface alloy, where CO molecules could be naturally self‐assembled into a hexagonal lattice. Via high‐throughput first‐principles calculations, the adsorption behaviors of CO on 30 surface alloys Cu 2 M (M represents the alloyed element) with a ()‐ R 30° superstructure on Cu(111) is explored. By systematically analyzing the structures, energetic and electronic properties of the adsorbed systems with different CO coverages, three surface alloys, Cu 2 Zn, Cu 2 Ga, and Cu 2 Ge, on which molecular graphene can be spontaneously formed, are successfully screened out. Remarkably, the self‐assembled molecular graphene is featured by an effective four‐band model involving the molecular (, ) orbitals of CO on a hexagonal lattice, leading to quantum spin Hall effect. This work paves an avenue for the large‐scale growth of artificial graphene, which should stimulate immediate interest among experimentalists in the synthesis, characterization, and implementation of topological states for dissipationless transport and quantum computing.

Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial data set creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.

We report the effects of reducing surface asperity size at the nanometer scale on metallic surfaces by plasma-assisted surface modification processes using simulations and experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted by irradiating various inert gas ions (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) onto a cobalt slab with nanoscale asperities on the surface. The MD simulations showed that as the atomic number of the inert gas increased the surface asperity size was reduced more efficiently, while the etching rate decreased. The dependencies of the scattering behaviors on the inert gas ions originated from the mass exchange between the working gas ions and the slab atoms. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray fluorescence measurements were performed on hard disk media subjected to the surface modification processes. These measurements experimentally demonstrated that the density of nanoscale asperities was reduced with a lower etching rate as the atomic number of the inert gas increased, consistent with the simulation results. Through this study, we clarified that heavier working gases were more effective in reducing surface asperity size without significantly reducing the thickness of the material, which can contribute to better control of surface morphologies at the nanometer scale.

Abstract Durable electrocatalysts and optimal ionomer distribution in cathode catalyst layer (CCL) are crucial for the efficiency and lifetime of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), especially at high currents. This work presents a 1D package‐integrated platinum (Pt) catalyst designed to optimize mass exchange and boost cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The package‐integrated Pt catalyst not only enhances the active site utilization, activity, and stability of Pt alloys but also optimizes the ionomer coverage and oxygen transport within the CCL. It shows superior performance with a mass activity of 1.33 A mg Pt −1 and only a 12 mV decay in half‐wave potential after 30 000 cycles. Additionally, it delivers impressive catalytic performance (320 mA cm −2 at 0.8 V), mass transport polarization (0.632 V at 2000 mA cm −2 ), and low oxygen transport resistance (0.03 s cm −1 ) in hydrogen‐air fuel cells. This package‐integrated catalyst with robust anti‐ionomer interference and impressive transport capability is of great significance for designing efficient and long‐lasting PEMFC cathodes.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have drawn public concern recently due to their toxic properties and persistence in the environment, making it urgent to eliminate PFAS from contaminated water. Electrochemical oxidation (EO) has shown great promise for the destructive treatment of PFAS with direct electron transfer and hydroxyl radical (⋅OH)-mediated indirect reactions. One of the most popular electrodes is Magnéli phase titanium suboxides. However, the degradation mechanisms of PFAS are still unsure and are under investigation now. The main methodology is the first-principal density functional theory (DFT) computation, which is recently used to explore the degradation mechanisms and interpret by-product formation during PFAS mineralization. From the literature review, the main applications of DFT computation for studying PFAS degradation mechanisms by EO include bond dissociation energy, absorption energy, activation energy, and overpotential η for oxygen evolution reactions. The main degradation mechanisms and pathways of PFAS in the EO process include mass transfer, direct electron transfer, decarboxylation, peroxyl radical generation, hydroxylation, intramolecular rearrangement, and hydrolysis. In the recent 4 years, 11 papers performed DFT computation to explore the possible PFAS degradation mechanisms and pathways in the EO process. This paper’s objectives are to: 1) summarize the main degradation mechanisms of PFAS degradation in EO; 2) review the application of DFT computation for studying PFAS degradation mechanisms during EO; process; 3) review the possible degradation pathways of perfluorooctane sulfonoic acid (PFOS) and per-fluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) during EO process.

This article introduces a suite of mini-applications (mini-apps) designed to optimise computational kernels in ab initio electronic structure codes. The suite is developed from flagship applications participating in the NOMAD Center of Excellence, such as the ELPA eigensolver library and the GW implementations of the exciting, Abinit, and FHI-aims codes. The mini-apps were identified by targeting functions that significantly contribute to the total execution time in the parent applications. This strategic selection allows for concentrated optimisation efforts. The suite is designed for easy deployment on various High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, supported by an integrated CMake build system for straightforward compilation and execution. The aim is to harness the capabilities of emerging (post)exascale systems, which necessitate concurrent hardware and software development — a concept known as co-design. The mini-app suite serves as a tool for profiling and benchmarking, providing insights that can guide both software optimisation and hardware design. Ultimately, these developments will enable more accurate and efficient simulations of novel materials, leveraging the full potential of exascale computing in material science research.

Abstract Low‐cost and durable hydrogen fuel cells are crucial for the success of the hydrogen economy. While Fe–N–C catalysts are amongst the most promising low‐cost alternative to platinum (Pt) for the oxygen reduction reaction, their unsatisfactory durability is the grand challenge faced by the field due to iron demetallation, carbon corrosion and electrode collapse. Herein, a dual‐metal single‐atom Fe–Mn–N–C catalyst with superior stability (49% loss in peak power density) than Fe–N–C catalysts (66% loss) over 96 h of continuous operations in H 2 –O 2 fuel cells is reported. Advanced operando electrochemical and post‐mortem physical measurements shed light on the underlying mechanism. The iron–manganese bond anchors the iron strongly in the Fe–Mn–N–C centre, which lowers the hydrogen peroxide yield as a result. Operando electrochemical measurements reveal a more stable triple‐phase boundary environment for the Fe–Mn–N–C catalyst than for Fe–N–C. Specifically, a combination of cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy with the distribution of relaxation times reveals that the iron demetallation and carbon corrosion are respectively 20% and 30% slower for the Fe–Mn–N–C catalyst than the Fe–N–C catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells. Altogether, this dual‐metal site strategy paves the way for improving the stability of Pt‐free catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells.

Within the context of green chemistry, the concept of green carbon science emphasizes carbon balance and recycling to address the challenge of achieving carbon neutrality. The fundamental processes in this field are oxidation and reduction, which often involve simple molecules such as CO2, CO, CH4, CHx, and H2O. Water plays a critical role in nearly all oxidation-reduction processes, and thus, it is a central focus of research in green carbon science. Water can act as a direct source of dihydrogen in reduction reactions or participate in oxidation reactions, frequently involving O-O coupling to produce hydrogen peroxide or dioxygen. At the atomic level, this coupling involves the statistically unfavorable proximity of two atoms, requiring optimization through a catalytic process influenced by two types of factors, as described by the authors. Extrinsic factors are related to geometrical and electronic criteria associated with the catalytic metal, involving its d-orbitals (or bands in the case of zerovalent metals and electrodes). Intrinsic factors are related to the coupling of oxygen atoms via their p-orbitals. At the mesoscopic or microscopic scale, the reaction medium typically consists of mixtures of lipophilic and hydrophilic phases with water, which may exist under supercritical conditions or as suspensions of microdroplets. These reactions predominantly occur at phase interfaces. A comprehensive understanding of the phenomena across these scales could facilitate improvements and even lead to the development of novel conversion processes.

Controlling the electron spin of oxygen-containing intermediates is crucial for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis toward clean energy technologies such as fuel cells and water electrolysis. Current strategies for controlling the electron spins rely mainly on tuning the chemical structure of the oxygen electrocatalyst, which is often hardly achieved for metal and oxide electrocatalysts. The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, a significant discovery in chiral spintronics, represents an alternative approach for tuning the spin selectivity of oxygen electrocatalysts. Here we demonstrate the use of intrinsic chiral nanoparticles as electron-spin filters to tune the selectivity in oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Chiral Au nanoparticles with a concave vortex cube structure were employed as the chiral substrate, exhibiting highly tunable optical chirality and intriguing CISS-like effect. As model systems, the catalytically active components such as Pt or Ni(OH)2 are overgrown onto chiral Au nanoparticles to construct the chiral hybrid electrocatalysts. Remarkably, both cases show chirality-dependent tunable activities over oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, respectively. The insights gained from this work not only shed light on the underlying mechanisms dictating the CISS-enhanced oxygen electrocatalysis by chiral nanoparticles but also provide an important knowledge framework that guides the rational design of chiral electrocatalysts toward oxygen electrocatalysis.

Chemical recycling of commodity and specialty polymers presents a multifaceted challenge for industrial societies. On one hand, macromolecular architectures must be engineered to yield durable products that, on the other hand, rapidly deconstruct to recyclable monomers under pre-determined conditions. Polymer deconstruction is a chemical process that requires deep understanding of molecular reactivity in heterogeneous media, where porous material architectures evolve in both space and time. To build this understanding, we develop herein experimental and analytical methods describing sets of diffusive eigenmodes that exist within time-varying, non-Euclidean boundary conditions, a situation commonly encountered in the reactive deconstruction of polymers where chain fragments splay, alter their local dynamics, and evolve in their confinement of reacting media. Diffusion power spectra, discerned experimentally by NMR, yield polymer and solvent frequency-domain velocity autocorrelation functions that are analyzed in the context of physical models for chemical reactions parameterized with fractal mathematics. The results connect local motion in polymers to chemical reactivity during acidolysis of circular elastomers.

Abstract Atop and multiple adsorbed hydrogen are considered as key intermediates on Pt‐group metal for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet the role of bridge hydrogen intermediate ( * H bridge ) is consistently overlooked experimentally. Herein, a Pt atomic chain modified fcc ‐Ru nanocrystal (Pt–Ru( fcc )) is developed with a co‐crystalline structure, featuring * H bridge intermediate bonded on the Pt–Ru pair site. Electrons leap from the pair site to * H bridge facilitate hydrogen desorption, thus accelerating the Tafel kinetics and ensuring outstanding electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (4.0 mV at 10 mA cm −2 ) and high turnover frequency (56.4 H 2 s −1 at 50 mV). Notably, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer PEMWE with ultra‐low loading of 10 ug Pt cm −2 shows excellent activity (1.61 V at 1.0 A cm −2 ) and low average degradation rate (4.0 µV h −1 over 1000 h), significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. Furthermore, the PEMWE‐based 80 µm Gore membrane under identical operating conditions requires only 1.54 and 1.58 V to achieve 1.0 and 1.5 A cm −2 . This finding highlights the key role of * H bridge at the Pt–Ru interface in obtaining high HER intrinsic activity and underscores the transformative potential in designing next‐generation bimetallic catalysts for clean hydrogen energy.

In alloy systems, the strain and ligand effects are prevalent, but it is challenging to study the impact of either on the material structure independently. We conducted high-energy-resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES)/resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy on a Pt3Mg alloy-based carbon material (Pt3Mg-N-C). By introducing a size-comparable atom, the strain effect is minimized, allowing the Pt d-density of states (d-DOS) to be primarily affected by the ligand effect. The experimental results reveal that Pt gains electrons in Pt3Mg-N-C, exhibiting a more symmetric d-band shape and a downshift of the d-band center compared to Pt metal, which is further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The correlation between the Pt d-DOS and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity is also discussed.

These geometries─generated via metadynamics and scored using DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS reference energies─exhibit substantially larger deviations in bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, and relative energies than other conformer benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse array of computational methods, including density-functional theory, composite quantum chemical methods, semiempirical models, neural network potentials, and force fields, on predicting relative energies for this challenging benchmark set. The results highlight multiple methods along the speed-accuracy Pareto frontier and identify AIMNet2 as particularly robust among the NNPs surveyed. We anticipate that Wiggle150 will be used to validate computational protocols involving nonequilibrium systems and guide the development of new density functionals and neural network potentials.

ABSTRACT LaTaON 2 is a promising visible‐light‐responsive photocatalyst for water splitting because of its broad visible light absorption and suitable band edge positions. However, the high defect concentration hinders the charge transfer and results in the poor photocatalytic performance of LaTaON 2 . Loading proper cocatalysts is one of the most efficient strategies for promoting charge separation/transfer and achieving high reaction activity. In this work, we have used density functional theory calculations to study the depositions of Pt, Ru, and Ni single atom cocatalysts on LaTaON 2 (010) surface. The most stable adsorption configuration is the same site for all the elements, namely the top of the N atom on the La‐terminated surface and the fourfold hollow site on the Ta‐terminated surface. The adsorption of the metal single atom on Ta‐termination is stronger than that on La‐termination due to the formation of more bonds. Upon the deposition, no localized impurity states appear in the middle of the forbidden gap since the n d states of metal adatoms are located within the valence band and conduction band of LaTaON 2 . The efficiency of the photocatalysts is probed by investigating their ability to adsorb the H atom in a thermodynamically favorable manner. Our results reveal that the energetically favorable sites of HER are the N atom on the La‐termination and the O and N atoms on the Ta‐termination, respectively. Compared with the clean surface, the surfaces with Pt, Ru, and Ni single adatoms exhibit higher performance for HER because loading metal cocatalysts can further activate the surface nonmetal atoms and reduce the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption. The work gives an atom‐level insight into the role of metal single atom cocatalysts in the LaTaON 2 photocatalyst for hydrogen production.

Developing ruthenium-based oxide catalysts capable of suppressing lattice oxygen participation in the catalytic reaction process is crucial for maintaining stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions. Herein, we delicately construct a RuO2 nanoparticle-anchored LiCoO2 nanosheet electrocatalyst (RuO2/LiCoO2), achieving dynamic optimization of RuO2 during the reaction process and improving catalytic stability. Benefiting from the unique electrochemical delithiation characteristics of the LiCoO2 support, the covalency of the Ru-O bond is effectively regulated during the OER process. The weakened Ru-O covalent bond inhibits the participation of lattice oxygen in the catalytic reaction and ensures the continuous operation of the Ru active sites. Moreover, the extended Ru-O bond in the optimized RuO2/LiCoO2 catalyst reduces the formation energy barrier of the *OOH intermediates, accelerating the progress of the OER. As a result, the RuO2/LiCoO2 catalyst requires only an overpotential of 150 ± 2 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and operates stably for 2000 h at 1 A cm-2 in a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. This work opens new avenues for designing efficient ruthenium-based catalysts.

ABSTRACT Effective CO2 sequestration requires not only minimizing carbon emissions but also optimizing storage efficiency while ensuring the integrity of storage sites. This research focuses on the assessment of CO2 injection in a stack storage system, specifically targeting the Entrada (high-permeability) and Bluff (low-permeability) formations within the San Juan Basin. By leveraging a single well to inject CO2 across multiple formations, the goal is to enhance storage efficiency, reduce the spatial extent of CO2 plumes, and minimize the area requiring long-term monitoring. A high-resolution hydrodynamic reservoir model was developed and validated using historical injection rates and pressure data from nearby saltwater disposal wells. This model was used to simulate 30 years of CO2 injection, aiming to store 50MtCO2f through a stacked storage configuration. Three well-completion strategies were explored: (1) a base case with injection into Entrada only, (2) a case with commingled injection into both formations through a single well, and (3) 6 scenarios using smart well-completion techniques to simultaneously inject CO2 into the Entrada and Bluff formations at controlled rates. Different injection rates were tested to identify the best scenario that minimizes CO2 plume size while meeting the storage target. Simulation results from the base case of injecting into Entrada only revealed that at an injection rate of 80MMSCFD, 50MtCO2 can be injected over 30 years. The commingled injection case showed that over 90% of injected CO2 entered the Entrada formation, leading to larger plume size (64.69 square miles after 100 years of post-injection monitoring) and an expanded area requiring monitoring. In contrast, the optimized injection strategy, with CO2 allocated at varying rates (25%, 31%, and 34% of the total injection rate of 80MMSCD) to the Bluff formation, resulted in the best scenario case significantly reducing the Entrada plume spatial extent by 22% while increasing the plume size in the Bluff formation by approximately 94%, accompanied by a 77% increment in the storage capacity. Ultimately, the best scenario reduced the total area requiring monitoring, demonstrating the effectiveness of a stack storage approach in controlling CO2 migration and pressure fronts. This study highlights the importance of optimizing CO2 in stacked storage systems to maximize sequestration efficiency. By carefully managing injection rates, the spread of CO2 plumes can be controlled, reducing monitoring costs and ensuring safe, long-term storage. The findings provide valuable insights for improving the practical implementation of CO2 capture and storage projects using stack storage systems.

Under mild conditions, the effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into formic acid (HCOOH) and carbon monoxide (CO) represents a promising avenue for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and addressing energy crises. In this work, we analyzed the electro-catalytic activities of six metals (Ti, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cr) anchored on monolayer molybdenum telluride (TM@MoTe2) for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) from CO2 to HCOOH and CO. Compared to the reversible hydrogen electrode, the limiting potential for HCOOH production on Ni@MoTe2 is only about −0.38 V, and it is only about −0.20 V for the CO production on Cu@MoTe2. The limiting potential is concerned with the free energies of *OCHO and *COOH. Both the CO2RRs suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and exhibit good selectivity for the desired reaction products. These features enable the efficient conversion of CO2 into HCOOH on Ni@MoTe2 or CO on Cu@MoTe2. Our calculations could provide valuable insights for the design and synthesis of high-performance catalysts based on MoTe2.

The scarcity of iridium (Ir) limits its widespread use in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, mesoporous single-crystalline spinel Co3O4 with atomically dispersed low-valence-state Ir has been developed to enable Ir's efficient and stable utilization. The surface Pourbaix diagram suggests that under acidic OER conditions, O* fully covers both Co3O4(111) and (110) surfaces, passivating Co sites but enhancing Co3O4's structural stability, a benefit further improved by Ir doping. Mesopores offer numerous loading sites for Ir single atoms (13.8 wt %), which activate the originally O*-passivated Co3O4(111) surface by creating high-intrinsic-activity Co-Ir bridge sites; meanwhile, Ir and Co leaching rates are reduced to about 1/4 and 1/5, respectively, compared to conventional Ir/Co3O4 catalysts. Our catalyst exhibits a low η10 of 248 mV for over 100 h, showcasing its potential in water electrolysis.
