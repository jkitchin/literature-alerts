CO2 photoreduction into valuable hydrocarbons, such as CO, CH4, and C2H4, delivers a promising approach to address both environmental and energy challenges. Transition metal chalcogenides, particularly cadmium sulfide (CdS), have emerged as prominent candidates due to their tunable electronic properties and availability. This study delves into a comprehensive investigation of how CdS crystalline facets and sulfur-deficient surfaces modulate the product selectivity. Through employing density functional theory (DFT), we unravel the catalytic performance of various CdS crystal orientations and sulfur vacancy configurations. The results have shown that different CdS facets exhibit unique electronic characteristics and surface energetics, which influence the adsorption dynamics and reaction pathways. The introduction of sulfur vacancies further modulates the nature of active sites, leading to substantial shifts in product selectivity. A detailed investigation on the reaction mechanisms unveils that specific facets preferentially facilitate the formation of CO, while others are more conducive to the generation of hydrocarbons such as CH4 and C2H4, due to the variations in activation barriers and intermediate stabilities. These findings underscore the importance of crystal facet engineering and defect manipulation in tailoring catalyst performance thus providing valuable insights for the rational design of efficient and selective CO2 reduction metal catalysts.

Exploring high-performance and low-platinum-based electrocatalysts to accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the air cathode of zinc-air batteries remains crucial. Herein, by combining electroless deposition and carbothermal reduction, a nitrogen-doped carbon-supported highly dispersed PtSn alloy nanocatalyst (PtSn/NC) was prepared for a high-efficiency ORR process. Electrochemical measurements show that PtSn/NC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.850 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.815 V). The PtSn/NC-based (20 μg

The current state-of-the-art electron-transfer modeling primarily focuses on the kinetics of charge transfer between an electroactive species and an inert electrode. Experimental studies have revealed that the existing Butler-Volmer model fails to satisfactorily replicate experimental voltammetry results for both solution-based and surface-bound redox couples. Consequently, experimentalists lack an accurate tool for predicting electron-transfer kinetics. In response to this challenge, we developed a density functional theory-based approach for accurately predicting current peak potentials by using the Marcus-Hush model. Through extensive cyclic voltammetry simulations, we conducted a thorough exploration that offers valuable insights for conducting well-informed studies in the field of electrochemistry.

Abstract Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising technology for green hydrogen production. However, severe charge recombination in the photoelectrode materials is one of the key obstacles to achieving high performance. Herein, a BiVO₄ photoanode with lattice strain (Str‐BVO) is constructed by generating Bi vacancies to promote charge separation in the bulk. The optimized Str‐BVO photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 6.20 mA cm⁻ 2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, with an impressive charge separation efficiency close to 100%. Systematical experiments and density functional theory reveal that the surface Bi vacancies induced strain causes the distortion of a small number of VO 4 tetrahedra, which increases the antibonding state energy of most normal VO 4 tetrahedra and creates more electronic vacancy states, thereby significantly promoting electron–hole separation. By surface loading with a FeNiO x co‐catalyst, the photoanode exhibits excellent PEC water‐splitting performance and stability.

In this work, we explore the electronic properties and chemical bonding in the recently discovered mineral zaykovite, the first natural rhodium selenide Rh3Se4. We comprehensively studied the bulk electronic structure, hybridization of rhodium and selenium orbitals, and the influence of spin–orbit interaction on the electronic spectrum, as well as inspected its topological properties. In addition, we investigated the surface electronic structure of zaykovite and revealed the anisotropic Rashba-type spin splitting in the surface states. In addition, using calculations of the phonon spectra and enthalpy of formation, we predicted the family of similar selenides based on other 4d and 5d transition metals such as Ir, Pd, and Pt. The structural and electronic properties of these materials are discussed.

Abstract Developing high‐efficiency alkaline water splitting technology holds great promise in potentially revolutionizing the traditional petrochemical industry to a more sustainable hydrogen economy. Importantly, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accompanied at the anode is considered as a critical bottleneck in terms of both complicated mechanism and sluggish kinetics, requiring rational design of OER electrocatalysts to elucidate the structure‐performance relationship and reduce the applied overpotential. As a benchmarked non‐precious metal candidate, NiFe‐based electrocatalysts have gained enormous attention due to low‐cost, earth‐abundance, and remarkable intrinsic OER activity, which are expected to be implemented in industrial alkaline water splitting. In this contribution, a comprehensive overview of NiFe‐based OER electrocatalysts is provided, starting with fundamental mechanisms, evaluation metrics, and synthetic protocols. Subsequently, basic principles with corresponding regulatory strategies are summarized following the sequence of substrate‐catalyst‐electrolyte design of efficient and robust NiFe‐based electrocatalysts toward industrial‐scale deployment. Perspectives on remaining challenges and instructive opportunities in this booming field are finally discussed.

Pt-based nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used in catalysis. However, this suffers from aggregation and/or sintering at working conditions. We demonstrate a robust strategy for stabilizing PtCo NPs under high temperature with strong interaction between M–N–C and PtCo NPs with Pt–M–N coordination, namely, “atom glue.” Such atom glue for stabilizing Pt-based NPs can be extended to Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, and Cu, being a versatile strategy for stabilizing PtCo NPs, which substantially promotes the performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and fuel cell. Impressively, the mass activity (MA) reaches 2.99 A mg Pt −1 for ORR over g -Zn–N–C/PtCo, and 79.3% of the initial MA is maintained after 90K cycles in fuel cell. This work provides a versatile strategy for stabilizing Pt-based NPs via atom glue, which is likely to spark widespread interest across various fields.

Catalytic activity of metal particles is reported to originate from the appearance of nonmetallic states, but conductive metallic particles, as an electron reservoir, should render electron delivery between reactants more favorably so as to have higher activity. We present that metallic rhodium particle catalysts are highly active in the low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide, whereas nonmetallic rhodium clusters or monoatoms on alumina remain catalytically inert. Experimental and theoretical results evidence the presence of electronic communications in between vertex atom active sites of individual metallic particles in the reaction. The electronic communications dramatically lower apparent activation energies via coupling two electrochemical-like half-reactions occurring on different active sites, which enable the metallic particles to show turnover frequencies at least four orders of magnitude higher than the nonmetallic clusters or monoatoms. Similar results are found for other metallic particle catalysts, implying the importance of electronic communications between active sites in heterogeneous catalysis.

The energetically most favorable chemical ordering of bimetallic nanoparticles can be characterized by combining global optimization algorithms and surrogate energy models. The latter approximate the energy of nanoalloys relying on structural descriptors, training models, and data. Here, we systematically evaluate the performance of highly data-efficient topological descriptors [Kozlov et al., Chem. Sci. 6, 3868 (2015)] for predicting the energies of metal nanoalloys with different chemical orderings. We also introduce a new descriptor based on atomic coordination types, which results in a less data-efficient and interpretable approach, but improves the general accuracy and the quantification of orderings in the inner parts of nanoparticles. The capacity of both the original and new approaches in combination with a basin hopping algorithm is illustrated by generating convex hulls of PdZn nanoalloys and predicting the resulting active surface site distribution as a function of particle composition. Finally, we show how these approaches can be combined with machine-learning adsorption models in electrocatalysis studies for a fast evaluation of the reactivity landscape of targeted nanoalloys.

Abstract Rapid bulk charge recombination and mediocre surface catalytic sites harshly restrict the photocatalytic activities. Herein, the aforementioned concerns are well addressed by coupling macroscopic spontaneous polarization and atomic‐site engineering of CdS single‐crystal nanorods for superb H 2 photo‐production. The oriented growth of CdS nanorods along the polar axis, vectorially superimposing substantial polar units with orderly arrangement, renders a strong polarization electric field (20.1 times enhancement), which boosts bulk charge separation with an efficiency up to 72.4% (80.4‐fold). Remarkably, polarization electric field alters the chemical state of Pt single sites by orderly reducing the binding energy of Pt atom with stepwise polarization enhancement of CdS substrate, which increases the onsite electron density of Pt from 10.232 to 10.261e − and *H key intermediates, providing preponderant Volmer‐Tafel/Volmer‐Heyrovsky reaction pathways with significantly decreased energy barriers for H 2 production. Thus, highly polarized CdS nanorods with atomically dispersed Pt sites perform an outstanding H 2 space‐time yield of 118.5 mmol g −1 h −1 and apparent quantum efficiency of 57.7% at λ = 420 nm, and a record‐high H 2 turnover frequency of 57798.4 h −1 , being one of the best catalysts for photocatalytic H 2 evolution. This work highlights the function of polarization in manipulating charge separation and catalytic reaction.

Elevated levels of total hardness in drinking water can readily result in scaling, which poses a threat to both the safety of water quality and the convenience of its use. While there is a wealth of research on the removal of calcium hardness, there is a dearth of studies focusing on the removal of magnesium hardness. In light of this, the present study employs modified induced crystallization softening (MICS) to delineate the removal pathways and mechanisms of magnesium hardness, and to investigate viable methods for its enhancement and application. Our research has determined that magnesium hardness can be effectively removed from water through the MICS, with the dosage of softening agents (NaOH) being a significant factor that influences this removal, whereas the fixed bed height within the fluidized bed exerts minimal impact on the process. In the low-dose stage (less than 250 mg/L), when the pH is below 10.0, up to 20% of magnesium hardness can be removed, predominantly through the crystallization of (Ca

Abstract Green hydrogen energy, as one of the most promising energy carriers, plays a crucial role in addressing energy and environmental issues. Oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, as the key to water electrolysis hydrogen production technology, have been subject to durability constraints, preventing large‐scale commercial development. Under the high current density and harsh acid‐base electrolyte conditions of the water electrolysis reaction, the active metals in the catalysts are easily converted into high‐valent soluble species to dissolve, leading to poor structural durability of the catalysts. There is an urgent need to overcome the durability challenges under acidic conditions and develop electrocatalysts with both high catalytic activity and high durability. In this review, the latest research results are analyzed in depth from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. First, a comprehensive summary of the structural deactivation state process of noble metal oxide catalysts is presented. Second, the evolution of the structure of catalysts possessing high durability is discussed. Finally, four new strategies for the preparation of stable catalysts, “electron buffer (ECB) strategy”, combination strength control, strain control, and surface coating, are summarized. The challenges and prospects are also elaborated for the future synthesis of more effective Ru/Ir‐based catalysts and boost their future application.

Abstract Enhancement of an alkaline water splitting reaction in Pt‐based single‐atom catalysts (SACs) relies on effective metal‐support interactions. A Pt single atom (Pt SA )‐immobilized three‐phased Pt SA @VP‐Ni 3 P‐MoP heterostructure on nickel foam is presented, demonstrating high catalytic performance. The existence of Pt SA on triphasic metal phosphides gives an outstanding performance toward overall water splitting. The Pt SA @VP‐Ni 3 P‐MoP performs a low overpotential of 28 and 261 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 and 25 mA cm −2 , respectively. The Pt SA @VP‐Ni 3 P‐MoP (+,−) alkaline electrolyzer achieves a minimum cell voltage of 1.48 V at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 for overall water splitting. Additionally, the electrocatalyst exhibits a substantial Faradaic yield of ≈98.12% for H 2 and 98.47% for O 2 at a current density of 50 mA cm −2 . Consequently, this study establishes a connection for understanding the active role of single metal atoms in substrate configuration for catalytic performance. It also facilitates the successful synthesis of SACs, with a substantial loading on transition metal phosphides and maximal atomic utilization, providing more active sites and, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic activity.

Abstract Efficient, stable, and low‐cost oxygen reduction catalysts are the key to the large‐scale application of metal–air batteries. Herein, high‐dispersive Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (NPs) with abundant oxygen vacancies uniformly are anchored on lignin‐derived metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) hierarchical porous nanosheets as efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts (Fe 2 O 3 /M–N–C, M═Cu, Mn, W, Mo) based on a general and economical KCl molten salt‐assisted method. The combination of Fe with the highly electronegative O induces charge redistribution through the Fe–O–M structure, thereby reducing the adsorption energy of oxygen‐containing substances. The coupling effect of Fe 2 O 3 NPs with M–N–C expedites the catalytic activity toward ORR by promoting proton generation on Fe 2 O 3 and transfer to M–N–C. Experimental and theoretical calculation further revealed the remarkable electronic structure evolution of the metal site during the ORR process, where the emission density and local magnetic moment of the metal atoms change continuously throughout their reaction. The unique layered porous structure and highly active M–N 4 sites resulted in the excellent ORR activity of Fe 2 O 3 /Cu–N–C with the onset potential of 0.977 V, which is superior to Pt/C. This study offers a feasible strategy for the preparation of non‐noble metal catalysts and provides a new comprehension of the catalytic mechanism of M–N–C catalysts.

With the depletion of traditional energy sources and growing environmental concerns, it is becoming increasingly urgent to develop green, low-emission renewable energy technologies to replace fossil fuel-driven methods that emit carbon dioxide (CO2). Currently, the electrochemical production of high-value-added chemicals and fuels from CO2 has aroused great interest from scientists. However, to make full use of CO2 for the preparation of chemicals, it is necessary to expand the range of electrosynthesis methods, in particular by expanding reaction pathways through the reaction of CO2 with different substrates. In general, CO2 can form new covalent bonds with substrate molecules through the formation of C−X bonds, including C−H, C−C, C−N, C−O, and C−S bonds, which would expand the range of possible products by diversifying the reaction pathway. In this review, we focus on the research progress in electrochemical conversion of CO2 through C−X bond formation. We start by examining fundamentals of the reactions and summarizing the reaction modes. Next, we discuss the electrosynthesis of C−X bonds (C−H, C−C, C−N, C−O, C−S) using CO2 and different substrate molecules. Finally, (i) strategies for the design and activity optimization of catalyst materials and (ii) the future development of forming five types of bonds from CO2 and small molecules are discussed, along with an outlook on their future research prospects.

Bringing molecules together on a catalytic surface is a prerequisite for bimolecular and recombination reactions. However, in the absence of attractive interactions between reactants, such as hydrogen bonds, this poses a challenge. In contrast, based on density functional theory, we show that coadsorption at active sites of single-atom alloys (SAAs) is favored and that coadsorption is a general phenomenon observed for catalytically relevant adsorbates on a broad range of SAAs under temperature and pressure conditions commonly employed for catalysis. Dopants located in both terrace sites and in step edge defects exhibit a preference for coadsorption, displaying similar periodic trends. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the reactivity of a model reaction on both a pure metal and an SAA and show that the preference for coadsorption significantly alters the overall reaction energy profile, even when the barriers for the rate-determining elementary step are identical. In our models, the coadsorption preference enhances the catalytic activity of the SAA surface by several orders of magnitude compared to the pure metal. We also report infrared (IR) spectroscopic signatures of coadsorption, which facilitate experimental detection. Analysis reveals that in these systems repulsive lateral interactions between nearby molecules are more than compensated for by the enhanced binding at dopant sites. Among the broad range of systems considered, SAAs containing early transition metals (TMs) exhibit the strongest coadsorption preference, which can be rationalized by assuming the existence of an optimal number of electrons involved in binding. The strong coadsorption preference, together with facile product desorption from early TMs, renders these systems attractive candidates for catalysis. Moreover, these SAAs could open new routes for reduction reactions because coadsorption with hydrogen is favored.
