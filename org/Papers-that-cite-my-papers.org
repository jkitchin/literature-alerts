Advancing the discovery of novel materials for electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) while rationalizing and quantifying selectivity trends has been an ambitious objective. A recently introduced selectivity descriptor, ΔΔG, published in Chem Catal. 2023, 3(3), 100568, utilizes thermodynamic analysis of adsorption free energies of key ORR intermediates (ΔG OOH* and ΔG O*) along with the free energy of H2O2 to quantify selectivity and establish trends. This model has been successfully applied to a large database of binary alloys, demonstrating strong potential for predicting selective materials Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202404677. In this study, we systematically explore a diverse range of active sites in carbon-based structures, boron nitrides, and single atom catalysts, emerging classes of materials for 2e-ORR. We assess the effectiveness of ΔΔG in capturing selectivity trends and distinguishing sites that are both catalytically active and highly selective. Our findings highlight that not all active sites in carbon-based materials reported with high activity inherently exhibit high selectivity, with only a small fraction meeting both criteria. This work highlights the importance of ΔΔG as a predictive tool, providing valuable insights for designing selective and active two-dimensional materials.

Abstract The development of efficient single‐atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) has garnered significant attention within the scientific community. However, the extensive scope of material experimentation, coupled with high research and development costs and prolonged research cycles, severely hampers the efficient advancement of related materials. In this study, the HER activity of 90 types of SACs is systematically investigated, which consist of single transition metal (TM) and/or nonmetal (NM) atoms bonded in graphyne (TM‐NM‐GY), by synergizing machine learning algorithms with high‐throughput DFT computations. The findings reveal that the HER catalytic activity of Fe‐GY, Fe‐B‐GY, Ni‐B‐GY, Pd‐B‐GY, Sc‐N‐GY, Co‐N‐GY, Y‐N‐GY, and Pd‐N‐GY surpasses that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, non‐metallic B or N atom doping can effectively modulate the HER performance of SACs. Furthermore, it is confirmed that HER activity correlates with characteristic factors such as the bond length of the coordinating atoms, d‐band center, metal binding height, charge transfer, and ICOHP. Finally, machine learning stacking models have proven efficient in predicting and designing superior HER SACs. It is anticipated that these insights will accelerate the prediction and design of corresponding SACs.

Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) deliver near ab initio accuracy in energy and force calculations at a low computational cost, making them invaluable for materials modeling. Although uMLIPs are pretrained on vast ab initio data sets, rigorous validation remains essential for their ongoing adoption. In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet with compound-specific ab initio (density functional theory (DFT)) data mitigates the systematic softening (i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves the alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra. While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using ∼100 structures is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for determining optimal fine-tuning data set sizes.

We report a colloidal synthesis strategy for producing MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 nanoheterostructures under mild conditions, i.e., low temperature and ambient pressure. The role of carboxylic acid ligands in directing the synthesis is systematically explored, revealing that lower ligand concentrations along with low-molecular weight molecules favor the formation of well-defined MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 heterostructures. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the resulting nanocomposites exhibit significantly enhanced electrochemical surface area and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity compared to their single-component counterparts. Specifically, MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 achieves a low overpotential of 299 mV at 10 mA cm–2, a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec–1, and a low charge transfer resistance of 9 Ω. The improved OER performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, which facilitate *OOH intermediate formation, and the MnO2 component, known for its intrinsic catalytic activity. Additionally, Mn3O4 serves as a stabilizing phase and precursor to MnO2, contributing to the overall durability and structural integrity of the catalyst.

Abstract Developing efficient oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for the progress of future energy conversion and storage systems. Herein, a fully conjugated ladder organic framework is designed with densely populated cobalt sites (HATN‐BiSalphen@KB). The molecular characteristics of the catalytic sites provide a trustworthy model for investigating the oxygen catalysis mechanism. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy demonstrate that the electronic interaction of the Co 2 N 4 O 2 and CoN 2 Cl 2 sites shifts the d ‐band center of Co atoms, optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption/desorption energetics and boosting bifunctional catalytic performance. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits exceptional bifunctional activity, achieving a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half‐wave potential of 0.983 V alongside a low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm −2 . In addition, the assembled rechargeable zinc‐air batteries demonstrate a high peak power density of 254.1 mW cm −2 and outstanding charge–discharge cycling stability for 450 h. This work provides valuable insights into designing advanced bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts through atomic‐level modulation of the coordination environment.

Abstract The limited choice of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers hinders their large-scale commercialization. Cobalt-based catalysts are promising candidates and usually undergo surface reconstruction into CoOOH-like structures. However, the directly synthesized CoOOH has not yet been investigated in acidic environments. Here, we show that the CoOOH is active across the whole pH range, while its redox features are pH dependent. Operando hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations show a pH-induced change in Co oxidation onset, but no change in the coverage of redox-active Co species before the oxygen evolution reaction. The pH-dependent catalytic performance is connected to the interfacial Co oxidative transformations under electrocatalytic conditions. By combining the kinetic isotope effect and the apparent activation energy with theoretical verification, we offer the mechanistic discussion of the possible reaction pathway for CoOOH. In addition, CoOOH demonstrates a stable cell potential of 100 mA cm −2 for 400 h in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. These results shed light on both the fundamental electrochemical properties of CoOOH and its potential for practical device applications.

The reproducibility of the rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests has been decisively limited by environmental and process variability in conventional manual sample preparation. To address this challenge, we present autoRDE-film, an automated platform that integrates force-controlled robotic polishing and process-controlled drop-coating to facilitate highly consistent RDE sample preparation. This mechanism reduces the standard deviation of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limiting current from 0.7 mA cm–2 (traditional scheme) to 0.07 mA cm–2 and the standard deviation of the ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) from 0.038 to 0.004 V, ensuring exceptional batch-to-batch consistency. With the help of 480 RDE sample datasets generated by autoRDE-film, we have developed a ResNet-18-based deep learning model that correlates the film morphology with their electrochemical performance, enabling rapid quality classification with an accuracy of 96.3%. The combined workflow achieves a success rate of 90% for uniform coatings in batch preparations, far surpassing those of traditional approaches. By quantitatively controlling all preparation parameters, autoRDE-film establishes a universal and high-efficiency framework for evaluating ORR catalysts, which can be extended to the evaluation of fuel cell and water electrolysis catalysts and offers a transformative tool for AI-aided electrocatalyst optimization.

Abstract Machine-learned potentials have become widely adopted alternatives to traditional electronic structure and molecular mechanics methods. However, despite excelling on fixed test sets, machine-learned potentials remain prone to instability when deployed in molecular dynamics simulations, particularly at elevated temperatures. Here we present the first physics-informed Gaussian process (GP)-based atomic energy models that achieve practically unlimited stability in NVT simulations at temperatures as high as 1000 K. Our findings highlight the importance of the GP prior mean function and demonstrate the models' ability to predict restoring forces that preserve the system’s physical integrity. The quantum chemical topology information embedded in these models acts as an inductive bias to mitigate arbitrary fluctuations in the predicted atomic energies. Finally, the models' robustness is evidenced by 50 successful simulations of four flexible organic molecules (peptide-capped glycine and serine, malondialdehyde and aspirin) yielding a cumulative simulation time of 0.5 microsecond completed within two CPU days.

Electrochemical processes are of particular interest in modern chemical technologies as they have numerous advantages over classical approaches. While computational support for investigating thermochemical reaction mechanisms is well established, there is still no consistent methodology for modeling electrochemical processes beyond the computational hydrogen electrode. This work addresses this gap through the study of the Shono‐type oxidation of N ‐formylpyrrolidine. Combining density functional theory calculations, the concept of computational Fc + /Fc electrode, Marcus–Hush approach, and Butler–Volmer model, the reaction mechanism is elucidated, including the identification of the role and position of proton‐coupled electron transfer process. Additionally, simulated cyclic voltammograms are in excellent agreement with experimental studies performed in parallel.

Computational electrochemistry is hard─anybody who has ever tried will know. We argue that the reasons for its complexity lie not only in the multiscale nature of electrochemical processes but also in the rapid, ongoing method development in the field. This has resulted in a lack of clear guidelines and many open discussions in the community. These issues were also the topic of a recent Lorentz Center workshop, the key take-away messages of which are highlighted in this Perspective. In particular, we discuss why the choice between constant potential and constant charge simulations is less trivial than it may seem, why interpreting electrochemical reaction free energy diagrams can be challenging, why the Poisson–Nernst–Planck equation is not all there is, and why we desperately need more benchmarking in the field.

The Pt/TiO2 interface has shown promise as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). However, understanding hydrogen and water splitting reactions on the Pt surface of the Pt/TiO2 interface remains a significant challenge. The Pt3/TiO2(h k l) interface was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rietveld refinement analysis, which revealed reflections attributed to Pt(1 1 1) and anatase TiO2(h k l). Theoretical modeling of the Pt3/TiO2(h k l) interface consists of approximately 60% TiO2 and 40% Pt, as determined by Rietveld refinement. The electronic properties were obtained using density functional theory (DFT)/plane-wave calculations on a model consisting of 39 atoms. The band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) of Pt3/TiO2(h k l) showed a new state between the valence and conduction bands, with contributions from the Pt 5d state, indicating metallic behavior. The initial steps of hydrogen and water splitting, as well as the transition states, were determined using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method for the reactions H2→Hads*+Hads* and H2Oads→OHads*+Hads* on the Pt3 surface of the Pt3/TiO2(h k l) interface. The Pt3/TiO2(1 0 1) interface exhibited the lowest activation energy (0.19 eV) for hydrogen molecule splitting, an exothermic reaction. Both Pt3/TiO2(h k l) interfaces exhibited an activation energy of approximately 1.4 eV for water splitting, an endothermic reaction. Therefore, hydrogen molecule splitting on the Pt3 surface is favorable, whereas water splitting is not, which may limit the hydrogen production rate (HGR) compared to other catalysts.

Abstract Controlling material functionalities via external stimuli is a cornerstone of modern science and technology. One effective strategy involves tuning mechanical strain, which can be induced through lattice mismatch, electric fields, or applied mechanical force. Recent advances in fabricating freestanding single‐crystalline complex oxide membranes have opened new opportunities for integrating these materials onto previously incompatible platforms such as metals and flexible polymers for next‐generation device applications. A key step in strain engineering is understanding and controlling the integration of such materials with flexible substrates. In this study, the integration and adhesion of freestanding single‐crystalline La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSMO(001)) membranes onto metallic surfaces (Au, Pt, and TiN) coated on flexible polymer substrates is demonstrated. It is found that the choice of metal underlayer significantly influences the ability to strain the membrane. Using TiN‐coated polymer support, a uniform strain of ≈1% in LSMO membranes, along with strong adhesion between the membrane and substrate, is achieved. Theoretical calculations reveal that strong Ti─O bonding and compact in‐plane lattice matching at the LSMO(001)/TiN(111) interface lower the interface formation energy compared to noble metals. These findings offer valuable insights for selecting suitable platforms to apply external mechanical stress to freestanding oxide membranes, facilitating their integration into flexible electronic systems.

Improving the catalytic performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water splitting in acidic media is crucial for the production of clean and renewable hydrogen energy. Herein, we study the OER electrocatalytic properties of various active sites on four exposed (110) and (1¯10) surfaces of Sn-doped RuO2 (Sn/RuO2) with antiferromagnetic arrangements in acidic environments. The Sn/RuO2 bulk structure with the Cm space group exhibits favorable thermodynamic stability. The coordinatively unsaturated metal (Mcus) sites distributed on the right branch of the volcano plot are generally more active than the bridge-bonded lattice oxygen (Obr) sites located on the left. Different from the conventional knowledge that the most active site is located in the nearest neighbor of the doped atom, it has a lower OER overpotential when the active site is 3.6 Å away from the doped Sn atom. Among the sites studied, the 46-Rucus site exhibits the optimal OER catalytic performance. The inherent factors affecting the OER activity of each site on the Sn/RuO2 surface are further analyzed, including the center of the d/p band at the active sites, the average electrostatic potential of the ions, and the number of transferred electrons. This work provides a reminder for the selection of active sites used to evaluate catalytic performance, which will benefit the development of efficient OER electrocatalysts.

Abstract We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of ab initio electronic structure theory—namely a concentration wave analysis—and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys’ electronic structure, with hybridisation between the sp states of Al and the d states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys’ smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.

The growing need for rapid screening of adsorption energies in organic materials has driven substantial progress in developing various architectures of equivariant graph neural networks (eGNNs). This advancement has largely been enabled by the availability of extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT)-generated datasets, sufficiently large to train complex eGNN models effectively. However, certain material groups with significant industrial relevance, such as aromatic compounds, remain underrepresented in these large datasets. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between limited, domain-specific DFT datasets and large-scale pretrained eGNNs. Our methodology involves creating a specialized dataset by segregating aromatic compounds after a targeted ensemble extraction process, then fine-tuning a pretrained model via approaches that include full retraining and systematically freezing specific network sections. We demonstrate that these approaches can yield accurate energy and force predictions with minimal domain-specific training data and computation. Additionally, we investigate the effects of augmenting training datasets with chemically related but out-of-domain groups. Our findings indicate that incorporating supplementary data that closely resembles the target domain, even if approximate, would enhance model performance on domain-specific tasks. Furthermore, we systematically freeze different sections of the pretrained models to elucidate the role each component plays during adaptation to new domains, revealing that relearning low-level representations is critical for effective domain transfer. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights and practical guidelines for efficiently adapting deep learning models for accurate adsorption energy predictions, significantly reducing reliance on extensive training datasets.

ABSTRACT We introduce a machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach to calculate the anharmonic infrared (IR) absorption spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), key carriers of interstellar aromatic IR bands. This method accounts for temperature effects in a molecule-specific way and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional quantum chemical calculations at a fraction of the cost, scaling linearly with system size. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Data base with up to 216 carbon atoms at different temperatures, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems. Our results highlight MLMD’s potential to enable the development of extensive molecular spectral data sets, enhancing data-driven analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly in anticipation of upcoming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope.

Abstract Elemental doping is an effective strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 by modifying its electronic structure through the introduction of impurity states near the valence or conduction bands. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) to investigate the effects of vanadium (V) and rhenium (Re) mono-doping and co-doping on the structural, electronic, and optical properties of rutile TiO 2 . Structural optimizations reveal slight reductions in lattice constants and bond lengths in doped systems, attributed to the marginal ionic radius differences between the dopants and Ti 4+ ions. Formation energy analysis indicated that V–Re co-doping is energetically more favorable than mono-doping, suggesting high structural stability. Electronic structure analysis indicates a significant bandgap narrowing in V-doped (2.62 eV) and V–Re co-doped TiO 2 (2.75 eV), suggesting enhanced absorption in the visible region and improved photocatalytic activity. In contrast, Re mono-doping slightly increases the bandgap to 3.10 eV, limiting its activity to the UV region. Optical properties, including the dielectric function and absorption spectra, further confirm a redshift in V and V–Re doped systems, while Re doping results in a blueshift. Band edge alignment with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) shows that all doped systems satisfy the thermodynamic criteria for water splitting, with V–Re co-doping exhibiting the most favorable band positions for hydrogen evolution. Finally, this work demonstrates that co-doping with V and Re is a promising strategy to engineer TiO 2 with improved visible-light photocatalytic performance, offering valuable insights for the design and synthesis of efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production.

The high-rate electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to afford multicarbon products (C2) holds transformative potential for advancing sustainable energy systems. Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as dynamic modulators to promote the C2 pathway, yet the underlying atomistic mechanisms of ILs in modulating this CO2RR process remain fundamentally unclear. Here, by integrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental validations, we systematically elucidate the critical influence of 1-(3-aminopropyl)-3-methylimidazole chloride ILs in optimizing the CO2RR pathway on Cu surfaces through electronic structure engineering. MD simulations demonstrate that ILs establish a CO2-enriched interfacial microenvironment that restricts bulk-phase CO2 diffusion through the confinement effect. Electron structure analyses reveal that ILs synergistically enhance interfacial electron accumulation and directional charge transfer for adsorbed CO2 and key intermediates (*CO, *COH, *CHO, and *C), collectively stabilizing them through IL-induced strengthening of Cu-C bonding. More importantly, the introduction of ILs dramatically reduces the activation barrier of the rate-determining C-C coupling step and thermodynamically favors the CO2RR to C2H4 and C2H5OH pathways through atom orbital hybridization. Additionally, the ILs not only enhance the CO2RR but also suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through proton confinement. This work provides molecular-level insights into the dynamic role of ILs in optimizing CO2RR processes and offers a foundation for designing advanced IL-mediated electrocatalytic systems.

Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production is an attractive renewable energy technology, but the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is severely constrained by a high overpotential. The two-dimensional vdW ferromagnetic material Fe3GeTe2, with its good stability and excellent metallic conductivity, has potential as an electrocatalyst, but its sluggish surface catalytic reactivity limits its large-scale application. In this work, we adapted DFT calculations to introduce surface Te vacancies to boost OER performance of the Fe3GeTe2 (001) surface. Te vacancies induce the charge redistribution of active sites, optimizing the adsorption and desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates. Consequently, the overpotential of the rate-determining step in the OER process of Fe3GeTe2 is reduced to 0.34 V, bringing the performance close to that of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst (0.56 V). Notably, the vacancies’ concentration and configuration significantly modify the electronic structure and thus influence OER activity. This study provides important theoretical evidence for defect engineering in OER catalysis and offers new design strategies for developing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion.

Machine learning has become ubiquitous in materials modelling and now routinely enables large-scale atomistic simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. However, developing machine-learned interatomic potentials requires high-quality training data, and the manual generation and curation of such data can be a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce an automated framework for the exploration and fitting of potential-energy surfaces, implemented in an openly available software package that we call autoplex ('automatic potential-landscape explorer'). We discuss design choices, particularly the interoperability with existing software architectures, and the ability for the end user to easily use the computational workflows provided. We show wide-ranging capability demonstrations: for the titanium-oxygen system, SiO2, crystalline and liquid water, as well as phase-change memory materials. More generally, our study illustrates how automation can speed up atomistic machine learning in computational materials science.

Abstract Understanding atomic orbital‐level interactions at material‐molecule interfaces is crucial for advancing surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). While conventional mechanisms focus on electromagnetic effects or interfacial charge transfer (CT), the role of orbital hybridization in multimetallic systems remains underexplored. Here, a d‐band‐mediated CT mechanism is proposed through the engineering high‐entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs). A face‐centered cubic AuAgCuMnInBi HEAAs synthesized via one‐step coreduction achieves ultrasensitive SERS detection of crystal violet. Density of states analyses reveal that Mn‐3d orbitals bridge electron reservoirs (Au/Ag/Cu) and In/Bi‐p orbitals, enabling efficient charge delocalization. Voltage‐tunable SERS signals in MnInBi subsystems confirm d‐band‐dependent CT enhancement. Beyond molecular sensing, this mechanism allows direct capture of reactive intermediates (OH·, O 2 · – ) and 5 n M uranium detection, bridging SERS enhancement dynamics with catalytic pathway elucidation. These findings establish d‐band engineering as a paradigm for designing multifunctional SERS substrates, bridging atomic‐scale electronic interactions with ultrasensitive sensing and catalytic mechanism elucidation.

Understanding and controlling the charge density wave (CDW) phase diagram of transition-metal dichalcogenides are long-studied problems in condensed matter physics. However, due to the complex involvement of electron and lattice degrees of freedom and pronounced anharmonicity, theoretical simulations of the CDW phase diagram at the density-functional-theory level are often numerically demanding. To reduce the computational cost of first-principles modeling by orders of magnitude, we have developed an electronic free-energy machine learning model for monolayer NbSe2 that allows us to control the electronic temperature as a parameter of the model. The ionic temperature is modeled via the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Our approach relies on a machine learning model of the electronic density of states and zero-temperature interatomic potential. This allows us to explore the CDW phase diagram of monolayer NbSe2 both under thermal and laser-induced nonthermal conditions. Our study provides an accurate estimate of the CDW transition temperature at low cost and can disentangle the role of hot electrons and phonons in the nonthermal ultrafast melting process of the CDW phase in NbSe2.

Comprehensive Summary Dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) show attractive prospects for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet face challenges in precise charge modulation that balances the activity and durability. Herein, we present a N,S‐coordinated Fe dual atomic catalyst modified by Fe 3 C nanoclusters (Fe 3 C/Fe 2 N x S) through pyrolyzing the mixtures of ZIF‐8‐encapsulated iron dimers and sulfur‐doped C 3 N 4 . Aberration‐corrected STEM and synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) validated that the catalyst was composed of Fe dual atomic sites and Fe 3 C nanoclusters, in which Fe dual atoms were coordinated by five N atoms and one S atom. Fe 3 C/Fe 2 N x S exhibited excellent ORR activity in alkaline media, displaying a high half‐wave potential ( E 1/2 = 0.894 V vs . RHE) with near 4e – selectivity ( n = 3.92) and maintaining 86.8% retention after 20000 s, superior to commercial Pt/C. Impressively, the assembled zinc‐air battery delivered exceptional peak power density (163 mW·cm –2 ) and 200‐hour robust stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that electron transfer from Fe of Fe 2 N x S to neighboring Fe 3 C induced local charge asymmetry, shifting the d‐band center closer to Fermi level, thereby enhancing O 2 activation. Moreover, the OOH * formation energy barrier was reduced to 0.52 eV in Fe 3 C/Fe 2 N x S, accelerating ORR reaction kinetics. This work establishes nanocluster‐mediated electronic redistribution to tailor charge asymmetry for high‐performance electrocatalysts.

Despite the importance of graphene based carbon capture devices, an accurate estimate of the interaction strength of a carbon dioxide molecule with graphene from periodic calculations is lacking. In this work, we compute a fixed node quantum diffusion Monte Carlo reference value for the interaction energy of a carbon dioxide molecule with a periodic free-standing graphene sheet, obtaining a value of -152 ± 15 meV. In addition, we evaluate the performance of several widely used density functional theory approximations and foundation machine learning interatomic potentials, for both carbon dioxide and water adsorption on graphene, competitive processes that play an important role in carbon capture technologies. Among the approaches tested, the B86bPBE-XDM, PBE-D3, revPBE-D3, rev-vdW-DF2, SCAN+rVV10, and PBE0-D3-ATM functionals achieve the closest agreement with DMC for the carbon dioxide-graphene interaction. The vdW-DF2, rev-vdW-DF2, and PBE0-D4-ATM functionals perform better for the competitive adsorption of water and carbon dioxide.
