Plasmon hybridization phenomena in metallic chain heterodimers represent a frontier in nanoscale optoelectronic research, offering insights into the quantum mechanisms that govern their behavior. Utilizing first-principles-based computational methods, we conduct a systematic study into the dimer configurations formed by Na8 and Mg8 chains, encompassing Na8 homodimer, Mg8 homodimer, and Na8Mg8 heterodimer. The study reveals that with the variation of bichain rotation angles, the plasmonic resonance modes within the dimers undergo significant hybridization, resulting in the emergence of new split peaks at the lower-energy range due to hybridization of the longitude mode and the transverse mode in the middle of the chain induced by it. At the high-energy range, the longitude multipole mode on the other chain is induced by the transverse center, and the interaction results in the splitting and appearance of hidden modes as the rotation angle increases. Both the excitation in the orthogonal direction and the electromagnetic field enhancement effects confirm the hybridization, which also provides the tenability of the plasmon resonance. This research provides a new theoretical perspective for understanding plasmonic hybridization phenomena at the nanoscale and offers important theoretical guidance for designing novel optoelectronic devices based on molecular plasmonics.

Due to the high configuration entropy, unique atomic arrangement, and electronic structures, high-entropy materials are being actively pursued as bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). However, a relevant strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of high-entropy materials is still lacking. Herein, a hole doping strategy has been employed to enable the high-entropy perovskite La(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 to effectively catalyze the ORR and OER. Hole doping experiments rely on the substitution of Sr2+ for La3+. The optimized La0.7Sr0.3(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 displays remarkable activity for the ORR and the OER, with a low potential difference of 0.880 V between the half-wave potential of the ORR and the OER potential at 10 mA cm-2, exceeding the majority of perovskite bifunctional catalysts. Further analysis of the electronic structures reveals that hole doping could regulate the eg-orbital filling of the transition-metal cations in high-entropy perovskites to an ideal position and thereby generate many highly active sites to promote the redox activity of oxygen. The assembled rechargeable ZAB with the targeted high-entropy perovskite as the cathode affords a specific capacity of 774.5 mAh gZn-1 under 10 mA cm-2 and durability for a period of 300 cycles, comparable to that of the 20%Pt/C + RuO2 ZAB. This work offers an important approach for the advancement of efficient high-entropy perovskites for ZABs.

We carry out highly accurate path integral Monte Carlo simulations to directly estimate the free energy of various warm dense matter systems including the uniform electron gas and hydrogen without any nodal restrictions or other approximations. Since our approach is based on an effective ensemble in a bosonic configuration space, it does not increase the computational complexity beyond the usual fermion sign problem. Its application to inhomogeneous cases such as an electronic system in a fixed external ion potential is straightforward and opens up the enticing possibility to benchmark density functional theory and other existing methods. Finally, it is not limited to warm dense matter and can be applied to a gamut of other systems such as ultracold atoms and electrons in quantum dots.

Developing efficient nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts remains challenging. Two-dimensional metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) stand out because of their large holes and high metal utilization. Based on first-principles high-throughput calculations, we studied the catalytic capacity of MOF catalyst TM3 (HITP)2 for NRR. Our calculated results indicate that among 29 catalytic structures, Mo3(HITP)2 and Os3(HITP)2 exhibit excellent activity for NRR, with the overpotential being 0.39 and 0.43 V, respectively. The unoccupied 4d orbitals of Mo are especially closer to the antibonding N-2p orbitals, leading to better nitrogen activation and lower overpotential. In addition, a descriptor related to charge variation and the electronegativity of metals and coordinating atoms is established, which has a good volcano plot relationship with the limiting potential of NRR and can provide ideas for catalyst screening. This research contributes valuable insights for the screening of NRR catalysts based on MOF.

Abstract Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been a powerful tool to model the corrosion behaviors of materials, provide insights into the corrosion mechanisms, predict the corrosion performance of materials, and design the corrosion‐resistant alloys and organic inhibitors. DFT enables corrosion scientist to fundamentally understand the corrosion behaviors and corrosion mechanisms of materials from the perspective of atomic and electronic structures, combining with the traditional and advanced experimental tests. This review briefly summarizes the main features of DFT calculations and present a comprehensive overview of their typical applications to corrosion and corrosion prevention of metals, involving potential‐pH diagrams, hydrogen evolution reaction, anodic dissolution, passivity and passivity breakdown, and organic inhibitor for metals. The paper also reviews the correlations between DFT‐computed descriptors and the micro/macro physiochemical parameters of corrosion. Despite the great progress achieved by DFT, there are still some challenges in addressing corrosion issues due to the lack of bridges between the DFT‐calculated electronic parameters and the macro corrosion performance of materials. The DFT modeling‐experiment‐engineering‐theory model will be a potential method to clarify and build the links.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting, which encompasses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), offers a promising route for sustainable hydrogen production. The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing this technology, especially given the reliance on expensive transition metals, such as Pt and Ir, in traditional catalysts. This review highlights recent advances in the design and optimization of electrocatalysts, focusing on density functional theory (DFT) as a key tool for understanding and improving catalytic performance in the HER and OER. We begin by exploring DFT-based approaches for evaluating catalytic activity under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The review then shifts to a material-oriented perspective, showcasing key catalyst materials and the theoretical strategies employed to enhance their performance. In addition, we discuss scaling relationships that exist between binding energies and electronic structures through the use of charge-density analysis and d -band theory. Advanced concepts, such as the effects of adsorbate coverage, solvation, and applied potential on catalytic behavior, are also discussed. We finally focus on integrating machine learning (ML) with DFT to enable high-throughput screening and accelerate the discovery of novel water-splitting catalysts. This comprehensive review underscores the pivotal role that DFT plays in advancing electrocatalyst design and highlights its potential for shaping the future of sustainable hydrogen production.

The design of new alloys is a multiscale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically slow and reserved for human experts. Machine learning can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural and chemical features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLMs) and the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multimodal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities. The concerted effort of the multiagent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multiobjective design tasks and opens avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) holds significant potential for converting CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals under mild reaction conditions. The kinetics of CO2RR is strongly influenced by both the electrocatalysts and the local environment at the electrode/electrolyte interface. While considerable research has focused on elucidating the “structure-activity” relationships of electrocatalysts, a fundamental understanding of the role of electrolyte-related factors (such as the ionic species) near the electrode/electrolyte interface is highly important for the further enhancement in the catalytic performance of CO2RR. In this review, we discuss the effects of pH, cations, and anions in the vicinity of the catalyst, using CO2RR as a model reaction. The mechanistic understanding of these effects is also analyzed via experimental findings from in situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical insights from density functional theory simulations. This review underscores the importance of understanding the various interactions of electrolytes with catalyst surfaces or intermediates and their impact on reaction kinetics of CO2RR.

ABSTRACT QCforever is a wrapper designed to automatically and simultaneously calculate various physical quantities using quantum chemical (QC) calculation software for blackbox optimization in chemical space. We have updated it to QCforever2 to search the conformation and optimize density functional parameters for a more accurate and reliable evaluation of an input molecule. In blackbox optimization, QCforever2 can work as compactly arranged surrogate models for costly chemical experiments. QCforever2 is the future of QC calculations and would be a good companion for chemical laboratories, providing more reliable search and exploitation in the chemical space.

Abstract In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies reveal key insights into the structural and chemical evolution of nanoparticles (NPs) under external stimuli like heating and biasing, which is critical for evaluating their suitability in chemical reactions and their tendency toward forming novel NP systems. In this study, starting from a core@shell Au nanotriangle (AuNT)@Pd nanostructure, the formation of a phase‐separated bi‐metallic Au─Pd NP system at high temperature is reported, despite the fact that Au and Pd are miscible in the entire composition and temperature range. In situ TEM heating of bare AuNT@Pd core@shell structures up to 1000 °C is performed. Between 400 and 800 °C, an initial alloy formation is observed. Notably, higher initial loading of Pd increases the melting temperature of the bi‐metallic system. However, the most important observation is the separation of the nanostructure into Au and Pd phases at temperatures above 850 °C for high Pd doping. The extent of Pd separation depends on the amount of initial Pd loading. A Janus Au─Pd nanostructure is formed at the end of the thermal treatments at 1000 °C. The phase‐separated NP is observed to be highly stable and could be clearly beneficial for various applications, particularly in catalytic processes.

To this end, a systematic comparison of two clustering workflows that had been established in previous literature was performed on two distinct material systems—an experimentally acquired Co2FeSi Heusler alloy and a simulated Au-matrix and Al2Cu precipitate. The cluster outputs were evaluated using a variety of unsupervised clustering metrics measuring separation and cohesion. It was found that the cluster output of a variational autoencoder (VAE) performed better compared to a more conventional latent transformation via Uniform Manifold Approximation & Projection (UMAP) on 4D-STEM data alone. However, the UMAP workflow applied to merged 4D-STEM and STEM-energy dispersive x-ray (STEM-EDX) data produced the best cluster output overall, indicating that the correlated information provides beneficial constraints to the latent space. A potential general workflow for analyzing merged datasets to identify structural-composition changes across different material systems is proposed.

Abstract Quantum chemistry (QC) calculations have significantly advanced the development of materials, drugs, and other molecular products. Molecular geometry optimization is an indispensable step for QC calculations. However, its computational cost increases dramatically with increasing molecular system complexity, hindering the large‐scale molecule screening. This work proposes a deep learning‐based molecular potential energy surface prediction tool (DeePEST) to significantly accelerate geometry optimizations. The key of DeePEST involves the development of a novel machine learning potential model for accurate and fast predictions of molecular energy and atomic forces. These predictions enable efficient molecular geometry optimizations for subsequent predictions of QC properties (single‐point energy, dipole moment, HOMO/LUMO, and 13 C chemical shifts) and COSMO‐SAC‐based thermodynamic properties (activity coefficient). Moreover, DeePEST facilitates efficient computer‐aided molecular designs that involve QC‐based geometry optimizations. The utilization of DeePEST in geometry optimizations achieves high prediction accuracy approaching to rigorous QC methods while maintaining the computational efficiency of molecular mechanics methods.

The reactions critical for the energy transition center on the chemistry of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and the heterogeneous catalyst surfaces that make up electrochemical energy conversion systems. Together, the surface-adsorbate interactions constitute the electrochemical interphase and define reaction kinetics of many clean energy technologies. Practical devices introduce high levels of complexity where surface roughness, structure, composition, and morphology combine with electrolyte, pH, diffusion, and system level limitations to challenge our ability to deconvolute underlying phenomena. To make significant strides in materials design, a structured approach based on well-defined surfaces is necessary to selectively control distinct parameters, while complexity is added sequentially through careful application of nanostructured surfaces. In this review, we cover advances made through this approach for key elements in the field, beginning with the simplest hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions and concluding with more complex organic molecules. In each case, we offer a unique perspective on the contribution of well-defined systems to our understanding of electrochemical energy conversion technologies and how wider deployment can aid intelligent materials design.

Understanding the ultrafast vibrational relaxation following photoexcitation of molecules in a condensed phase is essential to predict the outcome and improve the efficiency of photoinduced molecular processes. Here, the vibrational decoherence and energy relaxation of a binuclear complex, [Pt2(P2O5H2)4]4− (PtPOP), upon electronic excitation in liquid water and acetonitrile are investigated through direct adiabatic dynamics simulations. A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme is used where the excited state of the complex is modeled with orbital-optimized density functional calculations while solvent molecules are described using potential energy functions. The decoherence time of the Pt–Pt vibration dominating the photoinduced dynamics is found to be ∼1.6 ps in both solvents. This is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements in water, where intersystem crossing is slow (&gt;10 ps). Pathways for the flow of excess energy are identified by monitoring the power of the solvent on vibrational modes. The latter are obtained as generalized normal modes from the velocity covariances, and the power is computed using QM/MM embedding forces. Excess vibrational energy is found to be predominantly released through short-range repulsive and attractive interactions between the ligand atoms and surrounding solvent molecules, whereas solute–solvent interactions involving the Pt atoms are less important. Since photoexcitation deposits most of the excess energy into Pt–Pt vibrations, energy dissipation to the solvent is inefficient. This study reveals the mechanism behind the exceptionally long vibrational coherence of the photoexcited PtPOP complex in solution and underscores the importance of short-range interactions for accurate simulations of vibrational energy relaxation of solvated molecules.

Abstract The slow reaction kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on existing catalysts in alkaline hinders the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). In this work, a Cu‐incorporated NiW alloy (Cu i ‐NiW) without any platinum group metal (PGM) is designed and evaluated in both liquid cells and AEMFCs. This catalyst enabled the achievement of an electrochemical surface area‐normalized exchange current density of 70 µA cm −2 and robust stability, outperforming most PGM‐free catalysts. Furthermore, the incorporation of Cu into other systems such as NiMo and NiV using the same method also showcased excellent HOR activity and durability. The fuel cells assembled with Cu i ‐NiW as the anode and Pt/C or Fe‐N‐C as the cathode delivered peak power densities of 480 and 340 mW cm −2 , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the incorporated Cu is chemically inert but enhances the overall oxidation resistance of the catalysts. Moreover, it weakens hydrogen adsorption and promotes the adsorption of hydroxide ions, thereby enhancing the HOR activity significantly. These results may open a door for rational design of high‐performance and durable PGM‐free HOR catalysts.

Sustainable economic development to improve the quality of life and ensure the reduction of carbon emissions to minimize the threats of climate change have become global trends of modern times and strategic priorities of almost all countries of the world, including Ukraine.The article substantiates the importance of adhering to the principles of sustainable development, attracting investment resources for these purposes, using new approaches to financial, economic and organizational mechanisms for the implementation of innovative technologies for reducing carbon emissions (CCS) in the context of ensuring the strengthening of national defense.The essence and features of the technological process for CCS are revealed, the scale of participation of countries of the world in CCS projects and the predicted dynamics of reducing CO2 emissions under their implementation are analyzed. The financial, economic and organizational mechanisms for ensuring the effective implementation of CCS projects are characterized, their structure is detailed. The regulatory policy and regulatory framework of various countries supporting the deployment of CCS technologies, the practice of governments using financial and economic mechanisms, as well as attracting private financing to support investments in CCS are summarized.The initiatives of the Government of Ukraine regarding energy efficiency and the implementation of innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions are analyzed, recommendations are provided for the expansion of financial and economic mechanisms.A correlation is identified between the implementation of innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions and the strengthening of national defense in such key aspects as energy security and defense capability, reducing environmental risks at military facilities, using defense infrastructure to implement environmentally friendly innovations, cooperation within the framework of financial, economic and organizational mechanisms for the implementation of innovative technologies, the social aspect and strategic sustainability.It is concluded that, based on the experience of foreign countries in implementing CCS technologies, Ukraine should take a balanced approach to the development and implementation of CCS projects, improving existing financial, economic and organizational mechanisms, using international support and technical assistance from partner countries. This will allow realizing the existing potential for implementing the Strategy for Low-Carbon Development of Ukraine until 2050. The post-war reconstruction of the Ukrainian economy based on the principles of sustainable development and the orientation towards the use of the most modern innovative technologies will allow significantly modernizing its production potential, strengthening energy independence and environmental sustainability, which, of course, will have a synergistic effect on strengthening national defense.

Abstract Heteroatom‐bridged dual‐atom catalysts (DACs), featuring more flexible active sites and intermetallic interaction, provide an opportunity for sustainable environmental remediation. Herein, an innovative oxygen‐bridged Co‐Cu DAC supported on nano‐alumina (CoOCu‐DAC) is fabricated using a straightforward two‐step process. The as‐prepared catalyst significantly enhances both decontamination kinetics and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) utilization efficiency by 1–3 orders of magnitude toward monoethanolamine (MEA, p K a = 9.5) compared to Co single‐atom catalyst (Co‐SAC) and bulk metal catalysts, and largely outperforms previously reported systems. In‐situ ATR‐FTIR and theoretical investigations reveal that the secondary introduction of Cu plays multiple important roles: it activates lattice oxygen to trigger key proton transfer (PT) of MEAH + via nucleophilic attack at the interface and subsequently favors deprotonated MEA as an efficient electron donor to accelerate electron transfer (ET) by enhancing orbital overlaps for the co‐activation of O 2 and PMS. Such a stepwise proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET)‐enhanced catalytic pathway mediated by CoOCu‐DAC is fundamentally different from common route identified in Co‐SAC‐involved Fenton‐like system. The established binary QSAR further substantiates the universality of PCET‐enhanced strategy toward versatile nitrogen‐containing organic compounds. This study offers a new perspective for sustainable water decontamination and other related areas of catalysis based on rationalized design of multifunctional catalysts at atomic level.
