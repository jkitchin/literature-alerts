Direct methanol fuel cells rely on the efficiency of their anode/cathode electrocatalysts to facilitate the methanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction, respectively. Platinum-based nanocatalysts are at the forefront due to their superior catalytic properties. However, the high-cost, scarcity, and low CO tolerance of platinum pose challenges for the scalable application of DMFCs. Herein, we report novel ultrathin ternary PtNiRu alloy nanowires to improve Pt utilization and CO tolerance. These novel electrocatalysts incorporate the oxophilic metal Ru into ultrathin PtNi nanowires, aiming to enhance the intrinsic activity of platinum while leveraging the long-term durability and high utilization efficiency provided by the bimetallic synergistic effect. The PtNiRu NWs significantly enhance both mass activity and specific activity for ORR, performing about 6.9 times and 3.9 times better than commercial Pt/C, respectively. After a rigorous durability test of 10,000 cycles, the PtNiRu NWs only exhibited a 25.2 % loss in mass activity. Additionally, for MOR, the MA and SA of PtNiRu NWs exceed that of Pt/C catalyst by 4.30 and 2.72 times, respectively, and exhibit exceptional resistance to CO poisoning. Theoretical insights from density functional theory calculations suggest that the introduction of Ru modulates the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms, which contributes to decreased binding strength of oxygenated species and an elevated dissolution potential, substantiating the enhanced performance metrics, and the durability enhancement stems from the stronger PtM bonds than those in PtNiRu NWs resulted from PtRu covalent interactions. These findings not only provide a new perspective on platinum-based nanocatalysts but also significantly advance the quest for more efficient and durable electrocatalysts for DMFCs, representing a substantial stride in fuel cell technology.

Abstract An efficient and facile water dissociation process plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Considering the intricate influence between interfacial water and intermediates in typical catalytic systems, meticulously engineered catalysts should be developed by modulating electron configurations and optimizing surface chemical bonds. Here, a high‐entropy double perovskite (HEDP) electrocatalyst La 2 (Co 1/6 Ni 1/6 Mg 1/6 Zn 1/6 Na 1/6 Li 1/6 )RuO 6 , achieving a reduced overpotential of 40.7 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and maintaining exemplary stability over 82 h in a 1 m KOH electrolyte is reported. Advanced spectral characterization and first‐principles calculations elucidate the electron transfer from Ru to Co and Ni positions, facilitated by alkali metal‐induced super‐exchange interaction in high‐entropy crystals. This significantly optimizes hydrogen adsorption energy and lowers the water decomposition barrier. Concurrently, the super‐exchange interaction enhances orbital hybridization and narrows the bandgap, thus improving catalytic efficiency and adsorption capacity while mitigating hysteresis‐driven proton transfer. The high‐entropy framework also ensures structural stability and longevity in alkaline environments. The work provides further insights into the formation mechanisms of HEDP and offers guidelines for discovering advanced, efficient hydrogen evolution catalysts through super‐exchange interaction.

Abstract The quest for heightened energy efficiency is inextricably linked to advancements in energy storage and conversion technologies, wherein multifunctional catalysts play a pivotal role by mitigating the slow kinetics endemic to many catalytic reactions. The intricate synthesis and bespoke design of such catalysts, however, present notable challenges. Addressing this, the present study capitalizes on a novel dissolution manufacturing strategy to engineer self‐supporting, nanoporous multifunctional electrocatalysts, circumventing the prevalent issue of customizing catalytic functionalities upon demand. This innovative approach grants the flexibility to finely tune the incorporation of active species and metalloid binders, culminating in the creation of a self‐supporting nanoporous metal glass electrocatalyst doped with RuO 2 (NPMG@RuO 2 ) with outstanding performance in alkaline media. The catalyst showcases superior electrocatalytic activity, achieving low overpotentials of 41.50 mV for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction and 226.0 mV for Oxygen Evolution Reaction alongside sustained stability over 620 hours.These achievements are attributed to the distinct nanoporous architecture that ensures a high density of catalytic sites and mechanical strength, bolstered by the synergistic interplay between RuO 2 and Pt‐based metallic glass. The findings provide a versatile template for the development of nanoporous multifunctional catalysts, signifying a leap forward in the realm of energy conversion technologies.

Abstract Pt‐based alloy with high mass activity and durability is highly desired for proton exchange membrane fuel cells, yet a great challenge remains due to the high mass transport resistance near catalysts with lowering Pt loading. Herein, an extensible approach employing atomic layer deposition to accurately introduce a gas‐phase metal precursor into platinum nanoparticles (NPs) pre‐filled mesoporous channels is reported, achieved by controlling both the deposition site and quantity. Following the spatially confined alloying treatment, the prepared PtSn alloy catalyst within mesopores demonstrates a small size and homogeneous distribution (2.10 ± 0.53 nm). The membrane electrode assembly with mesoporous carbon‐supported PtSn alloy catalyst achieves a high initial mass activity of 0.85 A at 0.9 V, which is attributed to the smallest local oxygen transport resistance (3.68 S m −1 ) ever reported. The mass activity of the catalyst only decreases by 11% after 30000 cycles of accelerated durability test, representing superior full‐cell durability among the reported Pt‐based alloy catalysts. The enhanced activity and durability are attributed to the decreased adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates on Pt surface and the strong electronic interaction between Pt and Sn inhibiting Pt dissolution.

Abstract The successful large-scale implementation of hydrogen as an energy vector requires high performance electrodes and catalysts made of abundant materials. Rational materials design strategies are the most efficient means of reaching this goal. Here we present a study on the adsorption of H-atoms onto fcc transition metal surfaces and propose descriptors for the rational design of electrodes and catalysts by means of correlations between fundamental properties of the materials and among other properties, their experimentally measured performance as hydrogen evolution electrodes (HEE). A large set of quantum mechanical modelling data at the DFT level was produced, covering the adsorption of H-atoms onto the most stable surfaces (100), (110) and (111) of: Ag, Au, Co, Cu, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Rh. For each material and surface, a coverage dependent set of minimum energy structures was produced and chemical potentials for adsorption of H-atoms were obtained. Averaging procedures are here proposed to approach modelling to the experiments. Several correlations between the computed data and experimentally measured quantities are done to validate our methodology: surface plane dependent adsorption energies, chemical potentials and experimentally determined surface energies and work functions. We search for descriptors of catalytic activity by testing correlations between the DFT data obtained from our averaging procedures and experimental data on HEE performance. Our methodology allows us to obtain linear correlations between the adsorption energy of H-atoms and the exchange current density ( i 0 ) in a HEE, avoiding the volcano-like plots. We show that the chemical potential has limitations as a descriptor of i 0 because it reaches an early plateau in terms of i 0 . Simple quantities obtained from database data such as the first stage electronegativity (χ) as devised by Mulliken has a strong linear correlation i 0 . With a quantity we denominate modified second-stage electronegativity (χ 2m ) we can reproduce the typical volcano plot in a correlation with i 0 . A theoretical and conceptual framework is presented. It shows that both χ and χ 2m , that depend on the first ionization potential, second ionization potential and electron affinity of the elements can be used as descriptors in rational design of electrodes or of catalysts for hydrogen systems.

Abstract Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet their potential is often constrained by the inertness of the basal planes arising from their poor hydrogen adsorption ability. Here, the relationship between the electronic structure of the WS 2 basal plane and HER activity is systemically analyzed to establish a clear insight. The valance state of the sulfur atoms on the basal plane has been tuned to enhance hydrogen adsorption through sequential engineering processes, including direct phase transition and heterostructure that induces work function‐difference‐induced unidirectional electron transfer. Additionally, an innovative synthetic approach, harnessing the built‐in internal polarization field at the W‐graphene heterointerface, triggers the in‐situ formation of sulfur vacancies in the bottom WS x (x < 2) layers. The resultant modulation of the valance state of the sulfur atom stabilizes the W‐S bond, while destabilizing the S‐H bond. The electronic structural changes are further amplified by the release and transfer of surplus electrons via sulfur vacancies, filling the valance state of W and S atoms. Consequently, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the electronic structure of the WS 2 basal plane and the HER activity, focusing on optimizing S‐H bonding state.

Abstract The structural tailoring of Pt‐based catalysts into 1D nanowires for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) has been a focus of research. Mo(CO) 6 is commonly used as a morphological modifier to form nanowires, but it is found that it inevitably leads to Mo doping. This doping introduces unique electrochemical signals not seen in other Pt‐based catalysts, which can directly reflect the stability of the catalyst. Through experiments, it is demonstrated that Mo doping is detrimental to ORR performance, and theoretical calculations have shown that Mo sites that are inherently inactive also poison the ORR activity of the surrounding Pt. Therefore, a novel gas‐assisted technique is proposed to replace Mo(CO) 6 with CO, which forms ultrafine nanowires with an order of magnitude increase in length, ruling out the effect of Mo. The catalyst performs at 1.24 A mg Pt −1 , 7.45 times greater than Pt/C, demonstrating significant ORR mass activity, and a substantial improvement in stability. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell using this catalyst provides a higher power density (0.7 W cm −2 ). This study presents a new method for the preparation of ultra‐long nanowires, which opens up new avenues for future practical applications of low‐Pt catalysts in PEMFC.

Abstract Forced‐flow atomic layer deposition nanolamination is employed to fabricate Pt‐Ni nanoparticles on XC‐72, with the compositions ranging from Pt 94 Ni 6 to Pt 67 Ni 33 . Hydrogen is used as a co‐reactant for depositing Pt and Ni. The growth rate of Pt is slower than that using oxygen reactant, and the growth exhibits preferred orientation along the (111) plane. Ni shows much slower growth rate than Pt, and it is only selectively deposited on Pt, not on the substrate. Higher ratios of Ni would hinder subsequent stacking of Pt atoms, resulting in lower overall growth rate and smaller particles (1.3–2.1 nm). Alloying of Pt with Ni causes shifted lattice that leads to larger lattice parameter and d‐spacing as Ni fraction increases. From the electronic state analysis, Pt 4f peaks are shifted to lower binding energies with increasing the Ni content, suggesting charge transfer from Ni to Pt. Schematic of the growth behavior is proposed. Most of the alloy nanoparticles exhibit higher electrochemical surface area and oxygen reduction reaction activity than those of commercial Pt. Especially, Pt 83 Ni 17 and Pt 87 Ni 13 show excellent mass activities of 0.76 and 0.59 A mg Pt −1 , respectively, higher than the DOE target of 2025, 0.44 A mg Pt −1 .

Abstract The ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) has attracted attention because ethylene glycol (EG), which exhibits large‐scale production and a low market price, can be reformed into valuable glycolic acid (GCA) with the cogeneration of high‐purity hydrogen gas during the reaction. In this study, a noble catalyst material of Pt nanoparticles supported on Se‐doped porous carbon (Pt/SePC) is prepared and investigated for the selective electrochemical oxidation of EG to GCA. Pt/SePC achieved a maximum EG conversion of 94.6% and GCA selectivity of 84.4% and maintained this high performance with negligible degradation during durability tests. Furthermore, the EGOR required lower overpotential rather than the oxygen evolution reaction, thus the EGOR coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction can reduce the cell overpotential to 0.60 V, which is much lower than that of water electrolysis (1.58 V). The effect of Se doping is investigated through experimental analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and they shows that Se modified the binding energy of Pt nanoparticles and the adsorption energy of reactants by lattice deformation and charge density modification. This study provides scientific insights and strategies for electrocatalyst design for the selective oxidation of polyols to value‐added chemicals via the cogeneration of hydrogen gas.

Abstract Under large current densities, the excessive hydroxide ion (OH) consumption hampers alkaline water splitting involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High OH concentration (≈30 wt.%) is often used to enhance the catalytic activity of OER, but it also leads to higher corrosion in practical systems. To achieve higher catalytic activity in low OH concentration, catalysts on magnetic frame (CMF) are built to utilize the local magnetic convection induced from the host frame's magnetic field distributions. This way, a higher reaction rate can be achieved in relatively lower OH concentrations. A CMF model system with catalytically active CoFeO x nanograins grown on the magnetic Ni foam is demonstrated. The OER current of CoFeO x @NF receives ≈90% enhancement under 400 mT (900 mA cm −2 at 1.65 V) compared to that in zero field, and exhibits remarkable durability over 120 h. As a demonstration, the water‐splitting performance sees a maximum 45% magnetic enhancement under 400 mT in 1 m KOH (700 mA cm −2 at 2.4 V), equivalent to the concentration enhancement of the same electrode in a more corrosive 2 m KOH electrolyte. Therefore, the catalyst‐on‐magnetic‐frame strategy can make efficient use of the catalysts and achieve higher catalytic activity in low OH concentration by harvesting local magnetic convection.

Abstract In order to address imminent energy and environmental challenges, photocatalytic water splitting emerges as a promising way for harnessing solar radiation to generate clean chemical energy. 2D arsenene (β‐As) has notable catalytic activity in hydrogen production. Based on first principles calculations and non‐adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations, the β‐As/Ti 2 CO 2 heterojunction is predicted to be a promising Z‐scheme photocatalyst for overall solar water splitting. It has a desirable energy band structure with the valence band maximum of Ti 2 CO 2 and the conduction band minimum of β‐As well below and above the redox potentials of H 2 O. Both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can proceed spontaneously under light irradiation. NAMD simulations confirm that it is a Z‐scheme photocatalyst with fast electron–hole combination dynamics. Instead of by intrinsic electric field, such a fast electron–hole combination is driven by a large nonadiabatic coupling. The heterojunction exhibits strong optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet regions. The estimated solar‐to‐hydrogen (STH) efficiency limit of β‐As/Ti 2 CO 2 reaches 32%, which is the highest among all β‐As based junctions reported in the literature. These results suggest that β‐As/Ti 2 CO 2 is a promising photocatalyst for achieving overall water splitting.

Abstract Dynamic liquid metal catalysts have remarkable activity and selectivity toward certain reactions, such as carbon dioxide reduction. The surface hydrogen coverage may play a role in this, including controlling competing reactions such as hydrogen evolution. Using a novel method of statistically selecting relevant snapshots from a dynamic liquid metal trajectory, the hydrogen adsorption energy is reported across liquid surfaces of Ga–Sn and Ga–In via density functional theory. A fully dynamic sampling of hydrogen adsorption to the liquid metal is also conducted with ab initio molecular dynamics at temperature. The results indicate that hydrogen only associates weakly with Ga–Sn and Ga–In surfaces, with minimal difference between the two materials. Hydrogen adsorbs only slightly more stably (≈0.1 eV) to the liquid surfaces compared to the solid. A low hydrogen coverage is predicted on the liquid metal of ≈0.03 H Å −2 at potentials of around –1.15 V (vs RHE). However, the mobility of hydrogen on the liquid surface is much greater due to a novel mechanism whereby the dynamic surface rearranges, opening pathways for diffusion. The results suggest that the unique catalytic behavior of these liquid metal materials may be due to changes in adsorbate diffusivity when the metals are melted.

The quest for efficient green hydrogen production through Alkaline Water Electrolysis (AWE) is a critical aspect of the clean energy transition. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is central to this process, with the performance of electrocatalysts being a determining factor for overall efficiency. Theoretical studies using energy-based descriptors are essential for designing high-performance alkaline HER electrocatalysts. This review summarizes various descriptors, including water adsorption energy, water dissociation barrier, and Gibbs free energy changes of hydrogen and hydroxyl adsorption. Examples of how to apply these descriptors to identify the active site of materials and better design high-performance alkaline HER electrocatalysts are provided, highlighting the previously underappreciated role of hydroxyl adsorption-free energy changes. As research progresses, integrating these descriptors with experimental data will be paramount in advancing AWE technology for sustainable hydrogen production.

Organocatalysis has established itself as a third pillar of homogeneous catalysis, besides transition metal catalysis and biocatalysis, as its use for enantioselective reactions has gathered significant interest over the last decades. Concurrent to this development, machine learning (ML) has been increasingly applied in the chemical domain to efficiently uncover hidden patterns in data and accelerate scientific discovery. While the uptake of ML in organocatalysis has been comparably slow, the last two decades have showed an increased interest from the community. This review gives an overview of the work in the field of ML in organocatalysis. The review starts by giving a short primer on ML for experimental chemists, before discussing its application for predicting the selectivity of organocatalytic transformations. Subsequently, we review ML employed for privileged catalysts, before focusing on its application for catalyst and reaction design. Concluding, we give our view on current challenges and future directions for this field, drawing inspiration from the application of ML to other scientific domains.

Simulating peptides and proteins is becoming increasingly important, leading to a growing need for efficient computational methods. These are typically semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods, force fields (FFs), or machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), all of which require a large amount of accurate data for robust training and evaluation. To assess potential reference methods and complement the available data, we introduce two sets, DipCONFL and DipCONFS, which cover large parts of the conformational space of 17 amino acids and their 289 possible dipeptides in aqueous solution. The conformers were selected from the exhaustive PeptideCS dataset by Andris et al. [

In this Letter, we combine first-principles calculations with the non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) method to investigate the photocatalytic and excited-state properties of blue phosphorene (BlueP). Doping with Group III A elements not only maintains an appropriate bandgap and band edge positions for photocatalytic water splitting but also converts the indirect bandgap of BlueP to a direct bandgap, significantly enhancing photon absorption efficiency. The dopants effectively improve optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet light regions, potentially enabling a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 22.3% in the photocatalytic water splitting process. In NAMD calculations, we consider the dynamics of the electron–hole pair recombination process between the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum. We demonstrate the regulatory impact of dopant elements, temperature, and non-adiabatic coupling strength on the exciton lifetime of doped BlueP through ab initio molecular dynamics and NAMD methods. This study reveals the relationship between the charge transfer mechanism and non-adiabatic coupling in low-dimensional materials, offering valuable insights into the excited-state properties of optoelectronic materials. Ultimately, our findings contribute to the development of tunable, long-lived exciton lifetimes and high carrier mobilities in doped BlueP, which hold significant potential for photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen.

Self-discharge and chemically induced mechanical effects degrade calendar and cycle life in intercalation-based electrochromic and electrochemical energy storage devices. In rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, self-discharge in cathodes causes voltage and capacity loss over time. The prevailing self-discharge model centers on the diffusion of lithium ions from the electrolyte into the cathode. We demonstrate an alternative pathway, where hydrogenation of layered transition metal oxide cathodes induces self-discharge through hydrogen transfer from carbonate solvents to delithiated oxides. In self-discharged cathodes, we further observe opposing proton and lithium ion concentration gradients, which contribute to chemical and structural heterogeneities within delithiated cathodes, accelerating degradation. Hydrogenation occurring in delithiated cathodes may affect the chemo-mechanical coupling of layered cathodes as well as the calendar life of lithium-ion batteries.

Quantum chemical simulations can be greatly accelerated by constructing machine learning potentials, which is often done using active learning (AL). The usefulness of the constructed potentials is often limited by the high effort required and their insufficient robustness in the simulations. Here, we introduce the end-to-end AL for constructing robust data-efficient potentials with affordable investment of time and resources and minimum human interference. Our AL protocol is based on the physics-informed sampling of training points, automatic selection of initial data, uncertainty quantification, and convergence monitoring. The versatility of this protocol is shown in our implementation of quasi-classical molecular dynamics for simulating vibrational spectra, conformer search of a key biochemical molecule, and time-resolved mechanism of the Diels-Alder reaction. These investigations took us days instead of weeks of pure quantum chemical calculations on a high-performance computing cluster.

Abstract External field‐enhanced electrocatalysis is a novel and promising approach for boosting the efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, potentially achieving significant enhancement without altering the composition and structure of electrocatalysts. In addition, the scaling relations of electrocatalysis typically lead to similar variations of initial‐state and transition‐state (TS) energy, which minimally impacts the reaction energy barrier. A sophisticated design of the external field effects shall break these scaling relations. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current research on the effect of mechanical, electric, and magnetic fields on electrocatalysis. It meticulously details the mechanisms underlying activity enhancement based on external field regulations, spanning from the synthesis of electrocatalytic materials to their behavior during the reaction process and modulation of the electrolyte environment. Additionally, the applications of emerging machine learning (ML) technologies in electrocatalysis design, including machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to simulate large‐scale and dynamic chemical reaction processes, data‐driven design and optimization of electrocatalysis performance, are briefly reviewed. In addition, the significant potential of ML technologies in conjunction with external field regulation, envisioning them as effective tools for optimizing or reverse designing electrocatalysis, considering both thermodynamic and kinetic factors as well as the dynamic effect of electrocatalyst surfaces under extreme external fields, is highlighted.
