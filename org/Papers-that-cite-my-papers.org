Abstract This review highlights recent advances in machine learning (ML)‚Äêassisted design of energy materials. Initially, ML algorithms were successfully applied to screen materials databases by establishing complex relationships between atomic structures and their resulting properties, thus accelerating the identification of candidates with desirable properties. Recently, the development of highly accurate ML interatomic potentials and generative models has not only improved the robust prediction of physical properties, but also significantly accelerated the discovery of materials. In the past couple of years, ML methods have enabled high‚Äêprecision first‚Äêprinciples predictions of electronic and optical properties for large systems, providing unprecedented opportunities in materials science. Furthermore, ML‚Äêassisted microstructure reconstruction and physics‚Äêinformed solutions for partial differential equations have facilitated the understanding of microstructure‚Äìproperty relationships. Most recently, the seamless integration of various ML platforms has led to the emergence of autonomous laboratories that combine quantum mechanical calculations, large language models, and experimental validations, fundamentally transforming the traditional approach to novel materials synthesis. While highlighting the aforementioned recent advances, existing challenges are also discussed. Ultimately, ML is expected to fully integrate atomic‚Äêscale simulations, reverse engineering, process optimization, and device fabrication, empowering autonomous and generative energy system design. This will drive transformative innovations in energy conversion, storage, and harvesting technologies.

Abstract Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) by two‚Äêelectron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ‚àí ORR) under acidic conditions is promising. However, constructing a highly efficient acid‚Äêresistant 2e ‚àí ORR electrocatalyst is critical but challenging. Herein, a coaxial cobalt single‚Äêatom catalyst on carbon nanotubes (Co SA ‚ÄêN‚ÄêC/CNTs) is designed and synthesized by an ingenious separation chemical vapor deposition (SCVD) strategy, which achieves higher ORR activity, dominated 2e ‚àí selectivity, and superior stability in acid, compared to the counterpart nanoparticle catalyst prepared by traditional mixture pyrolysis. The as‚Äêassembled electrode using Co SA ‚ÄêN‚ÄêC/CNTs catalyst demonstrates a high H 2 O 2 yield in excess of 2000 mmol g cat ‚àí1 h ‚àí1 with a Faraday efficiency of >90% over 100 h without decay in a flow cell, as superior to the most reported acidic H 2 O 2 production catalysts. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that such excellent 2e ‚àí ORR performance of Co SA ‚ÄêN‚ÄêC/CNTs originate from the combined advantages of strongly coupled coaxial core‚Äìshell structure and highly dispersed single‚Äêatom property. Most importantly, a series of other coaxial transition metal single‚Äêatom catalysts (M SA ‚ÄêN‚ÄêC/CNTs, M = Fe, Cu, or Ni) are prepared through this SCVD strategy, and they all show enhanced ORR performance, demonstrating universality.

Vibrational spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for molecular characterization and offers an ideal target for the computational investigation of molecular materials. Building on previous comprehensive assessments of efficient methods for infrared (IR) spectroscopy, this study investigates the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of gas-phase IR spectra calculations, accessible through a combination of modern semiempirical quantum mechanical and transferable machine learning potentials. A composite approach for IR spectra prediction based on the double-harmonic approximation, utilizing harmonic vibrational frequencies in combination squared derivatives of the molecular dipole moment, is employed. This approach allows for methodical flexibility in the calculation of IR intensities from molecular dipoles and the corresponding vibrational modes. Various methods are systematically tested to suggest a suitable protocol with an emphasis on computational efficiency. Among these methods, semiempirical extended tight-binding (xTB) models, classical charge equilibrium models, and machine learning potentials trained for dipole moment prediction are assessed across a diverse data set of organic molecules. We particularly focus on the recently reported foundational machine learning potential MACE-OFF23 to address the accuracy limitations of conventional low-cost quantum mechanical and force-field methods. This study aims to establish a standard for the efficient computational prediction of IR spectra, facilitating the rapid and reliable identification of unknown compounds and advancing automated high-throughput analytical workflows in chemistry.

To alleviate the increasingly serious energy issues, it is essential to develop highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we employed density functional theory to investigate a broad spectrum of transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ag, W, Ir, and Pt) atoms supported on N-terminated diamond (100) surface (TM@ND) as single-atom catalysts for their OER and ORR performances. TM atoms (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, and Ir) show large binding energy with substrate and thermal stability, which is advantageous for electrocatalytic reactions. Especially, Ir@ND demonstrates high efficacy as an OER electrocatalyst, and Mn@ND is identified as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst, exhibiting the theoretical overpotentials smaller than 1 V. Consequently, it suggests that diamond-based catalysts could serve as promising candidates for energy conversion and storage applications.

Electrocatalysis holds paramount significance in driving the progress of sustainable energy technologies, such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and batteries. The presence of various species on the electrode surface, such as reactants, intermediates, and products during electrocatalysis' usually gives rise to complex reaction pathways. A systematic understanding of various electrocatalytic processes in chemical reactions is required to untangle the complicated interaction of species on the catalyst's surface and their influence on the electrocatalytic process. Taking hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as examples, this chapter introduces electrocatalytic mechanisms, feasible reaction pathways, and fundamental concepts to readers and stimulates their interest in the various fields of electrocatalysts and their applications.

Electrocatalytic technology plays an important role in advancing green and sustainable energy. Various significant electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), have huge potential in green energy conversion. However, the conversion efficiency is limited by slow kinetic processes and high reaction overpotentials. Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity is of paramount importance. Based on density functional theory (DFT), theoretical calculations can not only analyze the electrocatalytic reaction processes from the perspective of molecular structure and energy but also provide an in-depth understanding of the electronic structures of the catalysts and establish the structure‚Äìactivity relationships between catalysts and electrocatalytic reactions. Thus, DFT calculations can offer theoretical basis and guidance for the design and preparation of efficient electrocatalysts. In this chapter, we will introduce some DFT calculation methods and several electrocatalytic reactions, aiming to help readers understand how DFT calculations are applied to electrocatalytic energy conversion.

ABSTRACT Using first principles calculations we investigate cobalt‚Äêcoordinated tetracyanoquinodimethane (R‚ÄêCoTCNQ) as a potential catalyst for the CO 2 electroreduction reaction (CO 2 ERR). We determine that exchange‚Äìcorrelation functionals beyond the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are required to accurately describe the spin properties of R‚ÄêCoTCNQ, therefore, the meta‚ÄêGGA r 2 SCAN functional is used in this study. The free energy CO 2 ERR reaction pathways are calculated for the reduced catalyst ([R‚ÄêCoTCNQ] ‚àí1 e ) with reaction products HCOOH and HCHO predicted depending on our choice of electrode potential. Calculations are also performed for [R‚ÄêCoTCNQ] ‚àí1 e supported on a H‚Äêterminated diamond (1 1 0) surface with reaction pathways being qualitatively similar to the [R‚ÄêCoTCNQ] ‚àí1 e monolayer. The inclusion of boron‚Äêdoping in the diamond support shows a slightly improved CO 2 ERR reaction pathway. Furthermore, structurally, supported R‚ÄêCoTCNQ provide a high specific area of active Co active sites and could be promising catalysts for future experimental consideration.

Writing scientific literature reviews is highly challenging, especially for broad topics like "heterogeneous catalysis" due to the explosion of knowledge. In this article, we introduce a machine-assisted approach aimed to facilitating this process. It integrates an automated summarization of several sources into the conventional method of writing a literature review. Our approach represents an initial trial to compile recent trends in heterogeneous catalysis. We chose the topic of heterogeneous catalysis due to its significance in various industrial processes and its multidisciplinary nature, which makes reviewing it challenging. The review highlights the pursuit of more advanced and complex catalysts to enhance catalytic performance. These advances significantly influence chemical reaction engineering, which combines reaction chemistry and chemical engineering. The trend of developing complex catalysts faces feasibility challenges, underscoring the importance of balancing practicality and potential benefits. In this interplay, the role of atomistic understanding becomes more important as it provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing catalyst behavior. Therefore, this review also covers advances in computational studies, particularly density functional theory calculations and the incorporation of new techniques. The wide scope of knowledge presented in this initial trial will facilitate further development in the field of chemical reaction engineering.

Abstract Nanoporous and chemically‚Äêbridged graphene nanosheets span a wide chemical space with a broad set of applications in sensing and electronics. Modeling the structure and dynamics of such nanosheets is challenging, as chemical bond making and breaking as well as non‚Äêcovalent interactions must be captured accurately and on equal footing. Here it is showed that recent graph‚Äêbased machine‚Äêlearned force field (MLFF) SO3krates [J. T. Frank et al. , Nat. Commun. 15 , 6539 (2024)] is able to reliably model the dynamics and mechanical response for a broad class of nanoporous graphenes when trained on accurate density functional theory data that includes long‚Äêrange many‚Äêbody dispersion (MBD) interactions. In contrast, local moment tensor potentials and empirical reactive potentials are much less accurate. It is also found that recent MLFFs trained on solid‚Äêstate datasets must be used with care, since even empirical potentials occasionally yield more accurate results. These findings highlight the potential of properly‚Äêtrained graph MLFFs in modeling the properties of whole chemical spaces of complex functional materials.

Modeling adsorbates on single-crystal metals is critical in rational catalyst design and other research that requires detailed thermochemistry. First-principles simulations via density functional theory (DFT) are among the prevalent tools to acquire such information about surface species. While they are highly dependable, DFT calculations often require intensive computational resources and runtime. These limiting factors become particularly pronounced when investigating large sets of complex molecules on heavy noble metals. Consequently, our ability to explore these species and their corresponding energetics is limited. In this work, we establish a novel framework that utilizes techniques including molecular encoding, descriptor synthesis, and machine learning to overcome the limitation of costly DFT simulations. Simultaneously, we estimate thermochemical information efficiently at the DFT accuracy level. More specifically, we translated our training molecules into text-based identifiers through a simplified molecular-input line-entry system. Following that, we parametrize our training matrices with sets of short-range descriptors based on group methods, applying first the nearest neighbors to account for linear contributions. This is coupled with the long-range descriptors characterizing second nearest neighbors to account for nonlinear corrections. Finally, we use linear regression and machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian process regressions to regress over the linear and nonlinear matrix systems, respectively. This is the first work to our knowledge that encompasses both the first and second nearest neighbors based on the group theory throughout the featurization, training, and deployment stages. We trained and validated our models with 459 surface species on Pt(111), Ru(0001), and Ir(111) surfaces. Results exhibit robust performance to reproduce the energetics of interest, such as enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities, at various temperatures. Notably, the mean absolute errors can be reduced by 48% during training and 19% during prediction at a minimum, when compared to the classical group method. Leveraging the novel framework, our machine-learning-enabled thermochemistry estimator significantly empowers us to research the thermochemistry of complex species on metal catalysts.

Abstract Effective first‚Äêrow transition metal‚Äêbased electrocatalysts are crucial for large‚Äêscale hydrogen energy generation and anion exchange membrane (AEM) devices in water splitting. The present work describes that SmNi 0.02 Fe‚ÄêLDH nanosheets on nickel foam are used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and AEM water electrolyzer study. Tuning the Ni‚Äêto‚ÄêFe ratios in NiFe‚ÄêLDH and doping with Sm ions improves the electrical structure and intrinsic activity. SmNi 0.02 Fe‚ÄêLDH has higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, and TWS activity, achieving 10 mA cm‚Åª 2 current density at lower overpotentials (230 mV, 95 mV, and 1.62 V, respectively). In AEMWE cells, SmNi 0.02 Fe‚ÄêLDH as a cathode and anode pair exhibits outstanding activity (0.9 A cm‚Åª 2 at 2 V) and stability over 120 h. Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations reveal that the Sm doping in NiFe‚ÄêLDH surface enhances its bifunctional activity toward OER and HER. These findings emphasize the potential of non‚Äênoble composites for long‚Äêterm water electrolysis in total water splitting and AEMWE applications.

Abstract The modular assembly of organic molecules commonly guides the design of metal‚Äìorganic frameworks (MOFs), yet the systematic exploration of inorganic building blocks remains limited. Given the promising applications in catalytic reactions and topological materials, the study of metal‚Äìinorganic frameworks (MIFs)‚Äîwhich fundamentally differ from the well‚Äêestablished MOFs‚Äîhas become urgent. This study introduces a strategy for designing MIFs using host atom‚Äêcentered building blocks, applied to the platinum‚ÄìPhosphorus (Pt‚ÄìP) system. By combining experimental observations with theoretical calculations, a Pt 18 P 18 framework utilizing PtP 3 building blocks, demonstrating significant energetic benefits is proposed. PtP 3 units are employed to characterize Pt 3 P 6 clusters within the pores, leading to a ‚Äúcompass‚Äù model that aligns with experimental findings. To address computational challenges associated with the large periodicity of the superstructure, a robust machine learning force field is developed. The analysis, combining surface nucleation studies, first‚Äêprinciples calculations, and machine learning techniques, provides a comprehensive understanding of MIF structure.

Abstract Perovskite oxides have been considered promising oxygen catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), owing to structural and compositional flexibility, and tailorable properties. Ingenious B‚Äêsite ordered La 1.5 Sr 0.5 NiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 O 6 (LSNMF) double perovskite is strategically designed by simultaneously interposing Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 and Ni 0.5 Fe 0.5 into B‚Ä≤ and B‚Ä≥ sites. Controlling B‚Äêsite cation systematically tailors the electronic structure of the B‚Äêsite cation with a d‚Äêband center (M d ) upshift close to the Fermi level, increasing the overlap of the M d center and O 2p center (O P ). The strong interaction of M d and O p facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and activates the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process, thereby enhancing the ORR and OER activity. For ORR, LSNMF exhibited an onset potential of 0.9 V along with a high limiting current of ‚àí8.05 mA cm ‚àí2 . At the same time, for OER at 1 m KOH, LSNMF effectively reached a maximum current density of 3000 mA cm ‚àí2 . Most importantly, the difference between E ORR (at ‚àí1 mA cm ‚àí2 ) and E OER (at 10 mA cm ‚àí2 ), ŒîE is 0.69 V, which stands among the best of recently reported perovskites. The as‚Äêdesigned LSNMF is stable, efficient, lucrative, and a promising candidate for practical application.

The separation of high-purity hydrogen from mixed gasses using dense metallic alloy membranes is essential for advancing a hydrogen-based economy. Palladium-based membranes exhibit outstanding catalytic activity and theoretically infinite hydrogen selectivity, but their high cost and limited performance in contaminant-rich environments restrict their widespread use. This study addresses these limitations by exploring strategies to develop cost-effective, high-performance alternatives. Key challenges include the vast compositional design space, lack of systematic design principles, and the slow pace of traditional material development. This review emphasizes the potential of high-throughput and combinatorial techniques, such as composition-spread alloy films and the statistical design of experiments (DoE), combined with machine learning and materials informatics, to accelerate the discovery, optimization, and characterization of palladium-based membranes. These approaches reduce development time and costs while improving efficiency. Focusing on critical properties such as surface catalytic activity, resistance to chemical and physical stresses, and the incorporation of low-cost base metals, this study introduces domain-specific descriptors to address data scarcity and improve material screening. By integrating computational and experimental methods, future research can identify hidden material correlations and expedite the rational design of next-generation hydrogen separation membranes.

Abstract A polycryst alline ceramic sample of calcium and cobalt co-doped Lanthanum Manganite (LCMCO) was synthesized via the autocombustion route and subjected to comprehensive characterization using various analytical techniques, namely XRD, SEM, FTIR and VSM. The sharp peaks are observed on XRD analysis conducted at room temperature, confirming the formation of single-phase compound with orthorhombic crystal structure and Pbnm space group. The lattice parameters were calculated using the Rietveld refinement tool Fullprof and are as follows: a = 5.4989 √Ö, b = 5.4265 √Ö, and c = 7.7217 √Ö. The XRD data also provided information on interplanar d spacing, atomic locations and other structural factors. Further examination through FESEM affirmed the diverse shapes and sizes of the prepared samples. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy unveiled a broad peak at 615 cm-1, corroborating the presence of metal-oxygen bonds organized into MnO6 octahedral structures. Magnetic studies employing VSM disclosed the antiferromagnetic nature of the prepared samples. The AFM nature and precise lattice structure make this compound a potential candidate for magnetic refrigeration system. Moreover, the diverse morphology along with AFM nature make them suitable for magnetic sensor applications.
