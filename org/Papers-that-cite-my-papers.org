Nanoclusters designed with atomic precision are poised to transform next-generation electrode materials for energy devices due to their exceptional performance. However, traditional computational studies often focus solely on individual nanoclusters, neglecting the impact of structurally diverse, low-energy isomers that coexist in a sample. Herein, we present a data-driven approach to screen late-transition metal-based core-shell nanoclusters for bifunctional electrocatalysis. Utilizing geometric and electronic properties, we establish morphology-based relationships for activity and selectivity, emphasizing the critical role of structural diversity in fuel cell applications. We identify the unique single-cluster catalyst identity of M55 nanoclusters, where intermediate adsorption is primarily governed by the constituent metals' electronic and elemental characteristics. Our findings identified the Au48W7 nanocluster as the most efficient electrocatalyst, exhibiting the lowest bifunctional overpotential of 0.76 V, with ηOER = 0.33 V and ηORR = 0.43 V, highlighting its outstanding catalytic performance at the nano regime. Guided by the Sabatier principle, we highlight the limitations of conventional numerical methods and reshape the activity volcano, transitioning from RuO2 and Pt to Au/Ag-based nanoclusters. Furthermore, the trained ML model enables the screening of electrocatalysts for two- and four-electron pathways, steering selectivity between H2O2 and H2O formation. This study provides intuitive guidelines for designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, redefining activity volcanoes, and modulates selectivity in nanocluster alloys.

ABSTRACT Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is an eco‐friendly chemical with widespread industrial applications. However, the commercial anthraquinone process for H 2 O 2 production is energy‐intensive and environmentally harmful, highlighting the need for more sustainable alternatives. The electrochemical production of H 2 O 2 via the two‐electron water oxidation reaction (2e⁻ WOR) presents a promising route but is often hindered by low efficiency and selectivity, due to the competition with the oxygen evolution reaction. In this study, we employed high‐throughput computational screening and microkinetic modeling to design a series of efficient 2e⁻ WOR electrocatalysts from a library of 240 single‐metal‐embedded nitrogen heterocycle aromatic molecules (M‐NHAMs). These catalysts, primarily comprising post‐transition metals, such as Cu, Ni, Zn, and Pd, exhibit high activity for H 2 O 2 conversion with a limiting potential approaching the optimal value of 1.76 V. Additionally, they exhibit excellent selectivity, with Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 80% at overpotentials below 300 mV. Structure‐performance analysis reveals that the d ‐band center and magnetic moment of the metal center correlated strongly with the oxygen adsorption free energy (), suggesting these parameters as key catalytic descriptors for efficient screening and performance optimization. This study contributes to the rational design of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical production of H 2 O 2 , offering a sustainable solution for green energy and industrial applications.

Artificial photosynthesis provides an efficient strategy for solar energy storage via water splitting and CO2 reduction, but it remains a challenge in tuning artificial photosynthesis between these two competing reactions. Herein, we demonstrate photoinduced conversion of monometallic to bimetallic sites in a Fe-Co nitroprusside (FeCo-NP) to steer the reaction path from H2 evolution to CO2 reduction. Monometallic Co sites achieve efficient H2 production with 28.5 mmol g-1 activity and 85.4% selectivity. Photoinduced release of nitrosyl groups from Fe sites generates bimetallic Fe-Co sites, which suppress H2 evolution and enhance CO2 reduction, yielding 31.5 mmol g-1 activity and 87.3% selectivity for C1 products. Mechanistic investigations reveal that monometallic Co sites catalyze H2 evolution via H2O adsorption and O-H cleavage while bimetallic Fe-Co sites facilitate both H2O and CO2 adsorption and subsequent O and C hydrogenation for CO and HCOOH. This work uncovers a strategy to manipulate competing reaction pathways via photoinduced conversion of monometallic to bimetallic sites, which provides unique insights into addressing environmental issues and energy crises.

The article presents a concept that considers the prospects for the development of architecture as a significant part of an environmentally positive, sustainably functioning city integrated into the environment. At this stage of presenting the problem, such a city is the final stage of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals declared by the UN. The authors give an idea of three basic stages (periods) of urban development, from modernity to the achievement of the Goals, namely: industrial, post-industrial, sustainable. The concept of the principles of relations between cities and the ecological balance of adjacent regions corresponding to these stages is put forward. As a research method that formalizes the nature of the principles of ecological relations between the city and the surrounding region, the paradigm of biology as a science of living nature is taken. According to the chosen paradigm, the problems of integrating the city into the environment are considered from the standpoint of three possible types of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism. For each of the three types of symbiosis, examples of architectural and urban planning concepts are analyzed. A hypothesis is put forward about the current stage of the symbiotic relationship between architecture and the environment. A hypothesis is put forward about the beginning of the process of formation of architectural and urban planning approaches focused on an ecologically positive type of symbiosis of the city and the environment. The definition of a post-industrial city as a city of the transition period is given. A hypothesis is put forward about the basic principles of the formation of the architecture of a post-industrial city. The term "Compensatory-parasitic symbiosis" is proposed, which determines the principles of the functioning of the architecture of the transition period. The term "compensatory-parasitic type of architectural development" should be understood as such a formation of architectural and town-planning objects, in which the most effective compensation for damage caused by the city to the environment takes place.

Developing acid-stable and active ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for facilitating the large-scale applications of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) for hydrogen production. Here, we propose a strain heterogeneity engineering strategy to simultaneously enhance the OER stability and activity of RuO2 electrocatalysts by introducing single-atom platinum (Pt). In a PEM water electrolyzer, the resultant Pt-RuO2 catalyst archives 3 A cm-2 at a low voltage of 1.791 V and maintains a stable performance for over 500 h at 500 mA cm-2. These performance metrics highlight its potential for practical applications. Experiments and calculations analyses confirm that the bulk tensile strain effectively stabilizes the entire structure of electrocatalysts, while the regions of compressive strain are identified as highly active catalytic sites, where the weakened binding energy of oxo-intermediates improves the catalytic activity.

Abstract Proton‐exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) require durable and efficient catalyst supports to overcome the limitations of Pt‐based catalysts and conventional low‐crystalline carbon (LCC) supports, such as high cost, susceptibility to corrosion, and poor electrochemical durability. While highly crystalline carbon (HCC) offers improved stability, its intrinsic hydrophobicity and low defect density hinder Pt nanoparticles (NPs) nucleation and dispersion. In this study, a spin‐on‐dopant (SOD) approach is employed to synthesize phosphorus‐incorporated HCC (HCC P ) providing stable anchoring sites that facilitate uniform Pt NPs distribution. Compared to commercial Pt/LCC, Pt/HCC P exhibits enhanced thermal stability and oxidation resistance, with an oxidation onset temperature ≈90 °C higher. Accelerated durability tests reveal only a 2 mV half‐wave potential shift and a minimal electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss of 1.9% after 20 000 cycles, significantly lower than the 47.1% ECSA loss observed for Pt/LCC. Single‐cell tests further confirm that Pt/HCC P retains 92.4% of its initial power density, outperforming Pt/LCC. The incorporation of phosphorus improves Pt NPs stabilization on the superhydrophobic HCC surface, enhancing Pt utilization and long‐term durability. This study provides valuable insights into the development of high‐performance carbon supports for PEMFC catalysts.

The development of advanced catalysts with innovative nanoarchitectures is critical for addressing energy and environmental challenges such as the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Herein, the synthesis of an innovative copper–sulfur planar structure, Cu–S–BDC, within a metal–organic framework (MOF) catalyst is presented, which demonstrates 100% selectivity toward formate as the sole carbon product. Structural analysis and surface characterizations reveal that Cu–S–BDC exhibits quasi‐2D inorganic building units, with Cu bonded to two S‐CH groups and one BDC linker, while carboxylate groups adopt a bridging coordination mode. This unique arrangement not only imparts remarkable structural stability but also enhances the electronic properties of the MOF, as evidenced by a narrow bandgap of 1.203 eV that facilitates efficient charge transfer and increased electrochemical current density in CORR. Notably, it offers a Faradaic efficiency of 92% for formate at an overpotential as low as −0.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an aqueous electrolyte of 1 m KOH, as well as a current density of −25.8 mA cm 2 at −0.9 V versus RHE, averaged over 24 h of electrolysis. This study highlights a fresh perspective in the field of MOF electrocatalysts by demonstrating that engineering the metal coordination environment can significantly enhance the electronic properties and consequently improve the electrocatalytic performance of these materials.

This review provides an overview of recent advancements in cathode materials for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), focusing on their role in catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This begins with a fundamental discussion of the ORR mechanism, including two‐electron and four‐electron pathways. The review then explores a wide range of electrocatalyst materials, starting with precious metal catalysts, particularly platinum‐based materials, along with alloying strategies and composite structures. This then delves into nonprecious metal catalysts, encompassing metal‐free ORR electrocatalysts, carbon‐supported composite materials (including heteroatom doping and metal‐carbon composites), and transition metal oxides. The review further examines metal phthalocyanines, biomass‐derived catalysts, bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticles supported on carbon matrices, and chalcogenides (oxides, sulfides, and selenides) as ORR electrocatalysts. Advanced materials such as single‐ and dual‐atom catalysts, high‐entropy alloys, and metal organic frameworks derived electrocatalysts are also discussed. We analyze the identification of reaction sites and the effect of structure on catalytic activity. Furthermore, the review covers electrochemical measurements in PEMFCs and explores technological applications and industrial relevance, including products and patents. Finally, this review concludes by addressing future perspectives and challenges in the field of cathode materials for PEMFCs.

Abstract Peroxidase (POD)‐like nanozymes have emerged as effective alternatives to natural enzymes owing to their stability and cost‐effectiveness in biosensors. In particular, single‐atom nanozymes (SAzymes) featuring Fe–N 4 active sites have attracted significant attention for their high catalytic performance. However, their 2D exposed active sites result in limited reaction selectivity and strong pH dependence, restricting their functionality under neutral conditions. This study introduces Ru‐centered SAzymes coordinated out‐of‐plane with chlorine ligands (RuNC_Cl), achieving monofunctional POD‐like activity. RuNC_Cl exhibited remarkable POD‐like activity, which is 38‐fold greater than its catalase (CAT)‐like activity, indicating strong suppression of the competing CAT‐like reaction. Density functional theory calculations and Bader charge analysis of RuNC_Cl reveal that repulsive forces preventing secondary H 2 O 2 adsorption contribute to an increased energy barrier for the CAT‐like reaction. This selective POD‐like activity enables the precise detection of multiple biomarkers through a one‐pot cascade reaction under near‐neutral conditions. This advancement paves the way for the precise regulation of reaction pathways, enhancing the practicality of nanozymes for biosensing and related applications.

Abstract Dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) embedded in nitrogen‐doped graphene have been widely studied for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R), primarily yielding CO. However, achieving selectivity for C1 hydrocarbons remains challenging. Here, 32 Janus DACs (J‐M'M) are designed and investigated for CO 2 R using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, identifying 13 capable of producing methanol and methane. Notably, J‐FeCo and J‐CoNi exhibit favorable limiting potentials (−0.38 and −0.45 V vs. RHE) for CH 3 OH and CH 4 production, respectively, based on constant‐potential calculations. Compared to normal DACs (N‐M'M), Janus DACs demonstrate enhanced initial CO 2 hydrogenation and stronger CO adsorption. Oxygen coordination in J‐FeCo and J‐CoNi induces a downshift/upshift of majority‐/minority‐spin energy levels of d z2 , d yz , and d xz orbitals toward the Fermi level relative to N‐FeCo and N‐CoNi, strengthening the bonding state and weakening the antibonding state, thereby improving CO adsorption. Furthermore, an effective descriptor based on atomic features is identified to evaluate *CO binding strength. This work highlights the critical role of partial oxygen coordination in DACs for C1 hydrocarbons production and proposes a robust descriptor to guide the design of related catalysts.

Abstract Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is a promising approach to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet effectively enhancing the lattice oxygen participation remains a significant challenge. Herein, we aim to enhance the lattice oxygen participation of spinel Co 3 O 4 in OER through introducing rare‐earth europium (Eu) and constructing the [Eu‐O‐Co] unit. The constructed [Eu‐O‐Co] unit facilitates electron donation from Eu to surrounding Co‐O sites, thereby altering the redox sequence of transition metal and lattice oxygen. This structural innovation enables Eu‐Co 3 O 4 to present outstanding OER performance including a low overpotential of 305 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , robust long‐term stability, and high efficiency in rechargeable Zn‐air batteries. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the [Eu‐O‐Co] unit enhances lattice oxygen redox dynamics and enables direct O─O bond formation. The occupied Eu‐4f spin‐up orbitals near the Fermi level play a crucial role in activating highly labile lattice oxygen at Eu‐neighboring oxygen sites, promoting lattice oxygen participation in the non‐concerted proton‐electron transfer process, and lowing the thermodynamically limiting potential of LOM pathway. These findings underscore the importance of rare‐earth elements in modulating lattice oxygen redox dynamics, offering valuable insights for advancing the design of OER catalysts.

In this work, we systematically investigate the structure of Sr and Mg doped lanthanum gallate single crystals using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis revealed the presence of multiple domains with distinct lattice parameters. High-resolution TEM and integrated differential phase contrast imaging captured two regions, one with 90° symmetry and the other with non-90° symmetry. In addition, ordered oxygen vacancies in the non-90° region were revealed, while vacancies in the 90° region were randomly distributed. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy confirmed that the difference in the doping level of the two regions is within the detectability limits. However, the electron energy loss near-edge structure revealed detectable differences in their bonding character.

ABSTRACT Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) with high activity and selectivity are regarded as excellent OER catalysts, but easily corroded under acidic environment. Here, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to design a series of SACs protected by twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) “chainmail.” Charge transfer analysis showed that the carbon layer could serve as an intermediate between transition metal atom and reactants. In addition, rotation operation on bilayer graphene was applied to further enhance the catalytic performance. Thermodynamic free energy diagrams of eight types metal atoms and five rotation angles were systematically discussed. A volcano plot of overpotentials among all the studied single metal atom twisted bilayer graphene catalysts can be described by (). The designed Ni‐tBLG catalyst (rotation angle is 21.8°) exhibited the best performance with the lowest OER overpotential of 0.35 V. These results revealed that the selected single metal atom twisted bilayer graphene catalysts with high activity and stability could be treated as efficient OER catalysts.

ABSTRACT The molecular structure of phenyl‐substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (PSCCA, C 12 H 14 O 2 ; 3‐methyl‐3‐phenylcyclobutane‐1‐carboxylic acid ) was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and X‐ray crystallography techniques. Following structural confirmation, its molecular geometry was optimized at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level. The van der Waals interactions were accurately accounted for using the DFT‐D3 method in the CP2K program. Understanding the adsorption behavior of organic molecules on metal surfaces is of great significance for applications in catalysis, sensor design, surface functionalization, and corrosion prevention. In this context, the adsorption properties of the PSCCA molecule on Al and Cu surfaces were investigated in detail using DFT‐based CP2K calculations. By optimizing different adsorption configurations, the binding energies of the most stable structures were calculated and compared. The obtained results indicate that the PSCCA molecule strongly binds to both Al and Cu surfaces, with a higher adsorption energy on the Al surface compared to the Cu surface. In addition, Mulliken population analysis revealed distinct electronic charge transfer characteristics upon adsorption, with substantially stronger electron transfer observed on the Cu(111) surface due to enhanced d‐band–ligand orbital hybridization. This electronic behavior correlates with the adsorption strength and highlights the critical role of metal electronic structure in governing surface interactions. Electron density difference analyses suggest that PSCCA interacts with both surfaces via a physisorption mechanism. Furthermore, assessments in the context of surface inhibitor efficiency reveal that PSCCA has the potential to passivate active surface regions and hinder surface reactions. Analyses conducted under different pH conditions indicate that the inhibitory effect of PSCCA is particularly pronounced in acidic environments. These findings suggest that PSCCA, exhibiting higher adsorption energy and stability on the Al surface, can be considered an effective protective agent and may play a crucial role in the design of metal–organic interfaces.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the field of atomistic materials simulation, both due to their remarkable accuracy and their computational efficiency compared to established ab initio methods. Very recently, several general purpose MLIPs have been reported, which are broadly applicable across the periodic table. These represent a fascinating opportunity for materials discovery, provided that they are robust and transferable. In order to stress test current general purpose MLIPs, we evaluate the performance of M3GNet and MACE models in element‐substitution based structure prediction workflows for a diverse range of inorganic, crystalline materials. Importantly, these results are compared with a full density functional based workflow, shifting the focus from merely evaluating single‐point energy and force predictions of MLIPs toward an end‐to‐end perspective. We find that general purpose MLIPs are in general well‐suited to accelerate computational materials discovery and structure prediction, but also display certain systematic biases. To address these, a simple metric to quantify MLIP reliability for materials discovery is introduced. As a by‐product, we also predict novel ground state structures for 15 out of 100 analyzed compositions.

In this work, we highlight the need for dynamic workflow managers in self‐driving laboratories (SDLs) and optimizers for Materials Acceleration Platforms (MAPs). While MAPs leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to accelerate materials discovery, static workflow managers limit scalability, and flexibility. We demonstrate the benefits of modular, adaptable orchestrators by integrating PerQueue, a dynamic workflow manager, into a color‐mixing robot, streamlining task coordination and AI‐driven optimization. Additionally, we assess various MAP‐relevant methodologies based on their maturity and readiness for integration. This assessment underlines the importance of flexible workflow managers in advancing SDLs and optimizers, paving the way for more effective future MAP implementations. Achieving seamless integration requires addressing challenges like ensuring data provenance, adhering to findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable principles, and adapting workflows to changing experimental conditions—key elements for the successful deployment of MAPs.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can enable simulations of ab initio accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. However, their effectiveness hinges on the availability of considerable data sets to ensure robust generalization across chemical space and thermodynamic conditions. The generation of such data sets can be labor-intensive, highlighting the need for innovative methods to train MLPs in data-scarce scenarios. Here, we introduce transfer learning of potential energy surfaces between chemically similar elements. Specifically, we leverage the trained MLP for silicon to initialize and expedite the training of an MLP for germanium. Utilizing classical force field and ab initio data sets, we demonstrate that transfer learning surpasses traditional training from scratch in force prediction, leading to more stable simulations and improved temperature transferability. These advantages become even more pronounced as the training data set size decreases. We also observe positive transfer learning effects for most out-of-target properties. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning across chemical elements is a promising technique for developing accurate and numerically stable MLPs, particularly in a data-scarce regime.
