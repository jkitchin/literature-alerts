Enhancing iridium (Ir)-based electrocatalysts to achieve high activity and robust durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic environments has been an ongoing mission in the commercialization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. In this study, we present the synthesis of carbon-supported Ir nanoparticles (NPs) using a modified impregnation method followed by solid-state reduction, with Ir loadings of 20 and 40 wt % on carbon. Among the catalysts, the sample with an Ir loading of 20 wt % synthesized at 1000 °C with a heating rate of 300 °C/h demonstrated the highest mass-normalized OER performance of 1209 A g

Abstract Nigeria currently relies on 80% thermal energy generation. However, studies have shown that less than 60% of the population have access to power. To address this issue, Nigeria has developed an energy transition plan to achieve net-zero emissions by utilizing eco-friendly and sustainable renewable energy sources. However, the effectiveness of renewable energy resources is often hampered by seasonal variations, which limit the amount of energy that can be produced to meet growing demand. One effective solution to this challenge is long-term energy storage, particularly during periods of low demand. Power-to-X (PtX) technology offers a promising approach by enabling long-term sustainable energy generation and storage for future use when renewable energy availability decreases during peak demands. This study critically reviews the latest advancements in renewable PtX technology and evaluates its potential application within Nigeria's energy sector. Furthermore, it explores the potential obstacles to the widespread adoption of PtX technology in Nigeria. Despite Nigeria’s significant potential for implementing PtX initiatives, the country currently falls behind in technology deployment and viable production pathways for sustainable PtX implementation. This shortfall is primarily due to lack of policies, frameworks, and financing schemes to support infrastructural development, especially for long-term energy storage. Given the intermittent nature of renewable energy, a transition strategy that includes adequate storage capacity is crucial. Although green hydrogen, a key component of PtX, has substantial potential as an energy carrier in Nigeria, its immediate use is limited by high production costs. Nonetheless, ongoing efforts to diversify Nigeria’s energy mix through infrastructure and policy developments could eventually establish a roadmap for PtX implementation, promoting long-term energy sustainability and distribution efficiency.

Abstract The development of fuel cells and metal‐air batteries is an important link in realizing a sustainable energy supply and a green environment for the future. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the core reaction of such energy conversion devices. M–N–C catalysts exhibit encouraging ORR catalytic activity and are the most promising candidates for replacing Pt/C. The electrocatalytic performance of M–N–C catalysts is intimately related to the specific metal species and the coordination environment of the central metal atom. Axial coordination engineering presents an avenue for the development of highly active ORR catalysts and has seen considerable progress over the past decade. Nevertheless, the accurate control over the coordination environment and electronic structure of M–N–C catalysts at the atomic scale poses a big challenge. Herein, the diverse axial ligands, characterization techniques, and modulation mechanisms for axial coordination engineering are encompassed and discussed. Furthermore, some pressing matters to be solved and challenges that deserve to be explored and investigated in the future for axial coordination engineering are proposed.

Abstract The incorporation of defects and cocatalysts is known to be effective in improving photocatalytic activity, yet their coupled contribution to the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process has not been well‐explored. In this study, We demonstrate that the incorporation of S vacancies and NiSe can contribute to the improvement of charge separation efficiency via the formation of a strong electric field within the bulk ZnIn 2 S 4 (ZIS) and on its surface. More importantly, We also demonstrate that the synergy of S vacancies and NiSe benefits the overall hydrogen evolution activity by facilitating the H 2 O adsorption and dissociation process. This is particularly important for hydrogen evolution taking place under alkaline conditions where the proton concentration is low, allowing ZISv‐NiSe (containing abundant S vacancies) to outperform ZIS‐NiSe under alkaline conditions. In contrast, under acid conditions, since there are already sufficient amounts of protons available for reaction, the hydrogen evolution activity became governed by the hydrogen adsorption/desorption process rather than the H 2 O dissociation process. This leads to ZIS‐NiSe exhibiting higher activity than ZISv‐NiSe due to its more favorable hydrogen adsorption energy. The findings thus provide insights into how defect and cocatalyst modification strategies can be tailor‐made to improve hydrogen evolution activity under different pH conditions.

Abstract Hybrid nanostructures between biomolecules and inorganic nanomaterials constitute a largely unexplored field of research, with the potential for novel applications in bioimaging, biosensing, and nanomedicine. Developing such applications relies critically on understanding the dynamical properties of the nano–bio interface. This work introduces and validates a strategy to predict atom‐scale interactions between water‐soluble gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and a set of blood proteins (albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulin, and fibrinogen). Graph theory and neural networks are utilized to predict the strengths of interactions in AuNC–protein complexes on a coarse‐grained level, which are then optimized in Monte Carlo‐based structure search and refined to atomic‐scale structures. The training data is based on extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of AuNC–protein complexes, and the validating MD simulations show the robustness of the predictions. This strategy can be generalized to any complexes of inorganic nanostructures and biomolecules provided that one generates enough data about the interactions, and the bioactive parts of the nanostructure can be coarse‐grained rationally.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) technology stands out as a promising energy storage system. However, its journey toward practical implementation is hindered by sluggish sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) kinetics. A free-standing graphene aerogel (GA) combined with a copper-based metal-organic framework (MOF-GA) is fabricated as the sulfur host material for Li-S battery cathodes. The presence of MOF particles assumes a dual role, demonstrating its efficacy not only as a catalyst for the reduction reaction of graphene oxide (GO) but also as an electrochemical catalyst to promote sluggish SRR kinetics. The former amplifies electron transfer kinetics within the electrode, and the latter elevates the overall cell performance. Experimental results and theoretical calculations have proven the catalytic activity of MOF-GA electrodes, leading to a higher sulfur utilization of over 80% and a lower capacity decay of 0.082% per cycle. Under extreme conditions, the Li-S cells show a high initial specific capacity of 1113.0 mAh·g

We describe version 2 of the SPICE data set, a collection of quantum chemistry calculations for training machine learning potentials. It expands on the original data set by adding much more sampling of chemical space and more data on noncovalent interactions. We train a set of potential energy functions called Nutmeg on it. They are based on the TensorNet architecture. They use a novel mechanism to improve performance on charged and polar molecules, injecting precomputed partial charges into the model to provide a reference for the large-scale charge distribution. Evaluation of the new models shows that they do an excellent job of reproducing energy differences between conformations even on highly charged molecules or ones that are significantly larger than the molecules in the training set. They also produce stable molecular dynamics trajectories and are fast enough to be useful for routine simulation of small molecules.

Abstract Synergistic Pd–In 2 O 3 catalysts are promising candidates for producing methanol via CO 2 hydrogenation, and the metal phases in them can be tuned by thermal reduction treatment affecting the catalytic activity significantly. This work presents a comprehensive investigation to gain an insight into the effect of thermal reduction temperature on the variation and interaction of Pd and In 2 O 3 phases supported on CeO 2 (viz., PdIn/CeO 2 ) and their correlations with CO 2 hydrogenation toward methanol synthesis. The findings show that Pd/In‐rich PdIn alloys and In 2 O 3 with relatively strong interaction are key phases (by reducing the PdIn/CeO 2 at 300°C) for promoting methanol formation, leading to a high selectivity to methanol at 78.9% and space–time yield (STY) of 3.6 g CH3OH g PdIn −1 h −1 . A further increase in reduction temperature (from 300 to 500°C) promoted the formation of homogenized PdIn intermetallic alloys with significantly poor ability for H 2 dissociation and CO 2 activation, and hence poor methanol yield.

The adsorption capacities of ion exchangers with the primary amine (Lewatit® VP OC 1065) and polyamine (Diaion™ CR20) functional groups relative to Pd(II) and Cu(II) ions were tested in a batch system, taking into account the influence of the acid concentration (HCl: 0.1–6 mol/L; HCl-HNO3: 0.9–0.1 mol/L HCl—0.1–0.9 mol/L HNO3), phase contact time (1–240 min), initial concentration (10–1000 mg/L), agitation speed (120–180 rpm), bead size (0.385–1.2 mm), and temperature (293–333 K), as well as in a column system where the variable operating parameters were HCl and HNO3 concentrations. There were used the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intraparticle diffusion models to describe the kinetic studies and the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models to describe the equilibrium data to obtain better knowledge about the adsorption mechanism. The physicochemical properties of the ion exchangers were characterized by the nitrogen adsorption/desorption analyses, CHNS analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the sieve analysis, and points of zero charge measurements. As it was found, Lewatit® VP OC 1065 exhibited a better ability to remove Pd(II) than Diaion™ CR20, and the adsorption ability series for heavy metals was as follows: Pd(II) >> Zn(II) ≈ Ni(II) >> Cu(II). The optimal experimental conditions for Pd(II) sorption were 0.1 mol/L HCl, agitation speed 180 rpm, temperature 293 K, and bead size fraction 0.43 mm ≤ f3 < 0.6 mm for Diaion™ CR20 and 0.315–1.25 mm for Lewatit® VP OC 1065. The maximum adsorption capacities were 289.68 mg/g for Lewatit® VP OC 1065 and 208.20 mg/g for Diaion™ CR20. The greatest adsorption ability of Lewatit® VP OC 1065 for Pd(II) was also demonstrated in the column studies. The working ion exchange in the 0.1 mol/L HCl system was 0.1050 g/mL, much higher compared to Diaion™ CR20 (0.0545 g/mL). The best desorption yields of %D1 = 23.77% for Diaion™ CR20 and 33.57% for Lewatit® VP OC 1065 were obtained using the 2 mol/L NH3·H2O solution.

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising materials for electrochemical energy applications due to their excellent catalytic performance and durability. However, the controlled synthesis of HEAs with a well-defined structure and a uniform composition distribution remains a challenge. Herein, a soft template-assisted electrodeposition technique is used to fabricate a mesoporous HEA (m-HEA) film with a uniform composition distribution of Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, and Cu, providing a suitable platform for investigating structure-performance relationships. Electrochemical deposition enables the uniform nucleation and grain growth of m-HEA, which can be deposited onto many conductive substrates. The m-HEA film exhibits an enhanced mass activity of 4.2 A mg

Abstract The strategic manipulation of the interaction between a central metal atom and its coordinating environment in single-atom catalysts (SACs) is crucial for catalyzing the CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). However, it remains a major challenge. While density-functional theory calculations serve as a powerful tool for catalyst screening, their time-consuming nature poses limitations. This paper presents a machine learning (ML) model based on easily accessible intrinsic descriptors to enable rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput screening of efficient SACs in complex systems. Our ML model comprehensively captures the influences of interactions between 3 and 5d metal centers and 8 C, N-based coordination environments on CO 2 RR activity and selectivity. We reveal the electronic origin of the different activity trends observed in early and late transition metals during coordination with N atoms. The extreme gradient boosting regression model shows optimal performance in predicting binding energy and limiting potential for both HCOOH and CO production. We confirm that the product of the electronegativity and the valence electron number of metals, the radius of metals, and the average electronegativity of neighboring coordination atoms are the critical intrinsic factors determining CO 2 RR activity. Our developed ML models successfully predict several high-performance SACs beyond the existing database, demonstrating their potential applicability to other systems. This work provides insights into the low-cost and rational design of high-performance SACs.

Continuous-flow catalysis bridges the gap between bench-scale laboratories and production-scale factories and thus should be a green and promising technology for the manufacture of value-added chemicals. Here, we present the construction of a continuous-flow catalytic system by integrating a tubular reactor with novel catalytic fibers, which are comprised of single-atomic Pd (Pd

Abstract Transition metal oxides are state-of-the-art materials for catalysing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whose slow kinetics currently limit the efficiency of water electrolysis. However, microscale physicochemical heterogeneity between particles, dynamic reactions both in the bulk and at the surface, and an interplay between particle reactivity and electrolyte makes probing the OER challenging. Here, we overcome these limitations by applying state-of-the-art compressive Raman imaging to uncover concurrent bias-dependent pathways for the OER in a dense, crystalline electrocatalyst, α-Li 2 IrO 3 . By spatially and temporally tracking changes in stretching modes we follow catalytic activation and charge accumulation following ion exchange under various electrolytes and cycling conditions, comparing our observations with other crystalline catalysts (IrO 2 , LiCoO 2 ). We demonstrate that at low overpotentials the reaction between water and the oxidized catalyst surface is compensated by bulk ion exchange, as usually only found for amorphous, electrolyte permeable, catalysts. At high overpotentials the charge is compensated by surface redox active sites, as in other crystalline catalysts such as IrO 2 . Hence, our work reveals charge compensation can extend beyond the surface in crystalline catalysts. More generally, the results highlight the power of compressive Raman imaging for chemically specific tracking of microscale reaction dynamics in catalysts, battery materials, or memristors.

Abstract Developing metal‐free carbon catalysts is critical to achieve the electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) via two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) using seawater as electrolyte. Herein, N‐rich doped carbon (NC) is synthesized by directly pyrolyzing guanine as both N and C sources, which can facilitate the formation of ultrahigh‐N dopant (up to 33.89 at.%), and their ratios. The NC obtained at 700 °C with hydrogenated pyridine‐N and pyrrole‐N (3:2) dopants exhibits a superior selectivity of H 2 O 2 (up to 96%), high mass activity of 545.5 A g −1 at 0.2 V versus RHE and stable production of H 2 O 2 with 16.8 in 0.5 M NaCl. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectrum analysis proves that hydrogenated pyridine‐N and pyrrole‐N dopants play a critical role in constructing metal‐free active sites for the synthesis of H 2 O 2 . Meanwhile, theoretical calculations further reveal that compared to non‐hydrogenated N dopants, hydrogenated pyridine and pyrrole N can tune the projected density of states of 2p z orbitals of their adjacent carbon atoms approaching Fermi Level, enhancing * OOH to H 2 O 2 through 2e − ORR rather than H 2 O via 4e − ORR. This work provides new insights for developing metal‐free catalysts for efficient electrosynthesis of H 2 O 2 using seawater resources as promising electrolytes.
