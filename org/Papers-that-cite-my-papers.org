Abstract Hydrogen (H2) is considered the most promising clean energy source to replace conventional fossil fuels. Despite the exceptional catalytic activity of Pt-group metals, the high cost and relatively low durability of these noble metal-based catalysts remain key bottlenecks for sustainable hydrogen production at the industrial scale. In this report, we synthesized a new type of MXene, tungsten titanium carbide (W2TiC2). By loading cobalt (Co) onto the surface of W2TiC2, we developed a highly effective and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimized catalyst exhibited a small overpotential of 62.58 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a low Tafel slope of 44.34 mV/dec. At high current density of 100 mA/cm2 and 1000 mA/cm2, the low overpotentials of 191.18 mV and 407.72 mV were achieved, significantly outperforming the commercial Pt/C electrode. Under both current ranges, our catalyst exhibited excellent stability of 500 h at 10 mA/cm2 and for 100 h at 1000 mA/cm2 without any obvious degradation. In flow cell tests, by pairing with Ni foam, our catalyst also required much lower cell voltage than commercial Ni foam||Pt/C and maintained ~ 100% H2 faradaic efficiency over the 15h continuous tests from 100 to 400 mA/cm2. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) demonstrated a temperature induced redistribution of Co on MXenes from single sites and large nanoparticles (NPs) to uniform small NPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), revealed that the HER activity was sensitive to the coordination environment of Co on W2TiC2, and the Co-W interface is the likely HER active site . This work sheds light on structure design and utilization of metal-support interaction (MSI) in MXene-supported metal catalysts for the efficient electrochemical water splitting at industrial scale.

Forced by the problems of severe energy crisis, it is urgent to explore high efficiency sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies, particularly for electrolytic water devices and rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The efficiency of these two devices is mainly dominated by the half-reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The design of efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is the key for the development of water splitting and rechargeable ZABs. The antiperovskites as a promising family of electrocatalyst with structure flexibility, high electrical conductivity, and excellent electrocatalytic properties. Defining the enhancement mechanism toward HER, OER, and ORR is an urgent problem for the application of antiperovskite in the electrocatalysis field. This review brief introduces the fundamentals of HER/OER/ORR and summarizes the recent progress of antiperovskite materials in electrocatalysis field, including the research on structural regulation strategies of catalytic properties and catalytic mechanism. Based on ex situ/in situ characterized of electrocatalytic mechanism, the future challenges of antiperovskite in electrocatalytic mechanism and intrinsic modulation were prospected. The basic frontier issues are aimed in the field of HER/OER/ORR to provide theoretical guidance for the development of efficient and economical multifunctional electrocatalysts for ZAB and water splitting.

Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) supported single transition metal (TM) atom (TM1/POM) as an efficient soluble redox mediator for Li–O2 batteries is comprehensively investigated by first-principles calculations. Among the pristine POM and four kinds of TM1/POM (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt), Co1/POM not only maintains good structural and thermodynamic stability in oxidized and reduced states but also exhibits promising electro(chemical) catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li–O2 batteries with the lowest Gibbs free energy barriers. Further investigations demonstrate that the moderate binding strength of Li2-xO2 (x = 0, 1, and 2) intermediates on Co1/POM guarantees favorable Li2O2 formation and decomposition. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the introduced Co single atom as an electron transfer bridge can not only efficiently improve the electronic conductivity of POM but also regulate the bonding/antibonding states around the Fermi level of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox. The solvent effect on the OER catalytic performance and the electronic properties of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox with and without dimethyl sulfoxide solvent are also investigated.

Abstract Renewable energy‐driven proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) attracts widespread attention as a zero‐emission and sustainable technology. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with sluggish OER kinetics and rapid deactivation are major obstacles to the widespread commercialization of PEMWE. To date, although various advanced electrocatalysts have been reported to enhance acidic OER performance, Ru/Ir‐based nanomaterials remain the most promising catalysts for PEMWE applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient, stable, and cost‐effective Ru/Ir catalysts. Since the structure‐performance relationship is one of the most important tools for studying the reaction mechanism and constructing the optimal catalytic system. In this review, the recent research progress from the construction of unsaturated sites to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction and deactivation mechanism of catalysts is summarized. First, a general understanding of OER reaction mechanism, catalyst dissolution mechanism, and active site structure is provided. Then, advances in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER catalysts are reviewed in terms of the classification of unsaturated active site design, i.e., alloy, core‐shell, single‐atom, and framework structures. Finally, challenges and perspectives are presented for the future development of OER catalysts and renewable energy technologies for hydrogen production.

Electrochemical H2 generation and CO2 reduction address the energy and environmental crisis plaguing the world. An efficient electrocatalyst would require the lowest overpotential for these reactions. Given its position on the volcano plot near platinum, palladium presents itself as a viable alternative for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the activity is limited by a high overpotential. It is also a good electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to the favorable position of the d-band center. Nevertheless, the CO poisoning of the active site results in low electrocatalytic stability. Herein, we report a Ni-incorporated palladium catalyst, NiPd, which reduces water to H2 at a very low overpotential of 25 mV (η10). Furthermore, it reduces CO2 to formate with a very high faradaic efficiency of 97% at a potential of −0.25 V (vs RHE). DFT studies show that Ni inclusion leads to the facile activation of CO2 due to a bent adsorption configuration at the catalyst surface. The NiPd catalyst exhibits a strong and stable performance for HER (400 h) as well as for CO2RR (9 h) with high structural integrity as proven by postreaction characterization studies.

Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production via two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ‐ORR) features energy‐saving and eco‐friendly characteristics, making it a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. However, the common existence of numerous 2e − ‐ORR‐inactive sites/species on electrocatalysts tends to catalyze side reactions, especially under low potentials, which compromises energy efficiency and limits H 2 O 2 yield. Addressing this, a high surface density of mono‐species pyrrolic nitrogen configurations is formed over a polypyrrole@carbon nanotube composite. Thermodynamic and kinetic calculation and experimental investigation collaboratively confirm that these densely distributed and highly selective active sites effectively promote high‐rate 2e − ‐ORR electrocatalysis and inhibit side reactions over a wide potential range. Consequently, an ultra‐high and stable H 2 O 2 yield of up to 67.9/51.2 mol g −1 h −1 has been achieved on this material at a current density of 200/120 mA cm −1 , corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 72.8/91.5%. A maximum H 2 O 2 concentration of 13.47 g L −1 can be accumulated at a current density of 80 mA cm −1 with satisfactory stability. The strategy of surface active site densification thus provides a promising and universal avenue toward designing highly active and efficient electrocatalysts for 2e − ‐ORR as well as a series of other similar electrochemical processes.

We explore the phonon transport properties of defect-laden bilayer PtSTe using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on a neural-network force field. Defects prove very efficient at depressing the thermal conductivity of the structure, and flower defects have a particularly powerful effect, comparable to that of double vacancies. Furthermore, the conductivity of the structure with flower defects exhibits an unusual temperature dependence due to structural instability at high temperatures. We look into the distortion to normal modes around the defect by means of the projected phonon density of states and find diverse phenomena including localized modes and blue shifts.

The development of transition metal-based catalytic platforms that promote bioorthogonal reactions inside living cells remains a major challenge in chemical biology. This is particularly true for palladium-based catalysts, which are very powerful in organic synthesis but perform poorly in the cellular environment, mainly due to their rapid deactivation. We now demonstrate that grafting Pd(II) complexes into engineered β-sheets of a model WW domain results in cell-compatible palladominiproteins that effectively catalyze depropargylation reactions inside HeLa cells. The concave shape of the WW domain β-sheet proved particularly suitable for accommodating the metal center and protecting it from rapid deactivation in the cellular environment. A thorough NMR and computational study confirmed the formation of the metal-stapled peptides and allowed us to propose a three-dimensional structure for this novel metalloprotein motif.

Due to the environmental deterioration caused by modern industrialization, the key focus of researchers worldwide is diverted toward clean and sustainable energy sources, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries, where the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode plays a central role. Unfortunately, the sluggish kinetics at the cathode of the ORR, in which the platinum-based (Pt-based) catalyst plays a critical role, is the principal impediment to commercialization. Pt and Pt-based, cutting-edge ORR electrocatalysts suffer from high cost, low methanol tolerance, and poor stability. Researchers have made tremendous efforts towards substitution of Pt-based catalysts, and significant achievements were accomplished in the form of alternatives such as metal oxides, nitrides, chalcogenides, carbides, metal-free nanocarbon, and metal-nitrogen/carbon (M-N/C) nanocomposites. Among these innumerable substitutes of Pt-based catalysts, M-N/C shows great potential because of their high stability, high methanol tolerance, and admirable ORR activities. In this review, we have summarized the principles and factors determining the rate of ORR, which are related to different surface planes of the crystal, surface area, and electronic structure tunability, where the morphology, multiple heteroatom-doping, and controlled particle size play a vital role. Furthermore, we have also discussed the synthetic protocol of different ORR materials such as Pt-based, metal chalcogenides, metal oxides, and M-N/C nanocomposites and the challenges related to these materials. Hopefully, this review will provide a status update as well as new directions to the scientific community engaged in designing novel catalytic materials for energy and environmental applications.

An effective strategy using d-block metal hybridization was proposed to induce electronic interaction and promote the synergistic effect, aiming to enhance the OER performance of cost-effective spinel LiMn2O4. Indeed, we deploy a series of LiNixMn2-xO4 catalysts substituted with Ni, yielding the increase of Mn valence states from Mn3.5+ to Mn4+. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 catalyst achieved an excellent OER performance in alkaline media, with an overpotential reduction more than 320 mV at 10 mA cm-2 compared to the unsubstituted LiMn2O4, as well as the electrochemical stability. It was shown to be superior to most reported Mn-based oxide OER electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that Ni dopes holes in the Mn site, leading to an increase in Mn4+, and that the shared covalent network of Ni 3d-O 2p-Mn 3d optimized an easier desorption of intermediates. These results pave a new example for modulating the chemisorption strength, thus enabling activating the activity and stability of the OER process for cost-effective electrocatalysts based on spinel Mn oxides.

Intermetallic Pt-based nanoparticles have displayed excellent activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize highly atomically ordered Pt-based nanoparticle catalysts because the formation of an atomically ordered structure usually requires high-temperature annealing accompanied by grain sintering. Here we report the direct epitaxial growth of well-aligned, highly atomically ordered Pt3Fe and PtFe nanoparticles (< 5 nm) on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) bundle films. The long-range periodically symmetric van der Waals (vdW) interactions between SWCNT bundles and Pt-Fe nanoparticles play an important role in promoting not only the alignment ordering of inter-nanoparticles but also the atomic ordering of intra-nanoparticles. The ordered Pt3Fe/SWCNT hybrid catalyst showed enhanced ORR catalytic performance of 2.3-fold higher mass activity and 3.1-fold higher specific activity than commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the formation of an interlocked interface and strong vdW interaction endow the Pt-Fe/SWCNT catalysts with extreme long-term stability in potential cycling and excellent anti-thermal sintering ability.

Abstract This work utilizes defect engineering, heterostructure, pyridine N‐doping, and carbon supporting to enhance cobalt‐nickel selenide microspheres' performance in the oxygen electrode reaction. Specifically, microspheres mainly composed of CoNiSe 2 and Co 9 Se 8 heterojunction rich in selenium vacancies (V Se· ) wrapped with nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes (p‐CoNiSe/NCNT@CC) are prepared by Ar/NH 3 radio frequency plasma etching technique. The synthesized p‐CoNiSe/NCNT@CC shows high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance (half‐wave potential (E 1/2 ) = 0.878 V and limiting current density (J L ) = 21.88 mA cm −2 ). The J L exceeds the 20 wt% Pt/C (19.34 mA cm −2 ) and the E 1/2 is close to the 20 wt% Pt/C (0.881 V). It also possesses excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (overpotential of 324 mV@10 mA cm −2 ), which even exceeds that of the commercial RuO 2 (427 mV@10 mA cm −2 ). The density functional theory calculation indicates that the enhancement of ORR performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of plasma‐induced V Se· and the CoNiSe 2 ‐Co 9 Se 8 heterojunction. The p‐CoNiSe/NCNT@CC electrode assembled Zinc‐air batteries (ZABs) show a peak power density of 138.29 mW cm −2 , outperforming the 20 wt% Pt/C+RuO 2 (73.9 mW cm −2 ) and other recently reported catalysts. Furthermore, all‐solid‐state ZAB delivers a high peak power density of 64.83 mW cm −2 and ultra‐robust cycling stability even under bending.

Abstract The size of in situ exsolved nanoparticles (NPs) significantly affects the electrochemical and electro‐catalytic properties of oxide supports. Unfortunately, the instrumental factor affecting the exsolved NP size in poly‐crystalline perovskite oxides is still unexplored. Herein, the inherent micro‐strain (ε) value as an unprecedented factor in controlling the exsolved NP size of Pr 0.5 Ba 0.5‐ x Sr x Fe 0.85 Ni 0.15 O 3‐ δ ( x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) is introduced, wherein smaller NP size is successfully obtained via strain relaxation strategy. The effect of exsolved NP size on the fuel oxidation reaction kinetics at high‐temperature regimes is evaluated in‐depth by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In accordance with the insights provided by DFT calculations, the electro‐catalyst featuring the smallest Fe 3 Ni NP size via strain relaxation strategy demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance along with robust durability toward high‐temperature hydrogen oxidation reaction. This work presents scientific guidance for tailoring the exsolved NP size in perovskites, thereby paving the way for designing rational perovskite electro‐catalysts in various energy‐related applications.

The effective conversion of CO2 to methanol utilizing green hydrogen under moderate conditions represents a promising approach for achieving carbon neutrality. MoS2 demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance at temperatures below 200 °C, however, generating in-plane sulfur defects is challenging due to the intact planar structure. Introducing heteroatoms to induce sulfur vacancy formation and modulate their chemical environment remains a significant obstacle. In this study, we developed a NaCl-assisted method for synthesizing MoS2 and discovered that a small quantity of sodium not only promotes the formation of sulfur vacancies during the induction period, but also encourages CO2 hydrogenation via the carboxylate route, as opposed to the CO2 dissociation to CO* route over non-modified sulfur vacancies. Furthermore, catalysts at various stages throughout the 60 h induction period were characterized, revealing that the increase in sulfur vacancies and enhanced H2 dissociation capability are primary factors contributing to improved methanol yield. The sodium-modified MoS2 achieves a methanol space–time yield of up to 571 mgMeOH gcat−1h−1 at 200 °C and 5 MPa with a 4.8 % CO2 conversion and 96 % methanol selectivity. The turnover frequency based on total sulfur vacancies reaches 170 h−1. This research is anticipated to offer a new strategy for enhancing the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using heteroatom-assisted defect engineering.

Photocatalytic water splitting to spontaneously produce H2 and O2 is a long-standing goal in solar energy conversion, presenting a significant challenge without using sacrificial electron donors or external biases. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the design of artificial Z-scheme photocatalytic systems is at the forefront of this field. These systems achieve higher redox potential by separating photogenerated electrons and holes through a fast interlayer recombination process between valence and conduction band edges. Z-scheme photocatalysis involves using two different semiconductors with distinct bandgap energies. Here, we explore potential systems based on two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures composed of carbon, nitrogen, or similar main group elements. The advantages and disadvantages of these systems are discussed, with a focus on enhancing their efficiency through strategic design. Special emphasis is placed on the dynamics of excited charge carrier transfer and recombination processes, which are crucial for developing efficient photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting.

Abstract Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have been hailed as a promising hydrogen energy technology due to high energy conversion efficiency, zero carbon emission and the potential independence on scare and expensive noble metal electrocatalysts. A variety of platinum group metal (PGM)‐free catalysts has been developed with superior catalytic performance to noble metal benchmarks toward cathodic oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). However, PGM electrocatalysts still dominate the anodic catalyst research because the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) are two or three orders of magnitude slower than in that acidic media. Therefore, it is urgently desirable to improve noble metal utilization efficiency and/or develop high‐performance PGM‐free electrocatalysts for HOR, thus promoting the real‐world implementation of AEMFCs. In this review, the current research progress of electrocatalysts for HOR in alkaline media is summarized. We start with the discussion on the current HOR reaction mechanisms and existing controversies. Then, methodologies to improve the HOR performance are reviewed. Following these principles, the recently developed HOR electrocatalysts including PGM and PGM‐free HOR electrocatalysts in alkaline media are systematically introduced. Finally, we put forward the challenges and prospects in the field of HOR catalysis.

We report the free energy barriers for the elementary reactions in the 2e− and 4e− oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) steps on Au(100) in an alkaline solution. Due to the weak adsorption energy of O2 on Au(100), the barrier for the association channel is very low, and the 2e− pathway is clearly favored, while the barrier for the O–O dissociation channel is significantly higher at 0.5 eV. Above 0.7 V reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the association channel becomes thermodynamically unfavorable, which opens up the O–O dissociation channel, leading to the 4e− pathway. The low adsorption energy of oxygenated species on Au is now an advantage, and residue ORR current can be observed up to the 1.0–1.2 V region (RHE). In contrast, the O–O dissociation barrier on Au(111) is significantly higher, at close to 0.9 eV, due to coupling with surface reorganization, which explains the lower ORR activity on Au(111) than that on Au(100). In combination with the previously suggested outer sphere electron transfer to O2 for its initial adsorption, these results provide a consistent explanation for the features in the experimentally measured polarization curve for the alkaline ORR on Au(100) and demonstrate an ORR mechanism distinct from that on Pt(111). It also highlights the importance to consider the spin state of O2 in ORR and to understand the activation barriers, in addition to the adsorption energies, to account for the features observed in electrochemical measurements.

Abstract Photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) use solar energy to generate green hydrogen by water splitting and have an integrated device structure. Achieving high solar‐to‐hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency along with a long operational lifetime in these cells is crucial for the production of low‐cost green hydrogen as a viable energy source. Several functional components, such as photo absorber, charge transport, and catalyst layers are interfaced in these cells to form a compact monolithic device. In this review, therefore, the engineering and design of the individual components of these cells, the interplay between them, and their interfaces are discussed in detail, as these factors determine the overall performance of the cells. The main emphasis is on halide perovskite (HP) photo absorbers, which have emerged as promising materials for use in these cells due to their superior optoelectronic properties. Recent advances in the development of efficient and stable perovskite‐based cells are highlighted and reviewed. The design of catalysts for water splitting and the effect of factors such as pH and supporting cations are also examined. Finally, the scientific challenges and future directions for designing perovskite‐based photoelectrochemical cells are discussed. This review can help researchers further advance this technology toward commercial production of green hydrogen.

Efficient and stable Pt-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are indispensable for future fuel cells. Herein, we describe a heterostructure of Pd nanocrystals (PdNCs) on N-doped Ag nanowires (NWs) synthesized using a direct epitaxial growth strategy with a Pd loading of only 9.5 wt.%. The PdAg bimetallic heterostructure showed the highest mass activity among reported PdAg-based ORR electrocatalysts and exhibited excellent stability, with only a 1.5 mV decay in the half-wave potential even after 20000 cycles of continuous testing. The remarkably enhanced activity and durability can be attributed to the distinct advantages of the ultrasmall PdNCs, cocatalysts of N-doped AgNWs, and their heterointerfaces. This work reveals that the epitaxial growth of a heterostructure on a stable support is a promising strategy for promoting catalytic performance.

Density functional theory (DFT) modeling has been useful to electrocatalyst research, yet simulating the complexities of the electrode–electrolyte interface hinders progress in understanding reaction mechanisms and the underlying kinetics. Though many approaches to incorporating electrochemical double layer (EDL) features in DFT calculations have been developed, uncertainty in interfacial solvent properties and the distribution of ions leave the impact of the EDL on electrocatalytic kinetics unclear. Elucidating the sensitivity of DFT predictions to the EDL properties and model is crucial. Herein, we use an analytical Grand Canonical DFT framework (aGC-DFT) to quantify the sensitivity of potential-dependent activation energies to parameters of the EDL, incorporating a Helmholtz EDL model with varying dielectric constant (εr) and EDL width (d). We compute the activation barriers for OC–H, CO–H, and OC–CO bond formation from CO* on Cu. These elementary reactions are critical within the heavily debated reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction and are likely to impact overall activity and product selectivity. We show the aGC-DFT method produces consistent results with explicit GC-DFT calculations, while enabling probing of the EDL model sensitivity at a much lower computational cost. Reaction steps with significant dipole moment changes (i.e., CO–H bond formation) are highly sensitive to the chosen EDL parameters, such that the relative barriers of the OC–H, CO–H, and OC–CO bond formation steps depend significantly on EDL properties. Without knowledge of the interfacial properties of the EDL, there is substantial uncertainty in activation barriers and elementary reaction rates within a DFT analysis of electrocatalytic kinetics.

Abstract Doping light elements in Pt‐group metals is an effective approach toward improving their catalytic properties for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it is challenging to control dopant sites and to establish the correlation between the doping site and the catalytic property. In this paper, this success is demonstrated in controlling N doping sites in Pd metallene to manipulate electrocatalytic properties toward ORR. A Pd metallene sample with N dopant predominantly located at the atomic vacancy site (V‐N‐Pd metallene) exhibits two times higher mass activity in ORR than a Pd metallene sample with N dopant mainly occupied the interstitial site (I‐N‐Pd metallene). However, the I‐N‐Pd metallene shows improved durability than the V‐N‐Pd metallene, with only a 4 mV decay in half‐wave potential after 20 000 cycles. Computational calculation results reveal that the significantly enhanced ORR activity of V‐N‐Pd metallene arises from the atomic vacancy‐doped N, which modulates the electronic structure of Pd metallene to weaken the adsorption energy of intermediate O * species. This work provides guidelines for manipulating catalytic properties by controlling the doping sites of light elements in metal nanostructures.

Solid–water interfaces are ubiquitous in nature and technology. In particular, technologies evolving in the green transition, such as electrocatalysis, heavily rely on the junction of an electrolyte and an electrode as a central part of the device. For the understanding of atomic-scale processes taking place at the electrolyte–electrode interface, density functional theory (DFT) has become the de facto standard. The validation of DFT’s ability to simulate the interfacial solid/water interaction is crucial, and ideal simulation setups need to be identified in order to prevent avoidable systematic errors. Here, we develop a rigorous sampling protocol for benchmarking the adsorption/desorption energetics of water on metallic surfaces against experimental temperature programmed desorption, single crystal adsorption calorimetry, and thermal energy atom scattering. We screened DFT’s quality on a series of transition metal surfaces, applying three of the most common exchange–correlation approximations: PBE-D3, RPBE-D3, and BEEF-vdW. We find that all three xc-functionals reflect the pseudo-zeroth order desorption of water rooted in the combination of attractive adsorbate–adsorbate interactions and their saturation at low and intermediate coverages, respectively. However, both RPBE-D3 and BEEF-vdW lead to more accurate water adsorption strengths, while PBE-D3 clearly overbinds near-surface water. We relate the variations in binding strength to specific variations in water–metal and water–water interactions, highlighting the structural consequences inherent in an uninformed choice of simulation parameters. Our study gives atomistic insight into water’s complex adsorption equilibrium. Furthermore, it represents a guideline for future DFT-based simulations of solvated solid interfaces by providing an assessment of systematic errors in specific setups.

The adsorption/desorption of OH∗ on electrode surfaces is pivotal in numerous electrocatalytic reactions. To understand the effect of electrolyte pH on that process, in this work, an advanced approach combining ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) with free energy perturbation is employed to calculate the dehydrogenation free energy of water chemisorbed at differently electrified Pt(111)/electrolyte interfaces. Our findings reveal that the onset potential for OH∗ formation shifts negatively as the pH increases at low pH condition (pH<4.3), aligning with the cyclic voltammetry curves observed in experimental studies. It indicates the dissociation of chemisorbed water is the primary route for OH∗ adsorption at low pH condition. Furthermore, it is also found that the variation in dehydrogenation energy across different pH is primarily due to the local hydrogen bonding network surrounding the chemisorbed water. In addition, it is proposed that at high pH conditions OH− oxidation emerges as the primary route for OH∗ adsorption on Pt(111) constrained by the water chemisorption process. This work provides crucial insights into the pH-dependent adsorption behavior of OH∗ on the Pt(111) surface and aims to guide the optimization of electrolytes to boost the efficiency of related reactions.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a vital role in many next-generation electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, motivating the search for low-cost ORR electrocatalysts possessing high activity and excellent durability. In this work, we demonstrate that iron–cobalt phosphide (FeCoP) nanoparticles encapsulated in a N-doped carbon framework (FeCoP@NC) represent a very promising catalyst for the ORR in alkaline media. The core–shell structured FeCoP@NC catalyst offered outstanding ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.86 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and excellent stability in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming commercial Pt/C and many recently reported noble-metal-free ORR electrocatalysts. The superiority of FeCoP@NC as an ORR electrocatalyst relative to Pt/C was further verified in prototype zinc-air batteries (ZABs), with the aqueous and flexible ZABs prepared using FeCoP@NC offering excellent stability, impressive open circuit voltages (1.56 and 1.44 V, respectively), and high maximum power densities (183.5 and 69.7 mW cm–2, respectively). Density functional theory calculations revealed that encapsulating FeCoP nanoparticles in N-doped carbon shells resulted in favorable electron penetration effects, which synergistically regulated the adsorption/desorption of ORR intermediates for optimal ORR performance while also boosting the electronic conductivity. Our findings offer valuable new insights for rational design of transition metal phosphide-based catalysts for the ORR and other electrochemical applications.

Abstract Despite successful use in a wide variety of disciplines for data analysis and prediction, machine learning (ML) methods suffer from a lack of understanding of the reliability of predictions due to the lack of transparency and black-box nature of ML models. In materials science and other fields, typical ML model results include a significant number of low-quality predictions. This problem is known to be particularly acute for target systems which differ significantly from the data used for ML model training. However, to date, a general method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) of ML predictions has not been available. Focusing on the intuitive and computationally efficient similarity-based UQ, we show that a simple metric based on Euclidean feature space distance and sampling density together with the decorrelation of the features using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization allows effective separation of the accurately predicted data points from data points with poor prediction accuracy. To demonstrate the generality of the method, we apply it to light GBM machine learning using a set of time series tabular data sets. We also show that this metric is a more effective UQ tool than the standard approach of using the average distance of k nearest neighbors (k = 1–10) in features space for similarity evaluation. The computational simplicity of this dataset combined with its applicability to time series datasets allows it to be readily used in numerous real world problems.

In industrial production, there are many problems concerning the experimental design of product performance. This kind of problem can be translated into the problem of studying the product performance boundary through binary response modeling. Collecting data through simulation for such experiments is computationally expensive, and conditions and time are limited. Therefore, a sequential experimental design method based on binary response prediction is proposed by collecting as little data as possible to achieve the purpose of the experiment. The initial experimental scheme is generated by the Maximum Projected Coordinate Exchange (MP-CE) algorithm, and the sequential process is combined with the local criterion based on the binary response prediction boundary and the global optimization method for sampling. Example verification results show that the proposed method is superior to random sampling and space-filled sampling. In addition, sensitivity analysis and some algorithm parameters are discussed.
