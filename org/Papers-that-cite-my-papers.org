Abstract The solar‐driven overall water splitting (2H 2 O→2H 2 + O 2 ) is considered as one of the most promising strategies for reducing carbon emissions and meeting energy demands. However, due to the sluggish performance and high H 2 cost, there is still a big gap for the current photocatalytic systems to meet the requirements for practical sustainable H 2 production. Economic feasibility can be attained through simultaneously generating products of greater value than O 2 , such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 , 2H 2 O→H 2 + H 2 O 2 ). Compared with overall water splitting, this approach is more kinetically feasible and generates more high‐value products of H 2 and H 2 O 2 . In several years, there has been an increasing surge in exploring the possibility and substantial progress has been achieved. In this review, a concise overview of the importance and underlying principles of PIWS is first provided. Next, the reported typical photocatalysts for PIWS are discussed, including commonly used semiconductors and cocatalysts, essential design features of these photocatalysts, and connections between their structures and activities, as well as the selected approaches for enhancing their stability. Then, the techniques used to quantify H 2 O 2 and the operando characterization techniques that can be employed to gain a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanisms are summarized. Finally, the current existing challenges and the direction needing improvement are presented. This review aims to provide a thorough summary of the most recent research developments in PIWS and sets the stage for future advancements and discoveries in this emerging area.

Hydrogen generation via photoelectrochemical (PEC) overall water splitting is an attractive means of renewable energy production so developing and designing the cost-effective and high-activity bifunctional PEC catalysts both for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been focused on. Based on first-principles calculations, we propose a feasible strategy to enhance either HER or OER performance in the monoclinic exposed BiVO4 (110) facet by the introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ovacs). Our results show that oxygen vacancies induce charge rearrangements, which enhances charge transfer between active sites and adatoms. Furthermore, the incorporation of oxygen vacancies reduces the work function of the system, which makes charge transfer from the inner to the surface more easily; thus, the charges possess stronger redox capacity. As a result, the Ovac reduces both the hydrogen adsorption-free energy (ΔGH*) for the HER and the overpotential for the OER, facilitating the PEC activity of overall water splitting. The findings provide not only a method to develop bifunctional PEC catalysts based on BiVO4 but also insight into the mechanism of enhanced catalytic performance.

The chemical coupling of molybdenum carbide (Mo 2 C) to cobalt (Co) promotes oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics on the Co surface by making the surface more electrophilic. Here, to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of the surface electrophilic properties on the OER kinetics of Co and to obtain high OER activity, Fe and Ni are additionally incorporated into Co nanoparticles that are coupled with Mo 2 C nanoparticles (Co‐Mo 2 C). Considering the oxidation states of Fe (Fe 3+ ), Co (Co 2+ /Co 3+ ), and Ni (Ni 2+ ) ions, Fe and Ni are expected to affect the electronic structure of Co in the opposite direction. Lewis acidic Fe 3+ doping makes the Co surface oxide more electrophilic, promoting the formation of OER‐active CoOOH by strongly attracting hydroxide ions (OH − ). Thus, the OER kinetics is facilitated on the Co surface of Fe‐doped Co‐Mo 2 C, resulting in a significantly lower overpotential for the OER. On the other hand, the Ni 2+ doping makes the Co surface oxide less electrophilic, leading to an increase in the overpotential for the OER. Tailoring the electrophilic properties of the Co surface is presented as a key parameter in the design of a Co‐based OER catalyst for alkaline water electrolysis.

The existing approach of preparing hydrogen through electrocatalytic water splitting is hindered by several factors, including the scarcity of efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction that can function well under a variety of pH settings. The development of compounds with diverse active ingredients could contribute to the heterostructured electrocatalysts' ability to effectively react with a range of reactants. Moreover, assembling active species on a substrate to produce self-supported electrocatalysts can reduce the need for electricity. Here, we utilized nickel foam as the conductive substrate to produce heterostructured electrocatalysts with active species of ZnIn2S4, Ni2P, and NiS (denoted as ZnIn2S4/Ni2P/NiS@NF). The ZnIn2S4/Ni2P/NiS@NF only needs tiny overpotentials to drive high current densities and can be operated with long-term operational durability across a broad pH range.

Electrocatalysis has emerged as a pivotal field for sustainable energy and environmental solutions, fueling the development of diverse electrocatalysts over the past 2 decades. However, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamical processes governing electrochemical reactions remains elusive and is hampering efficient catalyst design. Surface-sensitive techniques like in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy are indispensable for characterizing these dynamic processes and guiding the development of novel catalysts. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in employing in situ/operando Raman techniques, with a particular emphasis on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), for probing various electrocatalytic systems. It discusses the development, advantages, and available configurations of these Raman techniques. Moreover, the review underscores the potential of in situ SERS in unraveling the intricate mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through innovative strategies and methodological advancements. Notably, leveraging SERS for novel OER catalysts, such as single-atom catalysts, metal–organic frameworks, and electrolyte–electrode interfaces, can unveil unexplored reaction pathways, guiding the development of superior catalytic materials. Overcoming challenges and harnessing SERS' capabilities can deepen our mechanistic understanding of the OER, enabling the rational design of efficient and durable electrocatalysts crucial for renewable energy advancement.

Abstract Hydrogen fuel cells represent a leading technology in developing green energy targeting net‐zero emissions goals by mid‐century. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have hitherto demanded substantial quantities of expensive platinum (Pt) group metals. Advances in catalyst design, including the controllable fabrication of highly branched morphologies to increase the surface area‐to‐volume ratio, intermixing Pt with more affordable transition metals, and controlling composition, offer solutions that can further enhance activity and reduce expense. In this context, Pt/M (M = Fe, Ni, Co) nanopods and nanodendrites with precise composition control using more affordable starting materials are designed and crafted. The method is highly efficient, taking only 30 min and avoiding the need for high‐pressure equipment, making it highly scalable. These catalysts show superior ORR performance at an electrode loading as low as 0.0022 mg Pt cm −2 . One, nanodendritic Pt/Ni, achieves a mass activity of at 0.9 V versus RHE, making it 87 times more efficient in terms of Pt‐content than a commercial 10 wt% Pt/C nanoparticle standard. These findings provide new opportunities for developing next‐generation, cost‐efficient Pt‐based catalysts, by potentially advancing hydrogen fuel cell technology through performance enhancement and addressing cost challenges through catalyst design.

In light of the intensifying global energy crisis and the mounting demand for environmental protection, it is of vital importance to develop advanced hydrogen energy conversion systems. Electrolysis cells for hydrogen production and fuel cell devices for hydrogen utilization are indispensable in hydrogen energy conversion. As one of the electrolysis cells, water splitting involves two electrochemical reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. And oxygen reduction reaction coupled with hydrogen oxidation reaction, represent the core electrocatalytic reactions in fuel cell devices. However, the inherent complexity and the lack of a clear understanding of the structure-performance relationship of these electrocatalytic reactions, have posed significant challenges to the advancement of research in this field. In this work, the recent development in revealing the mechanism of electrocatalytic reactions in hydrogen energy conversion systems is reviewed, including in situ characterization and theoretical calculation. First, the working principles and applications of operando measurements in unveiling the reaction mechanism are systematically introduced. Then the application of theoretical calculations in the design of catalysts and the investigation of the reaction mechanism are discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities are also summarized and discussed for paving the development of hydrogen energy conversion systems.

Abstract Future energy loss can be minimized to a greater extent via developing highly active electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolyzers. Incorporating an innovative design like high entropy oxides, dealloying, structural reconstruction, in situ activation can potentially reduce the energy barriers between practical and theoretical potentials. Here, a Fd‐3m spinel group high entropy oxide is developed via a simple solvothermal and calcination approach. The developed (FeCoMnZnMg) 3 O 4 electrocatalyst shows a near equimolar distribution of all the metal elements resulting in higher entropy (ΔS ≈1.61R) and higher surface area. The self‐reconstructed spinel high entropy oxide (S‐HEO) catalyst exhibited a lower overpotential of 240 mV to reach 10 mA cm −2 and enhanced reaction kinetics (59 mV dec −1 ). Noticeably, the S‐HEO displayed an outstanding durability of 1000 h without any potential loss, significantly outperforming most of the reported OER electrocatalysts. Further, S‐HEO is evaluated as the anode catalyst for an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) in 1 m , 0.1 m KOH, and DI water at 20 and 60 °C. These results demonstrate that S‐HEO is a highly attractive, non‐noble class of materials for high active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts allowing fine‐tuning beyond the limits of bi‐ or trimetallic oxides.

Abstract Catalysis is crucial for clean energy, green chemistry, and environmental remediation, but traditional methods rely on expensive and scarce precious metals. This review addresses this challenge by highlighting the promise of earth‐abundant catalysts and the recent advancements in their rational design. Innovative strategies such as physics‐inspired descriptors, high‐throughput computational techniques, and artificial intelligence (AI)‐assisted design with machine learning (ML) are explored, moving beyond time‐consuming trial‐and‐error approaches. Additionally, biomimicry, inspired by efficient enzymes in nature, offers valuable insights. This review systematically analyses these design strategies, providing a roadmap for developing high‐performance catalysts from abundant elements. Clean energy applications (water splitting, fuel cells, batteries) and green chemistry (ammonia synthesis, CO 2 reduction) are targeted while delving into the fundamental principles, biomimetic approaches, and current challenges in this field. The way to a more sustainable future is paved by overcoming catalyst scarcity through rational design.

Abstract This study unveils a novel concept of symmetric protonic ceramic fuel cells (symm‐PCFCs) with the introduction of a self‐recoverable electrode design, employing the innovative material BaCo 0.4 Fe 0.4 Zr 0.1 Y 0.1 O 3‐δ (BCFZY). This research marks a significant milestone as it demonstrates the bi‐functional electrocatalytic activity of BCFZY for the first time. Utilizing density functional theory simulations, the molecular orbital interactions and defect chemistry of BCFZY are explored, uncovering its unique capability for the reversible exsolution and dissolution of Co‐Fe nanoparticles under redox conditions. This feature is pivotal in promoting both hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. Leveraging this insight, a cell is fabricated exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity and fuel flexibility as evidenced by the peak power densities of ≈350, 287, and 221 mW cm −2 (at 600 °C) with hydrogen, methanol, and methane as fuels, respectively. Experiments also show that the reversible exsolution/dissolution mitigates performance degradation, enabling prolonged operational life through self‐recovery. This approach paves the way for novel, advanced, durable, and commercially viable symm‐PCFCs.

Abstract Machine‐learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized materials modeling at the atomic scale. Thanks to these, it is now indeed possible to perform simulations of ab initio quality over very large time and length scales. More recently, various universal machine‐learning models have been proposed as an out‐of‐box approach avoiding the need to train and validate specific potentials for each particular material of interest. In this paper, we review and evaluate four different universal machine‐learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), all based on graph neural network architectures which have demonstrated transferability from one chemical system to another. The evaluation procedure relies on data both from a recent verification study of density‐functional‐theory implementations and from the Materials Project. Through this comprehensive evaluation, we aim to provide guidance to materials scientists in selecting suitable models for their specific research problems, offer recommendations for model selection and optimization, and stimulate discussion on potential areas for improvement in current machine‐learning methodologies in materials science.

Abstract Aiming to efficiently expedite alkaline overall water splitting (OWS) by addressing challenges such as sluggish kinetics and limited stability, a hollow Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 ‐NiS@Ni(OH) 2 nanorod array with surface nanosheets is devised, featuring a high‐index Fe‐doped Ni(OH) 2 (101)‐NiS(211) heterostructural interface and an upshifted d ‐band center. This nanoarchitecture intensifies the adsorption and interaction of H 2 O and OH − reactants on the electrocatalyst surface, suitably bonds the * H intermediate in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and accelerates electron movement of * H, minimizes the energy requirement of the rate‐limiting phase ( * OH → * O) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by facilitating O─H cleavage of * OH and optimally adsorbs * O, amplifies the exposure of surface‐active centers, and ultimately reduces the apparent activation energy. Consequently, the overpotentials are as low as 66.4 mV (HER) and 254.9 mV (OER) at 10 mA cm −2 , alongside high turnover frequencies of 142 s −1 (H 2 ) and 279 s −1 (O 2 ) at 100 and 300 mV, respectively, markedly outperforming direct‐electrodeposited analogues. When functioning as a bifunctional electrode in OWS, this material merely requires 1.57 V at 10 mA cm −2 and sustains an operation for 168 h, approaching Pt/C||RuO 2 benchmark.

A heteronuclear dual transition metal atom catalyst is a promising strategy to solve and relieve the increasing energy and environment crisis. However, the role of each atom still does not efficiently differentiate due to the high activity but low detectability of each transition metal in the synergistic catalytic process when considering the influence of heteronuclear induced atomic difference for each transition metal atom, thus seriously hindering intrinsic mechanism finding. Herein, we proposed coordinate environment vary induced heterogenization of homonuclear dual‐transition metal, which inherits the advantage of heteronuclear transition metal atom catalyst but also controls the variable of the two atoms to explore the underlying mechanism. Based on this proposal, employing density functional theory study and machine learning, 23 kinds of homonuclear transition metals are doping in four asymmetric C 3 N for heterogenization to evaluate the underlying catalytic mechanism. Our results demonstrate that five catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance with a low limiting potential of −0.28 to −0.48 V. In the meantime, a new mechanism, “capture–charge distribution–recapture–charge redistribution”, is developed for both side‐on and end‐on configuration. More importantly, the pronate site of the first hydrogenation is identified based on this mechanism. Our work not only initially makes a deep understanding of the transition dual metal‐based heteronuclear catalyst indirectly but also broadens the development of complicated homonuclear dual‐atom catalysts in the future.
