CoFe-based catalysts have shown excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with the oxidation states of the active sites playing a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. However, how to effectively increase the oxidation state of these active sites remains a key challenge. In this work, a facile treatment with NaBH4 solution was employed to modulate the surface state of CoFeOxHy catalysts, inducing an enhanced OER activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 for the NaBH4-treated CoFe catalyst was reduced to 270 mV, indicating improved OER activity. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that NaBH4 treatment induced a phase reconstruction of the CoFe oxalate framework, a critical step in enhancing its catalytic properties. The strong reducing ability of NaBH4 strengthened the Co-Fe interaction, allowing the retention of low-valence Co species while facilitating the formation of high-valence Fe sites. This dual modulation of Co and Fe oxidation states significantly accelerated charge transfer kinetics, ultimately boosting OER performance. These findings highlight the importance of improving the oxidation states of active sites in CoFe-based catalysts, providing insights for developing efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.

RuO2 has been considered as a promising, low-cost, and highly efficient catalyst in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it suffers from poor stability due to the inevitable involvement of the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Here, we construct a unique metallene-based core-skin structure and unveil that the OER pathway of atomic RuO2 skin can be regulated from the LOM to an adsorbate evolution mechanism by altering the core species from metallene oxides to metallenes. This switch is achieved without sacrificing the number of active sites, enabling Pd@RuO2 metallenes to exhibit outstanding acidic OER activity with a low overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm–2, which is 54 mV lower than that of the counterpart PdO@RuO2 metallenes. Additionally, they also exhibit robust stability with negligible activity decay over 100 h at 50 mA cm–2, outperforming most reported RuO2-based catalysts. Multiple spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Pd-metallene core, acting as an electron donor, increases the migration energy of subsurface oxygen atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of intermediates on the active Ru sites, enabling a switch in the reaction mechanism. Such a unique metallene-based core-skin structure offers a novel way for tuning the catalytic behaviors of electrocatalysts.

We investigate the ultrafast electronic and thermal properties of the bulk amorphous cobalt oxide water oxidation catalysts cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) and cobalt borate (CoBi) using optical pump/X-ray probe correlated with in situ electrochemical transient absorption spectroscopy. The electronic signature of a light-generated intermediate species is compared to steady-state in situ heating X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), suggestive of non-thermal contributions to charge transfer formation on ultrafast timescales. With Co K-edge transient absorption spectroscopy, we observe a net photoreduction following 400 nm excitation that also initiates a potential-dependent increase in the excited-state fraction of trapped charge carriers that persists on nanosecond to microsecond timescales and is identified as a potential precursor state to oxygen evolving reactions (OER). Distinctly, the formation of excited-state species cannot be fully explained by photothermal reaction dynamics alone, with potential contributions from electronic motion acting in concert with macroscopic redox activity. The results can influence the design of water-splitting catalytic materials for tuning dimensionality, confinement, and charge delocalization across structures.

Low‐iridium acid‐stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in situ reconstruction of Ir‐based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade‐off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom‐bonded structure triggers rational surface‐confined reconstruction to form self‐stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir‐Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in‐situ/ex‐situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir‐O‐Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6 times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir‐Mn IMC as anode “pre‐electrocatalyst” (0.24 mgIr cm−2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0 A cm−2@1.851 V@80 °C) and runs stably at 2.0 A cm−2 for more than 2,000 h with the cost of USD 0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface‐confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical challenge in electrocatalytic water splitting, hindered by high energy demands and slow kinetics. Polyoxometalates (POMs), recognized for their unique redox capabilities, structural archetypes, and molecular precision, are promising candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, their application is hindered by high water solubility, causing rapid degradation and efficiency loss under harsh OER conditions. This study enhances the performance and stability of polyoxometalates (POMs) for OER by anchoring keggin‐type POM [TiCoW11O40]7‐ nanosheets onto a conductive, carbon‐protected manganese oxide (C‐Mn2O3) nanospheres support. The acquired porous framework enhances POM/C‐Mn2O3 (PCM) contact, improving stability, reaction kinetics, and redox activity by offering nucleation sites, electronic pathways, and abundant active sites, significantly boosting OER activity. The resulting PCM nanohybrid demonstrates remarkable OER activity in 1M KOH, requiring only a 300 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 with a Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec. The PCM electrocatalyst also shows high mass activity (784 A/g at 1.6 V) and maintains stability over 100 hours at 100 mA cm‐2 without performance fatigue. Consequently, this study offers a viable strategy for developing efficient, durable electrocatalysts using low‐cost materials.

The exploration and rational design of high-performance, durable, and non-precious-metal bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts are highly desired for the large-scale application of overall water splitting. Herein, an effective and straightforward coupling approach was developed to fabricate high-performance bifunctional OER/HER electrocatalysts based on core–shell nanostructure comprising a Ni/Ni3N core and a NiFe(OH)x shell. The as-prepared Ni/Ni3N@NiFe(OH)x-4 catalyst exhibited low overpotentials of 57 and 243 mV at 10 mA cm–2 for the HER and OER in 1.0 m KOH, respectively, superior to most bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts reported so far. Compared to the unmodified Ni/Ni3N, the Ni/Ni3N@NiFe(OH)x-4 catalyst exhibited a 43.3-fold increase in mass activity for the OER and an 8.7-fold increase for the HER, as well as a 29.5-fold increase in intrinsic activity for the OER and a 2.6-fold increase for the HER. When employed as both the cathode and the anode of the electrolyzer for the overall water splitting reaction, its voltage was reduced to 1.58 V at 10 mA cm–2. This surface reconstruction method increased the electrochemically active surface area and enhanced the catalytic activity. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the Fe etching reduced the onset potential for the active phase NiOOH, promoted its formation, and accelerated the reaction kinetics, thereby enhancing the overall electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst.

Abstract Li‐O 2 batteries urgently needs high discharge capacity and stable cycling performance, requiring effective and reliable bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Hovenia acerba Lindl ‐like heterostructure composed of cobalt sulfide and tin dioxide supported on carbon substrate (CoS/SnO 2 @C) is prepared via CO 2 laser irradiation technology. The half‐wave potential of CoS/SnO 2 @C for the ORR is 0.88 V, while the overpotential of the OER at 10 mA cm −2 is as low as 270 mV. The Li‐O 2 batteries employing the bifunctional CoS/SnO 2 @C catalyst displays a high discharge specific capacity of 3332.25 mAh g −1 and long cycling life of 226 cycles. Additionally, theory calculations demonstrate that the construction of heterostructure decreases energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (RDS) for both ORR and OER. Notably, SnO 2 behaves as the electronic promoter to optimize the electronic structure of heterostructure interface and triggers charge redistribution of CoS, which weakens the adsorption strength of the * O‐intermediates and allows to break the linear scaling relationship, thus further enhancing the catalytic performance of CoS/SnO 2 @C. This research furnishes directions for the design of heterogeneous catalysts, highlighting its great potential for application in rechargeable Li‐O 2 batteries.

Abstract The preferential adsorption toward OH − on the anode most likely blocks the accessibility of organic molecules and triggers competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER), typically precipitating a narrow potential window. Here, an OH − deconfinement strategy enabled by CO 3 2− self‐transformed from C 2 O 4 2− on metallic nickel oxalate (NiC 2 O 4 ) for efficient synthesis of bioplastic monomer 2,5‐furanedicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with faradaic efficiency of >95% via electrocatalytic 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (e‐HMFOR) at a wider potential window of 1.38–1.56 V RHE , outperforming state‐of‐the‐art Ni‐based electrocatalysts is presented. In situ, tests corroborate that the construction of NiOOH with surface‐adsorbed CO 3 2− (NiOOH‐CO 3 2− ) from NiC 2 O 4 can be facilitated by self‐liberating CO 3 2− . The CO 3 2− ions serving as an electric field engine can effectively weaken OH − coverage through electrostatic repulsion and enhance HMF adsorption at the NiOOH‐CO 3 2− surface, thereby heightening e‐HMFOR while inhibiting OER. Computational results further indicate that the CO 3 2− on NiOOH hoists the energy barrier of oxygen intermediate conversion (O* → OOH*) to suppress OER but promotes the e‐HMFOR kinetics. The precise modulation of OH − adsorption behavior on the electrocatalyst offers a powerful kit for boosting the oxidative upgrading process while circumventing the competing reaction OER.

Catalyst design plays a critical role in ensuring sustainable and effective energy conversion. Electrocatalytic materials need to be able to control active sites and introduce defects in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, producing efficient catalysts with a distinct surface structure advances our comprehension of the mechanism. Here, a defect‐engineered heterointerface of ruthenium doped cobalt metal organic frame (Ru‐CoMOF) core confined in MoS2 is reported. A tailored design approach at room temperature was used to induce defects and form an electron transfer interface that enhanced the electrocatalytic performance. The Ru‐CoMOF@MoS2 heterointerface obtains a geometrical current density of 10 mA‐2 by providing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at small overpotentials of 240 and 289 mV, respectively. Density functional theory simulation shows that the Co‐site maximizes the evolution of hydrogen intermediate energy for adsorption and enhances HER, while the Ru‐site, on the other hand, is where OER happens. The heterointerface provides a channel for electron transfer and promotes reactions at the solid‐liquid interface. The Ru‐CoMOF@MoS2 model exhibits improved OER and HER efficiency, indicating that it could be a valuable material for the production of water‐alkaline and acidic catalysts.

Abstract Rechargeable Zn‐air batteries (ZABs) have attracted widespread attention due to their advantages, such as high energy density, low price, and environmental friendliness. However, the sluggish kinetics of ORR/OER greatly prevent the practical application of rechargeable ZABs. In recent years, efficient, durable, and cost‐effective bifunctional catalysts are developed to accelerate the kinetics of ORR/OER and enhance the performance of ZABs. This review provides a systematic overview of ZABs and describes the standards of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. The latest research progress in the development of non‐noble metal‐based and nano‐metallic electrocatalysts for the air electrode of ZABs is systematically summarized, including the classification, design, synthesis methods, active site structures, and mechanism. Finally, the challenges faced by bifunctional catalysts and probable solutions are proposed. This review will provide a comprehensive guidance for development of efficient oxygen electrocatalyst in the future.

We have here thoroughly explored the OER and ORR performance for a category of two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) called TM3(HADQ)2, and Rh3(HADQ)2 exhibits a promising bifunctional OER/ORR activity, with an overpotential of 0.31 V for both OER and ORR. The d-band center (εd) and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) are utilized to study the relationship between OER/ORR activity and the electronic structure of catalysts, and it is found that the elementary d-electron number (Ne) of the central TM for TM3(HADQ)2, as well as the electronegativity of the ligand TM-N4 and the intermediate O atom, are the main reason that affects the catalytic activity of OER/ORR. Additionally, Rh3(HADQ)2 can be proven through the constant potential method (CPM) and microkinetics method that it is an acidic OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst. Rh3(HADQ)2 has a high toxicity tolerance, making it a potential bifunctional catalyst. Our research contributes to both the rational design of SACs for various catalytic processes and the fabrication of bifunctional, cost-effective oxygen-electric catalysts.

The addition of a redox mediator as soluble catalyst into electrolyte can effectively overcome the bottlenecks of poor energy efficiency and limited cyclability for Li-O2 batteries caused by passivation of insulating discharge products and unfavorable byproducts. Herein we report a novel soluble catalyst of bifunctional imidazolyl iodide salt additive, 1,3-dimethylimidazole iodide (DMII), to successfully construct highly efficient and durable Li-O2 batteries. The anion I- can effectively promote the charge transport of Li2O2 and accelerate the redox kinetics of oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions on the cathode side, thereby significantly decreasing the charge/discharge overpotential. Simultaneously, the cation DMI+ forms an ultrathin stably solid-electrolyte interphase film on Li metal, greatly inhibiting the shuttle effect of I- and improving the stability of anode. Using this DMII additive, our Li-O2 batteries achieve an extremely low voltage of 0.52 V and ultra-long cycling stability over 960 h. Notably, up to 95.8% of the Li2O2 yield further proves the reversible generation/decomposition of Li2O2 without the occurrence of side reactions. Both experimental and theoretical results disclose that DMII enables Li+ easily solvated, testifying the dominance of the solution-induced reaction mechanism. This work provides the possibility to design the soluble catalysts towards high-performance Li-O2 batteries.

Since the industrial revolution, the demand for fossil fuels has increased along with technological advancements, resulting in significant environmental pollution and global warming. To address these issues, the development of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydrogen is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting energy demand. Among these, hydrogen energy is considered as a promising future energy source due to its energy density and environmentally friendly characteristics. Currently, grey hydrogen is predominantly produced through the steam reforming processes, which relies on fossil fuels and emits large amounts of carbon dioxide. Green hydrogen, generated using renewable energy and electrolysis, has emerged as a sustainable alternative. In electrochemical water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) needs a higher activation energy compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction, making the development of efficient OER catalysts crucial for energy-efficient hydrogen production. Although noble metal catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 are commonly used, their high cost and limited availability have prompted research into transition metal-based alternatives.</br>NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have gained attention for their excellent redox properties, charge transport abilities, and effective adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, bulk NiFe-LDHs exhibit low catalytic efficiency due to poor electrical conductivity and a limited number of active sites. To overcome these limitations, various structural modification methods have been developed to improve their catalytic activity and stability. This review provides recent research trends focused on enhancing the performance of NiFe-LDHs through strategies such as heteroatom doping, interface engineering, vacancy creation, and intercalation, with representative studies highlighted to demonstrate these advancements.

In the current scenario of the energy crisis and environmental concerns, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are of vital importance for their application in metal–air batteries and efficient water splitting to produce hydrogen. The best possible electrocatalysts for the OER are considered to be noble metal-based materials like RuO2 and IrO2, but their high cost and instability have prevented their wider use for application in large-scale water splitting. Here, we envisaged CrPO4 as a cost-efficient host due to the formation of CrO6 octahedra interconnected through PO4 linkage, making it a stable framework structure to harness eg electrons that are pinned over the O(2p) orbital, required for superior OER activity. The presence of more electronegative Fe3+ or Cr3+ sites in the framework structure, through the inductive effect, enhances the iconicity of the Cr–O bond in the framework, and creation of CrO42– groups at the surface of the catalyst directly facilitates the adsorption/desorption of OH– in the form of –Cr–O–OH, which reduces the overpotential of the OER with higher structural stability of the electrocatalyst. In turn, Cr0.9Fe0.1PO4 demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity toward the OER in the alkaline electrolyte, together with a low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm–2 current density with a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec–1, better than that of the well-known electrocatalyst RuO2. Enhanced OER activity was observed due to the feasibility of 3-electron transfer with Cr3+/6+ redox as there was a significant increase at the redox peak current density and the presence of Cr6+ also facilitates oxygen evolution due to the strong overlap between Cr(3d) and O(2p) orbitals, which generates superior charge transfer from O(2p) bands to the Cr(3d) orbital, resulting in the reduction of oxygen or evolution of oxygen at a lower overpotential.

Developing efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal challenge in harnessing hydrogen energy. Among the promising candidates, transition metal sulfides have garnered significant research attention due to their low cost and exceptional catalytic capabilities. In this work, we present a strategy to fabricate Co and Ce dual-doping Ni3S2 nanosheets in situ on nickel foam (CoCe-Ni3S2/NF) as an efficient and robust catalyst for overall water splitting. The introduction of Co and Ce dopants can induce an internal electronic interaction for exposing more active sites and accelerating faster electron transfer. Meanwhile, the unique ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet array nanostructure, with a thickness of 10 nm, facilitates enhanced electrolyte infiltration and establishes efficient pathways for the release of H2 and O2 bubbles. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that Co and Ce dual-doping can effectively optimize the d-band center and improve the absorption energy of intermediates. The synergy derived from these design features enables CoCe-Ni3S2/NF to exhibit a remarkable performance in both the OER and the HER, as well as in overall water splitting. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, this catalyst achieves impressive low overpotentials of 285 and 193 mV at 50 mA cm–2 for the OER and HER, respectively. Notably, during overall water-splitting tests, a potential of 1.68 V is achieved at 20 mA cm–2, accompanied by an outstanding durability for 100 h. These results underscore the exceptional potential of CoCe-Ni3S2/NF as an efficient and robust catalyst for water splitting, paving the way for advancements in sustainable hydrogen energy technologies.

Finding effective electrocatalysts from earth-abundant materials for water splitting is crucial for advancing the future hydrogen economy. Fe-based oxides have been identified as highly efficient transition-metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their performance is hindered by inappropriate intermediate binding, low intrinsic conductivity, and poor stability, preventing them from competing with precious metal catalysts. This study presents an effective electrochemical reduction strategy for incorporating oxygen vacancies in situ into Fe3O4/iron foam (IF) nanocatalysts by applying a constant negative voltage. The results indicate that the reduced Fe3O4/IF (referred to as Re-Fe3O4/IF) exhibits enhanced OER performance due to the increased oxygen vacancy, substantial electron transfer rate, and greater electrochemically active surface area. Subsequently, this strategy was applied to Ni element-doped iron oxides with electron redistribution, achieving excellent OER performance. The electrochemically optimized Re-Ni0.8Fe2.2O4–x/IF nanocatalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 239 mV at 100 mA cm–2, a small Tafel slope of 41.78 mV dec–1, and an exceptional long-term electrolysis stability of 300 h under alkaline conditions. This study presents a simple and promising approach to induce oxygen vacancies into transition-metal oxides (TMOs)-based OER nanocatalysts for efficient water-splitting systems.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a cornerstone of electrochemical energy conversion systems such as water splitting and metal-air batteries, is inherently limited by its sluggish kinetics due to the multistep proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism and high activation barriers. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a revolutionary strategy to address the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we present a novel design thermodynamically enhanced for optimizing the rate determining stage of the OER. In line with the Second law of thermodynamics we report the findings from a first principle examination of a novel high-density fish patch single-atom catalyst for OER. We employed DMOL3 and MATLAB for the molecular modelling and computation while MATLAB was used to determine the overpotential constant. With a focus on the effect of the entropy on the reaction rate for Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the optimum entropy for efficient OER was determine. Applying an external pressure of (0, 0.1333, 0.2667 and 0.4 Pascal) on the system and studying the Gibbs free energy, the study revealed that 0.2667 Pa, is the best position for efficient OER. At this value, ΔGO2 and ΔGO -0. 066993 and -0. 06297 (J)

The development of efficient catalysts for water electrolysis is crucial for advancing the low-carbon transition and addressing the energy crisis. This work involves the fabrication of graphene-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by integrating NiFe-LDH and PbO2 onto graphene using plasma treatment. The plasma process takes only 30 min. Graphene’s two-dimensional structure increases the available reaction surface area and improves surface electron transport. Plasma treatment further improves catalyst performance by facilitating nanoparticle attachment and creating carbon defects and sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the PBE provide valuable insights into the role of vacancies in enhancing catalyst performance for OER. The catalyst’s conductivity and electronic structure are greatly impacted by vacancies. While modifications to the electronic structure increase the kinetics of charge transfer, the vacancy structure can produce more active sites and improve the adsorption and reactivity of OER intermediates. This optimization of intermediate adsorption and electronic properties leads to increased overall OER activity. The catalyst NiFe-PbO2/S/rGO-45, synthesized through plasma treatment, demonstrated an overpotential of 230 mV at 50 mA·cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 44.26 mV dec−1, exhibiting rapid reaction kinetics and surpassing the OER activity of commercial IrO2. With its excellent performance, the prepared catalyst has broad prospects in commercial applications such as water electrolysis and air batteries.

Constructing fast electron transfer pathways and abundant electro-active sites is an effective strategy to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of catalysts. Herein, structural engineering and dual-phase engineering were employed to construct a NiS2 nanoparticle-encapsulated MOF configured with a pseudo-neuronal structure (NiS2/MOF/HT). It was found that the pseudo-neuronal structure, constructed with a carbon nanohorn (CNH) and carbon nanotube (CNT), provided fast electron transfer pathways and abundant exposed active sites. Moreover, the NiS2/MOF/HT composite obtained via partial vulcanization not only inherited the pseudo-neuronal structure but also prevented the aggregation and growth of NiS2 particles. NiS2/MOF composites provide various active sites. With the combination of the promotion of electronic transfer and enrichment of electro-active sites (NiS2, MOF), NiS2/MOF/HT showed excellent performance, whose overpotential at 25 mA cm−2 was reduced by 19.5% compared with MOF/HT.

The supported RuO2 catalysts are known for their synergistic and interfacial effects, which significantly enhance both catalytic activity and stability. However, polymer-supported RuO2 catalysts have received limited attention due to challenges associated with poor conductivity. In this study, we successfully synthesized the RuO2-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) catalyst via a facile annealing process. The optimized nucleation and growth strategies enable the formation of RuO2 particles (~13.4 nm) encapsulating PTFE, establishing a conductive network that effectively addresses the conductivity issue. Additionally, PTFE induces the generation of oxygen vacancies and the formation of stable RuO2/PTFE interfaces, which further enhance the acidic OER activity and the stability of RuO2. As a result, the RuO2-PTFE catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 219 mV at 10 mA cm⁻2 in the three-electrode system, and the voltage of the RuO2-PTFE||commercial Pt/C system can keep 1.50 V for 800 h at 10 mA cm−2. This work underscores the versatility of PTFE as a substrate for fine-tuning the catalyst morphology, the crystal defect, and the stable interface outerwear. This work not only broadens the application scope of PTFE in catalyst synthesis but also provides a novel approach to the design of high-performance metallic oxide catalysts with tailored oxygen vacancy concentration and stable polymer outerwear.

The article describes а 2.5D non-hydrostatic model of dissolved oxygen transport in a freshwater lake. The oxygen dynamics are carried out through oxygen exchange with the atmosphere and physical transfer due to the effect of the thermal bar. An intraday change in wind speed (that influences the rate of oxygen transition from gas to liquid) is taken into account at the air-water interface. Space-time distributions of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration were obtained during the spring thermal bar on an example of Barguzin Bay of Lake Baikal. The results of simulation showed that the vertical flows generated by the spring thermal bar contributed to an increase in dissolved oxygen content in the thermoactive region of the bay. Due to the action of the thermal bar, areas with different levels of oxygen are formed in the body of water. There is not only a quantitative but also a qualitative difference between the oxygen distributions obtained for the thermoactive and the thermoinert regions. It has been also found that the wind speed and the wind duration affect the oxygen saturation of water at the thermal bar. The results of this study confirm the barrier function of the thermal bar.

Atomically dispersed metal catalysts coordinated with nitrogen coordination and anchored to carbon substrates (M-N-C) have become highly effective alternatives to platinum-group catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis. However, the catalytic efficacy of M-N-C systems remains constrained by the suboptimal performance associated with the symmetric charge distribution around the active metal centers. The synergistic co-design of asymmetric metal single-atom catalytic centers with heteroatom doping significantly enhances the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity and durability, advancing the capabilities of next-generation flexible zinc-air batteries. Herein, we developed a pyrolysis-secondary coordination strategy to generate a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, characterized by single Co atoms integrated within an asymmetrical Co-N5S1 moiety, along with nanocluster complexes embedded in N,P,S-codoped carbon frameworks, labeled CoSA+NC/NPSC. In the CoSA+NC/NPSC catalyst, the Co-N5S1 active sites exhibit an optimized electronic configuration, achieved through the synergistic coordination of heteroatom doping and nanocluster integration. Theoretically, this configuration significantly lowers the energy barriers and adjusts the d-band center, ensuring a more balanced binding strength between active sites and the oxygen-containing intermediates and contributing to the promoted bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction efficiency. The experimentally analytical results reveal that the CoSA+NC/NPSC demonstrates an impressive oxygen evolution reaction activity (Ej=10 = 1.58 V) and a narrow bifunctional potential gap (ΔE = 0.75 V), remarkably superior to the counterparts with symmetric Co-S coordination or phosphorus-free doping. When assembled as an air electrode, the CoSA+NC/NPSC-based flexible zinc-air battery exhibits ultralong charge-discharge life (>105 h) and impressive initial round-trip efficiency of 72.42% even at 0 °C.

Developing cost-effective, non-precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies, including zinc-air batteries, fuel cells, and water electrolyzers. This study presents a one-pot synthesis of cobalt-manganese mixed phosphates as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER. Among the catalysts tested, Na-Co-Mn-P [NaCo1.5Mn1.5(HPO4)2(PO4)] exhibited the highest catalytic activity, with a minimal ΔE of 0.86 V, indicating superior performance. The incorporation of alkali metals and the synergistic effects of metal and phosphate components enhance conductivity, electrochemical surface area, and mixed valency of transition metals, contributing to improved electrocatalytic activity. This work highlights a straightforward synthesis method and the beneficial role of metal-phosphate synergy in oxygen electrocatalysis.

Coordination complexes are promising candidates for powerful electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction but challenges remain in favoring the kinetics behaviors through local coordination regulation. Herein, by refining the synergy of carboxylate anions and multiconjugated benzimidazole ligands, we tailor a series of well-defined and stable coordination complexes with three-dimensional supramolecular/coordinated structures. The coordinated water as potential open coordination sites can directly become intermediates, while the metal center easily achieves re-coordination with water molecules in the pores to resist lattice oxygen dissolution. In situ experiments and theory simulations indicate that nickel centers with neighboring coordinated water molecules follow an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism with a low thermodynamic energy barrier. With more coordinated water introduced, an optimized intramolecular oxygen coupling process may appear for favoring the reaction kinetics. As such, a low overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm

Nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are considered as promising substitutes for precious metals in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, most of the reported NiFe LDHs suffer from poor long-term stability because of the Fe loss during OER resulting in severe inactivation. Herein, a dynamically stable chelating interface through in situ transformation of asymmetric aldehyde-ligand (THB, 1,3,5-Tris(3'-hydroxy-4'-formylphenyl)-benzene) modified NiFe LDHs to anchor Fe and significantly enhance the OER stability is reported. The fabricated asymmetric aldehyde-containing ligand THB is capable of stimulating much more interfacial charge transfer from NiFe LDHs to the oxygen group of THB and accelerating the formation of highly valent active Fe species leading to the strong combination between Fe and ligand and the reduced activation energy barrier of the intermediate, respectively. The optimized aldehyde-ligand-chelated NiFe LDHs (NiFe LDH/THB) shows enhanced OER performance featuring an overpotential of 224 mV at 100 mA cm

Water-assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)-based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo-based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co-Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet-like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co-Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi-LDH, demonstrating that the PBA-derived Co-Ni(O)OH was more effective.

Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in fuel cells and metal‐air batteries, which hold immense potential for energy conversion and storage systems due to their superior theoretical energy density, cost‐effectiveness, and safety profile. However, carbon‐based materials in air electrode face challenges stemming from the harsh oxidative environment of oxygen catalysis, leading to thermodynamic instability. This underscores the urgent necessity for the development of effective carbon anti‐oxidation strategies. This comprehensive review initially explores the complex mechanisms underlying the oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and the prevalent issue of carbon corrosion in carbon‐based materials. It then delves into diverse strategies aimed at mitigating catalyst corrosion through doped carbons, encompassing techniques such as graphitization, active site management, surface modification using functional groups, and corrosion resistance coating. Moreover, the review discusses methods to counteract carbon oxidation in catalyst supports, including the utilization of novel carbons, highly active catalysts to minimize oxidation, and the exploration of non‐carbon alternatives. Furthermore, the review also sheds light on protecting current collectors and conductive additives within the air electrode from corrosion. Ultimately, it outlines emerging challenges and opportunities for addressing carbon oxidation in air electrode, paving the way for enhanced performance and longevity in fuel cells and metal‐air batteries.

Solar-driven water splitting is achieved by connecting photovoltaics with electrolysis. Recently, integrated approaches of the two configurations for photoelectrochemical reactions have shown great potential in a combined unit, but strategies to address further material and cell development face significant scientific challenges. Here we present an experimental demonstration of photoelectrochemical (PEC) unit-cells with efficient separate dual compartments for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. The design and fabrication of cell architectures with various degrees of integration are investigated efficient and sustainable PEC processes. The effect of the nanostructured silicon (Si) photoelectrodes, including the adoption of layer architectures, surface protection layer deposition, and membrane electrode assembly is further studied to optimize the design parameters of the PEC unit-cells. This developed PEC cell with the Si photocathode achieved a photocurrent density of −4.8 mA cm–2 at −2.0 Vcell and −2.87 mA cm–2 at −1.6 Vcell. It clearly provides a critical milestone for unbiased solar water splitting. Practical solar to hydrogen (STH) can be directly estimated in investigating PEC performance in this unit-cell as assembled with a solar cell. It is a significantly meaningful step forward in practical solar fuel production.

Low‐iridium acid‐stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in situ reconstruction of Ir‐based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade‐off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom‐bonded structure triggers rational surface‐confined reconstruction to form self‐stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir‐Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in‐situ/ex‐situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir‐O‐Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6 times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir‐Mn IMC as anode “pre‐electrocatalyst” (0.24 mgIr cm−2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0 A cm−2@1.851 V@80 °C) and runs stably at 2.0 A cm−2 for more than 2,000 h with the cost of USD 0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface‐confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.

Abstract The applications of Fe‐based electrocatalysts in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are hindered due to poor stability and catalytic activity originating from rapid Fe leaching and the intrinsic electronic structure of FeOOH. Here, the study presents a strategy to precisely and continuously tune the morphology of FeOOH and the covalent characteristics of Fe–O bonds by controlling the coverage of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the FeOOH surface. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that regulating Fe–O covalency induces changes in intermediate adsorption strength and metal leaching, leading to a volcano‐shaped trend in durability and activity as a function of Fe–O covalency. Notably, in HER, negatively charged sites of EPS exhibit superior *H adsorption compared to bare FeOOH. In particular, EPS 2 @FeOOH exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both OER (η 10 = 240 mV) and HER (η 10 = 52 mV), with outstanding stability over 200 hours at 100 mA cm⁻ 2 . The current density also reaches 10 mA cm⁻ 2 at merely 1.51 V in a two‐electrode configuration, significantly surpassing other bifunctional electrocatalysts. This approach will provide a promising pathway to enhance the stability and activity of water electrolysis through precise modulation of EPS coverage.

Abstract As a subclass of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) possess a highly ordered porous structure, extensive surface area, and accessible catalytically active sites, demonstrating significant potential in catalytic applications. Although the catalytic activity of individual ZIFs is relatively low, their pore structure and size distribution can be rationally designed and optimized through appropriate chemical modifications and post‐treatment strategies to enhance their catalytic performance. This process requires meticulous control of ZIFs materials to meet the specific demands of catalytic reactions. In this study, a series of CoSe/NiSe 2 nanosheets is synthesized with precisely engineered morphology and architecture using a precursor route involving ZIFs. Notably, the CoSe/NiSe 2 ‐3 nanosheets exhibit a remarkable overpotential of 250.5 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline seawater and 215.3 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, when used as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the material also shows excellent electrocatalytic activity. When integrated with the a forementioned electrocatalyst into a full cell configuration, the device operates at a low voltage of 1.956 V at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 in an alkaline seawater medium, while maintaining excellent stability over a 12‐h operational period.

Electrochemical alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is regarded as an effective method for producing high‐purity hydrogen without relying on platinum group metal (PGM) as catalyst. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the anode half‐reaction, involves a four‐electron transfer process with slow kinetics, which significantly reduces the overall reaction efficiency of AWE. Although highly efficient catalysts can accelerate the OER reaction rate, the high overpotential of the anode still remains an important factor hindering AWE. Herein, ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (U‐NiFe LDH) nanosheet arrays were synthesized and used as anode catalysts due to their robust structure, excellent flexibility, and effective interlayer anion compensation. Only 250 mV of overpotential was required for OER to reach a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 in 1 M KOH. Incorporating the additive ethanol into KOH electrolyte further reduces the required overpotential of AWE to 114 mV. The anode overpotential could be decreased by 130 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm‐2 in a three‐electrode electrolysis system with U‐NiFe LDH as the anode. This work provides a possible approach for the development of low‐energy and green AWE technology for electrocatalytic hydrogen production.

Abstract Mass transfer factor plays an indispensable role in high current density to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, yet research on modulating reactant mass transport remains limited. Herein, by leveraging the dual acid‐base properties of aluminum sites, both the activation of the electronic activity of the layer for layered double hydroxides (LDH) and construction of the interlayer hydroxide coordination field (IHCF) have been achieved through in situ electrochemical reconstruction. It not only facilitates charge transfer and the surface catalytic transformation of reaction intermediates but, most notably, the presence of the IHCF significantly enhances the mass transport of reactants. As a result, the overpotential of LDHs with IHCF is only 164 mV, significantly better than the reported Ni‐based catalysts. Deuterium kinetic isotope effect experiments and pH‐dependence measurements demonstrate that the IHCF effectively enhances substrate mass transport capability and structural stability, thereby accelerating the proton‐coupled electron transfer process. To further validate the high mass transport characteristics, stability tests of the alkaline flow electrolyzer show that catalysts maintain over 1000 h of stability at a high current density. This work suggests that the IHCF effect can be utilized for further design and synthesis of efficient water oxidation catalysts for practical application.

The marsupial moles are arguably Australia’s most enigmatic marsupials. Almost indistinguishable from placental (eutherian) moles, they provide a striking example of convergent evolution. Exploring the genome of the southern marsupial mole, we provide insights into its unusual biology. We show definitively by retrophylogenomic analysis that marsupial moles are most closely related to bandicoots and bilbies (order Peramelemorphia). We find evidence of a marked decline in marsupial mole effective population size, most likely preceding the arrival of humans in regions near its range, and potentially corresponding to periods of climatic change. Our analysis of loss of eye function—an adaptation to subterranean life—reveals a structured order of loss of gene function associated first with the lens, then cone, and finally rod cells. Last, we identify genetic changes suggestive of adaptation to an oxygen-poor environment and of its evolution of partially descended testes.

Atomic oxygen, due to its unique chemical properties, is widely used in astrophysics to study chemical composition, nucleosynthesis conditions, and the processes of formation and evolution. The recent detection of the O I 1304 Å and 7774 Å lines in the upper atmospheres of exoplanets using space and ground-based telescopes opens the possibility to evaluate its abundance in these objects and constrain important atmospheric parameters. However, the simple approximation of thermodynamic equilibrium is often inaccurate in describing the formation and absorption for many spectral lines in stars and hot exoplanets. The development of a kinetic model that takes into account detailed radiative and collisional processes in advanced atomic models is required to interpret the observations. In this work we for the first time analyze the advantages of transit absorption measurement of two oxygen lines simultaneously.

Chromium (Cr) isotopes are pivotal proxies for understanding Earth’s atmospheric oxygenation history. This review highlights δ53Cr signatures as tools for reconstructing redox dynamics during events like the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) and the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE). Advances in analytical techniques, particularly multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), have enhanced δ53Cr measurement precision, revealing critical insights into oxidative weathering and atmospheric oxygenation. Challenges such as local environmental variability and uncertainties in oxygen thresholds remain, but integrating δ53Cr with complementary proxies promises a more comprehensive view of Earth’s redox evolution. This synthesis underscores the transformative role of Cr isotopes in tracing oxygenation processes and their implications for the evolution of the biosphere.

However, the dynamic evolution and reaction mechanisms regulated by electrolytes at both the positive and Zn negative electrodes remain elusive.

The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are excellent locations to study stellar dust emission and its contribution to galaxy evolution. Through spectral and photometric classification, MCs can serve as a unique environment for studying stellar evolution and galaxies enriched by dusty stellar point sources. We applied machine learning classifiers to spectroscopically labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, which involved 12 multiwavelength filters and 618 stellar objects at the MCs. We classified stars into five categories: young stellar objects (YSOs), carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars, oxygen-rich AGB (OAGB) stars, red supergiants (RSG), and post-AGB (PAGB) stars. Following this, we augmented the distribution of imbalanced classes using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Therefore, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy, reaching 89% based on the recall metric, in categorizing dusty stellar sources before and after data augmentation. In this study, SMOTE did not impact the classification accuracy for the CAGB, PAGB, and RSG categories but led to changes in the performance of the OAGB and YSO classes.

Since the long-range structure of the Gd-doped system (Ce1−xGdxO2−x/2) remains in the fluorite structure in the x-range [0–0.3], it is of interest to study this system in the local range. Molecular dynamics simulations seem to be particularly suitable for this purpose. Among all the possible parameters used to describe the local order/disorder, we focus on the behavior of the bond lengths. Doping cations and oxygen vacancies are introduced inside the fluorite structure following two arrangements, the random (R) and the neighbor (N). We investigate the evolution of the bond lengths with the temperature and doping level and identify different trends depending on the bond type (cation–anion, cation–cation). The bond length thermal expansion can be drastically different from the long-range thermal expansion mainly for the bonds implying Gd3+ cation. The presence of C-type Gd2O3 clusters is discussed through the study of the double component of the Gd–Gd Radial Distribution Function. Comments are provided for evolution of distances beyond the first and second shells of the cations’ environment. This study also demonstrates the impact of point defect distribution (R or N) on the evolution of the local structure, while maintaining the long-range fluorite structure.

Abstract Tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) based metal oxide semiconductor material has been conventionally used for sensing inorganic gases at elevated temperatures. However, in this study, the gas sensing performance of tungsten oxide‐based sensors is evaluated at room temperature. In this study, WO 3 quantum dots (QDs) are synthesized via the electrochemical method, followed by a microwave treatment to dehydrate them. The newly developed process is relatively less expensive and offers the flexibility to alter the structure in terms of phase, size, shape, and vacancy concentration. It is observed that electrochemical process parameters play an important role in phase evolution and control the oxygen vacancy concentration in the powder, which are essential for enhancing its gas sensing characteristics. Results showed an enhanced gas‐sensing ability of WO 3 QDs at room temperature toward inorganic gases, such as CO, NO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 when subjected to microwave treatment. The enhanced gas‐sensing performance of microwave‐treated WO 3 QDs is attributed to its smaller size and high oxygen vacancy concentration. The minimum limit of detection values for CO, NO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 at room temperature using microwave‐treated hydrated tungsten oxide QDs were 4.60, 1.5, 0.35, and 10.25 ppm, respectively.

Abstract Choosing the right and appropriate amount of substances in a changing environment is essential for the growth and survival of all species. We found that elevated oxygen levels significantly enhanced the iron-rich trapping devices of a nematode-trapping fungus (NTF), Arthrobotrys oligospora . Interestingly, genomic analysis revealed that all NTFs lacked coq7 , a key gene involved in ubiquinol (UQ) biosynthesis and iron chelation. Notably, A. oligospora utilizes UQ instead of UQ for low-aerobic respiration. Transcriptional, metabolic, mutational, and phenotypic analyses revealed that A. oligospora produces a chemotaxonomic class of highly oxygenated arthrobotrins with characteristics similar to UQ skeleton, for high-aerobic respiration. Disruption of arthrobotrin biosynthesis in the Δ art mutant not only enhanced UQ biosynthesis, but also triggered trapping device formation and nematicidal activity under elevated oxygen conditions. The addition of UQ to both wild-type and Δ art mutants strongly inhibited trapping device development. Remarkably, the iron-rich trapping devices preferentially capture N2 nematodes harboring iron-chelating COQ7 with ferritin properties. Time-calibrated evolutionary analyses, combined with geological data, indicated that the NTF ancestor lost the coq7 gene after acquiring the arthrobotrin biosynthetic gene cluster during the "superoligotrophy" period, characterized by dramatic shifts in global oxygen levels and temperature changes. Our results demonstrate that oxygen is a critical factor in inducing iron overload, highlighting the origin and role of coq7 loss in the evolution of predatory behavior of NTFs. Our finding that NTFs capture nematodes for iron chelation therapy, rather than for food, explains a long standing debate about the limited carnivorous ability of trapping devices.

Abstract The dissolution of sulfide minerals in subsurface porous media has important environmental implications. We investigate the oxidative dissolution of pyrite under evaporative conditions and advance a mechanistic understanding of the interactions between multiple physical processes and mineral/surface reactions. We performed a set of experiments in which initially water saturated and anoxic soil columns, containing a top layer of pyrite, are exposed to the atmosphere under no evaporation (single‐phase) and natural evaporative (two‐phase) conditions. The oxidative dissolution of pyrite was monitored by non‐invasive high‐resolution measurements of oxygen and pH. Additionally, we developed and applied a multiphase and multicomponent reactive transport model to quantitatively describe the experimental outcomes and elucidate the interplay between the physico‐chemical mechanisms controlling the extent of pyrite dissolution. The results confirm that the extent of pyrite dissolution under single‐phase conditions was constrained by the slow diffusive transport of oxygen in the liquid phase. In contrast, during evaporation, the evolution of fluid phases and interphase mass transfer processes imposed distinct physical constraints on the dynamics of pyrite oxidation. Initially, the invasion of the gaseous phase led to a fast delivery of high oxygen concentrations in the reactive zone and thus markedly increased pyrite oxidation and acidity/sulfate production. However, such enhanced release of reaction products was progressively limited over time as drying conditions prevailed in the reactive zone and inhibited pyrite oxidation. The transient phase displacement was also found to control the distribution of aqueous species and formation of secondary minerals by creating spatio‐temporally variable redox conditions.

This study investigates the structural and electronic transitions of sol–gel derived titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy, to elucidate the impact of annealing-induced phase evolution. As the annealing temperature increased from 400 °C to 800 °C, the films transitioned from amorphous to anatase, mixed anatase–rutile, and finally rutile phases. VUV spectroscopy revealed distinct absorption features: a high-energy σ → π* transition below 150 nm, associated with bonding to antibonding orbital excitations, and lower-energy absorption bands in the range 175–180 nm and near 280 nm, attributed to π → π* and t2g(π) → t*2g(π*) transitions, respectively. These spectral features highlight the material’s intrinsic electronic states and defect-related transitions. A slight redshift of the absorption band from 176 nm to 177 nm with annealing reflects bandgap narrowing, attributed to increased rutile content, crystallite growth, and defect-induced effects. Broadening and additional absorption features around 280 nm were attributed to oxygen vacancies and reduced titanium oxidation states (Ti3⁺), as corroborated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS further confirmed the presence of Ti3⁺ species and oxygen vacancies, providing complementary evidence of defect-mediated transitions observed in the VUV spectra. While complementary techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed phase transitions and the reduction of hydroxyl groups, respectively, VUV spectroscopy uniquely captured the dynamic interplay between structural defects, phase evolution, and optical properties. This study underscores the utility of VUV spectroscopy as a powerful tool for probing the electronic structure of TiO2 films, offering insights critical for tailoring their functional properties in advanced applications.

In this paper investigates the Methylene Blue degradation using two common reactors: the nanosecond pulsed discharge in oxygen bubbles and the Argon Microwave plasma jet above the treated solution. The aim of this study is to compare the evolution of the reactors' performance when the electrical conductivity increases. In deionized water, the Methylene Blue degradation and the energy efficiency in the nanosecond pulsed discharge configuration were significantly higher than the Argon microwave plasma jet. However, when the solution electrical conductivity is increased, the energy efficiency of the nanosecond pulsed discharge drops significantly by ~82%, whereas the performance of the microwave plasma jet reactors decreases by ~37% only for a greater variation of the electrical conductivity of the solution. Under these conditions, the efficiency of both reactors becomes comparable, suggesting the necessity to consider various parameters to compare the reactors' efficiency.

Abstract A detailed study of the evolution of transient arc properties in SF6 alternative gas mixtures was carried out on an experimental puffer circuit breaker. Thermal interruption tests were performed in several CO2-based mixtures under short-line fault-like current and voltage stresses, with the test-device providing a similar arc environment and interruption performance to a commercial circuit breaker. The time-evolution of arc properties including the radius, temperature, and electron density were investigated using high speed imaging and optical emission spectroscopy techniques. These results were compared with simulation results from a simple 1-D, two zone arc model. Spatially resolved measurements of the arc were obtained in the critical interruption regions of the nozzle, including the first reported 2-D measurements of the temperature distribution during the interruption process in CO2. These measurements revealed a faster temperature decay in the nozzle throat, indicative of stronger cooling in this region compared to the upstream stagnation zone. Comparisons between the behavior of SF6 and its alternatives largely agreed with the model predictions, with lower temperatures and earlier temperature decay observed in SF6, followed by CO2-based mixtures, while air exhibited the highest temperatures and latest onset of temperature decay. No significant influence of oxygen content was observed on the maximum arc temperature of CO2/O2 mixtures at currents above 500 A, where values ranging from 20 kK to 25 kK were typically observed.

Abstract The design of cathode/electrolyte interfaces in high‐energy density Li‐ion batteries is critical to protect the surface against undesirable oxygen release from the cathodes when batteries are charged to high voltage. However, the involvement of the engineered interface in the cationic and anionic redox reactions associated with (de‐)lithiation is often ignored, mostly due to the difficulty to separate these processes from chemical/catalytic reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Here, a new electron energy band diagrams concept is developed that includes the examination of the electrochemical‐ and ionization‐ potentials evolution upon batteries cycling. The approach enables to forecast the intrinsic stability of the cathodes and discriminate the reaction pathways associated with interfacial electronic charge‐transfer mechanisms. Specifically, light is shed on the evolution of cationic and anionic redox in high‐energy density lithium‐rich 0.33Li 2 MnO 3 ·0.67LiNi 0.4 Co 0.2 Mn 0.4 O 2 (HE‐NCM) cathodes, particularly those that undergo surface modification through SO 2 and NH 3 double‐gas treatment to suppress the structural degradation. The chemical composition and energy distribution of the occupied and unoccupied electronic states at the different charging/discharging states are quantitatively estimated by using advanced spectroscopy techniques, including operando Raman spectroscopy. The concept is successfully demonstrated in designing artificial interfaces for high‐voltage olivine structure cathodes enabling stable battery operation up to 5.1 V versus Li + /Li.

The high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses distinctive thermal stability and electronic characteristics, which exhibits substantial potential for diverse applications in electrocatalytic reactions. However, accurately controlling the size of HEA still remains a challenge, especially for the ultrasmall HEA nanoparticles. Herein, we firstly calculate and illustrate the size impact on the electronic structure of HEA and the adsorption energies of crucial intermediates in typical electrocatalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) and NO3– electroreduction (NO3RR). Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, we synthesize a range of ultrasmall PtRuPdCoNi HEA nanoparticles with adjustable sizes (1.7, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9 nm) using a one‐step spatially confined approach. Specifically, HEA nanoparticles with 1.7 nm size (HEA‐1.7) endows a 16 mV overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm−2, yielding a mass activity of 31.9 A mgNM‐1 of noble metal in HER, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy can also be easily applicable to other reduction reactions attributed to the richness of metal components and size adjustability, presenting a promising platform for various electrocatalytic applications as advanced catalysts.

In this study, GQDs/WO3 composite porous photoanodes were fabricated using a pulsed anodization method in an aqueous electrolyte containing hydroxyl GQDs. The morphology and crystal structure of the as-prepared GQDs/WO3 porous films were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, Raman spectra, and FTIR. The successful embedding of GQDs into the WO3 walls to form tightly bound heterojunctions was confirmed. It was investigated how the GQD content influenced the photoelectrochemical properties of the GQDs/WO3 heterojunctions. The optimal photocurrent densities observed in the GQDs/WO3 samples (10-WO3) were found to be three times higher compared to those obtained from pure WO3 porous films. This significant enhancement clearly indicates the positive impact of GQDs on the PEC performance. The boosted PEC activity of the GQDs/WO3 heterojunction photoanode was attributed to the fact that the introduction of GQDs promotes more efficient light absorption, charge separation, and transport processes within the heterojunction structure. Moreover, the GQDs/WO3 composites photoelectrodes exhibited excellent PEC stability, predicting its enormous potential for practical applications.

ABSTRACT The plant defense against insects is multiple layers of interactions. They defend through direct defense and indirect defense. Direct defenses include both physical and chemical barriers that hinder insect growth, development, and reproduction. In contrast, indirect defenses do not affect insects directly but instead suppress them by releasing volatile compounds that attract the natural enemies of herbivores. Insects overcome plant defenses by deactivating biochemical defenses, suppressing defense signaling through effectors, and altering their behavior through chemical regulation. There is always a genetic war between plants and insects. In this genetic war, plant–insect co‐evolution act as both weapons and messengers. Because plants always look for new strategies to avoid insects by developing adaptation. There are molecular processes that regulate the interaction between plants and insect. Here, we examine the genes and proteins involved in plant–insect interactions and explore how their discovery has shaped the current model of the plant genome's role. Plants detect damage‐associated and herbivore‐associated molecular patterns through receptors, which trigger early signaling pathways involving Ca 2+ , reactive oxygen species, and MAP kinases. The specific defense mechanisms are activated through gene signaling pathways, including phytohormones, secondary metabolites, and transcription factors. Expanding plant genome approaches to unexplored dimensions in fending off insects should be a future priority in order to develop management strategies.

Herein, we first report a photocatalytic OCM using CO2 as a soft oxidant for C2H6 production under mild conditions, where an efficient photocatalyst with unique interface sites is constructed to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, while concurrently boosting CH4 dissociation. As a prototype, the Au quantum dots anchored on oxygen‐deficient TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the Au‐Vo‐Ti interface sites for CO2 adsorption and activation are collectively disclosed by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, quasi in situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Compared with single metal site, the Au‐Vo‐Ti interface sites exhibit the lower CO2 adsorption energy and decrease the energy barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation step from 1.05 to 0.77 eV via Au‐C and Ti‐O dual‐site bonding. The adsorbed CO2 reduces the energy barrier of *CH4 dissociation to *CH3 from 2.13 to 1.59 eV, contributing to CH4 oxidation. Additionally, in situ Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy unveils the Au site facilitates ethane production by engaging in *CH3‐Au interaction and accelerating CH3‐CH3 coupling. Thus, the photocatalyst demonstrates a high C2H6 evolution rate of 2.60 mmol g‐1 h‐1 for OCM using CO2 as the soft oxidant, surpassing most of previously reported photocatalysts regardless of OCM and nonoxidative coupling of methane.

Abstract Ruthenium (Ru)‐based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are promising candidates for assembling high‐performance anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) while their intrinsic activities are restricted due to the strong Ru─H bond strength. Herein, we present the synthesis and stabilization of electron‐deficient Ru nanoclusters on oxygen‐functionalized carbon nanotube (Ru/O‐CNT) via strong electronic metal‐support interaction (EMSI) toward highly efficient and stable alkaline HER. A scalable high‐temperature shock method is used to anchor Ru nanoclusters on O‐CNT, which suppresses the aggregation of Ru clusters and the loss of O anion during synthesis, thus strengthening the EMSI between the two components via Ru–O–C link. The strong EMSI helps to stabilize Ru at electron‐deficient state at reductive potentials and optimizes the Ru─H bond strength. Consequently, Ru/O‐CNT delivers outstanding performances for alkaline HER with a small overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , which is superior to the benchmark Pt/C and most reported Ru‐based electrocatalysts. More impressively, an AEMWE assembled with Ru/O‐CNT as cathode achieves high current densities of 1 and 5 A cm −2 at low cell voltages of 1.68 and 2.09 V, respectively, at a Ru mass loading of only 20 µg cm −2 .

Manifestations of sulfuric acid speleogenesis (SAS) documented in several caves in the areas of Aghia Paraskevi, Konitsa, W. Peloponnese, Elassona, Lavrion and Kammena Vourla in Greece are examined and discussed in this work. Carbonate and sulfate samples collected from caves in Aghia Paraskevi and western Peloponnese areas were investigated using methods, such as fluid inclusion, scanning electron microscopy, carbon, sulfur and oxygen stable isotopes, X-ray powder diffraction, and chemical analysis. The examined caves are mainly developed at or in the proximity of the local water table and they are related to hydrothermal springs and geothermal fields. In addition to the documentation of SAS in one case study from Aghia Paraskevi, calcite spar with a homogenization temperature peak at 280°C, indicates an early speleogenetic stage that involves meteoric-origin hydrothermal fluids under deep-seated settings. Sulfur isotope composition of sulfates (–4 ‰) is indicative for pyrite oxidation. The Konitsa caves represent a system developed at multiple altitudes that is related to the evolution of Sarantaporos River. The caves in West Peloponnese are located in two different geotectonic units. However, the caves in both units are active and share common characteristics, such as their development near sea level, morphology and fracture-guided pattern, and the presence of gypsum with δ34S values (average –26 ‰) that are plausibly related to hydrocarbons and bacterial activity. Morphological and geochemical aspects of the caves in these two regions suggest long-lasting, multiphase speleogenetic systems.

Herein, we first report a photocatalytic OCM using CO2 as a soft oxidant for C2H6 production under mild conditions, where an efficient photocatalyst with unique interface sites is constructed to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, while concurrently boosting CH4 dissociation. As a prototype, the Au quantum dots anchored on oxygen‐deficient TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the Au‐Vo‐Ti interface sites for CO2 adsorption and activation are collectively disclosed by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, quasi in situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Compared with single metal site, the Au‐Vo‐Ti interface sites exhibit the lower CO2 adsorption energy and decrease the energy barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation step from 1.05 to 0.77 eV via Au‐C and Ti‐O dual‐site bonding. The adsorbed CO2 reduces the energy barrier of *CH4 dissociation to *CH3 from 2.13 to 1.59 eV, contributing to CH4 oxidation. Additionally, in situ Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy unveils the Au site facilitates ethane production by engaging in *CH3‐Au interaction and accelerating CH3‐CH3 coupling. Thus, the photocatalyst demonstrates a high C2H6 evolution rate of 2.60 mmol g‐1 h‐1 for OCM using CO2 as the soft oxidant, surpassing most of previously reported photocatalysts regardless of OCM and nonoxidative coupling of methane.

ABSTRACT The low‐permeability oil‐bearing tuffaceous sandstones of the second member of the lower Jurassic Sangonghe Formation (J 1 s 2 ) in the Well Pen‐1 west sag of the central Junggar Basin occur in a deep burial setting (> 4000 m). They contain abundant oil and gas shows and hold promising exploration prospects. However, the reservoir heterogeneity is strong due to complex lithofacies and diagenesis, leading to significant productivity differences between adjacent wells. Therefore, identifying the lithofacies and diagenesis of the J 1 s 2 sandstones and elucidating their influence on the evolution of relatively high‐quality reservoirs is of utmost importance for oil and gas exploration and development in this area. Samples from the Well Pen‐1 west sag, representing the J 1 s 2 sandstones, were investigated utilising core and thin section observations, scanning electron microscopy, X‐ray diffraction, fluid inclusions and carbon and oxygen isotope analyses. The J 1 s 2 sandstones are mainly medium‐ to fine‐grained and moderate‐ to‐well‐sorted feldspathic litharenites and litharenites. The tuffaceous contents range from 2.6% to 25% and the authigenic clay contents, produced by diagenesis, range from 0.6% to 12%, although carbonate cements are not abundant (av. 3.1%). Four sandstone lithofacies have been identified based on mineral compositions, leading to variations in diagenetic evolution and reservoir quality. Early diagenetic events included compaction, alteration of tuffaceous matrix and feldspar, and development of smectite, chlorite, kaolinite and early calcite. Mesogenic alteration included feldspar and tuffaceous matrix dissolution, alteration of kaolinite, chlorite and illite, and precipitation of quartz, anhydrite, late calcite and ferrocalcite. The alteration of the tuffaceous matrix resulted in a complex pore‐throat structure in the J 1 s 2 sandstones. The pebbly sandstone and conglomerate (SC) and fine‐grained sandstone (Sm) lithofacies are generally characterised by high compaction resistance, low tuffaceous matrix and cement contents, and abundant secondary dissolution pores, and they exhibit better reservoir quality and great potential for oil and gas enrichment.

The role of subducting slab-derived supercritical fluids in transferring oxidized components in subduction zones remains poorly constrained. We investigated the oxidation state and effect of supercritical fluids by a combined study of petrology and geochemistry on an ultrahigh-pressure eclogite-vein system from the Dabie orogen, China. These samples record the composition and evolution of supercritical fluids at subarc depths. Multiphase crystal inclusions trapped within minerals in the vein encompass calcite, anhydrite, and magnetite, suggesting that the supercritical fluids contain such cations as S6+, C4+, and Fe3+. Whole-rock and mineral compositions of the eclogites vary systematically with distance from the vein, suggesting that the eclogites adjacent to the vein were metasomatized by vein-forming supercritical fluids. The garnet-clinopyroxene oxybarometric results indicate that the metasomatism of supercritical fluids resulted in the elevation of oxygen fugacity in the eclogites. The metasomatized eclogites exhibit decreases in Fe and S contents, Fe3+/Fetotal ratios, and modes of omphacite and pyrite. This observation suggests that the supercritical fluids dissolving omphacite and pyrite were accompanied by a Fe-S redox coupling process during fluid-rock reactions. This process further releases Fe3+ and S6+ from the eclogites to supercritical fluids. In combination with the mineral composition of the vein, it is inferred that sulfur was likely transported farther by the supercritical fluids. Therefore, some supercritical fluids were oxidizing at the subducting slab-mantle wedge interface and thus can oxidize the metasomatized rocks. Therefore, supercritical fluids are efficient carriers of oxidized components from the subducting slab to the mantle wedge, eventually contributing to the oxidization of arc magma sources.

Realization of a sustainable hydrogen economy in the future requires the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for its production at scale. MXenes (Mn+1Xn) are a class of 2D materials with 'n' layers of carbon or nitrogen (X) interleaved by 'n+1' layers of transition metal (M) and have emerged as promising materials for various applications including catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Their properties are intimately related to both their composition and their atomic structure. Recently, high entropy MXenes were synthesized, opening a vast compositional space of potentially stable and functionally superior materials. Detailed atomistic modeling enables us to systematically explore this extensive design space, which is otherwise infeasible in experiments. We have developed a Neural Network Potential (NNP) to model (TixVyNbzMop)n+1Cn MXenes (x+y+z+p = 1; n = 1,2,3) by training against Density Functional Theory (DFT) data in an active learning fashion. We then used the developed NNP to perform hybrid Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD) simulations to identify thermodynamically stable compositions and investigate the relative arrangement of transition metal atoms within and across layers. Thermodynamic stability increased with Mo content and its presence on the surface layer. We further investigated the catalytic performance of stable MXenes for the HER and observed that the center of the oxygen p-band (εp) correlated well with the energy of adsorption of a hydrogen atom ΔG(*H). Subsurface metal atoms significantly influenced the ΔG(*H) values at the surface via both ligand and strain effects. Our work expands the space of potentially stable MXene compositions, providing targets for synthesis and their evaluation in various applications.

Opportunistic bacterial infections emerging from the environment are an increasing threat, especially for immunocompromised individuals such as people with cystic fibrosis (CF), driving morbidity, and mortality. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen from this group associated with chronic lung infections that has been extensively studied in this context, but the mechanism driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung is not fully understood. This work focuses on the adaptations of P. aeruginosa to long-term hypoxia, one of the important environmental pressures present in the CF lung, to investigate whether it drives the development of persistence in CF patients. We examined how an early CF isolate adapted to 6% oxygen over 28 days using an experimental evolution approach and showed that two distinct P. aeruginosa small colony variants (SCVs) emerged, one exclusively in hypoxia exposure cultures. Importantly, SCVs were more prevalent in hypoxia-adapted cultures than in normoxia-adapted cultures (98% vs <35%). Proteomic analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of >200 proteins within 28 days, including proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, stress response, iron acquisition, biofilm formation and those previously associated with chronic infection. Importantly the observed changes in the proteome were distinct from changes reported after short-term exposure to hypoxia. Phenotypic characterisation of adapted cultures supported these findings, showing that hypoxia-adapted cultures developed higher resistance to 8 of 13 antibiotics tested; increased biofilm (1.8-4.1-fold (p<0.0001) and decreased pyocyanin production (2.6-fold, p<0.0001). All hypoxia-adapted cultures showed decreased siderophore production (2.9-3.6-fold, p<0.02). Two distinct patterns of adaptation to hypoxic conditions were observed, with the phenotypes of one culture being markedly different from the other two. Overall, we demonstrate that long-term hypoxia exposure contributes to multiple phenotype and proteome changes that are also observed in P. aeruginosa CF lung chronic infection, possibly opening the path to treatment of chronic infections.

We calculate the energy dependence of inclusive and diffractive neutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering cross sections within the dipole picture, focusing on the ultrahigh-energy regime. We predict an up to ∼10% nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-oxygen scattering originating from the nonlinear QCD dynamics in the small-x Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. Diffraction is found to be a small 1%−4% contribution to the total cross section across a wide range of neutrino energies relevant for current and near-future experiments. The diffractive cross section is calculated separately for the coherent and incoherent channels that are found to be of equal importance. Additionally, we include the dominant contribution from the |qq¯g⟩ Fock state of the W± and Z bosons in the high-Q2 limit, along with the lowest-order |qq¯⟩ contribution. The |qq¯g⟩ contribution is found to be numerically significant, reaching up to 40% of the diffractive cross section. Published by the American Physical Society 2024

Characterized by confined structures, these materials exhibit exceptional properties that differ fundamentally from their bulk counterparts, including enhanced electronic, optical, chemical, and catalytic functionalities. With applications spanning energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics, low-dimensional nanomaterials offer unparalleled opportunities for developing advanced technologies. (1,13−15,26−29) This Forum (Special Issue) explores the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of low-dimensional nanomaterials, with a particular focus on their role in energy applications.The versatility of low-dimensional nanomaterials lies in their ability to undergo precise tuning at the atomic or molecular level, which allows for optimization in a wide range of energy applications. 0D nanoparticles and clusters, characterized by a high proportion of surface atoms relative to their volume and exhibiting quantum confinement effects, are ideal for catalytic and energy storage applications. For example, FeCo bimetallic alloy nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon significantly enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in zinc–air batteries. (3) This synergy between bimetallic nanoparticles and pyridinic nitrogen-active sites delivers a half-wave potential superior to commercial Pt/C, showcasing the potential of nanoparticle-based catalysts. (3) For lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), boron and phosphorus co-doped silicon nanoparticles (∼7 nm) exhibit high capacity (3300 mAh/g) and cycling stability. These single-nanometer-sized particles mitigate volume expansion during lithiation and demonstrate the value of precise size control in optimizing LIB performance. (4)1D nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanotubes, and nanofibers, enable anisotropic charge and ion transport. Nickel and sulfur co-confinement in nitrogen-rich carbon nanofibers leverages pseudocapacitive charge storage to enhance sodium-ion storage, achieving a high capacity of 320 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and excellent cycling stability. (10)2D materials, including graphene, MXenes, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are celebrated for their tunable interlayer chemistry, high surface area, and unique electronic properties. An article about 2D materials discusses their applications in batteries and highlights their ability to improve ion diffusion and capacity retention. (15) Moreover, post-transition metal monochalcogenides (PTMMCs) represent an advanced class of 2D materials with remarkable electronic and optical properties. These 2D materials, with their tunable bandgap and unique interfacial behaviors, are poised to play a significant role in next-generation devices, including photovoltaics and nanoscale transistors. (30) Additionally, 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites were identified as promising materials for polarization-sensitive photodetectors. (17) Their layered structures enable stability and efficient charge transport, making them ideal for optoelectronic applications. (17)3D architectures and nanocomposites amplify the benefits of low-dimensional materials. Fe7Se8 nanoparticles encapsulated in a carbon skeleton form a core–shell structure that mitigates volume expansion during lithiation. (24) The resulting anode demonstrates a high capacity of 457.8 mAh/g after 300 cycles. (24) A SnO2 nanoflower-holey graphene composite achieves high areal capacity (3 mAh/cm2) in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). (23) This hierarchical 3D structure enhances Na+ transport, ensuring high performance even at high mass loading.The synthesis and assembly of low-dimensional nanomaterials require advanced fabrication techniques. The ability to assemble atoms, molecules, and particles at interfaces with atomic precision has opened new frontiers in materials science. Advances in processing and assembling, such as layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly, nanoparticle assembly, and 3D printing technologies, are enabling the development of novel nanomaterial architectures with tailored properties. For example, a scalable wet-chemistry method produced SiOx@ZrO2@C nanospheres, addressing issues of volume expansion and low conductivity in LIBs. (31) The resulting electrodes retain 72.2% of their capacity after 500 cycles, showcasing the practical scalability of this method. (31) A light-driven nanonetwork assembly via 3D printing integrates top-down patterning with bottom-up nanoparticle assembly to create high-resolution structures for optical sensing. (32) This innovative method balances fabrication resolution and scalability. (32) An article highlights LbL self-assembly as a method for constructing multilayered composites from atomically thin 2D nanomaterials. (33) LbL assembly uses noncovalent interactions to create stable, controllable structures, with applications in energy storage, catalysis, sensors, and drug delivery. The article also discusses various LbL methods, such as van der Waals, electrostatic, Langmuir–Blodgett, and hydrogen-bonded assembly, and highlights challenges and future directions in using LbL for constructing multifunctional composites. (33) Moreover, the utilization of molten salt electrolysis for CO2 reduction represents a dual-purpose approach for decarbonization and the synthesis of valuable nanomaterials. An article highlights the potential of CO2-derived carbon-based nanomaterials, which are produced through the electroreduction of CO2 in molten salt. (34) These materials exhibit unique properties suitable for energy storage and electrocatalysis. By offering a sustainable route to synthesize carbon-based nanostructures, this process aligns with the goals of low-carbon-footprint technologies. (34) These innovations not only push the boundaries of material design but also bring us closer to realizing scalable, high-performance energy devices.This Forum (Special Issue) illustrates innovative solutions using low-dimensional nanomaterials and their assembled hierarchical forms to address challenges across various energy applications. In addition to LIBs, metal–air batteries, including zinc–air and lithium–air systems, rely heavily on efficient catalysts to overcome the sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Low-dimensional materials have enabled significant breakthroughs in this field. In lithium–oxygen batteries, amorphous RuO2 supported on TiO2 nanosheets outperforms its crystalline counterpart by promoting smaller and more reversible Li2O2 deposits. (35) This amorphous structure improves the discharge capacity (2.3 mAh/cm2) and extends cycling stability to 160 cycles, demonstrating the critical role of material morphology in optimizing catalytic performance. (35)Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have garnered interest as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to LIBs. However, the larger ionic radius of Na+ or K+ poses challenges for electrode materials to deliver stable cycling performance. Low-dimensional structures offer practical solutions. For example, by a nanoscale coating of octadecylamine chains, hydrophobic Prussian blue (PB) cathodes with open structures overcome moisture sensitivity during fabrication and usage. (36) This modification ensures stable capacities (145 mAh/g at 1 C) even after extended exposure to humid environments. (36) A hybrid cathode design combining Na3V2(PO4)3 and activated carbon introduces a dual energy storage mechanism. (37) The "nanoreservoir" effect enhances both energy density (218.6 Wh/kg) and cycle life (over 14,000 cycles), bridging the gap between batteries and capacitors. (37) For PIBs, challenges such as dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers hinder their development. An in situ-formed Fe-based protective layer provides a novel solution by suppressing dendrite formation and enhancing ionic conductivity. (38) This artificial SEI improves the cycling stability of potassium metal anodes to over 1700 h, highlighting the importance of interface engineering in ensuring long-term battery performance. (38)Lithium–sulfur batteries (Li–S) promise high energy density but are plagued by polysulfide shuttling and poor sulfur utilization. Advanced nanostructures have enabled significant progress in this area. Self-supporting nanoporous carbon films decorated with Co–N–C single-atom sites address these challenges by catalyzing sulfur conversion reactions and stabilizing polysulfides. (39) These materials achieve a specific capacity of 1310.1 mAh/g and an areal capacity of 5.6 mAh/cm2 at a high sulfur loading of 6.7 mg/cm2, showcasing the potential of single-atom catalysis for high-performance Li–S batteries. (39)Separators are critical for maintaining safety and performance in batteries, particularly in aqueous systems where dendrite growth and electrolyte instability pose significant challenges. Functionalized nanoporous separators designed for zinc-ion batteries improve electrolyte transport, enhance mechanical toughness, and mitigate dendrite formation. (40) These modifications extend cycle life and improve overall safety, emphasizing the role of separator engineering in advancing aqueous battery systems. (40)Supercapacitors, with their high power density and rapid charge–discharge cycles, benefit greatly from low-dimensional nanomaterials. δ-MnO2 nanosheets activated by Zn2+ intercalation demonstrate enhanced oxygen vacancies, facilitating Na+ adsorption and improving charge transport. (41) These materials achieve a capacitance of 3240 mF/cm2 even at high mass loading (16 mg/cm2), making them viable for commercial applications. (41) The assembly of 2D nanosheets into layered stacking structures provides open pathways for ion diffusion and electron transport. These architectures exhibit excellent stability and bridge the functionality gap between batteries and supercapacitors, demonstrating the versatility of 2D materials in hybrid energy devices. (16)Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) provides a pathway for sustainable energy conversion and carbon capture. Copper nanowires, with diameters as small as 0.8 nm, exhibit enhanced selectivity for converting CO2 into carbon monoxide due to uncoordinated surface atoms. (11) These findings highlight the importance of surface structure in tuning catalytic activity and selectivity. (11) A Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, comprising Cu-doped ZIF-67 and Bi4O5Br2, achieves a remarkable CO2-to-CO conversion rate of 6469.88 μmol·g–1·h–1 with a high selectivity of 97%. (25) The synergistic band alignment and intermediate desorption properties underscore the importance of heterostructure design in advancing CO2 photoreduction technologies. (25)Low-dimensional materials also play a pivotal role in optoelectronics. Hybrid organic–inorganic 2D perovskites exhibit exceptional polarization-sensitive properties, making them ideal for high-performance photodetectors. Their tunable layered structures and environmental stability position them as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic devices. (17)In summary, the studies presented in this Forum (Special Issue) illustrate the immense potential of low-dimensional nanomaterials to transform energy technologies. Moving forward, the integration of machine learning and high-throughput experimentation will accelerate material discovery. Interface engineering, particularly in heterogeneous structures, holds the key to unlocking synergistic performance enhancements. As we push the boundaries of nanomaterial capabilities, collaboration across disciplines will be essential. Advances in operando techniques and computational modeling will provide deeper insights into material behavior, guiding the rational design of next-generation energy devices. This Forum (Special Issue) underscores the transformative potential of low-dimensional nanomaterials in energy applications, offering innovative solutions to global challenges in energy storage, conversion, and sustainability.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsHongtao Sun, The Harold & Inge Marcus Department of Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States; Materials Research Institute (MRI), The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States, https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3259-6091, Email: [email protected]Jian Zhu, State Key Laboratory for Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan Key Laboratory of Two-Dimensional Materials, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9852-1645, Email: [email protected]NotesViews expressed in this editorial are those of the authors and not necessarily the views of the ACS.ReferencesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!

(American Chemical Society) A review. Isolated atoms featuring unique reactivity are at the heart of enzymic and homogeneous catalysts. In contrast, although the concept has long existed, single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) have only recently gained prominence. Host materials have similar functions to ligands in homogeneous catalysts, detg. the stability, local environment, and electronic properties of isolated atoms and thus providing a platform for tailoring heterogeneous catalysts for targeted applications. Within just a decade, we have witnessed many examples of SACs both disrupting diverse fields of heterogeneous catalysis with their distinctive reactivity and substantially enriching our understanding of mol. processes on surfaces. To date, the term SAC mostly refers to late transition metal-based systems, but numerous examples exist in which isolated atoms of other elements play key catalytic roles. This review provides a compositional encyclopedia of SACs, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the introduction of this term. By defining single-atom catalysis in the broadest sense, we explore the full elemental diversity, joining different areas across the whole periodic table, and discussing historical milestones and recent developments. In particular, we examine the coordination structures and assocd. properties accessed through distinct single-atom-host combinations and relate them to their main applications in thermo-, electro-, and photocatalysis, revealing trends in element-specific evolution, host design, and uses. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, including multimetallic SACs, atom proximity control, and possible applications for multistep and cascade reactions, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this flourishing field. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3cXitFSltL3P&md5=f4c3e96ec0d47aa32db16737ef0965e62Fei, H.; Dong, J.; Feng, Y.; Allen, C.

(Nature Research) Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently attracted broad research interest as they combine the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Rational design and synthesis of SACs are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report a general approach to a series of monodispersed at. transition metals (for example, Fe, Co, Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with a common MN4C4 moiety, identified by systematic X-ray absorption fine structure analyses and direct transmission electron microscopy imaging. The unambiguous structure detn. allows d. functional theor. prediction of MN4C4 moieties as efficient oxygen evolution catalysts with activities following the trend Ni > Co > Fe, which is confirmed by electrochem. measurements. Detn. of atomistic structure and its correlation with catalytic properties represents a crit. step towards the rational design and synthesis of precious or nonprecious SACs with exceptional atom utilization efficiency and catalytic activities. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC1MXhtFGisLzN&md5=ba4f0c2bc55d7aa8cc41ca3196bd2cde3Li, W.; Zhang, M.; Xie, X.; Liang, A.; Peng, H.; Ma, G.; Xu, Y.

(Nature Publishing Group) Nanowires and nanotubes carry charge and excitons efficiently, and are therefore potentially ideal building blocks for nanoscale electronics and optoelectronics. Carbon nanotubes have already been exploited in devices such as field-effect and single-electron transistors, but the practical utility of nanotube components for building electronic circuits is limited, as it is not yet possible to selectively grow semiconducting or metallic nanotubes. Here we report the assembly of functional nanoscale devices from indium phosphide nanowires, the elec. properties of which are controlled by selective doping. Gate-voltage-dependent transport measurements demonstrate that the nano- wires can be predictably synthesized as either n- or p-type. These doped nanowires function as nanoscale field-effect transistors, and can be assembled into crossed-wire p-n junctions that exhibit rectifying behavior. Significantly, the p-n junctions emit light strongly and are perhaps the smallest light-emitting diodes that have yet been made. Finally, we show that elec.-field-directed assembly can be used to create highly integrated device arrays from nanowire building blocks. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXkt1WqsA%253D%253D&md5=4afc91799c3ba9d1f2b1627f3861c3d97Huang, Y.; Duan, X.; Wei, Q.; Lieber, C.

(American Association for the Advancement of Science) One-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanowires and nanotubes, represent the smallest dimension for efficient transport of electrons and excitons and thus are ideal building blocks for hierarchical assembly of functional nanoscale electronic and photonic structures. The authors report an approach for the hierarchical assembly of one-dimensional nanostructures into well-defined functional networks. They show that nanowires can be assembled into parallel arrays with control of the av. sepn. and, by combining fluidic alignment with surface-patterning techniques, that it is also possible to control periodicity. In addn., complex crossed nanowire arrays can be prepd. with layer-by-layer assembly with different flow directions for sequential steps. Transport studies show that the crossed nanowire arrays form elec. conducting networks, with individually addressable device function at each cross point. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXntlWlsw%253D%253D&md5=a2fcb7702dd0b767a9d2716c00d3105b8Hao, G.; Xiao, J.; Hao, Y.; Zhou, G.; Zhu, H.; Gao, H.; Xu, Z.; Zhao, Z.; Miao, L.; Li, J.

(Elsevier Ltd.) One-dimensional (1D) tellurium (Te) nanowires (NWs) have triggered intense attention due to their remarkable properties in electronics, optoelectronics and nonlinear optics. However, the saturable absorption properties of Te NWs and the ability to be bleached by strong pulsed energy need to be further improved. Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibit prominent nonlinear optical properties. Direct epitaxial growth of large-area 1D/2D Te-TMDC vdW heterostructures is still rarely investigated. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable epitaxial growth of large-scale 1D/2D vertical Te-TMDC heterostructures via two-step vapor phase deposition method. Our exptl. results have confirmed that the saturable absorption properties of as-prepd. Te-TMDC heterostructures can be obviously enhanced. The first principle calcns. and surface potential measurements demonstrate that effective interlayer charge transfer between Te NWs and TMDC nanosheets is beneficial for promoting the saturable absorption properties. Systematic investigation of vdW Te-TMDC heterostructures with nonlinear optical properties is vital for the next generation of nanophotonics and integrated photonics, which paves the way for the development of saturable absorbers and light modulators based on Te-TMDC vdW heterostructures. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXntlyqtLY%253D&md5=7c55c94e2eaaffd6580ecb1adc8a16fd9Wang, K.; Sun, J.; Yang, H.; Zhang, Y.; Zhong, X.; Song, Y.; Hou, F.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, H.

Graphene is a wonder material with many superlatives to its name. It is the thinnest known material in the universe and the strongest ever measured. Its charge carriers exhibit giant intrinsic mobility, have zero effective mass, and can travel for micrometers without scattering at room temp. Graphene can sustain current densities six orders of magnitude higher than that of copper, shows record thermal cond. and stiffness, is impermeable to gases, and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a benchtop expt. This review analyzes recent trends in graphene research and applications, and attempts to identify future directions in which the field is likely to develop. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3A

A handful of these sources, exclusively seen in X-rays, are key to understanding aspects of the neutron star phenomenology and evolution that cannot be probed by the rest of the population. In this contribution, I review their properties and highlight the role of X-ray surveys at complementing our view of galactic neutron stars. Prospects for future investigations are discussed especially in the context of the aftermath of the eROSITA All-Sky Survey.

She is a leader in the field of nanogeoscience, which centers around how nanoparticles lead to mineral formation in geological systems. In over half a century of research, she has made major contributions in mantle mineralogy, deep earth geophysics, and the thermodynamics behind mineral formation. She even lent her name to a recently discovered mineral─navrotskyite.Credit: Alexandra NavrotskyNow Navrotsky heads up the Navrotsky Eyring Center for Materials of the Universe at Arizona State University. The center represents a unique multidisciplinary initiative aiming to better understand what materials make up other planets, how the planets have formed, and how they evolve over time. Navrotsky is also exploring how materials form in the kinds of extreme conditions found in the universe, using ASU's new facilities for high-pressure and high-temperature materials research.Rachel Brazil talked with Navrotsky about the importance of looking at planets on the nanoscale, what we already know about the universe's many materials, and what she is still hoping to discover. This interview was edited for length and clarity.What is nanogeoscience, and why is it important for understanding the chemistry of other planets?Click to copy section linkSection link copied!If you think of how many atoms make up a nanometer, it's about four or five atoms in a row. So nanogeoscience focuses on the behavior of atoms at that scale.From the geologic and essentially planetary point of view, much, if not almost all, of the reactivity that occurs in the universe occurs with the involvement of small particles. Big particles, big single crystals are really chemically pretty unreactive, and once they are reactive, they will corrode, form small particles, etc. So the majority of reactions─whether we're talking about our solar system, whether we're talking exoplanets─most of those reactions involve small particles.Now what is interesting about it is that the small particles have very different properties from large particles. They will be different in their chemical reactivity; they will be different in their thermodynamic properties; they will be different in how they absorb impurities and how they catalyze chemical reactions.What do we know about materials on other planets?Click to copy section linkSection link copied!One has a general picture of the likely compositions [of elements on other planets], but if one looks at the variety of exoplanets, or one even looks at Mars or Jupiter, then one knows much less about the fundamental chemistry. We know the range of pressures because those are constrained by the size of the planets, and we make educated guesses about the temperatures.[We have] quite a bit of information now from the [Mars] rovers and of course the various planetary probes. But that information has to be brought together with what the likely chemistry is and what the reactions are or could be. Right now we have more ideas than facts.You're the director of the Materials of the Universe Center at Arizona State University. What is the objective of that center, and what do you hope to achieve?Click to copy section linkSection link copied![We] are addressing the fundamental question of, how do the intrinsic properties of materials determine the evolution of planets, the properties of planets, the properties of resources?Venus, Earth, and Mars: They're similar in size; they're similar in containing a lot of silicate minerals. But they're very different in how those minerals react; they're very different in what their surfaces are; they're very different in how much water and oxygen they contain; therefore, they're very different in how their properties are influenced by nanoparticles.The fascinating thing is to try to bring together what we've observed in terms of planetary atmospheres and a lot of things that we think we understand about how planets formed, and then look at this at a nanoscopic scale to understand the actual chemistry of what has gone on and what will go on. And that gets us into evolution because if you think of the way planets have changed since their formation, since the formation of the Earth, and since the eventual evolution that led to life, this is all chemistry.We're [also] interested in extracting resources from the Earth and eventually from other places in space, perhaps even bringing an asteroid to Earth for its metal content. Maybe there are planets out there that are made entirely of metals; maybe there are planets out there that are made entirely of sulfides.ASU recently received a $14.7 million US National Science Foundation grant to set up a facility for high-pressure and high-temperature materials research. What can studying materials in these conditions tell us?Click to copy section linkSection link copied!The biggest unanswered question is why materials compress and change their structures the way they do. What is that telling you about how atoms interact? That's the fundamental physics and chemistry question.The fundamental materials and geological question is, how do these reactions determine what materials form? And finally, can you harness this richness of pressure and temperature to make new materials? For example, there have been some indications that high pressures can make some interesting new superconducting materials.High pressure got started, of course, because one wanted it to make diamonds. Well, now one makes diamonds by all sorts of other methods, not just by high pressure.So similarly, if we find some materials at high pressure that really have interesting properties, then the next step always is going to be to find easier, more economical, more scalable ways of making them. But first you have to discover new materials at high pressure and temperature.The mineral navrotskyite was recently discovered in Utah. How did it get named after you?Click to copy section linkSection link copied!A mineral is typically named after somebody who has done something significant, perhaps related to that mineral. The second part is you need to have somebody that has identified and characterized a mineral and wants to name it after you. It's a long proposition through the International Mineralogical Association.[It] came as an absolute surprise to me. You don't go through life thinking you will get a mineral named after you. You go through life doing the science that you find fascinating, that you can get funding for. I'm as surprised as anybody that my career has taken me as far as it has.Rachel Brazil is a freelance contributor to Chemical & Engineering News, the independent news outlet of the American Chemical Society.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!AuthorRachel BrazilCited By Click to copy section linkSection link copied!This article has not yet been cited by other publications.Download PDFFiguresReferences Get e-AlertsGet e-AlertsACS Central ScienceCite this: ACS Cent.
