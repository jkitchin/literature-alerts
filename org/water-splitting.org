Abstract Wide spread adaptation of green hydrogen can help to mitigate the serious climate issues, increasing global energy demands and the development of advanced electrocatalysts robust under industrial conditions is one of the key technological challenges. Herein, chromium‐doped nickel‐boride‐phosphide (Cr/NiBP) micro sphere (MS) electrocatalyst is demonstrated via a two‐step hydrothermal approach along with post‐annealing. The Cr/NiBP MS demonstrates low hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evaluation reaction over potentials of 78 and 250 mV at 100 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH, out performing most of the reported catalysts. The Cr/NiBP ǁ Cr/NiBP exhibits only 1.54 V at 100 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH and surpasses the benchmark of RuO 2 (+) ǁ Pt/C (−) up to 2000 mA cm −2 , which sets it as one of the best bifunctional electrocatalysts. Impressively, it maintains stable performance for over 240 h at 1000 mA cm −2 in 6 m KOH at 60°C, demonstrating rapid response, anti‐corrosion resistance, and robust structural integrity to meet the industrial operational conditions. Further, Cr/NiBP ǁ Pt/C exhibits a super‐low cell‐voltage of 2.25 V at 2000 mA cm −2 . The small amount of Cr atoms incorporation can significantly enhance active sites and intrinsic properties, accelerating water dissociation and rapid intermediate formation.

Abstract Integration of different active sites by heterostructure engineering is pivotal to optimize the intrinsic activities of an oxygen electrocatalyst and much needed to enhance the performance of rechargeable Zn–air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a biphasic nanoarchitecture encased in in situ grown N‐doped graphitic carbon (MnO/Co‐NGC) with heterointerfacial sites are constructed. The density functional theory model reveals formation of lattice oxygen bridged heterostructure with pyridinic nitrogen atoms anchored Co species, which facilitate adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Consequently, the well‐designed catalyst with accessible active sites, abundant oxygen vacant sites, and heterointerfacial coupling effects, simultaneously accelerate the electron/mass transfer and thus promotes the trifunctional electrocatalysis. The assembled aqueous ZAB delivers maximum power density of ≈268 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 797.8 mAh g zn −1 along with excellent rechargeability and extremely small voltage gap decay rate of 0.0007 V h −1 . Further, the fabricated quasisolid‐state ZAB owns a remarkable power density of 163 mW cm −2 and long cycle life, outperforming the benchmark air‐electrode and many recent reports, underlining its robustness and suitability for practical utilization in diverse portable applications.

Various sustainable energy conversion techniques like water electrolyzers, fuel cells, and metal-air battery devices are promising to alleviate the issues in fossil fuel consumption. However, their broad employment has been mainly inhibited by the lack of advanced electrocatalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the three involved half-reactions including oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent advances have witnessed the cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n])-directed strategy as a prominent tool to develop high performance electrocatalysts with either OER, ORR, or HER activities. In this review, the recent progress on CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts ranging from molecular complexes to heterogeneous nanostructures and single-atoms for the three half-reactions are reviewed, and future opportunities are discussed. A concise introduction to the fundamentals of CB[n]s regarding their synthesis, structure, and chemistry is given first. Subsequently, the systematic summary of CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts and their performance for the OER/ORR/HER are discussed in detail, with a specific emphasis on correlating their structure and activities by combining diverse physiochemical characterizations, electrochemical experiments, and theory simulations. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspective for future opportunities regarding CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts for many other electrocatalytic applications are proposed.

Abstract Designing cost‐effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge in green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two OWS half‐cell reactions. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesiz hierarchical heterostructure MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH and MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low IR‐corrected overpotentials of 156 and 61 mV with at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 under light assistance. The MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH‐MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH OWS cell achieves a low cell voltage of 1.46V at 10 mA cm −2 during light‐assisted water electrolysis. Both materials exhibited exceptional stability under industrially relevant HER and OER conditions, maintaining a current density of 1 A cm −2 with minimal alterations in their potential and performance. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping the LDH matrix with high‐valence Mo atoms and MoS 2 quantum dots improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the electrocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the thermodynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, this work develops a facile synthesis method to design highly active and stable MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.

An ideal water-splitting electrocatalyst is inexpensive, abundant, highly active, stable, selective, and durable. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the main bottleneck for H2 production with a complex and not fully resolved mechanism, slow kinetics, and high overpotential. Nickel oxide-based catalysts (NiOx) are highly active and cheaper than precious metal catalysts. However, rigorous catalyst tests and DFT calculations are still needed to rationally optimize NiOx catalysts. In this work, we combine plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) and density functional theory (DFT) to address the role of dopants in promoting NiOx OER activity. Ultrathin films of NiOx doped with Zn2+, Al3+, and Sn4+ presented improved intrinsic activity, stability, and durability for the OER. The results show a low to high catalytic performance of ZnNiOx < NiOx < AlNiOx < SnNiOx, which we attribute to an increase in the concentration of valence band (VB) holes combined with conduction band (CB) electron conductivity, characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of doping on the electronic structure and catalytic activity was investigated using advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (PEB0/pob-TZVP). DFT complements the experimental results, showing that the dopant charge states and orbital hybridization enhance the OER by improving the charge carrier concentration and mobility, thus allowing optimal binding energies and charge dynamics and delocalization. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PE-ALD-doped nanofilms NiOx and DFT to rationally design and develop catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves the recombination of diamagnetic hydroxyl (OH) or water (H 2 O) into the paramagnetic triplet state of oxygen (O 2 ). The spin conservation of oxygen intermediates plays a crucial role in OER, however, research on spin dynamics during the catalytic process remains in its early stages. Herein, β ‐Ni(OH) 2 and Fe‐doped β ‐Ni(OH) 2 (Ni 5 Fe 1 (OH) 2 ) are utilized as model catalysts to understand the mechanism of spin magnetic effects at iron (III) sites during OER. Combined with magnetic characterization, it is founded that the introduction of Fe transforms the antiferromagnetic Ni(OH) 2 into a ferromagnetic material. Testing the magnetic response of the catalyst under an external magnetic field, the OER activity of Ni 5 Fe 1 (OH) 2 is significantly enhanced in comparison to Ni(OH) 2 . This improvement is likely due to the introduction of iron sites, which promote spin magnetic effects and enhance reaction kinetics, thereby increasing catalytic efficiency. Combining experimental and theoretical characterization, it is discovered that the iron sites accelerate the formation of heterogeneous dual‐site O─O bridging, represented as ─Ni─O─O─Fe─, thereby effectively enhancing the kinetics of the OER reaction. This study provides a magnetic perspective on the structure‐function relationship of magnetic iron‐based catalysts and has significant implications for the design of new catalysts.

Abstract Nickel‐based double perovskites AA′BB′O 6 are an underexplored class of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, in which B‐site substitution is used to tune electronic and structural properties. BaSrNiWO 6 , with a B‐site comprised of alternating Ni and W, exhibits high oxygen evolution activity, attributed to the evolution of a highly OER active surface phase. The redox transformation of Ni 2+ (3d 8 ) to Ni 3+ (3d 7 ) combined with partial W dissolution into the electrolyte from the linear Ni(3d)‐O(2p)‐W(5d) chains drives an in situ reconstruction of the surface to an amorphized, NiO‐like layer, promoting oxygen redox in the OER mechanism. However, the high valence W 6+ (5d 0 ) acts as a stabilizing electronic influence in the bulk, preventing the mobilization of lattice oxygen which is bound in highly covalent W─O bonds. It is proposed that the surface generated during the OER can support a lattice oxygen evolution mechanism (LOEM) in which oxygen vacancies are created and preferentially refilled by electrolytic OH − , while bulk O species remain stable. This surface LOEM (sLOEM) allows BaSrNiWO 6 to retain structural integrity during OER catalysis. With a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec −1 in 0.1 m KOH, BaSrNiWO 6 illustrates the potential of Ni‐based double perovskites to offer both OER efficiency and bulk stability in alkaline electrolysis.

Abstract The preparation and modification of porous electrodes are an important component of the new generation electrochemical oxidation technology. Rapid preparation of porous electrodes can be easily achieved by synchronous oxygen bubble electrodeposition. However, according to the reaction mechanism of lead dioxide anodic electrodeposition, there is bound to be a competitive reaction of adsorbed hydroxyl radicals in the oxygen bubble template method, which means that synchronous OER impacts both the surface morphology and potentially the crystalline structure of the metal oxides. Clarifying the comprehensive influence of synchronous OER on the morphology and microstructure of the coating is important. In this work, the electrodeposition process of porous lead dioxide coating is regulated by the way of linear potential increase and realized the rapid preparation of high‐performance porous lead dioxide coating within 40 s. The morphology and microstructure, electrical, and electrochemical properties are characterized, combined with theoretical calculation and orthogonal analysis, to investigate the regulatory mechanism of the rapid growth of the porous lead dioxide by the electric potential. It is demonstrated that synchronous OER confers porous morphology and a large number of defects to the coating in situ, and enhancing the electrocatalytic oxidation performance of the electrode.

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) toward 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has been considered a promising approach for the substitution of the energy-consuming and hazardous oxygen evolution reaction and for the valorization of renewable biomass. However, it is limited by the susceptibility of HMF to the oxidative environment and requires efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a NiMo complex (NiMo-N) is provided as the precatalyst for the HMFOR, exhibiting favorable performances with a current density of 450 mA·cm-2 achieved at an anodic potential of 1.4 V vs RHE (similarly hereinafter) with 50 mmol/L (mM) HMF and over 95% HMF conversion and FDCA FE for at least five cycles. Combined with quasi situ and in situ analysis, it is confirmed that the extensive lattice distortions in the precatalyst facilitate the in-depth reconstruction, increasing the accessible Ni sites and defective oxygen vacancies (Ov), which would promptly convert to high-valence Ni and active O species during the reaction. The improved performance is then attributed to the incorporation of the improved chemisorption and dehydrogenation ability of HMF by the as-evolved active sites.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical half-reaction in water splitting and metal–air cells. The sensitivity of the OER to the composition and structure of the electrocatalyst presents a significant challenge in elucidating the structure–property relationship. In this study, highly stable single-crystal cobalt carbonate hydroxide [Co2(OH)2CO3, CoCH] was used as a model to investigate the correlations among structure, composition, and reactivity. Single-crystal CoCH nanowires (denoted as CoCH NWs) and Fe-doped CoCH nanowires (denoted as Fe-CoCH NWs) with an exposed (210) facet and Fe-doped CoCH nanosheets (denoted as Fe-CoCH NSs) with an exposed (2–13) facet were synthesized using electrochemical and one-step hydrothermal strategies, respectively. Their OER activity decreased in the following order: Fe-CoCH NWs > Fe-CoCH NSs > CoCH NWs. Theoretical investigation suggested that the doped Fe sites serve as active sites, and the crystal-facet dependence can finely adjust the 3d configuration of Fe sites, resulting in the optimal adsorption strengths and energy barriers for potential-determining steps on the (210) facet of CoCH. This renders the as-prepared Fe-CoCH NWs as some of the most promising Co-based OER catalysts.

Due to the high configuration entropy, unique atomic arrangement, and electronic structures, high-entropy materials are being actively pursued as bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). However, a relevant strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of high-entropy materials is still lacking. Herein, a hole doping strategy has been employed to enable the high-entropy perovskite La(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 to effectively catalyze the ORR and OER. Hole doping experiments rely on the substitution of Sr2+ for La3+. The optimized La0.7Sr0.3(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 displays remarkable activity for the ORR and the OER, with a low potential difference of 0.880 V between the half-wave potential of the ORR and the OER potential at 10 mA cm-2, exceeding the majority of perovskite bifunctional catalysts. Further analysis of the electronic structures reveals that hole doping could regulate the eg-orbital filling of the transition-metal cations in high-entropy perovskites to an ideal position and thereby generate many highly active sites to promote the redox activity of oxygen. The assembled rechargeable ZAB with the targeted high-entropy perovskite as the cathode affords a specific capacity of 774.5 mAh gZn-1 under 10 mA cm-2 and durability for a period of 300 cycles, comparable to that of the 20%Pt/C + RuO2 ZAB. This work offers an important approach for the advancement of efficient high-entropy perovskites for ZABs.

The platelike nickel-terephthalate-type metal-organic framework nanoarrays (Ni-BDC NAs) on carbon cloth are obtained by employing agaric-like Ni(OH)2 NAs as sacrificial templates. The microenvironment of Ni-BDC NAs is modulated by various neighboring functional groups (-NH2, -NO2, and -Br) on the carboxylate ligand, exerting minimal destructive effects on the structure and morphology of Ni-BDC NAs. The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of Ni-BDC-NH2 NAs, Ni-BDC-NO2 NAs, and Ni-BDC-Br NAs exhibited a significant enhancement compared to that of Ni-BDC NAs alone, as evidenced by both experimental and theoretical assessments. The presence of neighboring groups exerts a positive influence on the electronic coupling between Ni and O atoms, thereby facilitating the thermodynamically favorable formation of *O intermediates on Ni sites and accelerating the kinetics of the OER. The findings presented here provide valuable insights for the design and utilization of carboxylic acid molecules with functional group effects, enhancing the activity of the OER across diverse Ni centers.

Resolving the atomic surface structure, particularly surface termination or reconstruction, is essential for understanding the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Although rutile phase iridium dioxide (IrO2) is the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting, the atomic-level surface structures of IrO2 remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of its facet-dependent OER activities. Herein, we perform aberration-corrected integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy of the low- and high-index surface structures of spindle-shaped IrO2 nanorods and reveal distinct surface terminations and/or reconstructions on different surfaces. Notably, the (110) surface shows a predominantly top-/bridge-oxygen termination and high structural stability without obvious surface reconstruction. In contrast, the (001) and (101) surfaces, where all surface Ir atoms are coordinatively unsaturated, undergo significant reconstruction. Additionally, a high-index (321) surface composed of (110) terraces is identified and exhibits a distinct [IrO] surface termination, indicating a weaker binding energy between Ir with O. Density functional theory calculations reveals weakened oxygen-binding energies on both the reconstructed (101) surface and the high-index (321) surface, predicting substantially lower limiting OER overpotentials compared to the (110) surface. These findings provide an important structural basis for understanding the OER activities of IrO2 surfaces.

Efficient catalytic water splitting demands advanced catalysts to improve the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Earth‐abundant transition metal oxides show promising OER activity in alkaline media. However, most experimental information available is either from post‐mortem studies or in‐situ space‐averaged X‐ray techniques in the micrometer range. Therefore, the composition of the active centers under operando conditions is still under debate. In this work, we combine nanoscopic and spectroscopic measurements on the hydroxylation of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)‐prepared Ni and NiFe oxides nanoislands with operando local investigations of Ni and NiFe hydroxide electrocatalysts under OER conditions to reveal the nature of the active centers in 2D OER catalysts. Our results reveal that Fe doping increases the active surface area by island fragmentation, and boosts the intrinsic activity by creating optimized active centers consisting of both Ni and Fe atoms. In addition, our findings show that operando characterization at the nanoscale is crucial to reveal the dynamic nature of the interface of 2D catalysts under reaction conditions.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a critical role in water splitting, which can directly determine the energy consumption of hydrogen production. However, the poor stability of catalysts at large current density inhibits their industrial application. Therefore, the development of efficient catalysts with industry‐relevant activities still faces great challenges. Herein, a one‐step corrosion strategy is reported for the preparation of multi‐element low‐crystal transition metal hydroxide (denoted as NiFeCrMnCo‐c). Density functional theory calculation indicates that multi‐element doping strategy improves the conductivity of the catalyst and reduces the energy barrier in the catalytic process. Only 259 and 303 mV overpotentials are required to achieve the anodic current densities of 100 and 1000 mA cm −2 respectively, and it can work at the anodic current density of 50 and 1000 mA cm −2 for 300 h without apparent attenuation. Furthermore, when it is self‐assembled as an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, it requires only 1.72 V at 1000 mA cm −2 for industrial water splitting and operates stably for 100 h at 60 °C, which can meet the requirements of industrial hydrogen production. The design of the OER catalysts with simple preparation, high activity, and high current density provides a new perspective for practical industrial water splitting.

The pursuit of efficient and sustainable hydrogen production is essential in the fight against climate change. One important method for achieving this is the electrolysis of water, particularly through the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recent studies indicate that trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can enhance OER performance compared to bimetallic LDHs. This improvement occurs because the third cation alters the electronic structures of the other two cations, thereby increasing the intermediates’ binding energies and enhancing electrical conductivity. This study proposes an approach enabling the modulation of the electronic structures of all three cations involved in the synthesis of the trimetallic LDHs. It suggested intercalating sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) into the interlayer of the trimetallic NiFe-La-LDH. A successful intercalation of SDS has been confirmed through the XRD, FT-IR, EDS, and XPS. This has expanded the interlayer distance which was beneficial for the electrical conductivity. Furthermore, SDS generated sulphur, which modulated the electronic structures of all three cations enriching the active sites and improving electrical conductivity and OER performance compared to its counterparts. This approach is beneficial: 1. The interlayer can be further enlarged by using different doping ratios of SDS. 2. Sulphur can enrich the active sites and improve the OER performance.

The design of well‐engineered bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for achieving durable and efficient performance in overall water splitting. In this study, Ru‐doped FeMn‐MOF‐74 itself has Ru sites and generates FeMnOOH under catalytic conditions, forming dual active sites for overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ru dopants exhibit optimized binding strength for H* and enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Moreover, the Mn sites within FeMnOOH lower the energy barrier for the rate‐determining step (from O* to OOH*), serving as the active centre for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The incorporation of Ru significantly improves the electron transfer properties of FeMn‐MOF‐74 and enhances its water adsorption capacity, synergistically boosting its bifunctional activity. This strategy of designing dual active sites provides new insights into the development of bifunctional metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) for efficient overall water splitting.

Acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts that provide high activity, lower costs, and long-term stability are needed for the wide-scale adoption of proton-exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers for generating hydrogen through electrochemical water splitting. We report the effects of chromium substitution and temperature treatments on the structure, OER activity, and electrochemical stability of ruthenium oxide (RuO2) aerogel OER electrocatalysts. RuO2 and Cr-substituted RuO2 aerogels (Ru0.6Cr0.4O2) were synthesized using sol–gel chemistry and then thermally treated at different temperatures. Introducing chromium into the synthesis increased the surface area (7–11 times higher) and pore volume (5–6 times higher) relative to RuO2 aerogels. X-ray diffraction analysis is consistent with s that Cr was substituted into the rutile RuO2 structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that trivalent Cr substitution altered the surface electronic structure and ratio of surface hydroxides. The specific capacitance values of Cr-substituted RuO2 aerogels were consistent with charge storage within a hydrous surface. Cr-substituted RuO2 aerogels exhibited 26 times the OER mass activity and 3.5 times the OER specific activity of RuO2 aerogels. Electrochemical stability tests show that Cr-substituted RuO2 aerogels exhibit similar stability to commercial RuO2. Understanding how metal substituents can be used to alter OER activity and stability furthers our ability to obtain highly active, durable, and lower-cost OER electrocatalysts for PEM electrolyzers.

The development of efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is crucial for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology, especially in the pursuit of non‐iridium alternatives. Herein, we report a Zn, W co‐doping Ru3Zn0.85W0.15Ox (RZW) ternary oxide catalyst that exhibits a low overpotential of 200 mV and remarkable stability for over 4000 hours at 10 mA cm‐2 in 0.1 M HClO4. The incorporation of highly electronegative W facilitates the efficient capture of electrons released from the sacrificial Zn species during OER, and subsequently mediated to Ru sites. The observed enhancement in electron density within the stable Ru‐O‐W motifs substantially improve the anti‐overoxidation properties of the Ru active sites. Our findings highlight the importance of strategic metal doping in modulating the electronic structure of OER catalysts during operation, thereby facilitating the development of practical and long‐lasting water electrolysis technologies.

Fe2B is a potentially promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its excellent electronic conductivity, which is superior to that of traditional oxide catalysts. However, the activity of Fe2B is still not satisfactory. In this study, meta-stable microstructure stacking faults (SFs) were incorporated into Fe2B through a one-step high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) method. Pressure suppressed atomic diffusion but formed SFs when the grain grew. Fe2B with SFs exhibited remarkable OER activity, with low overpotential values of only 269 and 344 mV required to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively; because of the presence of SFs, the overpotential for the OER was reduced to only 67.7% of that of Fe2B without SFs at 10 mA cm−2. Theoretical and experimental investigations confirmed that these SFs regulate the d-band center of Fe2B toward the Fermi level, optimizing the catalytic site activity. Furthermore, SFs reduced the charge transfer between Fe atoms and boron (B) atoms, increasing the number of free electrons in the structure and thereby increasing conductivity. Finally, this study suggests a strategy to construct microstructures in crystals, providing new insights into designing excellent catalysts via microstructure engineering.

Bimetallic oxides are promising electrocatalysts due to their rich composition, facile synthesis, and favorable stability under oxidizing conditions. This paper innovatively proposes a strategy aimed at constructing a one‐dimensional heterostructure (Fe–NiO/NiMoO 4 nanoparticles/nanofibers). The strategy commences with the meticulous treatment of NiMoO 4 nanofibers, utilizing in situ etching techniques to induce the formation of Prussian Blue Analog compounds. In this process, [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3− anions react with the NiMoO 4 host layer to form a steady NiFe PBA. Subsequently, the surface/interface reconstituted NiMoO 4 nanofibers undergo direct oxidation, leading to a reconfiguration of the surface structure and the formation of a unique Fe–NiO/NiMoO 4 one‐dimensional heterostructure. The catalyst showed markedly enhanced electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory results reveal that the incorporation of Fe as a dopant dramatically reduces the Gibbs free energy associated with the rate‐determining step in the oxygen evolution reaction pathway. This pivotal transformation directly lowers the activation energy barrier, thereby significantly enhancing electron transfer efficiency.

Heterogenous single-atom catalysts (SACs) are reminiscent of homogeneous catalysts because of the similarity of structural motif of active sites, showing the potential of using the advantage of homogeneous catalysts to tackle challenges in hetereogenous catalysis. In heterogeneous oxygen electrocatalysis, the homogeneity of adsorption patterns of reaction intermediates leads to scaling relationships that limit their activities. In contrast, homogeneous catalysts can circumvent such limits by selectively altering the adsorption of intermediates through secondary coordination effects (SCEs). This inspired us to explore potential SCEs in metal–nitrogen-carbon (M–N-C), a promising type of oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. We introduced SCEs with a neighboring metal site that can modulate the adsorption strengths of oxygen-containing intermediates. First-principles calculations show that the second site in the heteronuclear duo four-nitrogen-coordinated metal center can induce SCEs that selectively stabilize the OOH intermediate but with minor effects on the OH intermediate and, thereby, disrupt the scaling relation between oxygen species and eventually increase the catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reactions. Additionally, the activity of oxygen reduction reaction of selected M–N-C is also enhanced by such SCE. Our computational work underscored the critical role SCEs can have in shaping activities of SACs, particularly in favorably altering scaling relationships, and demonstrated its potential to address catalytic challenges in heterogeneous catalysis.

Abstract Ni‐rich cathodes are more promising candidates to the increasing demand for high capacity and the ability to operate at high voltages. However, the high Ni content creates a trade‐off between energy density and cycling stability, mainly caused by the chemo‐mechanical degradation. Oxygen evolution, cation mixing, rock salt formation, phase transition, and crack formation contribute to the degradation process. To overcome this problem, strategies such as doping, surface coating, and core‐shell structures have been employed. The advantage of doping is to engineer the cathode surface, structure, and particle morphology simultaneously. This review aims to summarize recent advances in understanding chemo‐mechanical degradation mechanism and the role of different dopants in enhancing the thermal stability and overall electrochemical performance. The pinning and pillaring effects of dopants on suppressing oxygen evolution, cation mixing, and phase transition are introduced. It is found that the higher ionic radii enable dopants to reside on cathode particles, preserving the particle surface and refining particle morphology to suppress crack formation. Finally, the effect of doping on Li ion diffusion, rate capability, and long‐term stability are discussed.

Abstract Catalytic seawater electrolysis is a valuable renewable energy generation process. However, it is restricted by the intricate and corrosive ionic nature of seawater which hinders oxygen evolution reaction (OER), one of the reactions governing seawater electrolysis. Herein, we introduce an effective approach that not only withstands, but also harnesses the potential of complex ions in seawater to enhance the efficiency and durability of OER. Unlike conventional strategies that address adverse effects through catalyst surface modification, we found that seawater actively facilitates the reconstruction of catalysts with high‐spin sites. In situ characterizations suggest that the selective adsorption of Cl − from seawater on high‐spin Co sites in alkaline seawater accelerates catalyst reconstruction, contributing to the rapid formation of high‐valence Co, which enhances OER activity. The resulting reconstructed wrinkled nanosheets also create additional active Co sites and accelerate electrolyte transport. As a result, we achieve an overpotential as low as 377 mV at a current density of 1 A cm −2 , showcasing nearly 100% oxygen evolution efficiency in alkaline seawater. Notably, our approach achieves a remarkable current density of 2.13 A cm −2 prior to the onset of the chlorine evolution reaction, underscoring its potential for efficient and sustainable seawater electrocatalysis.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting presents the ultimate potential of hydrogen and oxygen production; however, regulating the rate and efficiency of water splitting is highly dependent on the accessibility of extremely efficient electrode materials for slow performance kinetics and large overpotential of both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ruthenium oxide (RuO2) based materials display high performance for OER and HER because of their capacity to bind oxygen, eminent catalytic activity, low cost compared to other precious metals, and stability in a wide pH range. However, there is still much space to promote the OER and HER activity and stability of RuO2 to fulfill the necessity for practical applications in water splitting. Different researchers applied multiple approaches that boosted the catalytic performance of RuO2-based electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting. Herein, this review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in RuO2-based materials in the field of water electrolysis for the generation of alternative energies. It gives a general description of water splitting in acidic and alkaline settings, including reaction mechanisms as well as common evaluation elements for the catalytic function of the materials. Most of the review reported based on RuO2 materials are only focused on OER performance but this review highlighted comprehensive ideas on different strategies like morphology design, electronic structure, electrolytes, and optimizing both electrocatalytic HER and OER functioning of RuO2-based electrocatalysts.

In the realm of green hydrogen energy, utilizing ruthenium (Ru) as a precious metal electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) instead of platinum (Pt/C) is an excellent choice. Unfortunately, there are not enough active sites or electronic structures on a single Ru-based catalyst to significantly improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, creating bifunctional water electrolysis catalysts that are stable and highly active in a variety of media continues to be a major challenge. The study describes a new method for creating an electrocatalyst (RuCuCl/NF-2) by using Ru to regulate an inert CuCl precursor. The enhanced mass transfer performance of the distinctive coral structure and the synergistic effect of RuCu emphasize its excellent water electrolysis activity, which is based on the self-assembly of Cu nanoparticles into a conical membrane structure. Overtaking the commercial benchmark Pt/C (~38 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2), the RuCuCl/NF-2 displays HER activity (~25 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2) in 1M KOH. This sheds light on how to create more sophisticated bifunctional electrocatalysts.

The development of robust and effective photoanodes is crucial for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production via total water splitting. Herein, the Ta2O5/α-Fe2O3/Co-Ni PBA (TFPB-1) photoanode was constructed by the compositing n-type Ta2O5 and n-type α-Fe2O3 followed by the deposition of p-type Co-Ni PBA. The IPCE of TFPB-1 was increased to 35.4% compared to 13.9% for Ta2O5 owing to the significantly improved light absorption efficiency, carrier separation efficiency and injection efficiency. The TFPB-1 achieved a current density of 2.78 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V (vs RHE), which was around 18.5 times that of Ta2O5. The OER overpotential over TFPB-1 was reduced to 0.59 V compared to 1.13 V for Ta2O5, resulting in a substantial reduction in the free energy of PEC water oxidation over TFPB-1. As a result, TFPB-1 exhibited remarkably enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution through water oxidation.

In the realm of zinc-air batteries, high bifunctional catalytic efficacy is intimately tied to the evaluation of catalysts. Consequently, the pursuit of proficient bifunctional catalysts that can efficiently catalyze both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a paramount objective in this research area. In this study, the spiny cobalt tetroxide (Co3O4) encapsulated hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) are constructed by anchoring Co3O4 onto HCS via hydrothermal or annealing treatment. The strategic interface design of the HCS encourages an abundance of sites while simultaneously facilitating the proliferation of spiny Co3O4, offering an expansive surface area and abundant active sites. The surface active Co3+ ions and the induction of surface oxygen vacancies in spiny Co3O4 encapsulated HCS endow it with outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity and stability. After spray-coating and subsequent annealing of the spiny Co3O4 encapsulated HCS catalyst on the flexible carbon-based polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber support, the spiny Co3O4 encapsulated HCS-PAN/carbon black (C) 800 air electrode is successfully integrated. Moreover, the optimized spiny Co3O4 encapsulated HCS-PAN/C 800 air electrode displays a decreased potential difference (ΔE) of 0.77 V for catalyzing the ORR and OER performance. This work introduces a promising candidate approach for exploring innovative bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, targeting enhanced efficiency in portable energy storage applications.

Abstract The design of cost‐effective electrocatalysts is critical for advancing sustainable energy technologies, particularly for key reactions like the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in water electrolyzers and metal–air batteries. Cobalt pentlandite (CNFS) has emerged as a promising candidate, offering high conductivity, stability, and the advantage of using abundant elements. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that tungsten (W) doping in CNFS, combined with an increased concentration of sulfur vacancies, can effectively shift the d‐band center downward enhancing metal‐sulfur orbital hybridization. These modifications facilitate the desorption of oxygen intermediate while maintaining structural integrity. Additionally, the engineering of this material with a hollow architecture further increases active site exposure, significantly improving catalytic activity. As a result of this multifaceted approach, the W‐doped CNFS catalyst achieves a remarkably low OER overpotential of 241 mV at 50 mA cm⁻ 2 , alongside enhanced ORR activity. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates excellent performance in rechargeable zinc–air batteries (ZABs), achieving a peak power density of 100 mW cm⁻ 2 and sustaining over 650 h of cycling at 4 mA cm⁻ 2 . Overall, this study presents a viable strategy for improving ZAB performance and reducing costs by utilizing efficient and cost‐effective metal sulfides with a cobalt pentlandite structure.

Dye-sensitization is a promising strategy to improve the light absorption and photoactivity abilities of wide-bandgap semiconductors, like TiO2. For effective water-splitting photoanodes with no sacrificial agents, the electrochemical potential of the dye must exceed the thermodynamic threshold needed for the oxygen evolution reaction. This study investigates two promising organic cyanoacrylic dyes, designed to meet that criterion by means of theoretical calculations. Both yellow-colored dyes were synthesized and characterized by optical and photoelectrochemical techniques, demonstrating strong light absorption in the visible region, suitable experimental reduction potentials, and adsorption from the organic solvent onto mesoporous TiO2 layers. In addition, to promote immobilization in aqueous electrolytes, the dyes were hybridized with graphene oxide or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Photoelectrochemical analysis of the dye-sensitized photoelectrodes demonstrated efficient charge transfer from the dyes to the TiO2 photoanode under simulated solar light. While the starting photocurrent notably surpassed the blank TiO2, a subsequent decay points to kinetic obstacles that still need to be overcome.

Seawater electrolysis is an ideal technology for obtaining clean energy—green hydrogen. Developing efficient bifunctional catalysts is crucial for hydrogen production through direct seawater electrolysis. Currently, metal substrates loaded with active catalysts are widely employed as electrodes for seawater electrolysis. However, the challenge of metal corrosion cannot be ignored. In this work, the boron-doped diamond (BDD) with excellent corrosion resistance was explored as a substrate for loading active catalysts in seawater electrolysis. A step-by-step electrodeposition method was used to fabricate the FeCoS/Ni/BDD electrode, effectively addressing the poor adhesion of the FeCoS active layer to the BDD substrate. The resulting electrode demonstrated interesting bifunctional catalytic performance, achieving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials of 425 mV and 360 mV, respectively, in alkaline simulated seawater (1 M KOH and 3.5 wt% NaCl) at a current density of 100 mA cm− 2. Furthermore, by increasing the KOH concentration in the alkaline simulated seawater to 3 M, the OER and HER overpotentials of the electrode significantly decreased to 383 and 300 mV, respectively. This work offers a novel approach for utilizing BDD substrates in the design of corrosion-resistant electrodes for alkaline seawater electrolysis.

It is especially essential to develop high-performance and low-cost nonprecious metal catalysts for large-scale hydrogen production. A large number of electrochemical catalysts composited by transition metal centers has been reported; however, it is still a great challenge to design and manipulate target electrocatalysts to realize high overall water-splitting activity at the atomic level. Herein, we develop totally new P-(Fe,V)-codoped metastable-phase β-NiMoO4. As an electrocatalyst, it can realize oxygen evolution at only 163 mV and hydrogen evolution at only 44 mV at 10 mA cm–2. It, as both an anode and a cathode, is fabricated into a cell for overall water splitting, which has an ultralow voltage value of 1.48 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and can remain stable for at least 100 h. In the target electrode, the P element plays three important roles: (1) it can stabilize the metastable-phase structure of β-NiMoO4; (2) it can further optimize the electronic structure; and (3) it can provide more active sites. The synergistic effect for multimetal centers with different redox couples is key for the great improvement of catalytic activity. The related mechanism is discussed in detail.

Rechargeable Zn-air batteries (RZABs) are poised for industrial application, yet they require low-cost, high-performance catalysts that efficiently facilitate both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The pivotal challenge lies in designing multimetal active sites and optimizing the carbon skeleton structure to modulate catalyst activity. In this study, we introduce a novel hierarchical porous carbon-supported FeCoNi bifunctional catalyst, synthesized via a spray combustion method. The carbon, derived from sucrose, was tailored into a hierarchical porous morphology through etching with NO3- ions and NaCl, thereby significantly increasing the surface area for the interaction of the O2 and electrolyte interaction. The in situ formation of FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles ensures their uniform dispersion and anchoring, facilitating electron transport. The strong interaction and charge transfer at the heterogeneous FeCoNi alloy interfaces, along with nitrogen doping, which enhances the OER/ORR activity, endow the FeCoNi/N-PC catalyst with exceptional bifunctional catalytic properties, characterized by an activity parameter of 0.73 V. Furthermore, the RZAB assembled with this catalyst demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and reversibility, with a minimal round-trip efficiency decay of 7.6% over 1380 cycles (460 h) at 10 mA cm-2.

Abstract Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are attractive cathode candidates for rechargeable secondary batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, LTMOs suffer from severe capacity attenuation, voltage decay, and sluggish kinetics, resulting from irreversible lattice oxygen evolution and unstable cathode‐electrolyte interface. Besides, LTMOs accumulate surface residual alkali species, like hydroxides and carbonates, during synthesis, limiting their practical application. Herein, a universal strategy is suggested to in situ convert surface residual alkali into a stable polymer coating layer for LTMOs, thus turning wastes into treasure. The formation process of polymer coating involves NH 4 F treatment to consume residual alkali, then utilizing generated fluorides to induce the ring‐opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Implementing this strategy to Li‐rich Mn‐based cathode materials (LRM) results in a notable reduction in voltage hysteresis, along with enhanced kinetics and cycling stability in lithium‐ion batteries. With this layer of encapsulation, surface lattice oxygen release and layered‐to‐spinel phase transition of LRM are significantly alleviated with minimal mechanical degradation and surface parasitic reactions. Such strategy can also be applied to air‐sensitive sodium‐rich LTMOs in sodium‐ion batteries, which showcases superior universality. This work might provide a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for LTMOs in practical application.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials present novel electronic and catalytic performances, showing a promising application as nano-device. In this investigation, a family of 2D material, X 2 B 6 (X = K, Na and Rb), is predicted with puckered crystal structure by elemental mutation method. The dynamic and thermal stability of the X 2 B 6 monolayer is addressed. The anisotropic mechanical properties of the X 2 B 6 monolayer is obtained by the Young’s modulus (296–406 N/m) and the Poisson’s ratio (0.36–0.35). Interestingly, the K 2 B 6 and Rb 2 B 6 monolayers demonstrate a metallic band structure, while the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is a semiconductor with an ultra-narrow bandgap only about 0.42 eV. Then, the ultra-high electron mobility in the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is calculated as about 9942 cm 2 .V −1 .s −1 , and the excellent optical performance of the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is also addressed. More importantly, the advantageous catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reduction (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is explored in these X 2 B 6 monolayers. Our work suggests a theoretical guidance to use the X 2 B 6 monolayer as a high-speed electronic devices and highly efficient catalyst.

Abstract The idea of grid‐scale hydrogen production by water electrolysis has been made possible by developing catalyst‐anchored three‐dimensional (3D) foam‐based electrodes. Catalytic performance in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions is improved by incorporating catalyst in 3D interlinked porous architecture, which enhances electrical conductivity and speeds up the discharge of gas bubbles. The detailed study on the role‐play of 3D frameworks in energy generation is explained in this article. The review also focuses on the recent development in utilizing these 3D substrates in the field of electrochemistry. Furthermore, it is imperative to enhance their compatibility with renewable energy systems and high‐temperature electrolysis for the sustainable production of hydrogen. Therefore, this review briefly explores the innovative design of self‐supported 3D framework electrodes using heterostructures and doping techniques to develop stable, durable, and efficient electrocatalysts. These catalysts aim to provide near‐zero overpotential, high selectivity, and long‐term stability for hydrogen production through water electrolysis, paving the way for commercial‐scale green energy production. 3D foam‐based electrodes can emerge as a key technology in the field of electrochemistry.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials with multifunctional properties, such as negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), magnetism, catalysis, and energy storage capabilities, are of significant interest for advanced applications in flexible electronics, spintronics, catalysis, and lithium-ion batteries. However, the discovery of such materials, particularly in low-dimensional forms, remains a challenge. In this study, we perform high-throughput density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore a new class of 2D V-shaped monolayers with remarkable physicochemical properties. Among 18 stable $M_4X_8$ (M = transition metal; X = halogen) compounds, we identify 9 auxetic monolayers, with \ce{Pd4I8} standing out for its exceptionally high NPR of -0.798. Notably, 4 of these materials exhibit half semiconductor properties, while 5 others are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, offering a unique combination of electronic and magnetic behavior. Additionally, these materials demonstrate promising catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) and show potential as anodes for rechargeable metal-ion batteries, particularly in alkali-ion systems. This work not only expands the family of 2D NPR materials but also introduces new candidates with multifunctional capabilities for a wide range of applications in nanoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage.

Abstract Alloying atomically dispersed noble metals with earth‐abundant transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) presents a promising approach to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, the challenge remains of reducing the size of the NPs without sacrificing high activity and durability. In this study, Ru–Co 2 Ni nanoalloy particles (NAPs) encapsulated in nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) are introduced, forming a core‐shell electrocatalyst (Ru–Co 2 Ni@NCNT). This design leverages Ru site optimization, CNT density control, strain engineering, efficient water dissociation, and outstanding bubble release dynamics within the core‐shell structure. These factors significantly improve catalytic performance with low overpotentials of 35 and 57 mV overpotential in 1.0 m KOH and 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 solutions, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that while Ru sites serve as active sites, they also modify the electronic structure of Co and Ni, optimizing their hydrogen adsorption energies and improving HER efficiency. The Ru–Co 2 Ni@NCNT catalyst is successfully integrated into both anion exchange membrane (AEM) and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, demonstrating stable operation at 0.5 A cm −2 for 500 h, underscoring its potential for efficient and durable hydrogen production.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are considered to be the most important processes in metal–air batteries and regenerative fuel cell devices. Metal–organic polymers are attracting interest as promising precursors of advanced metal/carbon electrocatalysts because of their hierarchical porous structure along with the integrated metal–carbon framework. We developed carbon-coated CNTs with Ni/Fe and Cu/Fe as active sites. Experimental observations from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption analysis suggest that C@CNT[Ni] outperforms C@CNT[Cu] in the ORR and OER, which is further supported by density functional theory calculations. C@CNT[Ni] exhibits a higher onset potential (0.99 V vs RHE) and a smaller Tafel slope (40.2 mV decade–1) compared to those of C@CNT/[Cu] in an alkaline electrolyte (0.94 V vs RHE and 46.5 mV decade–1, respectively). Such circumstances are attributed to the alloying effect between Ni and Fe in C@CNT[Ni], in contrast to the existing copper iron oxide phase in C@CNT/[Cu]. It is noteworthy that C@CNT[Ni] also displayed an improved OER, demanding its bifunctional property. As a proof of concept, C@CNT[Ni] was utilized in zinc–air batteries, which shows a high energy efficiency of ∼60%, a small charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.78 V, and excellent cycling performance (∼120 h) at 5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C. This protocol expands the utility of novel metal–organic hyper-cross-linked polymer-derived bimetallic electrocatalysts for clean energy research.

Avoiding atmospheric pollution with sulfur dioxide is generally achieved by its absorption from combustion gases in alkaline solutions and conversion to sulfites. Afterwards, sulfites can be transformed into neutral and environmentally safe chemicals by oxidation to sulfates. The oxidation of sulfites to sulfates can also be carried out in a cell in which the fuel will be sulfite ions. In this way, in addition to the beneficial effect of neutralizing large quantities of sulfite waste, electrical energy is also obtained. This is one of the reasons why study of the anodic oxidation of sulfite to sulfate on various electrode materials was necessary. Given the sensitivity of electrode materials in the presence of sulfur compounds, in our research we approached the study of sulfite oxidation on the Incoloy 800 anode in neutral solution (1 mol L−1 Na2SO4). In this research, the results obtained in the study of the kinetic parameters of the anodic process as a function of the sulfite concentration (10−1, 0.5, and 1 mol L−1), using linear voltammetry, are presented. The appreciable values of the exchange current density (3.4, 3.0, and 2.6 A m−2) show that Incoloy 800 has a significant catalytic effect in the anodic oxidation of sulfite. Chronoamperometric studies have shown that the anodic oxidation of sulfite is controlled by the mass transfer of sulfite ions from the bulk solution to the electrode surface. According to the chronocoulometric diagrams, it can be appreciated that, up to anodic potentials of +1.50 V, sulfite oxidation occurs on the electrode, while at more positive potentials, the oxygen evolution reaction is the main process. Electrochemical impedance data provide evidence of a chemical reaction coupled with electron transfer, which was modeled using a Gerischer impedance. At high sulfite concentrations, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) decreases by a factor of 10, indicating that the sulfite oxidation reaction is fast at sufficiently positive potentials. On the other hand, the passivation tendency of stainless steels upon anodic polarization gives them a high corrosion resistance, so that Incoloy 800 can be a viable option as an anode material for sulfite/oxygen (air) fuel cells.

Abstract Perovskite‐type oxides having composition La x Sm 0.8− x Sr 0.2 NiO 3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) were explored for their ability to act as facilitators for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Synthesis of the materials was conducted through a sol‐gel procedure via malic acid. The materials underwent advanced physicochemical characterization utilizing techniques, namely transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) and X‐ray diffraction (XRD). These analyses provided crucial details about the material’s particle size, surface morphology/chemical composition and crystalline structure, opening up exciting possibilities for their diverse applications. From TEM analysis, the average particle size of the oxide materials has been estimated and found to be 5.9 nm for Sm 0.8 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 and 4.8 nm for La 0.6 Sm 0.2 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 . The particle size of the oxide material decreases when La was partially substituted for Sm in Sm 0.8 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 . Cyclic voltammetry and Tafel plot were observed for the electrochemical analysis in 1 M KOH (25 °C). An investigation on the anodic polarization of oxides revealed an increased electrocatalytic activity when La was partially substituted for Sm in Sm 0.8 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 . La 0.6 Sm 0.2 Sr 0.2 NiO 3 was found to be most active at 800 mV with a current density, j = 184.1 mA/cm 2 . The Tafel experiment was conducted in 1M KOH at varying temperatures to determine thermodynamic properties like standard electrochemical energy of activation (), standard enthalpy of activation (Δ H ° # ), and standard entropy of activation (Δ S ° # ).

Recent ground- and space-based surveys have shown that planets between Earth and Neptune in size, known as "super-Earths," are among the most frequently found planets in the Galaxy. Although the JWST era has provided high-quality atmospheric data on several such super-Earths, modeling tools are crucial for understanding their unobservable interiors. Consequently, interior studies represent the next essential step in gaining a comprehensive understanding of this class of exoplanets. This study investigates the interior structure, thermal evolution, and atmospheric dynamics of the super-Earth GJ 486b using SERPINT, a 1-D self-consistent coupled interior structure and evolution model, aiming to understand the planet's thermal evolution based on an Earth-like structure. Our results indicate that GJ 486b's core is approximately 1.34 times larger than Earth's, with a core pressure of about 1171 GPa. The thermal evolution model predicts that the planet's mantle cools and solidifies over approximately 0.93 million years. As the magma ocean cools, water is released from the melt, forming a water-rich atmosphere during early solidification. Photolysis of water vapor and subsequent hydrogen escape lead to oxygen accumulation, forming a water- and oxygen-rich secondary atmosphere. Future high-sensitivity JWST observations, with improved wavelength coverage and the detection of additional trace gases, will enable a detailed analysis of the planet's atmospheric composition, providing crucial insights into the interior, surface, and subsurface properties of GJ 486b.

Global oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) often reach hypoxia but seldom reach anoxia. Recently it was reported that Michaelis Menten constants (Km) of oxidative enzymes are orders of magnitude higher than respiratory Km values, and in the Hypoxic Barrier Hypothesis it was proposed that, in ecosystems experiencing falling oxygen, oxygenase enzyme activities become oxygen-limited long before respiration. We conducted a mesocosm experiment with a phytoplankton bloom as an organic carbon source and controlled dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the dark to determine whether hypoxia slows carbon oxidation and oxygen decline. Total oxygen utilization (TOU) in hypoxic treatment (ca. 7.1 µM O2) was 21.7% lower than the oxic treatment (ca. 245.1 µM O2) over the first 43 days of the experiment. In addition, following the restoration of fully oxic conditions to the hypoxic treatment, TOU accelerated, demonstrating that oxidative processes are sensitive to DO concentrations found in large volumes of the ocean. Microbial amplicon-based community composition diverged between oxic treatments, indicating a specialized microbiome that included Thioglobaceae (SUP05 Gammaproteobacteria), OM190 (Planctomycetota), ABY1 (Patescibacteria), and SAR86 subclade D2472, thrived in the hypoxic treatment, while the genus Candidatus Actinomarina and SAR11 alphaproteobacteria were sharply inhibited. Our findings support the hypothesis that oxygenase kinetics might slow the progression of ocean deoxygenation in oxygen-poor regions and be a factor in the evolution of microbial taxa adapted to hypoxic environments.

Dual-atom catalysts featuring synergetic dinuclear active sites, have the potential of breaking the linear scaling relationship of the well-established single-atom catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction; however, the design of dual-atom catalysts with rationalized local microenvironment for high activity and selectivity remains a great challenge. Here we design a bisalphen ladder polymer with well-defined densely populated binuclear cobalt sites on Ketjenblack substrates. The strong electron coupling effect between the fully-conjugated ladder structure and carbon substrates enhances the electron transfer between the cobalt center and oxygen intermediates, inducing the low-to-high spin transition for the 3d electron of Co(II). In situ techniques and theoretical calculations reveal the dynamic evolution of Co2N4O2 active sites and reaction intermediates. In alkaline conditions, the catalyst exhibits impressive oxygen reduction reaction activity featuring an onset potential of 1.10 V and a half-wave potential of 1.00 V, insignificant decay after 30,000 cycles, pushing the overpotential boundaries of ORR electrocatalysis to a low level. This work provides a platform for designing efficient dual-atom catalysts with well-defined coordination and electronic structures in energy conversion technologies. Designing dual-atom catalysts with high activity and selectivity for oxygen reduction reactions is a challenging task. Here, the authors report a bisalphen ladder polymer with densely populated binuclear cobalt sites on Ketjenblack substrates, which improves oxygen reduction performance and stability.

Abstract Over the last decade, there has been significant advances in our understanding of anaerobic hydrocarbon oxidation in Archaea. While Bacteria are known to oxidise hydrocarbons aerobically, no aerobic hydrocarbon oxidation pathway has been found in Archaea. Here, we report the first aerobic hydrocarbon oxidizing archaeon in a novel order of the Syntropharchaeia. This order is represented by six metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) spanning three genera that are found in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Our analysis revealed that MAGs belonging to one newly defined genus, Candidatus ‘Aerovita’, encode a bacterial copper monooxygenase complex with homology to bacterial hydrocarbon monooxygenases. The presence of other oxygen-dependent enzymes, such as haem-copper oxygen reductase, and the absence of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, indicate an aerobic lifestyle for the Ca. ‘Aerovita’ lineage. These findings support horizontal gene transfer between archaeal and bacterial domains facilitating the evolution of aerobic hydrocarbon-oxidizing archaea.

An organism is considered “alive” if it can grow, reproduce, respond to external stimuli, metabolize nutrients, and maintain stability. By this definition, both mitochondria and viruses exhibit the key characteristics of independent life. In addition to their capacity for self-replication under specifically defined conditions, both mitochondria and viruses can communicate via shared biochemical elements, alter cellular energy metabolism, and adapt to their local environment. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesize that early viral prototype species evolved from ubiquitous environmental DNA and gained the capacity for self-replication within coacervate-like liquid droplets. The high mutation rates experienced in this environment streamlined their acquisition of standard genetic codes and adaptation to a diverse set of host environments. Similarly, mitochondria, eukaryotic intracellular organelles that generate energy and resolve oxygen toxicity, originally evolved from an infectious bacterial species and maintain their capacity for active functionality within the extracellular space. Thus, while mitochondria contribute profoundly to eukaryotic cellular homeostasis, their capacity for freestanding existence may lead to functional disruptions over time, notably, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, a phenomenon strongly linked to aging-related disorders. Overall, a more in-depth understanding of the full extent of the evolution of both viruses and mitochondria from primordial precursors may lead to novel insights and therapeutic strategies to address neurodegenerative processes and promote healthy aging.

ABSTRACT The synergistic influence of discrepancy in exothermic behavior of two types of polyacrylonitrile‐based precursor fibers (labeled as fiber A and B) and the continuous gradient pre‐oxidation conditions on stabilization structure were studied. The evolution and development process of skin‐core structure at different stabilization stages and corresponding influencing factors was clarified. Results showed fiber A had gentle exothermic behavior, smaller exothermic rates, and weaker heat flow, while fiber B had faster exothermic rates and concentrated heat flow, especially at stabilization later stage. Stabilization behaviors revealed that the cyclization index (Ic), oxidation index (Io), dehydrogenation index (Id), aromatization index (AI), X‐ray stabilization index, O elements, and bulk density increased with proceeds of pre‐oxidation. The relationship between the aromatization cross‐linked structure, bulk density, and chemical structure indicated that cyclization, dehydrogenation, and oxidation reactions jointly promoted the formation of aromatization cross‐linked conjugated lamellar structure. Under the same pre‐oxidation conditions, the stabilization degree of fiber B was much higher than that of fiber A. Meanwhile, a more serious inhomogeneous structure appeared at the early stage and further deteriorated at a later stage, which is related to its concentrated exothermic behavior, locally high temperature in the core and nonuniform oxygen distribution in the radial direction. These factors become the internal factors that affect the formation and development of skin‐core structure. By adjusting temperature and gradient distribution as well as shortening time, the skin‐core structure disappeared without compromising the stabilization degree. The formation of the skin‐core structure was controlled by chemical reactions at early stage but by double diffusion and locally high temperature in the core at the later stage. In order to promoted oxygen diffusion, the Ic, Io, and AI values at the initial stage should be controlled below 0.8%, 0.36%, and 32%, respectively. The principles, reasons, and regulatory mechanisms for optimizing the stabilization structure and set proper pre‐oxidation procedures were provided.

The solar transition region (TR) is a narrow interface between the chromosphere and corona, where emitted radiation contains critical information pertinent to coronal heating processes. We conducted 2-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations using adaptive mesh refinement to spatially resolve the fine structure of the TR while simultaneously capturing the larger-scale dynamics originating from surface convection. The time evolution of ionization fractions for oxygen ions is computed alongside the simulations. A minimum grid size of 1.25 km is achieved in the TR, enabling adequate resolution of the upper TR (log$_{10}T \gtrsim$ 5), although the lower TR (log$_{10}T \lesssim$ 5) remains under-resolved. Doppler shifts and nonthermal widths synthesized from TR lines exhibit convergence with grid sizes as coarse as 40 km, though some discrepancies persist between our results and observed TR line properties. A notable enhancement in emission from \ion{O}{6} lines, converging at a grid size of 2.5 km, shows an intensity 1.2 times that expected under ionization equilibrium, attributable to shock interactions with the TR. While model refinements are still required, our ability to resolve the TR offers critical insights into TR line characteristics arising from non-equilibrium ionization states, advancing our understanding of the coronal heating problem.

Abstract Gold catalysts are extensively utilized in photothermal processes that rely on localized surface plasmon resonance effects. However, the development of novel gold(I)‐organic frameworks that function as highly efficient photothermal catalysts for the production of hydrogen peroxide from water and oxygen presents a fascinating and challenging research opportunity. Herein, three gold(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes (Au‐CTCs) based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are prepared, exhibiting good photothermal conversion efficiency and H 2 O 2 evolution rates. Utilizing the optimized Au‐TFPT, the production rates of H₂O₂ can reach as high as 51,987 µ m g⁻¹ h⁻¹, surpassing the performance of most reported metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), even with the use of sacrificial agents to accelerate the reaction. The thermal‐assisted photocatalytic mechanism is comprehensively studied by transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance, electron paramagnetic resonance, rotating ring disk electrode test, catalytic performance and among others, demonstrating thermal energy can enhance the mobility of photogenerated carriers and apparent quantum yield, regulate the reactive species ratio and H 2 O 2 selectivity, reduce the apparent activation energy of photocatalysis, and improve mass transfer rates, thereby accelerating the reaction process. This study offers new insights into the thermal‐assisted photocatalytic production of H 2 O 2 .

Local adaptations are important in evolution as they drive population divergence and preserve standing genetic diversity essential for resilience under climate change and human impacts. Protecting locally adapted populations is essential for aquaculture species. However, high larval connectivity and frequent translocations challenge this in Chilean blue mussel (Mytilus chilensis) aquaculture, a world-class industry in Chiloé Island. This study examined local adaptations in two ecologically distinct natural beds, Cochamó (northernmost inner sea of Chiloé) and Yaldad (southernmost tip), through a 91-day reciprocal transplant experiment and genomic evidence. Cochamó mussels grew faster in their native environment (0.015 g/day) than Yaldad (0.004 g/day), though growth declined upon transplantation. Mussels transplanted within and between beds displayed distinctive adaptive transcriptomic responses, with differentially expressed genes involved with immune function, osmoregulation, metabolism, and cellular balance. Additionally, 58 known outlier SNPs mapped over the species’ genome sequence were linked with adaptive genes involved with osmoregulation, oxidative stress, and oxygen management, revealing selection-targeted specific genome regions. This study highlights how translocations affect the adaptive genomic response of M. chilensis and the impact of local environments in counterbalancing its genetic connectivity, concluding that the genomic differences in natural beds should be monitored and conserved for sustainable aquaculture practices.

Exploiting biomimetic perception of invisible spectra in flexible artificial human vision systems (HVSs) is crucial for real-time dynamic information processing. Nevertheless, the fast processing of motion objects in natural environments poses a challenge, necessitating that these artificial HVSs simultaneously have swift photoresponse and nonvolatile memory. Here, inspired by the human retina, we propose a flexible UV neuromorphic visual synaptic device (NeuVSD) based on GaOx@GaN-composited nanowires for dynamic visual perception. Benefiting from the combined action of oxygen adsorption kinetics on the GaOx shell and photoelectronic excitation in the GaN core, the NeuVSD can achieve rapid photoresponse and long-term plasticity simultaneously, a feature that surpasses traditional devices based on persistent photoconductivity mechanisms. Beyond the optoelectronic synaptic plasticity, the flexible NeuVSD on the PET/PI substrate exhibits good performance stability after 1000 bending cycles, profiting from the high adaptability of nanowires. Furthermore, target recognition and motion detection with weak light intensities are achieved through the establishment of neuromorphic visual neural networks, relying on dynamic exposures and edge information processing, respectively. Real-time edge detection can still be realized under a 40% noise factor and effectively remove the noise background. The flexible NeuVSD array-based artificial visual system can enhance the capability of dynamic visual information processing in low-light and high-noise conditions, thereby fostering the evolution of in-sensor computing and artificial intelligence.

Nova shells are the remnants of a nova eruption in a cataclysmic variable system. By studying their geometry we can better understand the physical mechanisms that shape them during the nova eruption. A nova shell that challenges our current understanding of these processes is the shell observed around V1425 Aql. It has at least two different components: an inner and symmetric shell, and an outer and asymmetric shell, with the latter expanding faster than the former. The physical reason behind the asymmetric ejecta is not clear. We aim to characterize the properties and differences between these two components to understand the origin behind the unusual shape. We acquired MUSE data to study the spatial position and kinematics of the expanding gas across the shell. Our analysis includes channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and the reconstruction of the 3D geometry of the nova shell. Several emission lines are detected within the MUSE wavelength coverage, including but not limited to Balmer, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Helium lines. There are significant differences in the spectra of the inner and outer shells, with the latter being observed only in forbidden transitions, while the inner shows a mix of forbidden and allowed ones. Our analysis reveals that the outer shell has a geometry consistent with an arc-shaped structure that partially encircles the more spherical inner shell. Within the inner shell, clumpy structures start to be noticeable in the lines of H$\alpha$+[Nii]. We have constrained the geometry of the outer shell to an arc-shaped structure, although the physical reason behind its origin is still eluding us. Further monitoring of the evolution of both shells in this object might help to clarify the mechanism behind this unusual configuration.

Traditional water injection profile monitoring primarily relies on methods such as isotope tracers and oxygen activation. Conventional resistive temperature instruments, which are drag-measured, are highly sensitive to production interference and can only capture the transient temperature response of the wellbore at a single depth. As a result, the temperature data obtained from well temperature logging has certain limitations. Using DTS (Distributed Temperature Sensing) for pre-and post-well opening and shut-in water injection profile testing, along with quantitative analysis of water absorption, addresses the limitations of traditional well temperature logging, which typically offers only qualitative insights. However, the interpretation of DTS data still requires further refinement to improve its alignment with actual conditions. In this study, COMSOL software 6.1 was used to simulate the temperature distribution within the downhole temperature field, both spatially and temporally. The Sobol method was employed to analyze the influence of fluid flow rate and rock thermal conductivity on the temperature field. The results indicated that the fluid flow rate in the wellbore has a more significant impact and is the primary controlling factor of the downhole temperature field. Based on actual field conditions and the forward simulation results, the differential evolution algorithm was applied to invert and interpret the water injection profile. The inversion results showed minimal error, confirming the feasibility of this approach. It is helpful to interpret the well temperature profile measured by the distributed fiber optic temperature sensor, which is helpful to improve the ability of well temperature logging to identify the output profile, which has important academic value and practical significance for the development of water injection wells.

The paper presents new data on the structure and composition of ultramafic rocks in the eastern part of the South Kraka massif. It is shown that the studied area is composed predominantly of spinel peridotites, among which the main role belongs to lherzolites with a low content of clinopyroxene (2–5%) and harzburgites, among which lens-shaped and bandshaped inclusions of monomineral olivine rocks – dunites – are quite often observed. The leading role in the structure of the rocks belongs to high-Mg olivine (Fo 87-94 ), a secondary role (2016). Nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Arabian Shield and genesis of Al-spinel micropods: Evidence from the mantle xenoliths of Harrat is played by high-Mg orthopyroxene (enstatite) and Ca-Mg clinopyroxene diopside. Rare minerals of the mantle stage are amphibole and plagioclase. A typical accessory mineral of ultramafic rocks is spinel, the composition of which varies from high-Al in lherzolites (Cr# = 0.16–0.3), to moderate-Al in harzburgites (Cr# = 0.3–0.55) and to high-Cr in dunites (Cr# = 0.6–0.85). Of the rare accessory minerals in the rocks, the following were identified: native copper, pentlandite, awaruite and PGM (laurite, irarsite, Os-Ir-Ru-alloys). The section of mantle ultramafic rocks of the Sargan Range completed its high-temperature evolution to the levels of the plagioclase peridotite facies, partly in the transition zone from spinel to plagioclase facies. An assessment of oxygen fugacity allows us to speak about more reducing conditions for the formation of rocks of the studied area compared to other similar formations of upper mantle origin and allows us to classify the studied ultramafic rocks as moderately depleted restites of the upper mantle under the riftogenic structure of the Paleo-Ural basin. The geochemical specialization of PGM also indicates a restite origin of ultramafic rocks. At the stage of cooling and tectonic transformations in the crust, ultramafic rocks underwent serpentinization.

Metallicity is a crucial tracer of galaxy evolution, providing insights into gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. At high redshift, these processes reveal how early galaxies assembled and enriched their interstellar medium. In this work, we present rest-frame optical spectroscopy of 12 massive ($\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})>9$) galaxies at $z\sim 6$-$8$ from the REBELS ALMA large program, observed with JWST NIRSpec/IFU in the prism mode. These observations span emission lines from [OII]$\lambda$3727,9 to [SII]$\lambda$6716,31, providing key information on nebular dust attenuation, ionisation states, and chemical abundances. We find lower O32 ratios (average $\sim3.7$) and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 equivalent widths (average ${EW_{[OIII]}}\sim390$\AA) than are generally found in existing large spectroscopic surveys at $z>6$, indicating less extreme ionising conditions. Strong-line diagnostics suggest that these systems are some of the most metal-rich galaxies observed at $z>6$ (average $Z_{\mathrm{gas}}\sim 0.4 Z_{\odot}$), including sources with near-solar oxygen abundances, in line with their high stellar masses (average $\log{M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}}\sim9.5$). Supplementing with literature sources at lower masses, we investigate the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations (MZR and FMR, respectively) over a 4 dex stellar mass range at $63$ studies.

Background Maintaining good cardiopulmonary fitness is crucial for global health in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), but there is limited knowledge about the longitudinal evolution of fitness measures at young ages, particularly with recent therapeutic advances. We investigated trends in exercise test outcomes in young people with CF (PwCF) and how they are influenced by elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) and the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods 70 young PwCF (12 to 20 years) were included in this retrospective observational single-centre study. We reviewed 177 symptom-limited surveillance cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) conducted on a cycle ergometer between 2010 and 2024. Longitudinal trends in peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak ), maximal workload, and ventilation were analysed using linear mixed models, separately for periods before and after the COVID-19 pandemic onset and ETI introduction. Results In ETI-naïve PwCF, VO 2peak was lower, and the increase from 12 to 20 years was smaller than predicted by validated reference data (p<0.001). Forty PwCF started ETI during the observational period with 46/103 tests performed under ETI (median therapy duration 1.6 years, range: 0.4–3.9). After ETI introduction, VO 2peak improved significantly, while ventilation and maximal workload were not relevantly affected. ETI approval coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, during which a steeper decline of VO 2peak in ETI-naïve PwCF was observed. However, this potential confounder did not significantly impact the overall longitudinal improvement in VO 2peak trajectory following ETI introduction (p<0.05). Conclusion The longitudinal trend in VO 2peak progression from adolescence to young adulthood is impaired in PwCF, but the initiation of ETI can have a positive impact on this trajectory.

The role of the State in the exercise of typical state activity in the face of international responsibility and sovereignty.The thesis aims to analyze the theme of international responsibility of the State in the exercise of empire activity.In the work, contextualizes the theme, relating it to the new challenges of DIMA and the protection of the marine environment.Discusses the sea and its importance for life, as a source of food and in the production of spare oxygen, in addition to its use for various human activities, especially in the transport of goods, in general, and oil, to demonstrate the importance of this study.It addresses the sea strips.It is a division for legal purposes, behold, the sea, in the general sense, understand the oceans and seas, is unique, thus only having the objective of establishing territoriality, sovereignty and sovereignty rights.This study is important for a better understanding of the attribution of the international responsibility of the State.Briefly, the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, the continental shelf, the high sea and the Area are analyzed.Several conventions of importance to the DIMA and to the Law of the Sea are analyzed about their implications to the State when using ships in the exercise of governmental activity or warships.As a rule, the various conventions addressed are important in the protective system of the marine environment, but have reservations regarding the application to warships or that are at the service of the State in carrying out typical activity, constituting true immunity to states when exercising empire activity.Among the conventions analyzed, we highlight the OILPOL Convention, 1954; the Convention on Intervention in the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969; the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969; the SOLAS Convention, 1974, and the ISPS, IMDG, ISM and HSC Codes; the MARPOL 73/78 Convention and theMontego Bay Convention, among others.Issues related to sovereignty and international accountability are addressed: current studies and projects related to the theme.In relation to sovereignty, the objective is to punctuate its evolution to the current times and the change of its nature, no longer seen as an obstacle to the responsability of the State but as an institute to assign responsibilities.At work, we seek to bring several institutes that can assist in the international responsability of the State more effectively or that there is greater commitment to the protective system of the marine environment, such as cooperation; the possible application of proportionality and reasonableness, although they are institutes of internal law focused on the application of principles of constitutional law; emphasis on the principles of prevention and precaution, as mitigating possible responsability; valuing soft law and sources of international law; a reading of the application of human rights from the perspective of environmental protection and the analysis of rhetoric in DIMA.And, finally, the conclusion whether or not there is the international responsibility of the state for the act of empire.The development of the work will have as main approach method the dialectic, in order to identify possible contradictions between conventions and principles of DIMA.Inductive, deductive, hypothetical-deductive and systemic methods will also be used.

The membrane electrode assembly in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) functions as the electrochemical reaction region, where the generated electric current relies on the diffusion of reactant gases and electron conduction. Drawing inspiration from biomechanics, this study embarked on constructing a database of PEMFC performance data. Similar to how biomechanical studies use advanced imaging and sensing techniques to map the internal workings of organisms, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were employed to capture the intricate fluid and gas behaviors within the fuel cell. The data was then used to train data-driven surrogate models based on artificial neural network (ANN) and improved differential evolution for rapid prediction and optimization. When considering the biomechanical aspects, we analyze the mechanical stresses and strains that occur within the membrane electrode assembly during operation. These biomechanical factors can affect the durability and performance of the fuel cell. The gas diffusion layer (GDL) is similar to the pore structure in biological tissues. The pore structure of biological organisms, such as bones, not only ensures the diffusion and transport of nutrients, but also provides space for the attachment of cells to maintain the growth and metabolism of bones. The optimization results revealed that the pores of the GDL, just like the pores of biological tissues, affect the diffusion efficiency of the reactant gases (similar to nutrients) to the catalytic layer, and an appropriate porosity ensures the supply of the reactants required for the electrochemical reactions inside the cell, and improves the PEMFC performance of the cell. By utilizing the random forest algorithm (RF) to conduct feature importance evaluation, we can gain further understanding and interpretation of the factors influencing coupling relationships. The researchers successfully identified the optimal values of GDL porosity and thickness, resulting in an 8.75% increase in power density and significant improvement in oxygen distribution uniformity. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the optimization, the optimized structural parameters were incorporated into CFD simulations. The validation results demonstrated close alignment between the optimized model's performance and actual values, confirming the efficacy and reliability of the optimization framework. Overall, this data-driven optimization approach provides an effective tool for multi-variable optimization of complex systems and holds significant importance in enhancing the performance and power density of PEMFC, while also taking into account the biomechanical factors that influence its long-term operation and stability.

Deciphering the most promising strategy for the evolution of cancer patient management remains a multifaceted, challenging affair to date. Additionally, such approaches often lead to microbial infections as side effects, probably due to the compromised immunity of the patients undergoing such treatment. Distinctly, this work delineates a rational combinatorial strategy harnessing stereogenic harmony in the diphenylalanine fragment, tethering it to an amphiphile 12-hydroxy-lauric acid at the N-terminus (compounds I-III) such that a potential therapeutic could be extracted out from the series. Aligned to the goal, the cytotoxic properties and cell viability of the compounds were investigated using two distinct cell lines: MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell) and HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney). Our rigorous investigations revealed that compounds I-III exhibited substantial cytotoxic impact on the MCF7 cell line. But from a pool of three constructs, compound III (12-hydroxy-lauric acid -d-Phe-l-Phe-OH) showed better selectivity toward cancerous MCF7 over normal HEK 293 in comparison to others, backed by computational calculations. Henceforth, it was fished out from the series and used for its elaborate anticancer activities using cell reactive oxygen species generation, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-dependent gene expression employing extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic factors as well as inflammatory biomarkers, namely, TNF-α and IL1-β. We anticipated that compound III, possessing mechanoresponsiveness and a nanofibrillar network, could be administered in patients with injections because of its shear-thinning properties. Moreover, the optimum partition coefficient of compound III might have allowed the scaffold to penetrate the cellular membranes and form a dilactate complex (compound VI) when exposed to the accumulated lactates/lactic acids, a common phenomenon observed within the hypoxic cancerous tumor cores, in accordance with the Warburg mechanism, thereby evading the cytotoxicity within normal cells. Besides, the supramolecular β-sheets of compound III manifest substantial antimicrobial efficacy against the common pathogens, two Gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus and B. subtilis, two Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and a fungus, C. albicans, along with proteolytic stability and high mechanical strength at physiological pH. Overall, we speculate that the discovery of these multifunctional bioinspired materials holds future promise as preferential therapeutics for the remediation of immune-susceptible cancer patients, afflicted by microbial infections arising alone or as side effects of chemotherapeutic medications.
