The pursuit of carbon‐neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni‐based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine‐rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser‐ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L‐LFP), derived from spent Li‐ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43– species, formed around L‐LFP, effectively repels Cl− ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH– adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high‐performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

Abstract This work illustrates the practicality and economic benefits of employing a hetero‐interfaced electrocatalyst (CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH), containing cobalt sulphide and iron‐cobalt double‐layer hydroxide for large‐scale hydrogen generation. Here, the rational synthesis and detailed characterization of the CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH material to unravel its unique heterostructure are essayed. The CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH operates as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to trigger both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline seawater (pH 14.0) while showcasing low overpotential requirement for HER (311 mV) and OER (450 mV) at 100 mA cm − 2 current density. The identical CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH on either electrode in an H‐cell setup results in simultaneous H 2 and O 2 production from seawater with a ≈98% Faradaic efficiency with an applied potential of 1.96V@100 mA cm − 2 . Next, this CoS 2 @CoFe‐LDH catalyst is deployed on both sides of a membrane electrode assembly in a one‐stack electrolyzer, which retains the intrinsic bifunctional reactivity of the catalyst to generate H 2 and O 2 in tandem from alkaline seawater with an impeccable energy efficiency (50 kWh kg −1 ‐of‐H 2 ). This electrolyzer assembly can be directly linked with a Si‐solar cell to produce truly green hydrogen with a solar‐to‐hydrogen generation efficiency of 15.88%, highlighting the potential of this converting seawater to hydrogen under solar irradiation.

Fe has been reported to play a crucial role in improving the catalytic activity and stability of Ni/Co-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while the Fe effect remains intangible. Here, we design several experiments to identify the activity and stability improvement using porous anodized nickel foam (ANF) as the electrode and 1.0 M KOH containing 1000 μM Fe(III) ions as the electrolyte. Systematic investigations reveal that Ni sites serve as hosts to capture Fe ions to create active FeNi-based intermediates on the surface of ANF to improve the OER activity significantly, and Fe ions regulate catalytic equilibrium and maintain the stability for a long time. The system exhibits 242 and 343 mV overpotentials to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm

Abstract Efficient and stable catalysts are in high demand for accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a high‐entropy sulfide (HES) of (FeCoNiCrCuAl)S@HCS with a 3D structure is successfully prepared by utilizing a simple one‐step solvothermal method and employed as catalyst toward OER. The lower electronegativity of Al compared to the other metal elements and its anti‐corrosion character enable an outstanding OER performance of (FeCoNiCrCuAl)S@HCS with an overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and an excellent durability after 20 000 CV cycles, outperforming the commercial RuO 2 and most reported metal‐sulfide catalysts. Experiments coupled with theoretical calculations reveal that Al atom primarily serves as electron donor and promotes a redistribution of local electrons from Co and Cr toward adjacent Fe, Ni, and Cu sites. As a result, the Cr‐Al site possesses a lowest energy barrier during the rate‐determining step and works as the dominant active site for OER process. This study provides a novel insight and strategy into structural design and performance enhancement for HES materials.

Developing energy‐ and time‐efficient strategies to derive high‐performance non‐precious electrocatalysts for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), especially stably working at industrial‐demanding current density, is still a big challenge. In this work, a concise molten salt erosion scenario was devised to rapidly modulate the smooth surface of the commercial NiMo foam substrate into the rough, electronically coupled, and hierarchically porous Ni/Fe/Mo(oxy)hydroxide catalyst layer assembled by the nanosphere array. This self‐supported catalyst is super‐hydrophilic for the alkaline electrolyte and distinguished by a balanced Mo leaching/surface‐readsorption process to tune the metal d band center and electronic perturbation. The altered electronic environment with the favored OER intermediate adsorption behavior attains the outstanding OER activity in terms of a very small overpotential of 230.21 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and an ultra‐long stability for 1179.45 h to sustain the initial commercial‐level current density of ca. 1000 mA cm‐2. This superb performance transcends most of the edge‐cutting transition metal peers reported recently and can satisfy the standards of industrial applications. This industrial‐compatible synthesis technology holds profound implications for hydrogen production via water splitting and other electrochemical applications.

Designing a high-performing iridium (Ir) single-atom catalyst is desired for acidic water electrolysis, which shows enormous potential given its high catalytic activity toward acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with minimum usage of precious Ir metal. However, it still remains a substantial challenge to stabilize the Ir single atoms during the OER operation without sacrificing the activity. Here, we report a high-performing OER catalyst by immobilizing Ir single atoms on a polyimide support, which exhibits a high mass activity on a carbon paper electrode while simultaneously achieving outstanding stability with negligible decay for 360 h. The resulting electrode (denoted as Ir

Abstract Development of high‐performance, low‐cost catalysts for electrochemical water splitting is key to sustainable hydrogen production. Herein, ultrafast synthesis of carbon‐supported ruthenium–copper (RuCu/C) nanocomposites is reported by magnetic induction heating, where the rapid Joule's heating of RuCl 3 and CuCl 2 at 200 A for 10 s produces Ru–Cl residues‐decorated Ru nanocrystals dispersed on a CuCl x scaffold, featuring effective Ru to Cu charge transfer. Among the series, the RuCu/C‐3 sample exhibits the best activity in 1 m KOH toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an overpotential of only −23 and +270 mV to reach 10 mA cm −2 , respectively. When RuCu/C‐3 is used as bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.53 V is needed to produce 10 mA cm −2 , markedly better than that with a mixture of commercial Pt/C+RuO 2 (1.59 V). In situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the bifunctional activity is due to reduction of the Ru–Cl residues at low electrode potentials that enriches metallic Ru and oxidation at high electrode potentials that facilitates the formation of amorphous RuO x . These findings highlight the unique potential of MIH in the ultrafast synthesis of high‐performance catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.

Abstract The design of a low‐iridium‐loading anode catalyst layer with high activity and durability is a key challenge for a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, the synthesis of a novel supported IrO 2 nanocatalyst with a tri‐layered structure, dubbed IrO 2 @TaO x @TaB that is composed of ultrasmall IrO 2 nanoparticles anchored on amorphous TaO x overlayer of TaB nanorods is reported. The composite electrocatalyst shows great activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, thanks to its dual‐interface structural feature. The electronic interaction in IrO 2 /TaO x interface can regulate the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, the Ir 3+ / Ir 4+ ratio, and the redox peak potential of IrO 2 for enhancing OER activity, while the dense TaO x overlayer can prevent further oxidation of TaB substrate and stabilize the IrO 2 catalytic layers for improving structural stability during OER. The IrO 2 @TaO x @TaB can be used to fabricate an anode catalyst layer of PEMWE with an iridium‐loading as low as 0.26 mg cm −2 . The low‐iridium‐loading PEMWE delivers high current densities at low cell voltages (e.g., 3.9 A cm −2 @2.0 V), and gives excellent activity retention for more than 1500 h at 2.0 A cm −2 current density.

In this investigation, cube-shaped Co3O4 nanoparticles and Co3O4/Ti3C2 MXene nanocomposite were successfully prepared through the solvothermal method. XRD analysis substantiated the cubic structure formation in Co3O4. Morphological and compositional analyses were conducted using FESEM and EDS analysis. The chemical states and surface properties of the materials were explored through XPS analysis. The characterized pristine and composite electro-catalysts were evaluated for oxygen evolution reaction. Co3O4/Ti3C2 MXene nanocomposite catalyst showed reduced over potential of 454 mV. The parameters of Co3O4/Ti3C2 MXene nanocomposite significantly enhanced the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction than the bare Co3O4 nanoparticles.

CoFe-based catalysts are efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Here, we present a simple one-pot hydrothermal method for synthesizing a series of CoFe glycerates with controllable surface morphologies and investigate their potential as highly efficient catalysts for the OER in alkaline media. These CoFe glycerates exhibit a unique yolk-shell microsphere structure assembled from ultrathin nanosheets. The adjustment of the surface nanosheet size is achieved by varying the CoFe ratio, ensuring a more efficient electrocatalytic system for the OER process. Due to the abundant active sites provided by the yolk-shell structure and interleaved ultrathin nanosheets, Co

Abstract Hydrogen, a clean resource with high energy density, is one of the most promising alternatives to fossil. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers are beneficial for hydrogen production because of their high current density, facile operation, and high gas purity. However, the large‐scale application of electrochemical water splitting to acidic electrolytes is severely limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic reaction and the inadequate development of corrosion‐ and highly oxidation‐resistant anode catalysts. Therefore, anode catalysts with excellent performance and long‐term durability must be developed for anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in acidic media. This review comprehensively outlines three commonly employed strategies, namely, defect, phase, and structure engineering, to address the challenges within the acidic OER, while also identifying their existing limitations. Accordingly, the correlation between material design strategies and catalytic performance is discussed in terms of their contribution to high activity and long‐term stability. In addition, various nanostructures that can effectively enhance the catalyst performance at the mesoscale are summarized from the perspective of engineering technology, thus providing suitable strategies for catalyst design that satisfy industrial requirements. Finally, the challenges and future outlook in the area of acidic OER are presented.

Heterogeneous dual‐site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting‐edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in‐situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual‐site O‐O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in‐situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O‐O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe‐Ni(P4O11) as pre‐catalyst, the in‐situ formed Fe‐Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record‐low overpotential of 156.4 mV at current density of 18.0 mA cm‐2. Successfully constructed Fe‐Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

Abstract The seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a significant topic on alleviating the energy crisis. Here, the Fe, Nb‐Ni 3 S 2 catalyst is prepared by metal‐doping strategy, and it shows high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline medium, and only needs 1.491 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm −2 in simulated seawater. Using Fe, Nb‐Ni 3 S 2 as a bifunctional catalyst, the two‐electrode electrolyzer only requires a voltage of 1.751 V (without impedance compensation) to drive the current density of 50 mA cm −2 , and can run over 150 h stably in the simulated seawater. Importantly, In situ Raman test demonstrates that the outstanding performance of Fe, Nb‐Ni 3 S 2 in simulated seawater is ascribed to the in situ formed sulfate protective layer induced by Nb doping, which can effectively inhibit the corrosion of chloride ion, while the protective layer is absent for Fe‐Ni 3 S 2 . The stable operation of simulated seawater electrolysis under industrial current density further confirms the stability improvement mechanism of forming protective layer. In short, this study provides a new strategy of using Nb dopants inducing the formation of protective layer to enhance the stability of seawater electrolysis.

Abstract This work reports a strategy that integrates the carbon nanotube (CNT) supporting, ultrathin carbon coating and oxygen defect generation to fabricate the RuO 2 based catalysts toward the pH‐universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high efficiencies. Specifically, the CNT supported RuO 2 nanoparticles with ultrathin carbon loricae and rich oxygen vacancies at the surface (C@OV‐RuO 2 /CNTs‐325) have been synthesized. The C@OV‐RuO 2 /CNTs‐325 shows superior activities and excellent durability for the HER. It only requires overpotentials of 36.1, 18.0, and 19.3 mV to deliver −10 mA cm −2 in the acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. Its HER activities are comparable to that of the Pt/C in the acidic media but higher than those of the Pt/C in the neutral and alkaline media. The C@OV‐RuO 2 /CNTs‐325 shows excellent HER durability with no activity losses for > 500 h in the acidic, neutral or alkaline media at −250 mA cm −2 . The density‐functional‐theory calculations indicate that the CNT supporting, the carbon coating, and the OVs can modulate the d‐band centers of Ru, increasing the HER activities of C@OV‐RuO 2 /CNTs‐325, and stabilize the Ru atoms in the catalyst, increasing the durability of the C@OV‐RuO 2 /CNTs‐325. More interestingly, the C@OV‐RuO 2 /CNTs‐325 shows great potential for practical applications toward overall seawater splitting.

In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium‐based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and stably operates for 500 hours with a very low degradation rate of 20 μV h‐1. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500 mA cm‐2 for 150 h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3‐anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.

In order to facilitate electrochemical oxygen reactions in electrically rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs), there is a need to develop innovative approaches for efficient oxygen electrocatalysts. Due to their reliability, high energy density, material abundance, and ecofriendliness, rechargeable ZABs hold promise as next-generation energy storage and conversion devices. However, the large-scale application of ZABs is currently hindered by the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the development of heterostructure-based electrocatalysts has the potential to surpass the limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of a single material. This Account begins with an explanation of the configurations of ZABs and the fundamentals of the oxygen electrochemistry of the air electrode. Then, we summarize recent progress with respect to the variety of heterostructures that exploit bifunctional electrocatalytic reactions and overview their impact on ZAB performance. The range of heterointerfacial engineering strategies for improving the ORR/OER and ZAB performance includes tailoring the surface chemistry, dimensionality of catalysts, interfacial charge transfer, mass and charge transport, and morphology. We highlight the multicomponent design approaches that take these features into account to create advanced highly active bifunctional catalysts. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future perspectives on this important topic that aim to enhance the bifunctional activity and performance of zinc-air batteries.

Abstract Compared to lithium (Li) anode, the alloy/Li‐alloy anodes show more compatible with sulfide solid electrolytes (SSEs), and are promising candidates for practical SSE‐based all‐solid‐state Li batteries (ASSLBs). In this work, a porous Li–Al alloy (LiAl‐p) anode is crafted using a straightforward mechanical pressing method. Various characterizations confirm the porous nature of such anode, as well as rich oxygen species on its surface. To the best knowledge, such LiAl‐p anode demonstrates the best room temperature cell performance in comparison with reported Li and alloy/Li‐alloy anodes in SSE‐based ASSLBs. For example, the LiAl‐p symmetric cells deliver a record critical current density of 6.0 mA cm −2 and an ultralong cycling of 5000 h; the LiAl‐p|LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 full cells achieve a high areal capacity of 11.9 mAh cm −2 and excellent durability of 1800 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ experiments reveal that the porous structure can accommodate volume changes of LiAl‐p and ensure its integrity during cycling; and moreover, a robust Li inorganics‐rich solid electrolyte interphase can be formed originated from the reaction between SSE and surface oxygen species of LiAl‐p. This study offers inspiration for designing high‐performance alloy anodes by focusing on designing special architecture to alleviate volume change and constructing stable interphase.

The perovskite‐type oxide (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3, synthesized using lanthanum resources recovered from polishing powder waste and manganese resources obtained from zinc anode mud, was prepared via a facile polymer‐assisted combustion method, and further applied in zinc‐air batteries. The crystal phase and microstructure features of the obtained nanoparticles were characterized usingn (XRD), (SEM), (TEM), (XPS), and nitrogen adsorption‐desorption measurements. The results showed that the obtained (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 nanoparticles, with nanoscale size, possess a high specific surface area and a suitable Mn3+/Mn4+ molar ratio, which will benefit both the(ORR) and the (OER). As expected, the thus‐fabricated (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 electrode exhibits a high current density of 71.2 and 85.2 mA cm‐2 at ‐0.2 V and 0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO, respectively, which is superior to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (58 and 31 mA cm‐2, respectively). Subsequently, this compound oxide can be an air electrode in a rechargeable zinc‐air battery. The assembled battery, using (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 as the cathode, exhibits a discharge voltage of 1.05~1.16 V and a charge voltage of 2.03~2.13 V under 15 mA cm‐2 for 150 h. The excellent electrochemical results presented in this study highlight the potential of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 as a highly efficient and commercially viable bifunctional electrocatalyst for applications in rechargeable zinc‐air batteries.

Abstract Acquiring a highly efficient electrocatalyst capable of sustaining prolonged operation under high current density is of paramount importance for the process of electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, Fe‐doped phosphide (Fe‐Ni 5 P 4 ) derived from the NiFc metal−organic framework (NiFc‐MOF) (Fc: 1,1′‐ferrocene dicarboxylate) shows high catalytic activity for overall water splitting (OWS). Fe‐Ni 5 P 4 ||Fe‐Ni 5 P 4 exhibits a low voltage of 1.72 V for OWS at 0.5 A cm −2 and permits stable operation for 2700 h in 1.0 m KOH. Remarkably, Fe‐Ni 5 P 4 ||Fe‐Ni 5 P 4 can sustain robust water splitting at an extra‐large current density of 1 A cm −2 for 1170 h even in alkaline seawater. Theoretical calculations confirm that Fe doping simultaneously reduces the reaction barriers of coupling and desorption (O * →OOH * , OOH * →O 2 * ) in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and regulates the adsorption strength of the intermediates (H 2 O * , H * ) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), enabling Fe‐Ni 5 P 4 to possess excellent dual functional activity. This study offers a valuable reference for the advancement of highly durable electrocatalysts through the regulation derived from coordination frameworks, with significant implications for industrial applications and energy conversion technologies.

Abstract Green hydrogen production by water splitting holds great potential as a clean and renewable source of energy for sustainable energy solutions. However, the efficiency of this process is hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Overcoming these kinetic hurdles requires the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts. This study explores the effect of transition metal doping on the electrocatalytic properties of Ni(OH) 2 microflowers towards alkaline OER. Transition metal‐doped Ni(OH) 2 microflowers, with highly porous structures due to interconnected nanosheets, are synthesized by a facile, cheap, and scalable chemical bath deposition (CBD), and combined with graphene paper (GP) substrates to fabricate electrodes. Through a systematic exploration of the relationship between the transition metal dopant element type (Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) or concentration and the consequent electrochemical properties, Co‐doping demonstrates improvement in the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 (329 mV), Tafel slope (45 mV dec −1 ), and other key performance indicators of Ni(OH) 2 microflowers for OER. These results are attributed to the high number of active sites and their enhanced electrocatalytic activity benefiting from the presence of the transition metal dopant. The proposed strategy paves the way for the development of cost‐effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting technologies.

Abstract Designing high‐entropy oxyhydroxides (HEOs) electrocatalysts with controlled nanostructures is vital for efficient and stable water‐splitting electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel HEOs material (FeCoNiWCuOOH@Cu) containing five non‐noble metal elements derived by electrodeposition on a 3D double‐continuous porous Cu support is created. This support, prepared via the liquid metal dealloying method, offers a high specific surface area and rapid mass/charge transfer channels. The resulting high‐entropy FeCoNiWCuOOH nanosheets provide a dense distribution of active sites. The heterostructure between Cu skeletons and FeCoNiWCuOOH nanosheets enhances mass transfer, electronic structure coupling, and overall structural stability, leading to excellent activities in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and water splitting reaction. At 10 mA cm −2 , the overpotentials for OER, HER, and water splitting in 1.0 m KOH solution are 200, 18, and 1.40 V, respectively, outperforming most current electrocatalysts. The catalytic performance remains stable even after operating at 300 mA cm −2 for 100, 100, and over 1000 h, correspondingly. This material has potential applications in integrated hydrogen energy systems. More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the synergy of the five elements in enhancing water‐splitting activity. This work offers valuable insights for designing industrial water electrolysis systems.

Abstract Thanks to their high voltage and delivered capacity, Li-rich transition metal (TM) oxide positive electrode (cathode) materials are among the most promising for next-generation lithium-ion-batteries, where Co-free Li-rich cathodes join reduced costs with competitive performance. However, their cycle-life remains limited, and the individual role of TMs is still not fully understood. The investigation of the TM chemical species’ evolution along the first charge for Li1.2Mn0.56Ni0.16Co0.08O2 and Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 has been accessed by means of operando multi edge XAS. The charge compensation mechanism has been studied and the effect induced by removing Co has been revealed. The absence of Co results in an accelerated and completed Ni oxidation along the first stage of charge and an inhibited formation of the undesired spinel phase and oxygen release at the end of the high voltage plateau. Interestingly, the oxygen release in the Co-containing material involves mainly the oxygen close to the Mn site and occurs while local structural interlayer re-arrangements are taking place.

Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising technique for the production of hydrogen and oxygen. Nevertheless, the development of low-cost, high-activity metal-based electrocatalysts that can effectively catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant challenge. Herein, we polymerized Polypyrrole (PPy) with FeCo layered double metal hydroxide grown in situ on nickel foam (NF) (FeCo-LDH/NF) by electrochemical polymerization to acquire composite material PPy@FeCo-LDH/NF. As a promising electrocatalyst with dual functionality for the HER and OER, the HER overpotential of PPy@FeCo-LDH/NF was 153 mV, and the OER overpotential was 245 mV at a current density of 10 mA·cm −2 . It was because that PPy increased the number of active adsorption sites, which in turn regulated the ion transfer rate between the electrolyte and the prepared catalyst. At the same time, after 24 h of stability testing, the HER and OER capacitance retention rates were 96.7% and 97.1%, respectively.

Electrolytic hydrogen production from water is a promising approach for obtaining clean energy. The development of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for the generation of hydrogen through water electrolysis. Transition metal oxides, such as Fe, Co, and Mn, have shown potential as efficient OER electrocatalysts for water splitting. However, accurately predicting their electrocatalytic performance in complex compositional spaces remains a challenge, impeding the precise design of compositions and processes for optimal performance. Herein, a machine learning-based method is proposed for predicting the OER activity of (FeCoMn)Ox catalysts across a wide range of compositions. Physical features that are highly relevant to the OER overpotential (OP) are identified and analyzed. The random forest algorithm is successfully used to establish the relationship between composition and overpotential. The model demonstrates good accuracy in predicting the outcomes of new experiments, with a mean relative error (MRE) of 9.3%. The features based on covalent radius (RC) and the number of electrons in the outermost d orbitals (DEs) are the primary factors. Their variances (δRC and δDE) exhibit a linearly decreasing relationship with the overpotential (OP), providing direct guidance for designing OP-oriented components. This work presents an effective and innovative approach for predicting and analyzing the physical factors of transition metal oxide electrocatalysts, which can enhance the design of highly catalytic materials for electrocatalysis.

Lactiplantibacillus (Lb.) plantarum is known as a benign bacterium found in various habitats, including the intestines of animals and fermented foods. Since animal intestines lack oxygen, while fermented foods provide a limited or more oxygen environment, this study aimed to investigate whether there were genetic differences in the growth of Lb. plantarum under aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions. Genomic analysis of Lb. plantarum obtained from five sources—animals, dairy products, fermented meat, fermented vegetables, and humans—was conducted. The analysis included not only an examination of oxygen-utilizing genes but also a comparative pan-genomic analysis to investigate evolutionary relationships between genomes. The ancestral gene analysis of the evolutionary pathway classified Lb. plantarum into groups A and B, with group A further subdivided into A1 and A2. It was confirmed that group A1 does not possess the narGHIJ operon, which is necessary for energy production under limited oxygen conditions. Additionally, it was found that group A1 has experienced more gene acquisition and loss compared to groups A2 and B. Despite an initial assumption that there would be genetic distinctions based on the origin (aerobic or anaerobic conditions), it was observed that such differentiation could not be attributed to the origin. However, the evolutionary process indicated that the loss of genes related to nitrate metabolism was essential in anaerobic or limited oxygen conditions, contrary to the initial hypothesis.

Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) has been suggested to be an effective measure to assess the oxygen metabolism and viability of tissue at risk. The preliminary results in a monkey model of stroke demonstrated progressive OEF reduction in both grey matter and white matter after pMCAO, in agreement with the neuron loss and fiber denegation as indicated by diffusion MRI indices following stroke. The findings suggest QSM derived OEF could provide additional information about the oxygen metabolism of the tissue and may be used to assess the ischemia-induced damage of the brain during acute stroke.

Abstract Electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution process must be both active and stable in order to make hydrogen from water using renewable power. Nitrogen‐doped carbon layer coated cobalt manganate particles were synthesized on carbon cloth using calcination method. The catalysts exhibited small particle sizes and graphitized carbon layer that covered the cobalt manganate, facilitating electron flow. Moreover, the nitrogen‐doped carbon layer enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rate by reducing the potential required for surface reconstruction and optimizing electron distribution on the cobalt manganate surface. This electrocatalyst demonstrated a current density of 100 mA/cm 2 at 1.56 V vs. RHE. Thus, this electrocatalyst shows promise as a novel OER catalyst for water oxidation in acidic aqueous solutions.

Atmospheric oxygen levels are traditionally viewed to have been relatively stable throughout Earth's history with several-step increases. Emerging evidence, however, suggests extremely dynamic atmospheric oxygen levels through large swaths of Earth's history. Here, we provide a new perspective on atmospheric oxygen evolution using a dynamical analysis to explore the relative importance of previously proposed feedbacks on the global oxygen and carbon cycles. Our results from a stochastic analysis of oxygen mass balance in this framework suggest there are multiple steady states for atmospheric oxygen, but only three stable states. One stable state under anoxic conditions (<10

The design and synthesis of low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) photoelectrocatalysts endowed with high activity and durability is of utmost importance for sustainable energy generation via solar-assisted water splitting. In this regard, and in the framework of our recent activities, we have focused on the electrophoretic deposition of graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) specimens containing dispersed NiO nanoaggregates on carbon cloth substrates. In the present study, the attention is devoted to the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization of a representative gCN–NiO specimen. In particular, we provide an analysis of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ni 2p regions, discussing in detail the main spectral features. The obtained results, that provide evidence for a direct electronic interplay between the single material components, may serve as a useful comparison for additional research on analogous materials for energy and environmental applications.

The stability and catalytic activity of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are strongly determined by the coordination states and spatial symmetry among metal sites at catalysts. Herein, an ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology to rapidly soften the intrinsic covalent bonds using ultrahigh electrical pulses is suggested, in which prospective charged excited states at this extreme avalanche condition can generate a strong electron-phonon coupling to rapidly evaporate some coordinated oxygen (O) atoms, finally leading to a controllable half-metallization feature. Simultaneously, the relative metal (M) site arrays can be orderly locked to delineate some intriguing atom-fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, where the coexistence of metallic bonds (M─M) and covalent bonds (M─O) at this symmetry-breaking configuration can partially restrain crystal field effect to generate a particular high-spin occupied state. This half-metallization catalyst can effectively optimize the spin-related reaction kinetics in acidic OER, giving rise to 10.3 times (at 188 mV overpotential) reactive activity than pristine pyrochlores. This work provides a new understanding of half-metallization atom-fingerprints at catalyst surfaces to accelerate acidic water oxidation.

In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium‐based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and stably operates for 500 hours with a very low degradation rate of 20 μV h‐1. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500 mA cm‐2 for 150 h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3‐anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.

To improve the stability of high-temperature water electrolysis, I prepared membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) using a decal method and investigated their water electrolysis properties. Nafion 115 and crosslinked sulfonated polyphenylsulfone (CSPPSU) membranes were used. IrO2 was used as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and Pt/C was used as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. The conductivity of the CSPPSU membrane at 80 °C and 90% RH (relative humidity) is about four times lower than that of the Nafion 115 membrane. Single-cell water electrolysis was performed while measuring the current density and performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at cell temperatures from 80 to 150 °C and the stability of the current density over time at 120 °C and 1.7 V. The current density of water electrolysis using Nafion 115 and CSPPSU membranes at 150 °C and 2 V was 1.2 A/cm2 for both. The current density of the water electrolysis using the CSPPSU membrane at 120 °C and 1.7 V was stable for 40 h. The decal method improved the contact between the CSPPSU membrane and the catalyst electrode, and a stable current density was obtained.

Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production still faces a bottleneck due to sluggish reactive kinetics and high reactive energy barriers. Herein, p–d orbital coupling P–Fe heterosites are constructed at Ni 2 P–FeNi‐LDH interfaces to enhance the O─H bond cleavage of reaction intermediates H 2 O* and OH* for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The Ni 2 P/NiFe‐LDH heterostructure shows superior HER and OER activities for alkaline water splitting with overpotentials of 230 and 270 mV at 100 mA cm −2 , respectively, and even exhibits high activity for electrocatalytic alkaline seawater splitting. The interaction of P 2p and Fe 3d orbitals at Ni 2 P–FeNi‐LDH interfaces upshifts the d‐band center of Fe and downshifts the p‐band center of P. This finding not only facilitates the dissociation of O─H bonds in H 2 O and promotes the Volmer–Heyrovsky step for HER, but also reduces the energy barrier for the rate‐determining step of OER from OH* to O* transition. This work proposes a new approach to constructing p–d heterosites at heterojunctions to facilitate reactive kinetics and reduce the energy barrier for electrocatalysis.

Abstract Long‐term operation of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) poses significant challenges due to the high potential and strong acidic environment associated with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to severe catalyst degradation. Here, ultrafine iridium–ruthenium nanowires (IrRu NWs) are developed through a facile process, which exhibits excellent activity and stability for acidic OER. The IrRu NWs achieve an overpotential of 243 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , which is significantly lower than that of commercial IrO 2 and pure Ir nanowires. Importantly, the IrRu NWs demonstrate 17.6% higher current density at 2 V in real PEMWE device than that of the commercial IrO 2 and Pt/C catalysts at the anode and cathode, respectively. The PEMWE device with the IrRu NWs catalyst layers can be stably operated at 1.0 and 1.5 A cm −2 for more than 500 h with a degradation rate of only 28 µV h −1 , which makes the IrRu NWs a promising catalyst toward PEMWE applications.

Abstract Among various products from electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (CO 2 ER), HCOOH is highly profitable one. However, the slow kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction lowers overall energy efficiency, which can be replaced by an electro‐oxidation reaction with low thermodynamic potential and fast kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolysis system coupling CO 2 ER with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR). A BiOCl–CuO catalyst was designed to sustain CO 2 ER to HCOOH at partial current density of 500 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 90% and 700 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 80%. In situ and ex situ x‐ray absorption fine structure was used to capture the structure transform of BiOCl–CuO into metallic Bi and Cu during CO 2 ER process, and the presence of CuO will promote this transformation which are supported by DFT calculations. Coupling HMFOR with CO 2 ER, we realize both FE HCOOH and FE FDCA above 95% simultaneously, providing new prospects vista for the electrosynthesis of value‐added products from paired system.

ABSTRACT. This investigation delineates the fabrication, comprehensive characterization, and electrochemical evaluation of a one-dimensional Cobalt-based Metal-Organic Framework (Co-MOFs), constructed from 4,4’-Bipyridine ligands and Cobalt (II) ions. The study aimed to perfect the synthesis protocol, elucidate the structural and compositional attributes of the resultant MOF, and probe its electrochemical performance. Utilizing the reflux method, renowned for its efficacy and eco-compatibility, we synthesized the MOF and affirmed its formation through a suite of analytical techniques, including Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), and electrical conductivity measurements. The synthesized Co-MOFs, chemically notated as [Co2(4,4'-bpy)2(SO4)(H2O)2]SO4·H2O, manifested as a one-dimensional coordination polymer. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis unveiled its monoclinic crystallinity within the C2 space group. Electrochemical characterization uncovered a reversible redox system, evidenced by a robust peak current ratio (IPa/IPc = 7.5), indicative of efficient electron transfer processes. Furthermore, the Co-MOFs significantly augmented the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline aqueous solution, highlighting its potential as a superior catalyst in energy-related electrochemical applications. This work not only contributes to the field of MOF synthesis but also sets the stage for future explorations into their practical applications in sustainable energy systems. Keywords: Electrochemical properties, metal-organic framework, oxigen evolution reaction catalyst, 4,4’-bipyridine.

Abstract Green and sustainable energy alternatives to replace fossil fuels are a topic of research in scientific community, thus yielding pursuit of advancing renewable energy systems with hydrogen emerging as a suitable and viable alternative. Efficient and non‐precious metal catalysts are crucial for large‐scale electrochemical water splitting yielding clean H 2 . Here, a novel two‐step hydrothermal synthesis approach to fabricate manganese–cobalt selenide nano‐cubes grown directly on nickel foam (NF) (MnCo 2 Se 4 /NF) is adopted. Leveraging its hierarchically structured architecture, augmented active sites, and electrochemically active surface area, MnCo 2 Se 4 /NF material demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for both water oxidation and reduction. With an overpotential of 233 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 187 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction at a current density of 10 mA/cm 2 , MnCo 2 Se 4 /NF also exhibits a Tafel slope of 44 mV/dec for sluggish OER process. Notably, this nanocrystalline catalyst displays enhanced catalytic activity under alkaline conditions, accelerates water dissociation, and maintains good stability over 50 h. Outperforming state‐of‐the‐art RuO 2 , particularly in two‐electrode assemblies with an overpotential of 218 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 , this work offers a promising pathway for designing and manufacturing of innovative bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient water splitting processes, thereby contributing to broader goal of sustainable energy production.

A still unexplored class of heterostructured bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and reduction (ORR) reactions is investigated: Ni‐Fe sulfides deposited onto a N,S‐co‐doped zeolite‐templated carbon (ZTC) substrate achieved upon the impregnation of a ZTC with thiourea and Ni and Fe precursors (Ni/Fe atomic ratio of 1). By heat‐treating the impregnated ZTC substrate at 700 °C under N2 atmosphere the efficient bifunctional catalyst is generated. A difference of only 0.76 V is measured between the potential required to drive an OER current density of 10 mA cm‐2 and the ORR half‐wave potential. Using electrochemical measurements and physico‐chemical characterizations, it is evidenced that OER activity results from the presence of a sulfide containing both Fe and Ni whereas the ORR activity originates from the N,S‐doped ZTC substrate. The selectivity of the ORR process is improved through the presence of sulfide phases. Compared to more conventional carbon substrate such as N,S‐co‐doped reduced graphene oxide, high specific surface area ZTC favors high ORR performances. The functional ZTC material was further successfully implemented as bifunctional air electrode in a coin‐type Zn‐air battery.

Abstract The electrochemical applications of gold span the entire pH spectrum. Recently, gold dissolution in acidic and alkaline media has been studied, but less attention has been given to electrolytes at intermediate pH values. To address this gap, this work uses on‐line electrochemical dissolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) to examine gold dissolution across a pH range of 1 to 12.7 using phosphate buffer solutions. All experimental parameters, except pH, are kept constant, enabling a clear investigation of pH effects on anodic (gold oxidation) and cathodic (gold oxide reduction) dissolution processes. Results show that dissolution amounts are lowest at neutral pH values between 3 and 7, varying with the applied potential and exposure time. Anodic and cathodic dissolution dominate in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Depending on the highest applied potentials and time exposure, the main dissolution mechanism shifts at pH=5, 7, and 9. The pH dependence of Au dissolution is proposed to be linked to the nature of gold oxides formed, the kinetics of oxide formation/reduction, gold ion redeposition, and the influence of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on dissolution. These results provide fundamental insights into gold dissolution under neutral pH conditions.

Abstract The development of efficient, robust, and cost‐effective electrocatalysts remains a significant challenge for practical water electrolysis. Here, a metallic glass (MG)‐based catalyst with surface‐enriched Ir and Pt‐alloyed active sites, demonstrating superior electrocatalytic performance, is reported. The dealloyed catalyst, characterized by an Ir and Pt‐rich honeycombed nanoporous surface and an interior flexible MG substrate, can directly serve as a bifunctional electrode, enabling efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with low overpotentials of 19 and 223 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , respectively. Notably, the mass activity of the catalyst surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts by 13.9 and 16.5 times, respectively. Additionally, the catalyst exhibits exceptional stability with negligible activity decay even under an ampere‐level current density (i.e., ≥1 A cm −2 ). Theoretical calculations reveal the optimization of atomic configuration and regulation of electronic interactions through lattice strain induced by the co‐alloying of Ir and Pt, contributing to superior electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the unique honeycombed nanoporous architecture, shaped by the surface migration and enrichment of the noble metals, offers abundant active sites for accelerating the electrocatalytic reactions. This work presents a novel approach to cost‐effectively design high‐performance alloy catalysts by engineering surface catalytically active sites.

The pursuit of carbon‐neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni‐based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine‐rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser‐ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L‐LFP), derived from spent Li‐ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43– species, formed around L‐LFP, effectively repels Cl− ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH– adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high‐performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

Abstract Overall water splitting is a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, but the primary challenge is removing bubbles from the electrode surface quickly to increase hydrogen production. Inspired by the directional fluid transport properties of natural biological surfaces like Nepenthes peristome and Morpho butterfly's wings, here a strategy is demonstrated to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting by a bubble‐guidance electrode, that is, an anisotropic groove‐micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE). Gradient groove micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high‐speed bubble transmission channels and exhibit superior bubble‐guidance capabilities. The synergistic effect of the asymmetric Laplace pressure generated between microscale porous structure and groove patterns and the buoyancy along the groove patterns pushes the produced bubbles directionally to spread, transport, and detach from the electrode surface in time. Moreover, the low adhesive nanosheet arrays are beneficial to reduce bubble size and increase bubble release frequency, which cooperatively improve mass transfer with the microscale structure. Notably, GMPE outperforms planar‐micro/nanostructured porous electrode (PMPE) in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions, with GMPE||GMPE showing better water splitting performance than commercially available RuO 2 ||20 wt.% Pt/C. This work improves electrodes for better mass transfer and kinetics in electrochemical reactions at solid‐liquid‐gas interfaces, offering insight for designing and preparing gas‐involved photoelectrochemical electrodes.

Abstract NiFe‐based nanomaterials are extensively studied as one of the promising candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their practical application is still largely impeded by the unsatisfied activity and poor durability caused by the severe leaching of active species. Herein, a rapid and facile combustion method is developed to synthesize the vertical graphene (VG) supported N‐doped carbon modified (Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se composites (NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG). The interconnected heterostructure of obtained materials plays a vital role in boosting the catalytic performance, offering rich active sites and convenient pathways for rapid electron and ion transport. The incorporation of Se into NiFe facilitates the formation of active species via in situ surface reconstruction. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the in situ formation of a Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 Se/Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 OOH layer significantly enhances the catalytic activity of NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG. Furthermore, the surface‐adsorbed selenoxide species contribute to the stabilization of the catalytic active phase and increase the overall stability. The obtained NC@(Ni x Fe 1‐x )Se/VG exhibits a low overpotential of 220 mV at 20 mA cm −2 and long‐term stability over 300 h. This work offers a novel perspective on the design and fabrication of OER electrocatalysts with high activity and stability.

The onset of Darwinian evolution represents a key step in the transition of chemical systems into living ones. Here, we show the emergence of Darwinian evolution in two systems of self-replicating molecules, where natural selection favors replicator mutants best capable of catalyzing the production of the precursors required for their own replication. Such selection for protometabolic activity was observed in a system where trimer and hexamer replicators compete for common resources, as well as in a system of different hexamer replicator mutants. An out-of-equilibrium replication-destruction regime was implemented in a flow reactor, where replication from continuously supplied dithiol building blocks needs to keep up with “destruction” by outflow. Selection occurred based on the ability of the mutants to activate a cofactor that photocatalytically produces singlet oxygen which, in turn, enhances the rate by which dithiol building blocks are converted into disulfide-based replicator precursors. Selection was based on a functional trait (catalytic activity) opening up Darwinian evolution as a tool for catalyst development. This work functionally integrates self-replication with protometabolism and Darwinian evolution and marks a further advance in the de-novo synthesis of life.

Abstract Oxyapatites A 10 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 (A – alkaline, rare‐earth elements) are considered promising materials for applications in solid‐state lighting and non‐contact thermometry. The temperature dynamics of the oxygen sublattice have a crucial influence on the luminescent properties of these optical hosts. Here, the structural evolution with temperature of germanates with the general formula ALa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 (A – Li, Na, K, Rb) is investigated, using X‐ray and neutron powder diffraction methods. These compounds crystallize in space‐group P 6 3 / m . NPD experiments helped to determine the oxygen and alkaline metal positions. Thermally‐induced reentrant structural transitions relating to the oxygen in the apatite channel are discovered for the first time. In the example of Eu‐doped RbLa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 and KLa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 , it is demonstrated that the luminescence of the Eu 3+ ion is influenced by small changes in the crystal structure.

The coexistence of a viral and tuberculous respiratory infection increases mortality and the transition to a severe form in both directions. We report an observation for a 55-year-old woman with untreated diffuse interstitial pnuemopathy, investigated by immunological and infectious tests, and found negative for pulmonary tuberculosis. Bronchial biopsies revealed non-specific inflammation, responsible for chronic dyspnea. Having presented ten days previously with myalgias, fatigue, dry cough and fever, with worsening of basic dyspnoea, without digestive or neurological manifestations, she was referred to the emergency department, where physical examination showed SpO2 at 80% on room air, reduced to 92% under 15 L/mn delivered via a high-concentration mask, polypnoea at 40 cycles per minute with bilateral diffuse crackling rales on auscultation, scattering just the anterior quadrants. The initial evolution was favorable, with clinical improvement in oxygen saturation to 94% on two liters per minute of oxygen delivered by nasal cannula, with respiratory rate at 23 cycles per minute with modest effort tolerance. On day 18 of hospitalization, she presented with a febrile peak of 38.3°C, polypnoea at 33 cycles per minute, increased oxygen requirements with a flow rate of 6l/m by face mask to reach an oxygen saturation of 92%, tachycardia at 130 beats per minute, and was therefore readmitted to intensive care with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with imipenem and amikacin. Multiplex PCR showing no germ, and a PCR test for pulmonary tuberculosis on a sputum sample which was positive, prompting the introduction of antibacillary treatment based on a fixed quadric-association of rifampicin, isoniaside, pyrazinaamide and ethombutol. Non-specific antibiotic therapy was discontinued after improvement of the inflammatory syndrome, and antibacillary treatment is still ongoing. Conclusion: Through this observation we discuss the difficulties in terms of diagnosis, management and outcome of a coinfection by SARS-COV 19 and mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Abstract Traditional methods of using ultrasound to measure oxygen concentration have the issue of inaccuracy and susceptibility to noise interference when measuring the time of flight (TOF) of ultrasonic echo signals. A proposed algorithm for ultrasonic parameter estimation, utilizing an asymmetric Gaussian model, aims to enhance the precision and reliability of TOF estimation, aiming to reduce the influence of noise interference. The algorithm combines an improved Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (SHADE) algorithm based on successful historical records with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The improved SHADE algorithm controls the degree of mutation strategy greediness during the mutation operation based on the number of iterations, thereby enhancing the algorithm’s iteration speed. Then, the obtained solution is used as the initial value for the EKF to estimate the model parameters, thus addressing the issue of EKF’s dependency on accurate initial values to obtain precise outputs. Through simulation and experimental measurements of ultrasonic oxygen concentration, several commonly used parameter estimation algorithms are compared with the proposed SHADE-EKF algorithm. Results demonstrate that the SHADE-EKF algorithm exhibits superior performance in estimating the TOF of ultrasonic waves.

ABSTRACT: Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is an environmentally friendly way to utilize coal resources. The cavity evolution process, especially the thermal impact on coal rock, is an important topic of UCG. The thermally induced coal rock failure processes in gasification environment are rarely investigated, but they are important to the gas production space and the flow from the injection well to the production well. In this study, a coupled numerical simulation program based on PFC3D and FLAC3D was established to realize multi-field coupled thermal impact conditions. The numerical model of burning-induced coal surface failure was established, and the basic cavity evolution mechanism was revealed. The main results show that (1) the redistributed temperature field in the coal rock is the most important parameter for the coupling model. The mechanical properties of the model element are assigned in accordance with its temperature state. (2) Taking into account the effects of heating, microscopic fracture and deformation are generated through PFC3D model, inhomogeneous temperature distribution is simultaneously achieved through FLAC3D model. (3) The evolution law of the expansion of the gasification cavity has been obtained by the coupled numerical simulation. (4) Eventually, the height of the gasification cavity increases, and the upper coal seams expand to an approximate equilibrium, the height affected by the temperature field becomes stable, and the vertical expansion rate of the gasification cavity gradually decreases. 1. INTRODUCTION Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is a revolutionary technology for clean coal utilization that integrates the three key processes of well construction, coal mining and gasification for efficient gas production. This technology allows coal to undergo controlled in-situ combustion, pyrolysis and gasification reactions to produce syngas with methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other components for surface recovery by injecting air, oxygen-enriched air, oxygen/water and other gasification agents into underground coal seams[1–4]. Currently, the underground gasification of middle-deep coal seams has no practical experience, especially for the dynamic study of the deforming and destroying process of the surrounding stone (coal) in the gasification cavity under high temperature and high pressure. The numerical simulation technology of gasification cavity development dynamics is still in the initial stage. The simulation technology of gasification cavity controllable development control is not deep enough, and the analysis of the effect of dynamic process parameters in the process of cavity formation is still insufficient.

In the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction system, the bubble will cover the reaction area on the photoelectrode surface, affecting the reaction impedance and gas-liquid mass transfer. A laser irradiation system was built and coupled with an electrochemical workstation and high-speed microscopic imaging system. The evolution behavior and mass transfer characteristics of single O<sub>2</sub> bubble on the TiO<sub>2</sub> photoelectrode were studied at different electrolyte concentrations (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1-2.0 mol/L). With the increase of electrolyte concentration from 0.1 mol/L to 2.0 mol/L, the solution resistance and bubble additional resistance decrease, and the overpotential in the stable growth stage of bubble decreases from 0.113 V to -0.089 V. The bubble will cause the fluctuation of overpotential in the nucleation, growth and detachment stages, which is consistent with the impedance change caused by the change of dissolved oxygen concentration in the liquid phase. By analyzing the correlation between gas evolution efficiency and bubble coverage, it is found that the increase of electrolyte concentration would lead to the simultaneous decrease of bubble coverage and gas evolution efficiency. By calculating the Sherwood dimensionless number, the results show that the total convective mass transfer coefficient increases with the electrolyte concentration. Single-phase natural convection plays a dominant role in the process of gas product transfer, and its mass transfer coefficient is one order of magnitude larger than that of bubble-induced convection. In summary, by adjusting the electrolyte concentration, the bubble on the gas evolution photoelectrode surface can be effectively removed and the mass transfer of the system can be optimized, which is of great significance for improving the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Abstract Coupled electrolyzer is a desirable way to realize efficient energy conversion from electricity to chemical energy. Using coupled electrolyzers highly valuable chemicals (e.g., H 2 , CH x COO − , nitrile, S, NH 3 , CO) can be obtained at low voltages, environmental pollutants can be alleviated, and wastewater (e.g., ammonia, urea, hydrazine) can be recycled. They are even helpful to realize the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Compared to traditional chemical methods, small molecule‐based coupled electrolyzers are more cost‐efficient. This review summarizes state‐of‐art of coupled electrolyzers, mainly the replacement of oxygen reduction reaction with oxidation reactions of small molecules and their further coupling with cathodic reduction reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), N 2 reduction reaction (NRR), and other reduction reactions of matching small molecules. In terms of oxidation reactions of small molecules, two types of reactions are covered: sacrificial agent oxidation reaction (SAOR) and electrochemical synthesis reaction (ESR). After detailing the design principle of coupled electrolyzers and several oxidation reactions of small molecules, construction, characterization, and performance of coupled electrolyzers are systematically overviewed along with discussion and outline of current challenges and prospects of this appealing strategy.

Solar saline water splitting is a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production, harnessing abundant solar energy and the availability of brine resources, especially in the Atacama Desert. Bischofite (MgCl2&middot;6H2O), a naturally occurring salt, has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications and the challenges associated with efficient hydrogen production in arid or hyper arid locations. This work discloses the electrochemical performance of Mn2O3 electrodes using a superposition model based on mixed potential theory and evaluates the superficial performance of this electrode in contact with a 0.5 M nature Bischofite salt solution focusing on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), that occurs during saline water splitting. The application of the non-linear superposition model provides valuable electrochemical kinetic parameters that complement the understanding of Mn2O3, this being one of the novelties of the manuscript.

Abstract This study, placed in the context of the preparation for the Uranus Orbiter Probe mission, aims to predict the bulk volatile compositions of Uranus and Neptune. Using a protoplanetary disk model, it examines the evolution of trace species through vapor and solid transport as dust and pebbles. Due to the high carbon abundance found in their envelopes, the two planets are postulated to have formed at the carbon monoxide ice line within the protosolar nebula. The time evolution of the abundances of the major volatile species at the location of the CO ice line is then calculated to derive the abundance ratios of the corresponding key elements, including the heavy noble gases, in the feeding zones of Uranus and Neptune. Supersolar metallicity in their envelopes likely results from accreting solids in these zones. Two types of solids are considered: pure condensates (Case 1) and a mixture of pure condensates and clathrates (Case 2). The model, calibrated to observed carbon enrichments, predicts deep compositions. In Case 1, argon is deeply depleted, while nitrogen, oxygen, krypton, phosphorus, sulfur, and xenon are significantly enriched relative to their protosolar abundances in the two planets. Case 2 predicts significant enrichments for all species, including argon, relative to their protosolar abundances. Consequently, Case 1 predicts near-zero Ar/Kr or Ar/Xe ratios, while Case 2 suggests that these ratios are 0.1 and 0.5–1 times their protosolar ratios, respectively. Both cases predict a bulk sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio consistent with atmospheric measurements.

Abstract The activity and durability of chemical/electrochemical catalysts are significantly influenced by their surface environments, highlighting the importance of thoroughly examining the catalyst surface. Here, Cu‐substituted La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3‐δ is selected, a state‐of‐the‐art material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), to explore the real‐time evolution of surface morphology and chemistry under a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, in a pioneering observation, it is discovered that the perovskite surface starts to amorphize at an unusually low temperature of approximately 100 °C and multicomponent metal nanocatalysts additionally form on the amorphous surface as the temperature raises to 400 °C. Moreover, this investigation into the stability of the resulting amorphous layer under oxidizing conditions reveals that the amorphous structure can withstand a high‐temperature oxidizing atmosphere (≥650 °C) only when it has undergone sufficient reduction for an extended period. Therefore, the coexistence of the active nanocatalysts and defective amorphous surface leads to a nearly 100% enhancement in the electrode resistance for the ORR over 200 h without significant degradation. These observations provide a new catalytic design strategy for using redox‐dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.

Pneumomediastinum, characterized by the presence of air in the mediastinum, is rare in newborns, especially in the spontaneous form, when it is not associated with assisted ventilation procedures or other pulmonary impairments. The diagnosis is not always obvious and immediate, which is why, in most cases, additional imaging tests are required for confirmation. Early identification of the lesion and appropriate treatment are essential, as the undue presence of air can compromise lung structures and, in the case of neonates, pneumomediastinum is associated with loculation. With the aim of elucidating the topic, the case of a full-term male newborn, born by Cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation, was reported. Son of a healthy 26-year-old mother, the newborn's vital signs were normal and anthropometry was considered adequate. With one day of life, signs of respiratory distress were recorded, with a drop in oxygen saturation and moderate subcostal insufficiency. Chest x-rays and computed tomography were performed. Imaging examinations revealed slightly triangular hyper transparency resulting from the removal of the thymus gland by a collection of repressed air, which is known as “Spinnaker sign”, or “boat sail sign”, or even “angel wing sign”, being the main radiographic feature of pneumomediastinum. The pneumomediastinum of the patient in question proved to be too voluminous, therefore, it was decided to perform mediastinal drainage. No complications were recorded after the intervention, with the newborn's satisfactory and progressive clinical evolution.

Abstract The present work investigates the structural and luminescence behaviour of Dy 3+ ‐Sm 3+ co‐doped glass ceramics obtained through heat treatment of precursor glasses. The growth of SiO 2 polycrystalline particles and evolution of these crystallites in the glass domain are witnessed via XRD and FESEM study. The presence of network vibrational bands, hydroxyl groups and the increased quantity of bridging oxygens (BOs) in glass ceramics are analysed through FTIR spectroscopy study. The absorption study (UV–Visible–NIR) showed the possible electronic transitions of Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ ions. The red shift in the absorption band edges and the lower bandgap values are obtained as a result of improved heat treatment in glass ceramics. Emission studies show the enhanced luminescence intensity of glass ceramics under 350 and 402 nm excitations. Decay measurement of glass ceramics showed the improved lifetimes of Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ ions to have appeared in microseconds (×10 −6 s). The colour characteristics of glass ceramics analysed using CIE colour chromaticity diagram and correlated colour temperature (CCT) values suggest the neutral to cool white light emissions. Therefore, prepared glass ceramics with SiO 2 polycrystalline phase are considered to be suitable materials in cool white LEDs applications.

Abstract Ligand-protected metal nanoclusters (NCs) represent a significant advancement in the field of catalysis due to their unique size-specific electronic and geometric structures. These properties are highly dependent on the metal species, number of constituent atoms, and geometric structure of the metal NC. We discuss on the synthesis, stability, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic/photocatalytic applications of these fascinating materials, emphasizing their superior performance over conventional catalysts. In this study, we have obtained a deeper understanding of the interaction between the metal core and the organic ligands protecting the metal NCs, as well as the desorption behavior of the ligands under calcination, which is crucial for the application of metal NCs as heterogeneous catalysts. Based on this understanding, we have demonstrated that metal NCs-supported catalysts with appropriate pretreatment exhibit higher activity as photocatalysts compared to conventional catalysts. Moreover, by suppressing oxygen poisoning through the use of sulfur species in the ligands, Pt NCs showed high activity as cocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in water splitting. Additionally, atomically precised phosphine-protected Pt NCs exhibited high activity as cathode electrocatalysts for fuel cells. These findings are expected to significantly contribute to the development of more diverse catalysts based on metal NCs, including those with varying metal species, numbers of constituent atoms, and geometric structures.

Abstract Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO 3 − ) to ammonia (NH 3 ) is a potential way to produce green NH 3 and remediate the nitrogen cycle. In this paper, an efficient catalyst of spherical CuO made by stacking small particles with oxygen‐rich vacancies is reported. The NH 3 yield and Faraday efficiency are 15.53 mg h −1 mg cat −1 and 90.69%, respectively, in a neutral electrolyte at a voltage of ‐0.80 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The high activity of the electrodes results from changes in the phase and structure during electrochemical reduction. Structurally, there is a shift from a spherical structure with dense accumulation of small particles to a layered network structure with uniform distribution of small particles stacked on top of each other, thus exposing more active sites. Furthermore, in terms of phase, the electrode transitions from CuO to Cu/Cu(OH) 2 . Density functional theory calculations showed that Cu(OH) 2 formation enhances NO 3 ‐ adsorption. Meanwhile, the Cu(OH) 2 can inhibit the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, while the formation of Cu (111) crystal surfaces facilitates the hydrogenation reaction. The synergistic effect between the two promotes the NO 3 ‐ to NH 3 . Therefore, this study provides a new idea and direction for Cu‐based oxides in electrocatalytic NH 3 production.

(1) Background: Supercritical water-cooled reactors (SCWRs) and their smaller modular variants (SMRs) are part of the ‘Generation IV International Forum’ (GIF) on advanced nuclear energy systems. These reactors operate beyond the critical point of water (tc = 373.95 °C and Pc = 22.06 MPa), which introduces specific technical challenges that need to be addressed. The primary concerns involve the effects of intense radiation fields—including fast neutrons, recoil protons/oxygen ions, and γ rays—on the chemistry of the coolant fluid and the integrity of construction materials. (2) Methods: This study employs Monte Carlo simulations of radiation track chemistry to investigate the yields of radiolytic species in SCWRs/SMRs exposed to 2 MeV neutrons. In our calculations, only the contributions from the first three recoil protons with initial energies of 1.264, 0.465, and 0.171 MeV were considered. Our analysis was conducted at both subcritical (300 and 350 °C) and supercritical temperatures (400–600 °C), maintaining a constant pressure of 25 MPa. (3) Results: Our simulations provide insights into the radiolytic formation of chemical species such as e−aq, H●, H2, ●OH, and H2O2 from ~1 ps to 1 ms. Compared to data from radiation with low linear energy transfer (LET), the G(e−aq) and G(●OH) values obtained for fast neutrons show a similar temporal dependence but with smaller amplitude—a result demonstrating the high LET nature of fast neutrons. A notable outcome of our simulations is the marked increase in G(●OH) and G(H2), coupled with a corresponding reduction in G(H●), observed during the homogeneous chemical stage of radiolysis. This evolution is attributed to the oxidation of water by the H● atom according to the reaction H● + H2O → ●OH + H2. This reaction acts as a significant source of H2, potentially reducing the need to add extra hydrogen to the reactor’s coolant water to suppress the net radiolytic production of oxidizing species. Unlike in subcritical water, our simulations also indicate that G(H2O2) remains very low in low-density SCW throughout the interval from ~1 ps to 1 ms, suggesting that H2O2 is less likely to contribute to oxidative stress under these conditions. (4) Conclusions: The results of this study could significantly impact water-chemistry management in the proposed SCWRs and SCW-SMRs, which is crucial for assessing and mitigating the corrosion risks to reactor materials, especially for long-term operation.

Abstract The stepwise oxygenation of Earth's surficial environment is thought to have shaped the evolutionary history of life. Microfossil records and molecular clocks suggest eukaryotes appeared during the Paleoproterozoic, perhaps shortly after the Great Oxidation Episode at ca. 2.43 Ga. The mildly oxygenated atmosphere and surface oceans likely contributed to the early evolution of eukaryotes. However, the principal trigger for the eukaryote appearance and a potential factor for their delayed expansion (i.e., intermediate ocean redox conditions until the Neoproterozoic) remain poorly understood, largely owing to a lack of constraints on marine and terrestrial nutrient cycling. Here, we analyzed redox‐sensitive element contents and organic carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of relatively low metamorphic‐grade (greenschist facies) black shales preserved in the Flin Flon Belt of central Canada to examine open‐marine redox conditions and biological activity around the ca. 1.9 Ga Flin Flon oceanic island arc. The black shale samples were collected from the Reed Lake area in the eastern part of the Flin Flon Belt, and the depositional site was likely distal from the Archean cratons. The black shales have low Al/Ti ratios and are slightly depleted in light rare‐earth elements relative to the post‐Archean average shale, which is consistent with a limited contribution from felsic igneous rocks in Archean upper continental crust. Redox conditions have likely varied between suboxic and euxinic at the depositional site of the studied section, as suggested by variable U/Al and Mo/Al ratios. Organic carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of the black shales are approximately −23‰ and +13.7‰, respectively, and these values are systematically higher than those of broadly coeval continental margin deposits (approximately −30‰ for δ 13 C org and +5‰ for δ 15 N bulk ). These elevated values are indicative of high productivity that led to enhanced denitrification (i.e., a high denitrification rate relative to nitrogen influx at the depositional site). Similar geochemical patterns have also been observed in the modern Peruvian oxygen minimum zone where dissolved nitrogen compounds are actively lost from the reservoir via denitrification and anammox, but the large nitrate reservoir of the deep ocean prevents exhaustion of the surface nitrate pool. Nitrogen must have been widely bioavailable in the ca. 1.9 Ga oceans, and its supply to upwelling zones must have supported habitable environments for eukaryotes, even in the middle of oceans around island arcs.
