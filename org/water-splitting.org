Transition metal oxides are considered alternative electrocatalysts for ZAB owing to their multiple oxidation states. However, they have limitations such as low electrical conductivity and the deficiency of reactive sites. In this study, to overcome these shortcomings and improve electrocatalytic activity, oxygen vacancies and porous architectures were introduced through a partial reduction process and a porous carbon framework. Open porous carbon microspheres with uniformly loaded NiCo2O4 nanosheets and oxygen vacancies (V-NCO/OPC) displayed enhanced electrocatalytic performance with a low Tafel slope (68 mV dec-1) in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential (402 mV) at 10 mA cm–2 in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The combined effect of the oxygen vacancies and porous architecture can offer sufficient active sites, modify the electronic structure of the metal oxide surface, and facilitate mass transport, enhancing the electrocatalytic properties of V-NCO/OPC. Furthermore, when applied for ZAB, V-NCO/OPC demonstrated better electrochemical performance including discharge power density (154.9 mW cm-2) at the current density of 175.9 mA cm-2, low voltage gap (0.85 V) at the initial cycle, and long-term (250 h) cycle stability at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 than those of noble-metal electrocatalysts.

Abstract Design of active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires in‐depth understanding of the electrocatalyst properties and interfacial structural dynamics during OER. One of the essential insights for advanced electrocatalyst design is vivid understanding of the drivers and mechanisms of dissolution of electrocatalysts. In this work we analyze some important aspects of electrocatalyst dissolution during OER, to deepen and advance our understanding of activity‐stability relations and relevant stability descriptors.

The development of non‐precious metal electrocatalysts with excellent activity and durability for electrochemical water splitting has always been a goal. Transition metal sulfides are attractive electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this article, we designed and constructed efficient catalysts with multiple synergistic interactions and synthesized Ce‐NiS2@NF nanosphere using a solvothermal method. Ce‐NiS2@NF exhibits excellent HER performance, OER performance, and overall water splitting capability in alkaline electrolytes, demonstrating good stability. The addition of Ce influences the activity of the catalysts, attributed to the synergistic interactions creating more active sites and higher intrinsic activity through the introduction of Ce heteroatoms. Additionally, the self‐supported conductive substrate promotes electron transfer, enhancing the intrinsic activity and active site density of the catalyst. This study provides an in‐depth investigation into structural design and performance enhancement, offering ideas for designing efficient catalysts for overall water electrolysis. This work provides an in‐depth study in terms of structural design performance enhancement and provides ideas for designing efficient alkaline bifunctional catalysts. Valuable insights have been provided in elucidating the intrinsic mechanism of the catalytic activity of cerium‐doped nickel sulfide nanospheres, thus providing new guidance in the field of energy conversion technology.

Zostera marina, a critical keystone marine angiosperm species in coastal seagrass meadows, possesses a photosensitive oxygen evolving complex (OEC). In harsh environments, the photoinactivation of the Z. marina OEC may lead to population declines. However, the factors underlying this photosensitivity remain unclear. Therefore, this study was undertaken to elucidate the elements contributing to Z. marina OEC photosensitivity. Our results demonstrated a gradual decrease in photosystem II performance towards shorter wavelengths, especially blue light and ultraviolet radiation. This phenomenon was characterized by a reduction in F

Abstract Engineering the intermetallic nanostructures as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is of great interest in green hydrogen production. However, a few non‐noble metals act as bifunctional electrocatalysts, exhibiting terrific HER and OER processes reported to date. Herein the intermetallic nickel–antimonide (Ni─Sb) dendritic nanostructure via cost‐effective electro‐co‐deposition method is designed and their bifunctional electrocatalytic property toward HER and OER is unrevealed. The designed Ni─Sb delivers a superior bifunctional activity in 1 m KOH electrolyte, with a shallow overpotential of ≈119 mV at ‐10 mA for HER and ≈200 mV at 50 mA for OER. The mechanism behind the excellent bifunctional property of Ni─Sb is discussed via “interfacial descriptor” with the aid of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). This study reveals the rate of electrocatalytic reaction depends on the energy required for electron and proton transfer from the catalyst's surface. It is noteworthy that the assembled Ni─Sb‐90 electrolyzer requires only a minuscule cell voltage of ≈1.46 V for water splitting, which is far superior to the art of commercial catalysts.

Water electrolysis is one promising and eco‐friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In response, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2‐xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best‐performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500% current density promotion at overpotential η = 300 mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe‐based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni:Fe ratio rather than Fe content in all metal elements. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2‐xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large‐scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.

Abstract In addressing the challenge of hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment (TME), a significant obstacle to effective cancer therapy, this research introduces a pioneering nanozyme engineered to utilize water and oxygen as reactants. Utilizing ultrasonic piezoelectricity, this nanozyme converts these substrates into oxygen (O 2 ) and reactive oxygen species, thereby amplifying oxidative stress without relying on endogenous H 2 O 2 . This approach involves the strategic engineering of porous ZnSnO v :Mn nanosheets (named MZSO NSs), which are distinguished by oxygen‐rich vacancies and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This breakthrough represents the initial attempt to merge catalytic activities akin to catalase (CAT) with the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), confirmed through both enzymatic reactions and electrochemical voltammetric analysis. The predominant mechanism of ultrasound‐augmented oxygen generation in MZSO is identified as piezoelectric hole‐induced OER. Supporting theoretical analyses clarify the synergistic impact of oxygen vacancies and Mn doping on the dynamics of carriers and the OER process, leading to a notable increase in catalytic efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of piezoelectric‐enhanced OER electrocatalysts to alleviate hypoxia in the TME, providing novel insights into the development of piezoelectric acoustic sensitizers for the treatment of cancer.

Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) catalysts with high catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity have been extensively studied, especially Fe and Co-based sulfides. Fe and Co active sites with a strong synergistic effect, which can adjust the electron density distribution and effectively improve the electrocatalytic OER activity. However, TMSs has poor stability in alkaline environment caused by metal ions and sulfur elements are facilitated to dissolve. In this work, TMSs was modified by polyaniline (PANI) to inhibit the precipitation of iron, cobalt, and sulfur elements and enhance its stability under alkaline conditions. Moreover, π-d structure can also be formed by the coating of polyaniline, which can further adjust its own electronic structure on the basis of stabilizing the TMSs structure, so as to improve the electrochemical performance, rendering them to stably operate at harsh environment for more than 90 h. These findings offer new guidance for improving the electrocatalytic stability of TMSs.

Several CoS2/Ni flow-through porous electrodes are fabricated to promote gas bubble release for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. Structural characterization shows that CoS2 catalyst is immobilized on the porous Ni substrate. The bubble average diameter can be decreased from 29.29 ± 17.9 μm to 13.51 ± 5.05 μm, and the desorption time is decreased from 1.615 s to 0.067 s, with the electrolyte velocity increase from 0 cm/s to 2.89 cm/sat the current density of 100 mA/cm2. A mathematical model is proposed to describe gas bubble grown, which is found that higher current density is not bring much bigger gas bubble. The overpotential of the CoS2/Ni electrode for OER is 498 mV at 100 mA/cm2. The overpotential of CoS2/Ni electrode can be decreased from 754 mV to 661 mV with the electrolyte velocity increase from 0 cm/s to 9.42 cm/s at 200 mA/cm2 with the energy required for hydrogen production reduced by 5.01 kWh/kmol.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a half-reaction that transpires at the anode during water electrolysis. It is a controlling step in the process because of slow kinetics. Therefore, developing OER catalysts with low cost, enduring stability, and wide-pH-value adaptability is a significant challenge. In this article, NiXCo2.4-X-MOF (x = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) catalysts were synthesized via hydrothermal on nickel foam (NF). The proportion and hydrothermal temperature can affect the performances, and the optimal catalyst is obtained with x= 0.6 and hydrothermal temperature is 150°C (Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF). This catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performances. The overpotentials are 1.77, 1.61, and 1.68 V in 1 M PBS (pH= 7), 1 M KOH, and alkaline seawater at 20, 200, and 200 mA cm-2 with excellent stability towards OER, respectively. In-situ SERS results suggest that during the OER process, hydroxyoxides are formed on the catalyst surface, which serves as the actual active substance. Furthermore, XPS analysis of the OER reaction reveals the formation of M-O and high-valence state oxides. DFT calculations confirm that Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF/NiCoOOH acts as the genuine active site for the OER, formed through the reconstruction of Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF, lowering the energy barrier for OOH* formation further accelerates the reaction kinetics of the OER. This study indicates the broad application prospects of MOFs in wide-pH-value and seawater.

Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have been utilized as cost-effective alternatives for noble metal electrocatalysts, exhibiting comparable activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nickel-cobalt selenide (NiCoSe) is a TMC exhibiting significant potential in reducing the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A carbon-based hydrochar support is used as a scaffold for depositing NiCoSe, ensuring the dispersion and stability of the synthesized electrocatalyst. This work develops a NiCoSe/hydrochar electrocatalyst to enhance the stability and activity of the TMC towards OER. Various compositions of nickel-cobalt selenide (NiCoSe 2 , Ni 0.85 Co 0.85 Se, and Ni 0.6 Co 0.4 Se 2 ) with a chitin-based hydrochar support are synthesized. The electrocatalytic activity is determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry using a three-electrode set-up. NiCoSe 2 has the lowest overpotential at 179.3 mV and a Tafel slope of 163.4 mV-dec -1 . This highlights the enhanced performance of NiCoSe 2 compared to other compositions.

Oxygen vacancies are important factors to tune the performance of oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it remains challenging how to control the concentration of the oxygen vacancies and decouple their effects on OER from other factors. In this work, we use a specific composition/phase La 0.4 Sr 0.6 FeO 3- d perovskite oxide as an example to tailor the oxygen vacancies of their nanoparticulate using a modified molten salt synthesis and ozone treatment. The OER performance of the resulting La 0.4 Sr 0.6 FeO 3- d nanoparticles with different degree of oxygen vacancies ranging from 0 to 25% are compared. The OER reactivity increases with increased oxygen vacancies in the materials, but the change is nonlinear. The OER stability, on the other hand, has a bimodal distribution. The activities of fully oxidized sample and the most oxygen-deficient sample degrade slower than the two samples in the middle. The results suggest that it is feasible to design catalysts with oxygen vacancy to be the most OER active and stable. Further investigation into the oxygen vacancy – active site relation would offer guiding principle to design and synthesize high OER performance oxide catalysts.

The activity of iron oxyhydroxides (FeOOH) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is limited by its poor conductivity and the high energy barrier in the rate-determining step. Herein, we report the immobilization of atomic dispersed Pd species on Co doped FeOOH, realizing the preparation of amorphous hetero-structure FeCoaOOH-Pdb. In the case of Co/Fe of 0.68 and Pd/Fe of 0.026, the coexisting structure of nanorods and nanospheres with appropriate oxygen vacancies and unsaturated active centers increases the number of active sites and enhances the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst. The density functional theory results uncover that the FeCo0.68OOH-Pd0.026 optimizes the binding energies of ⁎O and ⁎OOH, and accelerates the OER kinetics. The rationally designed FeCo0.68OOH-Pd0.026 exhibits excellent OER activity and reliability, manifesting a Tafel slope of 37.5 mV dec-1, a low overpotential of 265.1 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which has the potential to realize the large-scale implementation of water splitting.

Transition metal materials that loaded with trace of Iridium (Ir) are widely accepted as effective catalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which the Ir atoms exposed on the surface can directly affect the electrocatalytic reaction. However, this neglects the Ir – Ir interaction of distinct locations, which may be benefit for the fine-tuning of electronic structure. Herein, we changed the locations (surface and inside) of Ir atoms in the cobalt oxide (Co3O4@NC), and investigated their alkaline OER and HER performances. Combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical calculations, we infer that the steric interactions induced by the surface – internal Ir sites can weaken the Ir-O bond and optimize the adsorption of intermediates on catalyst surface with a negative shift of d-band center, enabling the surface-Ir sites with lower energy barrier for water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption for HER. Therefore, the as-prepared Irw-Co3O4@NC with surface − inside Ir distributions significantly improve the HER without degrading OER performance, with low overpotential of −173 / −71 mV for HER at −10 mA·cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH / 1.0 M KOH, and 244 / 249 mV at 10 mA·cm−2 for OER.

Actual work devoted to the development of a homological approach for describing the kinetic properties of grossly nonstoichiometric oxides ABO3-δ with perovskite structure. The approach consists in considering such oxides having different oxygen stoichiometry 3-δ as chemical homologues involved in the same oxygen exchange reaction and forming a continuous series in δ. The proposed approach is considered using the oxide with exceptional oxygen mobility Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF). The kinetic properties of BSCF were studied by new method of the oxygen partial pressure relaxation. The equilibrium properties of BSCF were reported earlier and obtained by original technique of the quasi-equilibrium oxygen release. The power law dependence of the kinetic parameters on the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure is considered as the consequence of linear free energy relationship similar to the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation.

Electrodeposition of abundant metals to fabricate efficient and durable electrodes play a viable role in advancing renewable electrochemical energy technologies. Herein, we deposit Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF onto nickel foam (NF) to form Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF as a highly efficient electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical investigation verifies that the Co9S8‐Ag‐Ni3S2@NF electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER because of its nanoflowers' open‐pore morphology, reduced overpotential (η10 = 125 mV), smaller charge transfer resistance, long‐term stability, and a synergistic effect between various components, which allows the reactants to be more easily absorbed and subsequently converted into gaseous products during the water electrolysis process. DFT calculation also reveals that the introduction of Ag (222) surface into the Co9S8 (440)‐Ni3S2 (120) system increases the electronic density of states per unit cell of a system and significantly reduces the energy barriers of intermediates for OER, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER. This study showcases the innovation of employing trimetallic nanomaterials immobilized on a conductive, continuous porous three‐dimensional network formed on a nickel foam (NF) substrate as a highly efficient catalyst for OER.

Maximization the synergistic effect of each component in transition metal-carbon complexes is expected to improve the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis for rechargeable Zn-air batteries but is still challenging. Herein, nucleobase guanine is employed as a supramolecular precursor to generate the core (FeCo alloy)-shell (carbon) structure embedded in ultrathin graphene-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (FeCo@NCNSs) via a confinement pyrolysis strategy. Thanks to the generated core-shell structure and bimetallic synergistic effect, the as-prepared FeCo@NCNSs exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, when served as the bifunctional air electrode for a practical Zn-air battery, FeCo@NCNSs exhibits a higher open-circuit voltage (1.553 V) and peak power density (197.30 mW cm-2), as well as the greatly improved long-term cyclic stability compared to the noble metal benchmarks. This work provides a promising approach to integrate various active sites for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and inspires the exploration of simple but efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.

The advancement of electrocatalysts exhibiting outstanding performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), crucial for hydrogen production, holds immense significance in addressing energy shortages and mitigating environmental pollution. In this study, a novel approach to synthesizing Co-MOF (Metal-Organic Framework) directly immobilized onto a Ni foam substrate through hydrothermal synthesis is presented. In contrast to conventional methods employing powder-based synthesis with binders, our direct attachment method offers a unique and efficient means of creating robust Co-MOF at Ni foam (Co-MOF@NF) hybrid catalysts. Subsequently, a chemical reduction approach utilizing sodium borohydride was employed to introduce surface modification into the Co-MOF structure. The resulting material, sodium borohydride treated Co-MOF@NF (Red. 1 h Co-MOF@NF), exhibited a remarkable enhancement in OER activity compared to the pristine Co-MOF@NF sample. Notably, Red.1 h Co-MOF@NF demonstrated a substantially reduced overpotential of 235 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm⁻2, in contrast to the 300 mV overpotential required by the pristine Co-MOF@NF under the same conditions. Furthermore, the Red.1 h Co-MOF@NF catalyst displayed exceptional stability, sustaining a current density of 50 mA cm⁻2 for over 48 h, highlighting its promising potential for practical applications. The synergistic effects of direct hydrothermal attachment, surface modification, and improved OER performance make this study a significant contribution to the advancement of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffers a complex four-electron process with sluggish kinetics, which severely hinders its practical application. In general, Ni-based spinel-structured materials have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for OER. However, fabricating surface with high efficient Ni3+ active sites for Ni-based spinel is thermodynamically unfavorable, which impedes the future development and application of Ni-based spinel. In this study, we have formulated a octahedral (Oh) sites doping route for the synthesis of a Ni3+-riched Ni(Co1.98Ni0.02)O4. The results demonstrate that the catalyst with high density of surface Ni3+ active sites exhibits an improved OER catalytic activity compared with NiCo2O4 and requires a low overpotential of 349 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.

The current study focuses on the synthesis, characterization and investigation of the potential applications of azo chromophore functionalized polyesters and their composites with graphene derivatives. Employing the two-step diazotization coupling reaction, diazo diol monomers are synthesized. Subsequently, the azo polyesters are prepared via low-temperature solution polycondensation of the diazo diols with diacid chloride followed by the incorporation of graphene derivatives to obtain composite materials. Characterization techniques including Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-Visible Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are employed to evaluate the chain structure, degree of crystallinity, optical properties and morphology. Further, their electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and detection ability toward heavy metal ion was evaluated. The results demonstrate enhanced catalytic and detection capabilities attributed to synergistic interactions between polymer and graphene components. This study provides significant insights into the development of efficient polymer-graphene hybrid materials, with potential applications in green chemistry and environmental monitoring.

Preparing high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with low precious metal loadings for water electrolysis applications (e.g., for green hydrogen production) is challenging and requires electrically conductive, high-surface-area, and stable support materials. Combining the properties of stable TiO2 with those of active iridium oxide, we synthesized highly active electrodes for OER in acidic media. TiO2 powders (both commercially available Degussa P-25® and hydrothermally prepared in the laboratory from TiOSO4, either as received/prepared or following ammonolysis to be converted to titania black), were decorated with IrO2 by UV photodeposition from Ir(III) aqueous solutions of varied methanol scavenger concentrations. TEM, EDS, FESEM, XPS, and XRD measurements demonstrate that the optimized version of the photodeposition preparation method (i.e., with no added methanol) leads to direct deposition of well-dispersed IrO2 nanoparticles. The electroactive surface area and electrocatalytic performance towards OER of these catalysts have been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.1 M HClO4 solutions. All TiO2-based catalysts exhibited better mass-specific (as well as intrinsic) OER activity than commercial unsupported IrO2, with the best of them (IrO2 on Degussa P-25® ΤiO2 and laboratory-made TiO2 black) showing 100 mAmgIr−1 at an overpotential of η = 243 mV. Chronoamperometry (CA) experiments also proved good medium-term stability of the optimum IrO2/TiO2 electrodes during OER.

Metal node engineering, which can optimize the electronic structure and modulate the composition of poor electrically conductive metal–organic frameworks, is of great interest for electrochemical natural seawater splitting. However, the mechanism underlying the influence of mixed-metal nodes on electrocatalytic activities is still ambiguous. Herein, a strategic design is comprehensively demonstrated in which mixed Ni and Co metal redox-active centers are uniformly distributed within NH2–Fe-MIL-101 to obtain a synergistic effect for the overall enhancement of electrocatalytic activities. Three-dimensional mixed metallic MOF nanosheet arrays, consisting of three different metal nodes, were in situ grown on Ni foam as a highly active and stable bifunctional catalyst for urea-assisted natural seawater splitting. A well-defined NH2–NiCoFe-MIL-101 reaches 1.5 A cm–2 at 360 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 0.6 A cm–2 at 295 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in freshwater, substantially higher than its bimetallic and monometallic counterparts. Moreover, the bifunctional NH2–NiCoFe-MIL-101 electrode exhibits eminent catalytic activity and stability in natural seawater-based electrolytes. Impressively, the two-electrode urea-assisted alkaline natural seawater electrolysis cell based on NH2–NiCoFe-MIL-101 needs only 1.56 mV to yield 100 mA cm–2, much lower than 1.78 V for alkaline natural seawater electrolysis cells and exhibits superior long-term stability at a current density of 80 mA cm–2 for 80 h.

TiO2 is a widely used photoelectric conversion semiconductor material. However, due to its selective absorption of ultraviolet light and high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, it exhibits poor photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. In this study, intrinsic defect titanium vacancy and semiconductor recombination agents ZnIn2S4 were introduced into an anodization‐annealed TiO2 film (TiO2 NT) to enhance the photoanode activity. The activity‐enhanced TiO2 photoanode (ZIS@TiO2 NT‐EA) was characterized by surface analyses and photoelectrochemical measurements. The results indicated that the introduction of titanium vacancies into the TiO2 NT‐EA changed its semiconductor type from n to p. After the ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles were loaded on the TiO2 NT‐EA film, the carrier concentration of the ZIS@TiO2 NT‐EA increased nearly 12 times than the pristine TiO2 NT. Due to the higher carrier separation efficiency resulting from the formation of p‐n heterojunction, the photocurrent density of the ZIS@TiO2 NT‐EA reached 3.89 mA cm‐2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, nearly 3 times higher than that of the original TiO2 NT. The maximum applied bias photon‐to‐current efficiency (ABPE) value of the ZIS@TiO2 NT EA reached 2.15% at 0.496 V vs. RHE, which is very competitive if compared with all the reported TiO2 film electrodes in the PEC water splitting application.

Bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (BMOFs) have shown a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, attributed to the synergistic effects of dual metal sites. However, the significant role of these dual-metal synergies in the OER is not yet fully understood. In this study, we employed density functional theory to systematically investigate the OER performance of NiAl- and NiFe-based BMOFs by examining all possible spin states of each intermediate across diverse external potentials and pH environments. We found that the spin state featuring a shallow hole trap state and Ni ions with a higher oxidation state serve as strong oxidizing agents, promoting the OER. An external potential-induced spin crossover was observed in each intermediate, resulting in significant changes in the overall reaction and activation energies due to altered energy levels. Combining the constant potential method and the electrochemical nudged elastic band method, we mapped the minimum free energy barriers of the OER under varied external potential and pH by considering the spin crossover effect for both NiAl and NiFe BMOFs. The results showed that NiFe exhibits better OER thermodynamics and kinetics, which is in good agreement with experimentally measured OER polarization curves and Tafel plots. Moreover, we found that the improved OER kinetics of NiFe not only is attributed to lower barriers but also is a result of improved electrical conductivity arising from the synergistic effects of Ni–Fe dual-metal sites. Specifically, replacing the second metal Al with Fe leads to two significant outcomes: a reduction in both the band gap and the effective hole mass compared to NiAl, and the initiation of super- and double-exchange interactions within the Ni–F–Fe chain, thereby enhancing electron transfer and hopping and leading to the improved OER kinetics.

A hydrothermal process was used to synthesize the AWPC/MnO2 composite. Techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, FTIR spectra, Ramman spectra, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. We looked at the electrochemical properties of the materials we made in an electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A hydrothermal synthesis approach is used to graft MnO2 wire-like nanostructures onto acacia wood-derived activated carbon. Good electrochemical performance is shown by the carbon/MnO2 hybrid composite electrode, which has high specific capacitances of 301 F g−1 at 500 mA s−1, low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1, which is attributed to the synergistic influences between MnO2 and waste biomass-produced carbon. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor operating in the voltage range of 1.8 V and exhibiting a high energy density of 25 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 450 W kg−1 demonstrates the significant potential of the activated carbon/MnO2 composite generated from synthesized biomass. The AWPC/MnO2's oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was checked to see how well the improved nanostructure could be used. The results offer a fresh perspective on the fabrication of electrochemical energy storage devices with outstanding performance.

Abstract In this study, we have investigated the synthesis of supported iridium oxide (IrO x ) nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrolysis in a surfactant-free aqueous bath as a possible route for the large-scale production of highly active electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic water electrolyzers. The process involves (i) formation of Ir-hydroxides complex from an Ir precursor in basic media followed by (ii) protonation in acidic media to form colloidal hydrated IrO x NPs and (iii) conversion and deposition of IrO x NPs on the surface of carbon or TiN support by probe sonication. The IrO x NPs produced through hydrolysis route form highly stable colloidal solution. Since it is essential to precipitate the catalyst NPs from the colloidal solution for their use in water electrolyzer electrode development, here, we investigate the optimal reaction conditions, e.g., pH, temperature, time, and presence of support, for efficient synthesis of the catalyst NPs. The reaction intermediates formed at different reaction steps are explored to get insights into the chemistry of the process. Under the optimal synthesis conditions, 100% precipitation of IrO x NPs was achieved. Further, the precipitated TiN supported IrO x NPs exhibited high OER activity, superior to that of the commercial benchmark IrO 2 electrocatalyst. The study provides a scalable synthesis route for highly active, low Ir-content OER electrocatalysts for acidic water electrolyzers. Graphical Abstract

Bioinspired, self-assembled hybrid materials show great potential in the field of energy conversion. Here, we have prepared a sonication-induced boladipeptide (HO-YF-AA-FY-OH (PBFY); AA = Adipic acid, F = l-phenylalanine, and Y = l-tyrosine) and an anchored, self-assembled nickel-based coordinated polymeric nanohybrid hydrogel (Ni-PBFY). The morphological studies of hydrogels PBFY and Ni-PBFY exhibit nanofibrillar network structures. XPS analysis has been used to study the self-assembled coordinated polymeric hydrogel Ni-PBFY-3, with the aim of identifying its chemical makeup and electronic state. XANES and EXAFS analyses have been used to examine the local electronic structure and coordination environment of Ni-PBFY-3. The xerogel of Ni-PBFY was used to fabricate the electrodes and is utilized in the OER (oxygen evolution reaction). The native hydrogel (PBFY) contains a gelator boladipeptide of 15.33 mg (20 mmol L

The exploration of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high activity and acceptable price is essential for water splitting to hydrogen generation. High-entropy materials (HEMs) have aroused increasing interest in the field of electrocatalysis due to their unusual physicochemical properties. In this work, we reported a novel FeCoNiMoZn-OH high entropy hydroxide (HEH)/nickel foam (NF) synthesized by a facile pulsed electrochemical deposition method at room temperature. The FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH displays a 3D porous nanosheet morphology and polycrystalline structure, which exhibits extraordinary OER activity in alkaline media, including much lower overpotential (248 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope (30 mV dec−1). Furthermore, FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH demonstrates excellent OER catalytic stability. The enhanced catalytic performance of the FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH primarily contributed to the porous morphology and the positive synergistic effect between Mo and Zn. This work provides a novel insight into the design of HEMs in catalytic application.

ABSTRACT. There is a growing need to develop catalysts based on non-precious metals for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the various catalysts comprising multiple transition metals, nickel (Ni)-iron (Fe) selenides have gained considerable attention due to their promising catalytic activity, attributed to their distinct metal-like characteristics. Although a lot of studies have focused on the dissolution of selenium (Se) under alkaline OER conditions and its consequent in-situ reconstructing impact, little attention has been paid to the possible involvement of Se itself in OER. In this work, we focus on the small amounts of Se residues that remain after dissolution. Our findings suggest that the quantity of these residues directly influences the OER activity of the Fe active sites within NiFe selenides. These residues are presented on the surface in the form of SeOx.

Unraveling the catalyst surface structure and behavior during reactions is essential for both mechanistic understanding and performance optimization. Here we report a phenomenon of facet-dependent surface restructuring intrinsic to β-Ni(OH)2 catalysts during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), discovered by the correlative ex situ and operando characterization. The ex situ study after OER reveals β-Ni(OH)2 restructuring at the edge facets to form nanoporous Ni1–xO, which is Ni deficient containing Ni3+ species. Operando liquid transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy further identify the active role of the intermediate β-NiOOH phase in both the OER catalysis and Ni1–xO formation, pinpointing the complete surface restructuring pathway. Such surface restructuring is shown to effectively increase the exposed active sites, accelerate Ni oxidation kinetics, and optimize *OH intermediate bonding energy toward fast OER kinetics, which leads to an extraordinary activity enhancement of ∼16-fold. Facilitated by such a self-activation process, the specially prepared β-Ni(OH)2 with larger edge facets exhibits a 470-fold current enhancement than that of the benchmark IrO2, demonstrating a promising way to optimize metal-(oxy)hydroxide-based catalysts.

The utilization of water electrolysis for green hydrogen (H2) production, powered by renewable energy, is a promising avenue for sustainable development. Proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) stands out as one of the most efficient H2 production technologies. However, implementing it on an industrial scale faces substantial challenges, particularly regarding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER, a critical process with inherently slow kinetics requiring additional potential, significantly influences overall water-splitting efficiency. Most OER electrocatalysts in PEMWE struggle with poor stability in harsh acidic environments at high oxidative potentials. While rare-earth metal oxides, such as iridium or ruthenium oxides, offer stability in commercial oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts (OECs), their use depends on achieving economically and sustainably viable operations. An alternative approach involves developing low- or non-noble metal-based OECs with sustaining high activity and long-term durability. Although such materials currently exhibit lower activity and stability than noble-based OECs, notable progress has been made in enhancing their performance. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in designing acidic-stable OECs based on low or without noble metal contents. It delves into the thermodynamics and degradation mechanisms of OECs in acidic media, evaluation parameters for activity and stability, strategies for developing active and acid-stable OECs, and the challenges and opportunities of acid water electrolysis. Through a detailed analysis of these aspects, the review aims to identify opportunities for engineering actively durable OECs.

<p>Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can convert renewable energy into hydrogen through water electrolysis. Identifying stable and active single-atom catalysts (SACs) for OER under acidic conditions holds great promise for developing cost-effective and efficient energy storage solutions, but challenging due to the vast number of potential material compositions and diverse surface morphologies. Here, to accelerate new discoveries, we present a high-throughput screening (HTS) framework that leverages the power of machine learning (ML) and density functional theory (DFT). The proposed framework includes an assessment of both the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of support surfaces. In addition, the integration of ML and uncertainty quantification for predicting the binding energies dramatically reduces the computational cost (by over a factor of 10), facilitating the identification of catalytically active SACs. Following the proposed scheme, we suggest 14 new promising SACs for OER across the 795 binary oxide supports and 21 transition metal atom combinations. These catalysts are found to break the scaling relation due to the enhanced *OOH binding with the support, which arises from favorable hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>

Abstract Understanding the structure‐activity correlation is an important prerequisite for the rational design of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts at the atomic level. However, the effect of coordination environment on electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains enigmatic. In this work, the regulation of proton transfer involved in water oxidation by coordination engineering based on Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2 and CoHPO 4 is reported. The HPO 4 2− anion has intermediate p K a value between Co(II)‐H 2 O and Co(III)‐H 2 O to be served as an appealing proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) induction group. From theoretical calculations, the pH‐dependent OER properties, deuterium kinetic isotope effects, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Raman studies, the CoHPO 4 catalyst beneficially reduces the energy barrier of proton hopping and modulates the formation energy of high‐valent Co species, thereby enhancing OER activity. This work demonstrates a promising strategy that involves tuning the local coordination environment to optimize PCET steps and electrocatalytic activities for electrochemical applications. In addition, the designed system offers a motif to understand the structure‐efficiency relationship from those amino‐acid residue with proton buffer ability in natural photosynthesis.

NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) with abundant heterostructures represents a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, NiFe LDH/Fe2O3 nanosheet arrays have been fabricated by facile combustion of corrosion-engineered NiFe foam (NFF). The in situ grown, self-supported electrocatalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 248 mV for the OER at 50 mA cm–2, a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec–1, and excellent durability over 100 h under the industrial benchmarking 500 mA cm–2 current density. A balanced Ni and Fe composition under optimal corrosion and combustion contributed to the desirable electrochemical properties. Comprehensive ex-situ analyses and operando characterizations including Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTACV) and in situ Raman demonstrate the beneficial role of modulated interfacial electron transfer, dynamic atomic structural transformation to NiOOH, and the high-valence active metal sites. This study provides a low-cost and easy-to-expand way to synthesize efficient and durable electrocatalysts.

Reasonable design and development of non-precious metal Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with high efficiency, low cost and stability are of great significance for electrocatalytic water splitting. The unique molecular structure and exceptional properties of polyoxometalates (POMs) have caught significant attention from the scientific community. Herein, CoMo-POM@IF nanoflowers has been successfully synthesized by facile etching iron foam (IF) at room temperature using polyoxometalates (POMs) as a precursor. POMs as a carbon-free metal-oxygen clusters with unique structural characteristics can be uniformly nucleated at room temperature, which can not only enable efficient green synthesis, but also provide a clear source of catalytic activity. CoMo-POM@IF catalysts with perfect nanoflake layer structure are obtained with the optimal reaction time, and the embedding of POM nanoparticles increased the surface roughness to expose more active sites. The embedding of POMs nanoparticles increases the surface roughness and electrochemically active area, showing great advantages in OER. An overpotential of 282 mV is measured at a current density of 10 mA·cm-2 in 1 M KOH, showing long-term electrochemical stability. The green synthesis of POMs electrocatalyst provides great ideas for the development of room temperature oxygen evolution electrocatalyst and speeds up the development of OER electrocatalyst in the actual production.

Developing of highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution is one of the most important issues for water splitting. It is widely accepted that Fe sites can act as active centers for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution. Herein, an amine-mediated strategy was used to induce the reconstruction of nanoscale Prussian blue analogue. The nanoscale cubes of Prussian blue analogue can be etched by amine ligand, inducing the formation of hollow structure and small sized pieces. In the etching process, Fe-based species in situ preferentially loads on the surface of newly generated units, which can expose more iron sites and thus promotes the electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution. The optimized catalyst exhibits an incredibly low overpotential of 257 mV at 10 mA·cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 44.1 mV dec-1 with remarkable stability in alkaline solution. After OER operation, Ni-doped FeOOH with thin sheet-like structure was formed on the surface of catalyst particles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirms the key role of Fe active sites in the OER process, and that the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe sites modulates the adsorption behavior of intermediates and so results in enhanced activity. This work provides an efficient strategy for advanced oxygen evolution catalysts towards electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

A micron-sized long-afterglow material, Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu,Ce, was utilized to conduct the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, two half-reactions of water splitting, in the presence of sacrificial agents under both light and dark conditions for the first time. The as-synthesized Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu,Ce exhibited higher photocatalytic activity compared to that of the referenced Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu and Sr2MgSi2O7:Ce samples. Herein, in addition to benefiting from the long photogenerated carrier lifetime of long-afterglow materials, the higher photocatalytic activity was attributed to the conjugated electronic structure between Eu and Ce ions. This structure facilitates charge and energy transfer between them, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. This research provides a new strategy for designing efficient long-afterglow material photocatalysts through the construction of conjugated electronic structures.

Given the energy crisis and escalating environmental pollution, the imperative for developing clean new energy is evident. Hydrogen has garnered significant attention owing to its clean properties, high energy density, and ease of storage and transportation. This study synthesized four types of catalysts—FeS(DI/MB), FeS(ET/MB), Fe(DI/MB), and Fe(ET/MB)—using two distinct solution systems: DI/MB and ET/MB. The FeS(DI/MB) catalyst, synthesized using the layered solution system (DI/MB), demonstrates a uniformly distributed and dense nanosheet structure, exhibiting excellent resistance to strong bases and superior catalytic properties. The FeS(DI/MB) electrode showed OER overpotentials of 460 mV and 318 mV in 1 M and 6 M, respectively, at current densities of up to 500 mA cm−2. Under industrial electrolysis test conditions, the FeS(DI/MB) electrode required only 262 mV to achieve a current density of 500 mA cm−2, operating in a high-temperature, strong alkaline environment of 6 M at 60 °C. Furthermore, the FeS(DI/MB) electrode exhibited excellent OER catalytic activity and stability, as evidenced by a 60 h stability test These findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of iron nickel sulfide-based catalysts, and further in-depth and comprehensive exploration is anticipated to yield the excellent catalytic performance of these catalysts in the realm of electrolytic water hydrogen production.

CoFe 2 O 4 –La 1− x Sr x CoO 3 ( x = 0.2, 0.6, 0.8) composites have been synthesized using a two‐step, low‐temperature wet chemical approach that combines coprecipitation and sol–gel techniques. The composite materials have been physicochemically analyzed using Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope. The electrocatalytic properties of the composite materials have been assessed in terms of their performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline medium. Cyclic voltammetry has been used for analyzing the redox behavior of the materials in 1 M KOH solution. The electrocatalytic activity of the materials has been assessed using anodic polarization curves on Ni substrate and the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode demonstrates excellent activity, with current densities of 11.1 mA cm −2 for OER and 47.4 mA cm −2 for MOR at 650 mV. Also, the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode has the maximum specific activity of 1.1 × 10 3 mA cm −2 g −1 at 650 mV toward OER. The electrodes’ stability has been assessed through chronoamperometric experiments and additional insight into the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity gained through the electrochemical surface area estimations using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. From chronoamperometric experiment, it has been observed that the CoFe 2 O 4 –La 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 film electrode attains stability within 114 s with a current density of 108.7 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters, including the standard enthalpy of activation (Δ H ° # ), standard entropy of activation (Δ S ° # ), and standard electrochemical energy of activation (), have been estimated by anodic polarization curve recorded in KOH as well as KOH with CH 3 OH solutions at various temperatures.

Oxygen had a profound effect on the evolution. In the beginning life on Earth emerged in an oxygen-free environment. Around 2.7 billion years ago, photosynthetic cyanobacteria started to produce oxygen. This caused a mass extinction of anaerobic organisms, except some bacteria that used oxygen for energy production. According to the endosymbiotic theory, the mitochondria of eukaryotes derive from such bacteria; the chloroplasts of plants are descendants of cyanobacteria. During the Cambrian "explosion" about 500 million years ago, rising oxygen levels enabled the evolution of complex animals. In later periods, fluctuations of atmospheric oxygen levels contributed to animal terrestrialization and mass extinction events, and facilitated the evolution of large insects and dinosaurs.

Abstract Lattice oxygen loss from transition metal oxide cathodes in Li-ion batteries (LiBs) is a key factor responsible in their gradual capacity decline over time. Understanding and mitigating this phenomenon is crucial for the development of next-generation LiBs. The effect of various parameters on lattice oxygen loss, such as cathode chemical composition, has been studied extensively. However, there is a lack of experimental investigation into the lattice oxygen stability across different crystallographic facets within the same cathode composition. Here, we employed in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to investigate oxygen evolution from preferentially faceted, electrodeposited LiCoO2 cathodes. Samples predominantly exposing the (003) basal planes and the (101), (102), (110) fast Li-ion diffusing facets exhibited oxygen evolution at potentials exceeding 3.5 V vs Li+/Li. Finite element simulations helped quantify the flux of oxygen evolution on the first charge cycle to 33±5 pmol/cm2s for the basal plane and 37±9 pmol/cm2s for the faceted samples at potentials above 4 V based on single spot measurements. However, spatially resolved measurements showed that faceted samples exhibited significant heterogeneity in their oxygen evolution, reaching twofold values compared to the basal plane samples at potentials beyond 4.5 V.

Anionic redox chemistry enables extraordinary capacity for Li- and Mn-rich layered oxides (LMROs) cathodes. Unfortunately, irreversible surface oxygen evolution evokes the pernicious phase transition, structural deterioration, and severe electrode-electrolyte interface side reaction with element dissolution, resulting in fast capacity and voltage fading of LMROs during cycling and hindering its commercialization. Herein, a redox couple strategy is proposed by utilizing copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) to address the irreversibility of anionic redox. The Cu-N synergistic effect of CuPc could not only inhibit surface oxygen evolution by reducing the peroxide ion O

Abstract The increasing demand for clean hydrogen necessitates the rapid development of efficient photoanodes to catalyze the water oxidation half‐reaction effectively. Here a strategy is introduced to fabricate photoanodes that synergistically combine and leverage the properties of porous Ti‐doped hematite (Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 ) and graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) nanosheets anchored with in situ grown Ni‐doped CoP co‐catalyst (Ni‐CoP). The resulting hybrid photoanodes exhibit >7 times higher photocurrent density at +1.23 V RHE compared with Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 photoanodes. Comprehensive characterization techniques, including ambient photoemission spectroscopy, intensity‐modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, and transient absorption spectroscopy complementarily reveal the key impact of g‐C 3 N 4 in these composites with enhanced solar oxygen evolution reaction: The incorporation of g‐C 3 N 4 leads to enhanced charge separation through a type‐II heterojunction, thereby increasing the hole flux at the surface, and extending the charge carrier lifetime to the ms‐s range needed for water oxidation. Additionally, g‐C 3 N 4 facilitates efficient transfer of photogenerated holes to the fine Ni‐CoP nanoparticles confined in the graphitic matrix for a boosted oxygen evolution reaction. These findings highlight the advantages of complex heterostructure photoanodes and demonstrate a new application of g‐C 3 N 4 as a multifunctional support of co‐catalysts for future photoanodes with enhanced performance.

Developing RuO2-based electrocatalysts with high activity and stability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable but remains a challenge. More critically, strategies for rational manipulation of the reaction pathway of RuO2 from a kinetically favorable but unstable lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) pathway to an adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway are still elusive. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ce-doped RuO2 catalysts with the existence of oxygen vacancies (Ce-RuO2-x). Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ru valence state is lowered with the formation of Ce-O-Ru local structure, and Ru-O covalency is decreased, which suppress the surface Ru demetallation and lattice oxygen loss, resulting in greatly enhanced durability toward acidic OER. Moreover, the synergistic effect between Ce-O-Ru local structure and oxygen vacancies can be conducive to the stabilization of OOH∗, leading to a manipulated reaction pathway from LOM to AEM and reduced energy barrier of the rate-determining step.

Abstract Unitized regenerative fuel cells have emerged as promising energy conversion and storage systems for various applications. However, in order to optimize their efficiency, it is crucial to enhance the performance of the bifunctional catalyst. This study aims to provide deeper insights into the electrochemical behavior and performance of the bifunctional catalyst. Several electrocatalysts were prepared and evaluated using rotating disc electrode measurements. The primary focus was placed on investigating the interaction between Pt, Ir, and the support material, antimony doped tin oxide (ATO), and their impact on the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. Among the analyzed catalysts, Pt black mixed with synthesized IrO2 supported on developed ATO exhibited the highest performance, considering the results from both the fuel cell and electrolyzer systems.

Hydrogen obtained from electrochemical water splitting is the most promising clean energy carrier, which is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, the development of an efficient OER electrocatalyst using nonprecious 3d transition elements is desirable. Multielement synergistic effect and lattice oxygen oxidation are two well-known mechanisms to enhance the OER activity of catalysts. The latter is generally related to the high valence state of 3d transition elements leading to structural destabilization under the OER condition. We have found that Al doping in nanosheet Ni-Fe hydroxide exhibits 2-fold advantage: (1) a strong enhanced OER activity from 277 mV to 238 mV at 10 mA cm

Rechargeable zinc-air batteries have been identified as promising technologies for energy storage. However, developing cost-effective electrocatalysts that can efficiently facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for their advancement. This work investigates synthesized electrocatalysts composed of graphene-Cu2O deposited on carbon cloth by doctor blading casting method as bifunctional electrodes in a rechargeable Zn-air battery. The battery integrated with graphene-Cu2O as the air-cathode electrocatalyst showed superior performance in terms of cycling stability compared to that without Cu2O. This enhanced performance is attributed to the reversibility of Cu+/Cu2+ species during the redox reactions facilitated by the high electrical conductivity of graphene. Therefore, the results suggest the potential of the synthesized electrodes for advancing the development of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.

A Fe-Co dual-metal co-doped N containing the carbon composite (FeCo-HNC) was prepared by adjusting the ratio of iron to cobalt as well as the pyrolysis temperature with the assistance of functionalized silica template. Fe1Co-HNC, which was formed with 1D carbon nanotubes and 2D carbon nanosheets including a rich mesoporous structure, exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities. The ORR half-wave potential is 0.86 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), and the OER overpotential is 0.76 V at 10 mA cm−2 with the Fe1Co-HNC catalyst. It also displayed superior performance in zinc–air batteries. This method provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of efficient transition metal-based carbon catalysts.

Abstract Slow oxygen evolution kinetics and severe corrosion limit the further application of BiVO4 photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Here, BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanodes were synthetized aiming at improving its photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability. Compared with pure BiVO4 photoanode, the BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanode enhanced the photocurrent from 1.1 mA/cm2 to 4.5 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. In addition, Ni(OH)2 acted as a corrosion protection layer on the surface of the photoanode, allowing the BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanode to exhibit excellent stability.

Amorphous RuOx (a-RuOx) with disordered atomic arrangement and abundant coordinatively unsaturated Ru sites possesses high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the a-RuOx is prone to fast corrosion during OER in strong acid. Here, we realized the stabilization of an ultrathin a-RuOx layer via constructing heterointerface with crystalline α-MnO2 nanorods array (MnO2@a-RuOx). Benefiting from the strong electronic interfacial interaction, the as-formed MnO2@a-RuOx electrocatalyst display an ultralow overpotential of 128 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 and stable operation for over 100 h in 0.1 M HClO4. The assembled proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer reach 1 A cm-2 at applied cell voltage of 1.71 V. Extensive characterizations indicate the MnO2 substrate work as an electron donor pool to prevent the overoxidation of Ru sites and the OER proceeds in adsorbent evolution mechanism process without involving lattice oxygen. Our work provides a promising route to construct robust amorphous phase electrocatalysts.

The modification of Ir or oxygen vacancies (Vo) is a strategy to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of heterogeneous nanocatalysts. However, it is crucial to further clarify the synergistic effect of Ir and Vo on the enhancement mechanism of OER performance after surface reconstruction. In this work, FeCo Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) co-modified by Ir and Vo were successfully prepared by the thermodynamically favorable galvanic replacement reaction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that the synergistic effect of Ir and Vo enhanced the charge transfer of FeCo LDHs. XPS spectra reveal robust interactions between Ir and FeCo LDHs. Density-functional theory further reveals that the low-oxygen-coordinated Ir (III) acts as an active site to optimize the OER rate-determining step energy barrier. As a result, Ir and Vo co-modified FeCo LDH requires only a 203 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and, more importantly, operates stably at an industrial current density of 250 mA cm−2 for 312 h without degradation. This work provides new insights and avenues for understanding the enhanced performance mechanism of catalysts after surface reconstruction and for industrial scale-up production.

Direct seawater splitting is an environment‐friendly and promising technology to replace freshwater electrolysis for hydrogen production. The challenge of seawater electrolysis lies in the competition between chloride oxidation reaction (CER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as electrode corrosion and poisoning caused by chloride. Some small molecules have lower anodic electrocatalytic oxidation potentials compared to OER and CER, making them possible to substitute OER and/or CER in coupled electrolyzers not only to eliminate the electrode corrosion problem but also to significantly enhance the energy efficiency of seawater electrolysis. This article reviews the progress of such small molecule oxidation facilitated seawater electrolyzer. Starting with an overview of the key challenges in seawater electrolysis, this review introduces the fundamentals and advantages of the coupled seawater electrolyzers and discusses the strategies for anodic small molecule oxidation and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction, including utilizing Cl‐ as a reactive medium, value‐added chemical synthesis, pollutants electrooxidation, and optimizing electrolyzers. Finally, the challenges and prospects of small molecule oxidation facilitated seawater splitting are summarized, aiming to provide impetus for research and development on coupled seawater electrolysis technologies.

Mott-Schottky construction and plasmon excitation represent two highly-efficient and closely-linked coping strategies to the high energy loss of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the combined effect has rarely been investigated. Herein, with Ag nanoparticles as electronic structure regulator and plasmon exciter, Ag/CoV-LDH@G nanohybrids (NHs) with Mott-Schottky heterojunction and notable plasmon effect are well-designed. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, it was found that the Mott-Schottky construction modulates the Fermi level/energy band structure of CoV-LDH, which in turn leads to lowered d-band center (from -0.89 to -0.93), OER energy barrier (from 6.78 to 1.31 eV), and preeminent plasmon thermal/electronic effects. The thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, promote the deprotonation of *OOH, and accelerate electron transfer kinetics. Whereas the electronic effect can increase the density of charge carriers (from 0.70×10

Abstract It is of essential importance to design bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater splitting. Herein, an approach for manipulating electron redistribution in NiCoP treated by P defect (P v ) engineering (NiCoP v @NF) is presented, exhibiting excellent catalytic activities and stability toward HER/OER in alkaline seawater solution. The P v reduces the surface electrooxidation reconfiguration energy barrier, making it easier to drive the local conversion of crystals to active oxy(hydroxide) in OER. In addition, the Ni site of NiCoP v and the Co site of NiCoOOH are the active sites for HER and OER processes, respectively. In situ generated PO 4 3− adsorbed on the catalyst surface causes spatial repulsion, preventing Cl − corrosion in seawater electrolysis. The seawater AEM electrolyzer using NiCoP v @NF couple achieves excellent performance of high activity (2.43 V at 500 mA cm −2 ) and long‐term durability (500 mA cm −2 over 110 h). The working efficiency of AEM in 1.0 M KOH is as high as 77.0% at 100 mA cm −2 with the price of per GGE H 2 as low as $ 0.87.

The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) plays a critical role in direct hydrazine fuel cells and presents a promising alternative to the kinetics-sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in water reduction. Engineering catalysts with high-density multifold nanotwin structures has emerged as a compelling strategy to enhance catalytic activity. However, the exploration of multifold nanotwins for HzOR applications remains absent. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a porous Ni-Zn-Cu catalyst featuring high-density twofold and fivefold nanotwins. The Ni-Zn-Cu catalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni-Zn-Cu/Ni foam) exhibits exceptionally high catalytic activity and stability toward the HzOR, achieving a current density of 204.3 mA·cm-2 at 0.0 V vs. RHE and retaining up to 89.1% after 20 hours of continuous electrolysis. Online mass spectrometer (MS) analysis indicates that the Ni-Zn-Cu coating facilitates N-N bond cleavage of N2H4. This study offers valuable insights into the development of multifold nanotwin catalysts for advancing HzOR applications.

Seawater Electrolysis is an exciting alternative to freshwater electrolysis; however, it suffers from a multitude of issues that must be resolved before the technology can be scaled. Corrosive hypochlorite forms at the anode of seawater electrolysis and can damage catalysts and electrolyzer components. Hypochlorite is unstable and can decay, particularly when exposed to heat and metal ions, which can lead to erroneously high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) selectivity conclusions, resulting in poor catalyst and electrolyzer component selection. In this study, we use the rotating ring-disc electrode technique to characterize the selectivity of IrO 2 , NiO, Co 3 O 4 , RuO 2 , Pt and PtRu electrocatalysts in situ at near-neutral pH (8.4) with linear scan voltammetry (LSV), potentiostatic and galvanostatic experiments. Our findings reveal that elevated temperatures are conducive to higher OER selectivity. Furthermore, when we increased the chloride concentration in the electrolyte with an IrO 2 catalyst, we observed that although the overall selectivity towards the OER reaction decreased, the OER current independently increased, indicating a synergistic relationship.

While dual-atom catalysts benefiting from synergetic interatomic interactions have inspired the development of emerging catalysts, the role of atomic interactions on the catalytic selectivity and activity has yet to be clearly discovered. Herein, two-types of Pt dual-atom active sites, Pt dimers (2Pt) with an interatomic distance of 2.6 Å and Pt pairs (Pt2) at a distance of 0.9 Å, are fabricated by anchoring onto cationic vacancy-rich nickel-based hydroxide (Pt@NiFeCo-E). It reveals that 2Pt sites are favorable for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while Pt2 sites are active towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The coexistence of two types of Pt dual atoms endows the bifunctional activity, which reached an overpotential of 14 mV@10 mA cm−2 for HER, an overpotential of 234 mV@100 mA cm−2 for OER, and an effective overall water splitting reaction (OWS) in alkaline at an overpotential of 1.42 V to reach 10 mA cm−2 and at 100 mA cm−2 for 50 h. This work not only clarifies a new mechanism in manipulating the selectivity of dual-atom catalysts via controlling the interatomic distance, but also paves a pathway for designing novel high-efficient bifunctional catalysts.

Advancing efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for commercializing emerging energy devices. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose doping different transition metal (TM) atoms to regulate the electronic structures of the two-dimensional 1T-HfTe2 monolayer to achieve bifunctional catalysis for the ORR/OER. Due to the small electronegativity of the Hf atom, we found the doped TMs can generally form anion centers by accepting abundant charges from the Hf interlayer. At the same time, the highly conductive 1T-HfTe2 contributes to the charge transfer between the active center and the reaction intermediates, rendering the designed SACs the tunable activity for the reactions. By comparing the theoretical overpotentials of ORR and OER on 15 single-atom catalysts (SACs), Pt-doped system exhibits excellent catalytic activity for both ORR and OER, outperforming the traditional Pt(1 1 1) and RuO2(1 1 0) catalysts. Based on the charge transfer mechanism, we clarified that the doped TM atoms act as a 'bridge' to transfer the electrons from the substrate to the reaction intermediates, thereby effectively contributing to the improvement of catalytic activity. In summary, our study shows that, by doping appropriate TM atoms, the intrinsic inert HfTe2 can be activated toward efficient ORR/OER. This could provide some guidance for the design of new two-dimensional ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst materials.

The development of high-performance electrocatalytic electrodes for overall water splitting is a crucial issue to realize renewable hydrogen production. This paper presents the in situ growth of N-modified Co-based nanorods on porous TiN ceramic membranes using the hydrothermal method and thermal NH3 treatment, resulting in a novel self-supported electrocatalytic electrode with abundant heterointerfaces, denoted as NCTN-x-y (x: nitridation temperature; y: nitridation time). In the alkaline medium (1 M KOH), the NCTN-350-2 electrode displays the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (ƞ10 = 66 mV), and the NCTN-250-3 electrode manifests the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (ƞ10 = 270 mV). Accordingly, these two electrodes comprise an electrolyzer, which features a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of 1.63 V. The good electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the abundant heterointerfaces formed between the porous TiN ceramic membrane and the N-modified Co-based nanorods, in conjunction with the hierarchical pore structure of the TiN ceramic membrane. Theoretical calculations identify that the construction of heterointerfaces modulates the electronic structure of active sites, thereby promoting the dissociation of H2O, optimizing the H* adsorption energy (ΔGH*), and accelerating the reaction kinetics, which ultimately improve the electrocatalytic activity of electrode.

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as an alternative to precious metals as efficient and low‐cost catalysts for water electrolysis. Elemental doping and morphology control are effective approaches to further improve the performance of TMPs. Herein, Fe‐doped CoP nanoframes (Fe‐CoP NFs) with specific open cage configuration were designed and synthesized. The unique nano‐framework structured Fe‐CoP material shows overpotentials of only 255 and 122 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, overwhelming most transition metal phosphides. For overall water splitting, the cell voltage is 1.65 V for Fe‐CoP NFs at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , much superior to what is observed for the classical nanocubic structures. Fe‐CoP NFs show no activity degradation up to 100 h which contrasts sharply with the rapidly decaying performance of noble metal catalyst reference. The superior electrocatalytic performance of Fe‐CoP NFs due to abundant accessible active sites, reduced kinetic energy barrier, and preferable *O‐containing intermediate adsorption is demonstrated through experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Our findings could provide a potential method for the preparation of multifunctional material with hollow structures and offer more hopeful prospects for obtaining efficient earth‐abundant catalysts for water splitting.

Abstract Developing highly effective transition metal‐based bifunctional electrocatalysts remains a tremendously challenging task for large‐scale overall water splitting. Herein, a multiheterostructured Mo‐doped Ni 2 P/Fe x P electrocatalyst on NiFe foam with P vacancy (denoted as Mo─Ni 2 P/Fe x P‐V/NFF) is developed to serve as an efficient dual‐pH electrocatalyst. Due to the synergistic effect of multiple strategies (heteroatom doping, heterointerface, and P vacancy), the Mo─Ni 2 P/Fe x P‐V/NFF possesses remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity in alkaline/acidic and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, along with encouraging durability. The mechanisms of improved electrocatalytic activity combining multicharacterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are elucidated. Specifically, X‐ray absorption fine structure experimental analysis confirms that the Mo doping can optimize the electronic structure of electrocatalyst. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the evolved oxyhydroxides are the real active substances for the OER. DFT calculations reveal that the conductivity of as‐prepared samples can be enhanced through multiple strategy synergy. Moreover, in the HER process, multiple strategies can not only reduce the hydrogen binding energy to near zero but also enhance the H 2 O dissociation and *OH desorption. In the OER process, DFT calculations also verify that Mo doping and interface engineering can optimize the adsorption of the rate‐determining step, achieving the lowest theoretical overpotential.

In addressing the challenging quest for an efficient electrocatalyst in electrochemical water splitting, we demonstrate an Fe-doped NiO nanosheet array anchored on nickel foam synthesized via a two-step process. Demonstrating exceptional performance in an alkaline electrolyte, FeNiO catalysts exhibit the oxygen evolution reaction with a low potential of 1.52 V vs RHE and the urea oxidation reaction of 1.32 V vs RHE @ 10 mA/cm2. The bifunctional electrolyzer generates 10 mA/cm2 current at 1.95 V for water and 1.59 V for urea electrolysis at ambient temperature. Promisingly, the FeNiO catalyst based electrolyzer generates hydrogen at an industrial-scale current density of 400 mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of just 1.91 V in concentrated alkaline electrolyte and elevated temperature (80 °C) due to the dimensionally stable and robust behavior of the self-supported catalyst. The activation energy for alkaline water electrolysis is found to be 52 kJ/mol. The present catalysts also demonstrate stable performance at 300 mA/cm2 in 4 M KOH electrolyte at 50 °C for more than 20 h. The synergy induced by Fe doping into NiO activates catalytic sites, expediting charge transfer and reaction kinetics. The present research report highlights the potential of catalysts as a practical and cost-effective approach for green hydrogen production via water splitting.

Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high‐temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir‐B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor‐acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate‐determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir‐B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B‐induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high-temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir-B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor-acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate-determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir-B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B-induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

Abstract In this work, we explored the recovering possibilities of nickel‐based products from the cathode materials of spent nickel‐metal hydride (NiMH) batteries collected from car repair centers in Mongolia. Specifically, nickel‐based by‐products such as metallic nickel, Ni microparticles, nickel oxide, nickel chloride, and betta‐phase ( β ) nickel hydroxide powders are successfully produced. X‐ray diffraction patterns suggested that all samples show high crystallinity and phase purity. Ni microparticles were recovered using a chemical reduction method from a leachate solution prepared by dissolving the cathode of the spent NiMH battery in hydrochloric acid. Notably, β ‐Ni(OH)₂ displayed two redox peaks in KOH electrolyte solution, suggesting that it has excellent electrochemical potential and can be reused for the fabrication of new NiMH batteries. To validate the electrochemical performances, we examined the catalytic activity of nickel microparticles as a catalyst for the degradation of Congo red (CR) dye and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reduction reaction rate of CR dye in the presence of a nickel catalyst was 2.17×10 −3 s −1 , significantly higher than the control experiment without a nickel catalyst. These results provide possible solutions for developing sustainable battery systems by recovering different nickel‐based products from spent NiMH batteries.

Developing efficient hole transport layers and water oxidation electrocatalysts is vital for improving the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices for water-splitting. In this work, we synthesized Co3O4 nanoparticles/Ti3C2-MXene hybrid material and utilized it as a dual-function material to transport the photogenerated holes and catalyze the water oxidation reaction. It was found that the modification of BiVO4 with Co3O4/Ti3C2-MXene prolonged the lifetime of the photogenerated holes by 13.7-fold (i.e. from 0.26 s for BiVO4 to 3.56 s for Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4) and significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance. The modification of BiVO4 with only Ti3C2-MXene resulted in significant surface recombination more likely due to the high concentration of the accumulated holes in the Mxene layer because of its low electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation reaction. Employing the Co3O4/Ti3C2-MXene hybrid materials reduced significantly the rate constant of surface recombination and dramatically enhanced the charge transfer efficiency (i.e. from 0.17% for BiVO4 to 14.0% for Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4 at 0.65 VRHE). Under optimized conditions, the Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4 photoanode was able to deliver 5.05 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE and outperforms Ti3C2/BiVO4 and Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanodes. Moreover, it showed high stability for over 50 hours and reached a Faradaic efficiency of 90%. An applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) value of 1.71% at 0.62 VPt was obtained for the overall water splitting. This work provides a facile method to reduce surface recombination and enhance the stability and PEC efficiency of BiVO4 photoanodes via modification with dual-function oxygen evolution catalyst/hole transport layer hybrid materials.

Abstract Double-atom catalysts (DACs) have open up novel paradigms in the field of rapidly developing atomic catalysis because of their great potential to promote catalytic performances in various reaction systems. However, increasing the loading and extending the service life of metal active centers represents a grand challenge for the efficient utilization of DACs. Here, we rationally design asymmetric nitrogen, sulfur-coordinated diatomic iron centers on highly defective nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (denoted as A-Fe2S1N5/SNC, A: asymmetric), which possesses the atomic configuration of N2S1Fe-FeN3 moiety. The abundant defects and low-electronegativity heteroatoms in the carbon-based framework endow the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC with a high loading of 6.72 wt%. Furthermore, the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC demonstrates an ultra-low overpotential of 193 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm− 2, outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalysts. In addition, the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC exhibits extraordinary stability, maintaining > 97% activity for over 2000 hours during the OER process. This work provides a practical scheme for simultaneously balancing activity and stability of DACs toward electrocatalysis applications.

Monitoring must be a basic element in oenological processes, assuring the oenologist's confidence in the supervision of the different processes. In this article, an analysis was carried out on all the works reported in the literature for the monitoring of different wine parameters in each phase. As described in the paper, artificial sensors have been developed to monitor the evolution of the fermentation and maceration phases. Similarly, in the ageing phase, other authors have developed different systems to monitor the evolution of the wine colour and oxygen. Within the particular case of biological ageing, not many developments have been found to control it. Given the scarcity of developments in this field, it would be necessary to propose a greater number of studies in this field.

Abstract. Understanding the compositions and evolution of atmospheric organic vapors is crucial for exploring their impact on air quality. However, the molecular and seasonal characteristics of organic vapors in urban areas, with complex anthropogenic emissions and high variability, remain inadequately understood. In this study, we conducted measurements in urban Beijing during 2021–2022 covering four seasons using a Vocus-PTR, an improved Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS). During the measurement period, a total of 895 peaks are observed, and 543 of them can be assigned to formulas. The contribution of CxHyOz species is most significant, which compose up to 53.7 % of the number and 76.0 % of the mass of total organics. With enhanced sensitivity and mass resolution, various sub-ppt level species and organics with multiple oxygens (≥3) were discovered. When counting the species number, 42.2 % of the organics measured are at sub-ppt level and 37.8 % of the species contain 3–8 oxygens. Organic vapors with multiple oxygens mainly consist of intermediate volatility and semi-volatile compounds, and many of them are found to be the multi-generational oxidation products of various volatile organic precursors. In summer, the fast photooxidation process generates organic vapors with multiple oxygens, and leads to an increase in both their concentration and proportion. While in other seasons, the variations of organic vapors with multiple oxygens are closely correlated with those of organic vapors with 1–2 oxygens, which could be heavily influenced by primary emissions. Organic vapors with low oxygen content (≤ 2 oxygens) are comparable to the results obtained by traditional PTR-MS measurements in both urban Beijing and neighboring regions.

Abstract Photosynthetic organisms, fungi, and animals comprise distinct pathways for vitamin C biosynthesis. Besides this diversity, the final biosynthetic step consistently involves an oxidation reaction carried out by the aldonolactone oxidoreductases. Here, we study the origin and evolution of the diversified activities and substrate preferences featured by these flavoenzymes using molecular phylogeny, kinetics, mutagenesis, and crystallographic experiments. We find clear evidence that they share a common ancestor. A flavin-interacting amino acid modulates the reactivity with the electron acceptors, including oxygen, and determines whether an enzyme functions as an oxidase or a dehydrogenase. We show that a few side chains in the catalytic cavity impart the reaction stereoselectivity. Ancestral sequence reconstruction outlines how these critical positions were affixed to specific amino acids along the evolution of the major eukaryotic clades. During Eukarya evolution, the aldonolactone oxidoreductases adapted to the varying metabolic demands while retaining their overarching vitamin C-generating function.

Paleontological and phylogenomic observations have shed light on the evolution of cyanobacteria. Nevertheless, the emergence of heterocytes, specialized cells for nitrogen fixation, remains unclear. Heterocytes are surrounded by heterocyte glycolipids (HGs), which contribute to protection of the nitrogenase enzyme from oxygen. Here, by comprehensive HG identification and screening of HG biosynthesis genes throughout cyanobacteria, we identify HG analogs produced by specific and distantly related non-heterocytous cyanobacteria. These structurally less complex molecules probably acted as precursors of HGs, suggesting that HGs arose after a genomic reorganization and expansion of ancestral biosynthetic machinery, enabling the rise of cyanobacterial heterocytes in an increasingly oxygenated atmosphere. Subsequently, HG chemical structure evolved convergently in response to environmental pressures. Our results open a new chapter in the potential use of diagenetic products of HGs and HG analogs as fossils for reconstructing the evolution of multicellularity and division of labor in cyanobacteria.

C4 photosynthesis is a repeatedly evolved adaptation to photosynthesis that functions to reduce energy loss from photorespiration. The recurrent evolution of this adaptation is achieved through changes in the expression and localisation of several enzymes and transporters that are conventionally used in non-photosynthetic metabolism. These alterations result in the establishment of a biochemical CO2 pump that increases the concentration of CO2 around rubisco in a cellular environment where rubisco is protected from oxygen thus preventing the occurrence of photorespiration. A key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is the change in subcellular localisation of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity from the mesophyll cell chloroplast to the cytosol, where it catalyzes the first biochemical step of the C4 pathway. Here, we achieve this key step in C4 evolution in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) using genome editing. We show that editing the chloroplast transit peptide of the primary CA isoform in the leaf results in relocalisation of leaf CA activity from the chloroplast to the cytosol. Through analysis of fluorescence induction kinetics in these CA relocalisation lines we uncover a role a new role for chloroplast CA in photosynthetic induction. We also reveal that relocalisation of CA activity to the cytosol causes no detectable perturbation to plant growth or leaf-level CO2 assimilation. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel role for chloroplast CA in C3 plants, and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis by genome editing.

Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a major public health concern. Antibiotic intermediates (AIs) used in the production of semisynthetic antibiotics have the same bioactive structure as parent antibiotics and synthetic antibiotic production wastewater usually contains high concentrations of residual AIs; however, the effects of AIs and their interactive effects with antibiotics on the emergence of AR are unknown. In this study, antibiotic-sensitive E. coli K12 was exposed to five types of β-lactam AIs and their parent antibiotic ampicillin to analyze their impact on the evolution of multiple AR. The results indicated that AI 6-APA inhibits bacterial growth and stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species, as well as induces AR and antibiotic persistence like the parent antibiotic AMP. Combined exposure to 6-APA and AMP synergistically stimulated the induction of multiple AR and antibiotic persistence. The resistance mutation frequency increased up to 6.1×106-fold under combined exposure and the combination index reached 1326.5, indicating a strong synergy of 6-APA and AMP. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that these effects were associated with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, enhanced stress response signatures, and activation of efflux pumps. These findings provide evidence and mechanistic insights into AR induction by AIs in antibiotic production wastewater.

The Early Tonian period in the São Francisco Craton represents the development of an intracontinental rift across the northern and central Espinhaço regions, playing a crucial role in understanding the tectonic evolution of the Neoproterozoic Period within this craton and its adjacent orogens. This rift is associated with the breakup of the São Francisco paleoplate, marked by the formation of several rifts, some of which were aborted (e.g. Santo Onofre Rift), and magmatism associated. Field investigations, coupled with petrographic, lithogeochemical, and U-Pb geochronological data of the Serra do Meio Suite, elucidate key characteristics and offer significant insights into the Tonian tectonic evolution of the São Francisco Craton and its relationship with Santo Onofre Rift. The suite comprises metagranitoids exhibiting a mineralogical composition spanning from alkali-feldspar granites to granites and its petrogenesis and tectonic characteristics reveal an alkaline to calc-alkalic signature, exhibiting extreme ferroan geochemistry and indications of moderate to high oxygen fugacity. Pressure estimations suggest low-pressure conditions during magma crystallization, implying shallow crustal emplacement. The suite's evolution involves complex petrogenetic processes, likely influenced by fractional crystallization and contamination by country rocks from a quartz-feldspathic crustal source, as well as a possible contribution from juvenile tholeiitic mantle sources associated with rift environments, showcasing a signature typical of A1-type granite. The U-Pb SHRIMP age, determined as 930 ± 2 Ma (MSWD = 0.34), is interpreted as the crystallization age of the rock and allows us to connect it to the opening of the Santo Onofre-Macaúbas Rift in the São Francisco Craton.

Abstract Rechargeable Li‐CO 2 batteries are considered as a promising carbon‐neutral energy storage technology owing to their ultra‐high energy density and efficient CO 2 capture capability. However, the sluggish CO 2 reduction/evolution kinetics impedes their practical application, which leads to huge overpotentials and poor cyclability. Multi‐element transit metal oxides (TMOs) are demonstrated as effective cathodic catalysts for Li‐CO 2 batteries. But there are no reports on the integration of defect engineering on multi‐element TMOs. Herein, the oxygen vacancy‐bearing Li‐Ni‐Co‐Mn multi‐oxide (Re‐NCM‐H3) catalyst with the α ‐NaFeO 2 ‐type structure is first fabricated by annealing the NiCoMn precursor that derived from spent ternary LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathode, in H 2 at 300 °C. As demonstrated by experimental results and theory calculations, the introduction of moderate oxygen vacancy has optimized electronic state near the Fermi level (E f ), eventually improving CO 2 adsorption and charge transfer. Therefore, the Li‐CO 2 batteries with Re‐NCM‐H3 catalyst deliver a high capacity (11808.9 mAh g −1 ), a lower overpotential (1.54 V), as well as excellent stability over 216 cycles at 100 mA g −1 and 165 cycles at 400 mA g −1 . This study not only opens up a sustainable application of spent ternary cathode, but also validates the potential of multi‐element TMO catalysts with oxygen defects for high‐efficiency Li‐CO 2 batteries.

Abstract. A three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model with multiple nutrient and plankton functional groups was developed and adapted to the Gulf of Mexico to investigate the role of nutrients and the complexity of plankton community in dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics. A 15-year hindcast was achieved covering the period of 2006–2020. Extensive model validation against in situ data demonstrates that the model was capable of reproducing vertical distributions of DO and spatial distributions of bottom DO concentration, as well as their interannual variations. The study demonstrates that bottom DO dynamics and hypoxia evolution are significantly influenced by both physical processes and local biochemistry, with sedimentary oxygen consumption and vertical diffusion identified as key contributors. Summer hydrodynamics play a critical role in nutrient distribution and limitation: a notable expansion of Si limitation was simulated when coastal currents shifted eastward or northward. This effect, especially pronounced on the western part of the Louisiana–Texas shelf, underscores the importance of nutrient limitation in shaping DO dynamics. The model identifies a bi-peak primary production pattern in spring and early summer, aligned with satellite chlorophyll a variations, attributed to the complexity of the plankton community and interactions among different plankton groups. Our findings emphasize the necessity of integrating sophisticated plankton community dynamics into biogeochemical models to understand primary production variability and its impact on bottom hypoxia.

Abstract Complex liquid–solid reactions occur during brazing. A deep understanding of brazing liquid evolution is therefore of important concern for the bonding between filler and substrates. The joining of gas‐pressure‐sintered silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) ceramic to oxygen‐free copper (OFC) foil was prepared using Ag–Cu–TiH 2 filler at 875°C for 0.5 h. The effect of the Ag:Cu ratio on the interfacial microstructure and peeling strength of the joints was analyzed. The reaction of brazing liquid with Si 3 N 4 ceramic includes reactions with both the β‐Si 3 N 4 and the grain boundary phases (Y–Si–Mg–O–N). The resulting interfacial reaction products include TiN, Ti 5 Si 3 , and potential Cu 3 Ti 3 O. Based on the phase composition and three‐dimensional morphology of the interfacial reaction products in the Si 3 N 4 ceramic/OFC foil joints, a model for the evolution of the brazing liquid as the reaction proceeds was proposed. Peeling test results indicated that the peeling strength of the joints rises unilaterally with the increase of the Ag:Cu ratio in the filler until reaching the peak value of 24.3 N/mm at the maximum Ag:Cu ratio of 90:10. The mechanisms of the joint peeling fracture were discussed in detail.

Abstract Photocatalytic water splitting for clean hydrogen production has been a very attractive research field for decades. However, the insightful understanding of the actual active sites and their impact on catalytic performance is still ambiguous. Herein, a Pr‐doped TiO 2 ‐supported Cu single atom (SA) photocatalyst is successfully synthesized (noted as Cu/Pr‐TiO 2 ). It is found that Pr dopants passivate the formation of oxygen vacancies, promoting the density of photogenerated electrons on the CuSAs, and optimizing the electronic structure and H * adsorption behavior on the CuSA active sites. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of the obtained Cu/Pr‐TiO 2 catalyst reaches 32.88 mmol g −1 h −1 , 2.3 times higher than the Cu/TiO 2 . Innovatively, the excellent catalytic activity and performance is attributed to the active sites change from O atoms to CuSAs after Pr doping is found. This work provides new insight for understanding the accurate roles of single atoms in photocatalytic water splitting.

Earth-abundant and effective electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting process have seen an exceptional rise in research over the past few years. Among these, synthesis of active, long-lasting materials that act as bifunctional electrocatalysts in an alkaline environment is a crucial step for the development of perovskite-based electrocatalysts. Herein, perovskite type BaNi1-xCoxO3; x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5; prepared by economic solution combustion method is reported with regard to its oxygen and hydrogen evolution activity in 1.0 M KOH. The benchmark current density of 10 mAcm−2 was reached by BaNi0.7Co0.3O3 (BC3) with the lowest overpotential of 279 mV and 419 mV for OER and HER respectively. Furthermore, BC3 showed a phenomenal bifunctional electrocatalytic property with an overall cell voltage of 1.98 V at 10 mAcm−2 in a two-electrode system. A gain by 92 mV in overall electrocatalytic activity of BC3 was recorded after 24 h of constant splitting of water at 30 mAcm−2 makes it an interesting bifunctional electrocatalyst best suited for large scale hydrogen production through water electrolyser.

Extreme pinniped divers are extraordinary models to study adaptations to hypoxia/reoxygenation events derived from extreme fluctuations in oxygen levels during deep diving. We analyzed the evolutionary adaptations of the Weddell seal ( Leptonychotes weddellii) and the Northern and Southern elephant seals ( Mirounga angustirostris and M. leonina), which have exceptional diving abilities, reaching depths of over 1000 meters for extended periods up to 90 minutes. To understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning these remarkable adaptations, we conducted a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of thirteen pinniped species. Our gene family evolution analyses revealed a significant loss of function in genes involved in the enzymatic degradation of glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant that our functional analysis have previously shown to increase rapidly in response to hypoxia exposure in primary cells derived from extreme divers, likely to protect cells against oxidative damage. We also detected adaptive signatures in pathways involved in the optimization of mitochondrial respiration, energy metabolism, DNA repair and cardiovascular regulation in these extreme divers. Notably the Weddell seal exhibited more genes under positive selection compared to the Elephant seals, possibly reflecting adaptations to extreme environmental pressures. Pathways enriched in Weddell seals include those related to fat metabolism, oxidative damage against hydrogen peroxide and membrane lipid remodeling.

Introduction. Pneumonia is a common infectious disease among children, very familiar to pediatricians and a major cause of hospitalization worldwide. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) - atypical pathogen, is estimated to be responsible for approximately 30-40% of community-acquired pneumonias. The aim of the paper was to underline the diagnostic and treatment difficulties in a case of pneumonia with M. pneumoniae in a school-aged boy, with multiple presentations in the Emergency Service for respiratory difficulties. Material and method. We present the case of a 7 years and 10-month-old male patient, admitted to our clinic for wheezing, cough and dyspnea. Results. The clinical exam at admission pointed out influenced general status, wheezing, thoraco-abdominal swing, intercostal draft, sibilant and crackles, oxygen saturation 89%, tachycardia 134 beats/minute. The blood tests revealed mild leukocytosis, with neutrophilia, slightly increased inflammatory biomarkers. Considering the general status and the presence of functional respiratory syndrome, steroid and symptomatic anti-inflammatory treatment is initiated. However, the general condition remains stable, which required the widening of the spectrum of investigations with the performance of a chest CT noticing a pneumonic condensation with an air bronchogram located at the level of the right upper lobe. Considering the stationary respiratory functional syndrome and the radiological appearance of the pneumonia as well as the age, we performed serology for atypical germs and identified a positive titer of Ig M antibodies for M. pneumoniae by instituting Azithromycin po., but after 3 days, the evolution remains stationary, thus we changed the treatment with intravenous Levofloxacin, with a favorable subsequent evolution. Conclusions. Pneumonia with atypical pathogens such as M. pneumoniae is a well-defined and well-known pathology in the literature, but it still remains a condition that imposes multiple difficulties related to the diagnosis and therapeutic management of pediatric cases.

The progressive transfer of photogenerated electrons between the catalyst components and reactants is of great significance for photocatalysis. Amorphous Pd (PdA) and oxygen vacancies (VOs) were simultaneously introduced in Pd-In2O3 exploiting hydrogen-induced amorphization effects; 0.6 wt% Pd-In2O3 exhibited a 4.5-fold increase in activity and a 3.2-fold higher selectivity toward CH3OH + CO (63.62 %) compared with In2O3. Multiple in situ techniques and theoretical calculations revealed that intercomponent electron transfer channels were established via various interface structures formed between PdA or crystalline Pd (PdC) and In2O3; PdA acted as electronic pump, facilitating the transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons, resulting in their subsequent enrichment on the surface of PdA. Simultaneously, PdA acted as electron-donating adsorption site for H2O, increasing the number of electrons received by H2O, further inhibiting the competitive adsorption of H2O and CO2 on VO sites, and promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, the electronic coupling between PdC and VOs could significantly decrease the electron-donating ability of VOs, reducing the number of electrons received by CO2, thus effectively regulating the degree of CO2 reduction. This study employs PdA/PdC and VOs to synergistic optimize the progressive transfer of photogenerated electrons, and presents a novel approach for elucidating the catalytic mechanism.

Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4-2.4 $\mu$m with Gemini-S/IGRINS. We detected the presence of H$_{2}$O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise rations of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of $\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.70^{+1.27}_{-0.93}$, consistent with the stellar value, and a super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O$=0.80^{+0.07}_{-0.11}$. We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within $1\sigma$ but favored a slightly more sub-stellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio ($\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.74^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and C/O$=0.59^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ($V_{sys}$) and Keplerian ($K_{p}$) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted $V_{sys}$ for H$_{2}$O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H$_{2}$O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.

Arsenic, ubiquitous in various industrial processes and consumer products, presents both essential functions and considerable toxicity risks, driving extensive research into safer applications. Our investigation, drawing from 7,182 arsenic-containing molecules in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), outlines their diverse bonding patterns. Notably, 51% of these molecules exhibit cyclic connections, while 49% display acyclic ones. Arsenic forms eight distinct bonding types with other elements, with significant interactions observed, particularly with phenyl rings. Top interactions involve carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sulfur, and arsenic itself. We meticulously evaluated average bond lengths under three conditions: without an R-factor cut-off, with R-factor ≤ 0.075, and with R-factor ≤ 0.05, supporting the credibility of our results. Comparative analysis with existing literature data enriches our understanding of arsenic's bonding behaviour. Our findings illuminate the structural attributes, molecular coordination, geometry, and bond lengths of arsenic with diverse atoms, enriching our comprehension of arsenic chemistry. These revelations not only offer a pathway for crafting innovative and safer arsenic-based compounds but also foster the evolution of arsenic detoxification mechanisms, tackling pivotal health and environmental challenges linked to arsenic exposure across different contexts.

Sustainable and rapid production of high-valent cobalt-oxo (Co(IV)=O) species for efficiently removing organic pollutants is challenging in permoxymonosulfate (PMS) based advanced-oxidation-processes (AOPs) due to the limitation of the high 3d-orbital electronic occupancy of Co and slow conversion from Co(III) to Co(II). Herein, S-scheme BiOCl-OV/CoAl-LDH heterojunction were constructed by ultrathin BiOCl with the oxygen-vacancy (OV) self-assembled with ultrathin CoAl-LDH. OV promoted the formation of charge transfer channel (Bi-O-Co bonds) at the interface of the heterojunction and reduced electron occupation of the Co 3d-orbital to facilitate the generation of Co(IV)=O in the BiOCl-OV/CoAl-LDH/PMS/Visible-light system. S-scheme heterojunction accelerated the photogenerated electrons to allow rapid conversion of Co(III) to Co(II), promoting the fast two-electron transfer from Co(II) to Co(IV)=O. Consequently, the developed BiOCl-OV/CoAl-LDH/PMS/Visible-light system showed excellent degradation efficiency for most of organic pollutions, and exhibited very high removal capability for the actual industrial wastewater. This study provides a new insight into the evolution of Co(IV)=O and the coordinative mechanism for photocatalysis and PMS activation.

Water electrolysis stands as a fundamental technique, involving the electrical decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. Recent advances in alkaline water electrolysis have yielded impressive results, with energy efficiencies exceeding 70%. The photoelectrochemical water electrolysis, characterized by its proton-conductive membrane, demonstrates remarkable promise, boasting efficiency levels of up to 80%. Solid oxide cells represent a high-temperature option for hydrogen production, showcasing efficiencies above 70%. The burgeoning fields of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting harness solar energy to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction. The results reveal that these technologies have achieved solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of up to 18%. These diverse approaches offer versatile solutions for green hydrogen production, vital for decarburization efforts. They address the need for sustainable, environmentally friendly, and secure energy sources, aligning with economic, environmental, and social considerations. As continue to advance these methodologies, hydrogen's role in our energy landscape grows, promising a cleaner and more sustainable future.

Lanthanide oxides have potential advantages for photocatalytic hydrogen production. To systematically investigate the photocatalytic performance of lanthanide oxides on metal sulfides, a series of LnxOy/ZnIn2S4 (LnxOy/ZIS) were synthesized by hydrothermal method. Comprehensive characterization demonstrated that LnxOy synergistically improved the performance of ZnIn2S4 by extending light absorption, reducing contact interface resistance and enhancing carrier separation. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) rates of the LnxOy/ZIS photocatalysts were improved, which were 1.6 to 4.2 times higher than those of pure ZnIn2S4 (198.0 μmol g-1 h-1). The PHE rates of LnxOy/ZIS decreased with increasing lanthanide atomic number, and when the lanthanides contained variable valence ions, the PHE rates of LnxOy/ZIS were superior to those of neighbouring lanthanides. The heterojunction formed by LnxOy and ZnIn2S4 effectively promoted carrier separation. Lanthanide ions with unoccupied 4 f orbital were more likely to accept electrons and served as a hydrogen adsorption site for further hydrogen reduction. Multivalent ions could also promote the migration of electrons and generate oxygen vacancies to inhibit the recombination of carriers. In conclusion, for ZnIn2S4, lanthanide oxides are promising candidates to improve the performance of PHE. This study provides guidance on the selection of appropriate lanthanide oxides for the construction of efficient sulphur-based heterojunction photocatalysts.

Abstract Lespedeza potaninii, a xerophytic subshrub belonging to the legume family, is native to the Tengger Desert and is highly adapted to drought. It has important ecological value due to its drought adaptability, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report a 1.24 Gb chromosome-scale assembly of the L. potaninii genome (contig N50=15.75 Mb). Our results indicate that L. potaninii underwent an allopolyploid event with two subgenomes, A and B, presenting asymmetric evolution and B subgenome dominance. We estimate that the two diploid progenitors of L. potaninii diverged around 3.6 MYA and merged around 1.0 MYA. We revealed that the expansion of hub genes associated with drought responses, such as the binding partner 1 of accelerated cell death 11 (ACD11) (BPA1), facilitated environmental adaptations of L. potaninii to desert habitats. We found a novel function of the BPA1 family in abiotic stress tolerance in addition to the known role in regulating the plant immune response, which could improve drought tolerance by positively regulating reactive oxygen species homeostasis in plants. We revealed that bZIP transcription factors could bind to the BPA1 promoter and activate its transcription. Our work fills the genomic data gap in the Lespedeza genus and the tribe Desmodieae, which should provide both theoretical support in the study of drought tolerance and in the molecular breeding of legume crops.

Abstract A 65–year–old male with renal cell carcinoma, previously treated with nephrectomy and recently diagnosed with lung metastases, presented to the cardiology clinic for investigations before starting chemotherapy. He reported a history of ischemic heart disease, a non–ST–elevation myocardial infarction for which he refused coronary angiography in 2005, and a negative maximal stress test for ischemia in 2017. Additionally, the patient reported insulin–dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and well–controlled arterial hypertension. The patient was referred for a cardiological evaluation due to a reported short–term rhythmic heartbeat without other cardiological symptoms. Cardiological parameters were stable (blood pressure: 140/95 mmHg; heart rate: 42 bpm, and oxygen saturation without oxygen supplementation: 98%). Physical examination was normal. Laboratory investigations did not show elevated levels of high–sensitivity troponin I, and only signs of mild chronic kidney disease were observed. The initial ECG showed sinus bradycardia with deeply inverted T–waves in the extended anterior area (Fig. 1), which were not present in an ECG performed one month earlier. There was no reported chest pain. An echocardiogram examination demonstrated hypertensive heart disease with marked hypokinesia of the mid–apical portion of the anterior wall and anterior interventricular septum, together with a moderate reduction in global systolic function (LV ejection fraction: 40%). The patient was hospitalized, and underwent coronary angiography the following day. He had a low–risk score (GRACE: 95 pts) As shown in Fig. 2, there was evidence of long sub–occlusive stenosis of the proximal part of the anterior descending coronary artery that was treated with angioplasty and a single drug–eluted stent placement, resulting in a good angiographic result. After the procedure, there was a rapid recovery of regional kinetics but a slower normalization of the electrocardiographic morphology (Fig. 3). Comment Wellens‘ syndrome identifies a particular subtype of unstable angina characterized by the appearance of ischemic changes on the ECG,. The clinical risk assessment of this subgroup of patients with ACS, apparently having a more benign prognosis due to their definition as unstable angina with a low GRACE risk score, potentially has an evolution toward a large myocardial infarction if not promptly diagnosed.

Cyanobacteria oxygenated the atmosphere of early Earth and continue to be key players in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. A phylogenetically diverse subset of extant cyanobacteria can perform photosynthesis with far-red light through a process called far-red light photoacclimation, or FaRLiP. This phenotype is enabled by a cluster of ~20 genes, and involves the synthesis of red-shifted chlorophylls f and d, together with paralogues of the ubiquitous photosynthetic machinery used in visible light. The FaRLiP gene cluster is present in diverse, environmentally important cyanobacterial groups but its origin, evolutionary history, and connection to early biotic environments have remained unclear. This study takes advantage of the recent increase in (meta)genomic data to clarify this issue; sequence data mining, metagenomic assembly, and phylogenetic tree networks were used to recover more than 600 new FaRLiP gene sequences, corresponding to 52 new gene clusters. These data enable high-resolution phylogenetics and - by relying on multiple gene trees, together with gene arrangement conservation - support FaRLiP appearing early in cyanobacterial evolution. Sampling information shows that considerable FaRLiP diversity can be observed in microbialites to the present day, and the process may have been associated with microbial mats and stromatolite formation in the early Paleoproterozoic. The ancestral FaRLiP cluster was reconstructed, revealing a conserved intergenic regulatory sequence that has been maintained for billions of years. Taken together, our results indicate that oxygenic photosynthesis using far-red light may have played a significant role in Earth's early history.

Abstract This study explores the low‐temperature pyrolysis kinetic of low metamorphic grade coal from Northern Shaanxi, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy to analyze the characteristics of various functional groups over a 293–1023 K temperature range. A kinetic model, correlating with the pyrolysis behaviors of these groups, was developed through thermal analysis kinetics. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology simulated the furnace's flow dynamics, allowing an examination of the physical field alterations and functional group evolution during pyrolysis. Results showed that the pyrolysis kinetic functions for aromatic C–H, C=C, C–O, and •OH, along with temperature, pressure, and velocity fields, were successfully integrated into the simulation. This integration provided detailed insights into the temperature profile, pressure distribution, flow velocities, and functional group distribution in the furnace. Aliphatics, exhibiting the largest mass fraction and wide pyrolysis temperature range, and •OH radicals with the highest activation energy were concentrated in the furnace's pyrolysis zone center. C=C's distribution was influenced by aromatic C–H and aliphatics, showing a complementary pattern. The oxygen‐containing groups C–O and C=O had similar pyrolysis mechanisms and uniform distribution. The functional groups' mass fractions were ranked from highest to lowest as follows: aliphatics > •OH > aromatic C–H > C–O > C=C > C=O.

Peroxiredoxins are a group of antioxidant enzymes that play a crucial role in eliminating hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produced during cellular metabolism. In conditions such as tissue ischemia/reperfusion, H 2 O 2 production is heightened. This scenario is recurrent in aquatic mammals, such as cetaceans and pinnipeds, when they perform breath-hold dives that lead to depletion of oxygen stores and cell hypoxia due to prolonged submersion. In such circumstances, peroxiredoxins are essential for regulating metabolism and preventing oxidative damage. Thus, our objective was to investigate evolutionary patterns of the peroxiredoxin gene family among aquatic mammalian species. Accordingly, we identified the number of ortholog and paralog genes among mammals, examining events of gene duplication, patterns of chromosomal distribution, and adaptive selection. We found that most subtypes of peroxiredoxins are characterized by single-copy genes with minimal missing data, with PRDX1, the most highly expressed subtype found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, exhibiting an increase in gene copies in aquatic mammals, particularly in pinnipeds. The distribution of the copies was dispersed along the genome and the majority were retrocopies of the main coding sequence with little divergence among them. We also found evidence of positive selection in the PRDX3 gene, especially in a convergent mutation among two deepest-diving species, cuvier’s beaked whale and southern elephant seal in which the amino acid had radical physical-chemical property change, possibly affecting the protein function. These results suggest that the peroxiredoxin gene family has a role in the evolution of aquatic mammals by reducing oxidative damage intrinsic to diving behavior in these species.

The analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of [${\alpha}$/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-${\alpha}$ and low-${\alpha}$ sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality, invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration. Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H], thus confirming previous suggestions by Gratton et al. (1996) and Fuhrmann (1998). Then we try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models. We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking also into account possible accretion of dwarf satellites. The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] exhibit a sharp increase of [Fe/$\alpha$] at a nearly constant [$\alpha$/H] (where $\alpha$ elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. A chemical model predicting a stop in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and where the high-$\alpha$ disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy can well explain the observations.

Abstract Male, 79 years old, presented to the ED with chest pain and hemodynamically instability. Approximately one month prior, he underwent aortic bioprosthesis implantation for severe aortic stenosis. Pre–intervention coronary angiography revealed diffuse atheromatous plaques, none of which were stenotic. Additionally, the patient‘s medical history included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on NOAC, hypertension and COPD. Upon admission: NIBP 80/50 mmHg, HR 150 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 85%. ECG showed atrial fibrillation with ST–segment elevation from V1 to V5. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.25 and lactate 6 mmol/L. He received inotropic and vasopressor support, and prompt coronary angiography was performed, revealing 99% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery at the bifurcation with the diagonal branch, which was treated with angioplasty and coronary stent placement (Fig.1). Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated the presence of the aortic bioprosthesis with diffusely thickened leaflets consistent with multiple vegetations. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed a nosocomial infectious endocarditis, with mild–to–moderate stenosis, and evidence of peri–prosthetic echogenic material directed towards the left atrium, suggestive of abscess. The patient reported low–grade fever and asthenia in the weeks prior. The systemic and local inflammatory state of the endocarditis contributed to an accelerated atherosclerotic process, destabilizing the plaque and resulting in its rupture. Blood cultures identified multidrug–resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus, for which specific antibiotic therapy was started. The patient and his family declined cardiac surgery due to high operative risk. Follow–up TEE, after approximately six weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy, showed reduced vegetations on the bioprosthetic valve leaflets, with evolution of the previously noted large echolucent cavity, along with two similar peri–prosthetic lesions. These findings were confirmed on contrast–enhanced CT. The patient, achieving hemodynamic stability, was discharged home, continuing intravenous antibiotic therapy (OPAT protocol). At the one–month post–discharge follow–up, the patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. A repeat TEE showed normally mobile bioprosthetic valve leaflets without vegetations, and the previously noted large cavity with internal flow, consistent with cleansed abscess (Fig.2–3).

Here, we use ecological modeling and computational flow simulations to explore how Ediacaran marine animal forests influenced their surrounding environment. Our results reveal how organism morphology and community structure and composition combined to impact vertical mixing of the surrounding water. We find that Mistaken Point communities were capable of generating high-mixing conditions, thereby likely promoting gas and nutrient transport within the "canopy." This mixing could have served to enhance local-scale oxygen concentrations and redistribute resources like dissolved organic carbon. Our work suggests that Ediacaran marine animal forests may have contributed to the ventilation of the oceans over 560 million years ago, well before the Cambrian explosion of animals.

Background: The retina is a light-sensitive nerve layer located at the back of the eye that creates images of objects. These cells kept alive by getting oxygen and nutrients from tiny blood vessels in the eye. Retinopathy is a disease of the retina that is more prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness because hyperglycemia weakens retinal capillaries, resulting in leakage of blood into the surrounding space. This bleeding can result in formation of scar tissue, which can cause traction retinal detachment and maculopathy. The development of a panel of blood biomarkers to monitor diabetic retinopathies is essential for both diagnosis and prognosis. Proteomics as a powerful tool for the analysis of complex mixtures of proteins and the identification of biomarkers can be of great importance. Purpose: To detect early nerve fiber layer changes around macula and optic disc in diabetic patients, and to correlate diabetic retinopathy with blood antioxidants and gut microbiota in T2DM in Saudi patients. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional case-control study, a total of 77 eyes of 39 subjects aged 40-60 years who did not have any history of eye injuries or eye diseases affecting fundus viewing, were recruited from King Saud University Campus and the department of ophthalmology in King Abdul Aziz university hospital in Riyadh. All subjects underwent full ophthalmic examination including Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular profile, Proteomic approach of collected overnight fasting plasma and Microbial stool examination. Results: The nerve fiber layer thickness around the optic disc was measured for all groups, and there was no statistically significant difference in all quadrants between groups. The total retinal thickness at the macular area was different among all groups and tends to increase in group 3 due to diabetic retinopathy. The macular thickness in the 4 quadrants revealed no statistical difference except in the inferior quadrant. Glutathione S transferase and lipid peroxides showed no significant difference between the three studied groups; vitamin C and Glutathione were surprisingly higher in controlled diabetic patients relative to controls. Moreover, over growth of bacteroids participated to the evolution of retinopathy in diabetic patients. Conclusion: As hyperglycemia and oxidative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, the present study certified that the progressive damage can be delayed in controlled type 2 diabetic patients using different treatment modalities that subside oxidative stress.

Recently, with the help of in-situ PL and GIWAXS measurements, we have shown that the defects are formed mainly at the grain boundaries and surface.1,2 Therefore, it is necessary to selectively passivate surface and grain boundaries. It was shown that the removal of thin surface layers using mechanical,3 or laser4 polishing may improve the performance of perovskite thin films and PCEs. In our work, we performed an initial study examining the effect of the DCSBD (the diffuse coplanar surface barrier discharge) plasma on perovskite thin films. The sample was placed in the vicinity of the plasma and exposed to the plasma for different duration. Using in-situ photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, we found that the exposure of perovskite surface to plasma in nitrogen atmosphere causes the removal of oxygen from perovskite film. We found that, at first, the PL intensity decreased significantly, which is caused by surface defects created by exposure to plasma. However, after this abrupt change, the plasma lines of singly ionized oxygen appear in the spectrum of the plasma, and the PL intensity increases until the oxygen is completely removed. This means that the removal of oxygen has a positive impact on defect densities in perovskite film. However, when completely removed, further exposure to plasma has only a negative impact. We believe this method could be an intermediate step before the deposition of a passivation layer on the perovskite. Additionally, the DCSBD plasma treatment is already used in different industrial applications and thus it is ready for use in large production lines.

&nbsp;In the early generation of the Indian 220 MWe pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR220), Zr-2.5Nb pressure tubes (PT) were manufactured from doublemelted (DM) ingots. Later on, quadruple melted (QM) ingots were used to achieve enhanced performance. These pressure tubes were fabricated by hot extrusion followed by double pilgering with intermediate annealing and this fabrication route is designated as an old route (OR). These tubes have performed reasonably well. However, some of these tubes showed higher in-reactor deformation. Subsequently, both alloy chemistry and manufacturing practice were revisited and changes in alloy chemistry and ingot diameter, mode of hot working for breaking the cast structure and hot extrusion of billets with higher extrusion ratio and single pilgering steps have been employed. This route is designated as a new route (NR) and is being used for manufacturing pressure tubes for the current generation of 220MWe pressurized heavy water reactors. <br><br>Over the years, changes in Chlorine (Cl), Carbon (C), Phosphorous (P), Iron (Fe) and Hydrogen (H) specification and narrowing down the specification for Niobium (Nb) and Oxygen (O) have been implemented to exploit their beneficial effect on in-reactor deformation and hydrogen pickup. The changes in manufacturing practices had resulted in changes in microstructure and texture. In the old route (OR), pressure tube (PT) microstructure was characterized by the presence of discrete beta-phase precipitates along the interfaces of alpha lamellae while the new route (NR) pressure tube (PT) exhibits more continuous beta film and relatively coarser α lamellae. In terms of crystallographic texture too, the new route (NR) pressure tubes (PTs) had higher FT values (in the order of 0.65) in comparison to old route (OR) pressure tubes (PTs) (FT~0.55 to 0.6).<br><br>Because of crystallographic and microstructural anisotropy, the tensile behavior of this material is also anisotropic with the transverse direction exhibiting higher flow stress and lower ductility at and below reactor operating temperatures. The transverse tensile strength of pressure tube (PTs) fabricated from new route (NR) is higher than that fabricated from old route (OR). The fracture toughness of pressure tubes (PT) manufactured from quadruple melted (QM) ingots are significantly higher than that of the pressure tubes (PTs) manufactured from double melted (DM) ingots, which is attributed to the deleterious effect of Chlorine (Cl), Carbon (C), Phosphorous (P) and their complexes. The variation in fracture toughness of pressure tubes (PTs) was evaluated as a function of temperature, hydrogen content and hydride orientation. The hydrided material exhibited a typical S curve showing lower-shelf, transition and upper shelf regimes. Delayed hydride cracking velocity and threshold stress intensity factor were determined as a function of temperature, direction of approach to test temperature and hydride orientation. Threshold stress for hydride reorientation (σth) determined using ex-situ and in-situ methods between 250 and 300oC was observed to decrease with an increase in temperature. Thermal creep behavior was investigated for these tubes at 350, 400 and 450 °C at different stress levels and comparison of the minimum creep rate and the rupture life is presented. This article describes the evolution of the alloy chemistry, microstructural features, texture and mechanical properties and hydride induced embrittlement of the pressure tubes (PTs) used in Indian pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) and life extension approaches. An attempt has been made to rationalize the observed properties in terms of alloy chemistry and microstructure.
