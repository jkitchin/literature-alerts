High/medium entropy alloys (HEAs/MEAs) with high electrocatalytic activity have attracted great attention in water electrolysis applications. However, facile synthesis of self-supporting high/medium entropy alloys electrocatalysts with rich active sites through classical metallurgical methods is still a challenge. Here, a self-supporting porous FeCoNi MEA electrocatalyst with nanosheets-shaped surface for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was prepared by a one-step electrochemical process from the metal oxides in molten CaCl2. The formation of the FeCoNi MEA is attributed to the oxides electro-reduction, high-temperature diffusion and solid solution. Additionally, the morphology and structure of the FeCoNi MEA can be precisely controlled by adjusting the electrolysis time and temperature. The electronic structure regulation and the reduced energy barrier of OER from the "cocktail effect", the abundant exposed active sites brought by surface ultrathin nanosheets, the good electronic conductivity and electrochemical stability from the self-supporting structure enable the FeCoNi MEA electrode shows high-performance OER electrocatalysis, exhibiting a low overpotential of 233 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2, a low Tafel slop of 29.8 mV dec–1, and an excellent stability for over 500 h without any obvious structural destruction. This work demonstrates a facile one-step electrochemical metallurgical approach for fabricating self-supporting HEAs/MEAs electrocatalysts with nanosized surface for the application in water electrolysis.

Efficient and durable electrocatalysts with sufficient active sites and high intrinsic activity are essential for advancing energy-saving hydrogen production technology. In this study, a Mott-Schottky heterojunction electrocatalyst with Ag nanoparticles in-situ grown on NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH)/NiFe2O4 nanosheets (Ag@NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4) were designed and successfully synthesized through a hydrothermal process and subsequent spontaneous redox reaction. The in-situ growth of metallic Ag on semiconducting NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4 triggers a strong electron interaction across the Mott-Schottky interface, leading to a significant increase in both the intrinsic catalytic activity and the electrochemical active surface area of the heterojunction electrocatalyst. As a result, the Ag@NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4 demonstrates impressive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline KOH solution, achieving a low overpotential of 249 mV at 100 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 42.79 mV dec−1. When the self-supported Ag@NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4 is coupled with the Pt/C electrocatalyst, the alkaline electrolyzer reaches a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of only 1.460 V. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in-situ Raman analysis reveal that the Ni(Fe)OOH is the possible active phase for OER in the catalyst. In addition, when employed for UOR catalysis, the Ag@NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4 also displays intriguing activity with an ultralow potential of 1.389 V at 50 mA cm−2. This work may shed light on the rational design of multiple-phase heterogeneous electrocatalysts and demonstrate the significance of interface engineering in enhancing catalytic performance.

<p>Inorganic, organic, and hybrid two-dimensional (2D) materials are being developed for ever-expanding numbers of applications, though energy and catalysis remain the main drivers of their development. We present overviews of bottom-up and top-down synthetic strategies of such materials and examine manufacturing scalability issues. Mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties and their modulation are highlighted because they are fundamental to the above-mentioned drivers. The burgeoning importance of heterostructures in such materials, particularly for catalysis and electrode design and function is stressed. Detailed attention is given to applications of 2D materials to the electrocatalysis reactions: oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. Water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction by photocatalysis are also examined. A perspective of expected advances in the expansion of applications and types of 2D materials, with a focus on heterostructure development, is presented in the conclusion.</p>

Abstract The generation of green hydrogen by water splitting is identified as a key strategic energy technology, and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one of the desirable technologies for converting renewable energy sources into hydrogen. However, the harsh anode environment of PEMWE and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving four‐electron transfer result in a large overpotential, which limits the overall efficiency of hydrogen production, and thus efficient electrocatalysts are needed to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetic process. In recent years, noble metal‐based electrocatalysts (e.g., Ru/Ir‐based metal/oxide electrocatalysts) have received much attention due to their unique catalytic properties, and have already become the dominant electrocatalysts for the acidic OER process and are applied in commercial PEMWE devices. However, these noble metal‐based electrocatalysts still face the thorny problem of conflicting performance and cost. In this review, first, noble metal Ru/Ir‐based OER electrocatalysts are briefly classified according to their forms of existence, and the OER catalytic mechanisms are outlined. Then, the focus is on summarizing the improvement strategies of Ru/Ir‐based OER electrocatalysts with respect to their activity and stability over recent years. Finally, the challenges and development prospects of noble metal‐based OER electrocatalysts are discussed.

Abstract Although numerous efforts are made to synthesize active electrocatalysts for green hydrogen production; catalyst stability, and facile synthesis to scale up the production are still challenging. Herein, the production of novel non‐PGM catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (OER) in an alkaline aqueous medium is reported, which is based on the synthesis of a trimetallic metal–organic framework (MOF) precursors. Fine‐tuning of the composition of the metal centers (Ni, Co, and Fe) shows a great effect on OER activity after the MOF undergoes dynamic chemical and structural transformations under OER conditions. In situ characterization reveals the origin of OER activity enhancement as metals’ oxidation state increases, inducing compressive mechanical strain on metal centers, enhancing the electronic conductivity through the formation of oxygen vacancies, and stronger metal–oxygen covalency. Catalysts are used in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) setup within an industrial full‐cell anion exchange membrane electrolyzer (AEMEC), showing a stable performance for 550 h without noticeable decay at 750 and 1000 mA cm −2 industrial level current densities.

Electrochemical water splitting is regarded as an effective technology for producing green hydrogen, which is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. In particular, direct seawater splitting offers significant economic and environmental advantages. However, its efficiency is hindered by the high overpotential required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the competition from chloride oxidation. This review highlights the potential of interface engineering to overcome these limitations and develop efficient OER electrocatalysts. We comprehensively explore recent advancements in interface engineering for OER in both alkaline and seawater environments. We begin by introducing the mechanisms of freshwater and seawater electrolysis, emphasizing key considerations for OER catalyst design. Subsequently, we review the recent progress made in various interface engineering strategies, analyzing their impact on OER performance in both electrolytes. Finally, we outline promising future directions for developing efficient seawater oxidation catalysts through interface engineering.

High-entropy materials (HEMs) play a significant role in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their unique properties. However, there are still challenges in the preparation of HEMs for OER catalysts. In this study, the FeCoNiMnCr catalyst is synthesized for the first time using the ultrasonic hydrothermal-sintering technique and exhibits excellent performance for OER electrocatalysis. There is an optimal ultrasonic hydrothermal time and power for achieving the best OER performance. The results demonstrate that the performance of FeCoNiMnCr catalysts prepared through ultrasonic hydrothermal sintering (US-FeCoNiMnCr) is significantly improved compared with the traditional hydrothermal-sintering method. The US-FeCoNiMnCr catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 228 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope as low as 45.39 mV dec−1 in an alkaline medium. Moreover, the US-FeCoNiMnCr catalyst demonstrates remarkable stability in electrocatalytic OER with a minimal potential increase observed even after 48 h. This work not only provides valuable insights into high-entropy material synthesis, but also presents a powerful electrocatalyst for water electrolysis.

It is important for the practical application of water electrolysis to explore stable and earth-rich bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). An immersion-selenization strategy was proposed to prepare CoSe2/Co nanorods anchored on Co foam as bifunctional catalysts for OER and UOR. Due to the self-supported properties of CoSe2/Co and its unique nanorod structure, the OER activity is enhanced, showing an overpotential of 318 mV and a Tafel slope of 91.11 mV dec–1. In addition, the electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic UOR activity with an overpotential of 260 mV and a Tafel slope of 94.83 mV dec–1. The nanorod structure was basically retained after a 28 h durability test. This work provides a broad approach to the development of low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts.

The development of low‐cost transition metal compounds with high‐performance for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in promoting the development of electrocatalysis. In this study, a Ce‐doped Ni3S4 catalyst (Ce0.2‐Ni3S4) was synthesized through a one‐step solvothermal method, where the doped rare earth element Ce induced the transformation of NiS to Ni3S4. The Ce0.2‐Ni3S4 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance in 1 M KOH. At a current density of 10 mA cm‐2, it showed a low overpotential of 230 mV and a low Tafel slope of 52.39 mV dec‐1. Long‐term OER tests at the same potential lasted for 24 h without significant loss of current density. This work introduces a novel method of Ce element doping for modifying transition metal sulfides, providing new insights into the effective utilization of rare earth elements in the field of electrochemistry. It creates more chances for the progress of highly efficient catalysts for efficient OER, contributing to the advancement of electrocatalysis.

Global energy consumption increases year after year, causing the depletion of non-renewable sources. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global demand for electrical energy is expected to increase by 3.3 % in 2024. Therefore, developing new renewable sources is urgent, including new devices for energy storage and conversion, particularly those based on electrochemical reactions. Water splitting is a clean and sustainable technology capable of facing this issue by producing oxygen and hydrogen from water and electricity. However, an issue related to this technology is the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, making it necessary to develop new electrocatalysts with high electrochemical performance. To meet this requirement, this work deals, for the first time, with a high entropy oxide with a rock-salt structure synthesized by a green sol-gel synthesis using red seaweed (Rhodophyta) as a polymerizing agent. Sol-gel synthesis allows the large-scale production of nanomaterials with high uniformity and dispersion of the chemical elements involved. The literature, which discussed the synthesis of these oxides, reveals that agents harmful to the environment are employed, including sodium hydroxide, acetic acid, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, urea, and ammonium hydroxide. The composition of the high entropy oxide is (Mg0.2Ni0.2Co0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O. As electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, it exhibits a low overpotential (336 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2), a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec-1, and excellent durability. The electrochemical performance of the high entropy oxide prepared in this work is superior to other electrocatalysts of the same class that were produced using transition metal-based precursors.

This work utilized an innovative and economical remediation method to convert inexpensive waste feedstock into extremely useful catalysts. The procedure centered on polyethylene (PE), an easily accessible substance, and effectively transformed it at a mild temperature utilizing a new solvothermal technique, which entailed the reaction of sulfuric acid with PE chains at 120 °C. Throughout this process, the polymer experienced a pivotal cross-linking stage, resulting in its conversion into carbon materials when exposed to temperatures above 500 °C. To improve the catalytic characteristics, platinum (Pt) was effectively integrated into the resultant carbon matrix using the existing impregnation technique. Further, the catalyst's physicochemical properties were thoroughly analyzed utilizing SEM, FTIR, and XRD techniques. After that, the catalyst's performance was thoroughly evaluated in several electrocatalytic reactions, such as methanol oxidation, oxygen evolution and reduction reactions, and hydrogen evolution. The results of this investigation reveal the impressive electrocatalytic ability of the Pt/C catalyst made from waste plastic. It was found to be comparable to the best commercially available Pt/C catalysts in all the reactions that were examined. This research not only demonstrates the possibility of using waste plastic for catalyst production, but also serves as the first documented example, based on successfully converting waste plastic bags into Pt/C through the conventional Liquid Phase Reduction (LPR) process. This novel method has great potential for sustainable and ecologically responsible catalytic applications.

Abstract Electrochemical activation usually accompanies in situ atom rearrangement forming new catalytic sites with higher activity due to reconstructed atomic clusters or amorphous phases with abundant dangling bonds, vacancies, and defects. By harnessing the pre‐catalytic process of reconstruction, a multilevel structure of CuNi alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in N‐doped carbon (CuNi nanoalloy@N/C) transforms into a highly active compound of Ni‐doped CuO nanocluster supported on (N/O‐C) co‐doped C. Both the exposure of accessible active sites and the activity of individual active sites are greatly improved after the pre‐catalytic reconstruction. Manipulating the Cu/Ni ratios of CuNi nanoalloy@N/C can tailor the electronic property and d‐band center of the high‐active compound, which greatly optimizes the energetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates. This interplay among Cu, Ni, C, N, and O modifies the interface, triggers the active sites, and regulates the work functions, thereby realizing a synergistic boost in OER.
