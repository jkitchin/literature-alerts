Developing cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts is essential for advancing a green energy future. Herein, a NiFe-layered double hydroxide loaded on reduced graphene oxide (NiFe-LDHs@rGO) hybrid was synthesized using a straightforward three-step process involving exfoliation tearing, electrostatic self-assembly, and chemical reduction. The face-to-face packing and ultrathin exfoliation enable strong heterogeneous interactions, fully harnessing the potential of these complementary two-dimensional counterparts. Consequently, the resultant catalyst displays outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity and stability, whose overpotential is as low as 241 mV at 30 mA cm

Abstract Although ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) is an efficacious oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in acidic media, its performance in alkaline conditions is subpar and it is also ineffective for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in common electrolytes. Here, an effective phosphorus (P)‐doping strategy is introduced to manipulate the d ‐band center of ruthenium (Ru) sites, attenuating the adsorption energy of HER intermediates and lowering the energy barrier in OER, thereby significantly accelerating both HER and OER performance. The representative 10%P‐RuO 2 nanofibers (NFs) catalyst presents an ultralow overpotential of 177.9 mV at 1 A cm −2 and long‐term stability of 300 h in 1 m KOH toward HER, greatly exceeding those of benchmark platinum (Pt)/C catalyst. Moreover, the 10%P‐RuO 2 NFs catalyst exhibits an exceptional OER performance with a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm −2 (η 10 ) and desirable stability of 150 h at 1 A cm −2 , which is far better than commercial RuO 2 and many other typical previously reported OER catalysts. Additionally, an overall water electrolytic cell using 10%P‐RuO 2 NFs as both anode and cathode necessitates a working voltage of 1.52 V (η 10 ) and demonstrates long‐term stability over 100 h at 1 A cm −2 , outperforming many typical water electrolysis cells.

Efficient and durable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction are essential for realizing the large-scale application of water electrolysis technologies. Here, we report a novel Zn-doped NiOOH subnanowires (Zn–NiOOH SNWs) catalyst synthesized via the electrochemical reconstruction of Zn–NiMoO4 SNWs. The inclusion of Zn triggers a transition in the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism of NiOOH from the adsorbate evolution mechanism to the lattice oxygen mechanism, resulted from Zn's adaptive adjustment of coordination types, which also improves the reaction energetics, thereby enhancing the stability and activity. Furthermore, the subnanowire structure provides further stabilization of the lattice oxygen in Zn–NiOOH, preventing its destructive dissolution. Remarkably, Zn–NiOOH SNWs display a current density of 10 mA cm–2 with an overpotential of only 179 mV and maintain stable operation at 200 mA cm–2 for 800 h with minimal changes in overpotential, establishing them as one of the most effective catalysts involving lattice oxygen for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. When utilized as the anode in an alkaline water electrolyzer, our Zn–NiOOH SNWs catalyst demonstrates stability exceeding 500 h under a water-splitting current of 200 mA cm–2, indicating promising potential for practical applications.

Abstract Bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with low cost, high activity, and long‐term durability are highly desired for rechargeable zinc‐air batteries (RZABs). However, the design of such catalysts is a significant challenge. Herein, a new bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of atomically dispersed Fe‐N 4 sites bridged with MoO x clusters (FeN 4 /MoO x ) on carbon black substrate is designed for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involved in liquid and flexible RZABs. The FeN 4 /MoO x is prepared by pyrolyzing hematin porcine adsorbed on carbon black, followed by hydrothermal growth of MoO x . In the FeN 4 /MoO x catalyst, the Fe atoms are atomically dispersed and penta‐coordinated with four pyrrolic N atoms and one O atom of MoO x clusters. Such a structure produces strong electronic interactions between the Fe and Mo atoms. The FeN 4 /MoO x electrocatalyst exhibits excellent ORR and OER activities, with an ORR half‐wave potential of 0.902 V, an OER overpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , and an ultrasmall potential gap of 0.665 V. Liquid and flexible RZABs based on the FeN 4 /MoO x catalyst show a high energy and power density, as well as excellent cycling stability and rechargeability. This work introduces a novel type of bifunctional catalysts consisting of connected single atoms and clusters for energy storage devices and wearable electronics.

The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton‐exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)2‐assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium‐doped IrOx catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir‐O covalency. This design facilitates direct O‐O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr‐IrOx catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr‐IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72 V at 1 A cm‐2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500 hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium‐based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.

Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co2+, Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with OH−/H+ interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co2+ sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high‐valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co2+ acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH− ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co2+ sites, the as‐derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the rate‐limiting step in water electrolysis due to its sluggish kinetic, and it is challenging to develop an OER catalyst that could work efficiently in both acid and alkaline environment. Herein, NiIr nanowire assembles (NAs) with unique nanoflower morphology were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. As a result, the NiIr NAs exhibited superior OER activity in both acid and alkaline media. Specifically, in 0.1 M HClO4, NiIr NAs presented a superior electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of merely 242 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and a Tafel slope of only 58.1 mV dec‐1, surpassing that of commercial IrO2 and pure Ir NAs. And it achieved a significantly higher mass activity of 148.40 A/g at ‐1.5 V versus RHE. In 1.0 M KOH, NiIr NAs has an overpotential of 291 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and a Tafel slope of 42.1 mV dec‐1. Such remarkable activity makes the NiIr NAs among the best of recently reported representative Ir‐based OER electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed alloying effect promotes surface bonding of NiIr with oxygen‐containing reactants, resulting in excellent catalytic properties.

Development of high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial to realizing the electrolytic water cycle. C60 is an ideal substrate material for single atom catalysts (SACs) due to its unique electron-withdrawing properties and spherical structure. In this work, we screened for a novel single-atom catalyst based on C60, which anchored transition metal atoms in the C60 molecule by coordination with N atoms. Through first-principles calculations, we evaluated the stability and activity of MN4–C54 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, Pt, Ir, Au). The results indicate that CuN4–C54, which is based only on earth-abundant elements, exhibited low overpotentials of 0.46 and 0.47 V for the OER and ORR, respectively, and was considered a promising bifunctional catalyst, showing better performance than the noble-metal ones. In addition, according to the linear relationship of intermediates, we established volcano plots to describe the activity trends of the OER and ORR on MN4–C54. Finally, d-band center and crystal orbital Hamiltonian populations methods were used to explain the catalytic origin. Suitable d-band centers lead to moderate adsorption strength, further leading to good catalytic performances.

Abstract The application of thermodynamically more favorable sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR) to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrocatalytic water electrolysis is an appealing strategy to achieve low‐energy hydrogen production while removing toxic sulfur ions from wastewater. However, the study of SOR catalysts with both activity and stability still faces great challenges. Herein, this study prepares partially amorphous Ru‐doped CoSe (pa‐Ru‐CoSe) nanoparticles for SOR. The doping of Ru keeps Co in an electron‐deficient state, which enhances the adsorption of SOR intermediates and improves the catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the partially amorphous selenide possesses great corrosion resistance to sulfur species, thus ensuring stability in long‐term SOR. In addition, the pa‐Ru‐CoSe requires only 0.566 V to reach a current density of 100 mA cm −2 in the SOR‐HER coupled system and remains stable for 200 h. This work provides a promising partially amorphous strategy for SOR catalysts with both catalytic activity and long‐term stability, enabling hydrogen production with low energy consumption and simultaneous sulfur production.

The development of a bifunctional electrocatalyst with high efficiency, high stability, and low cost is of great significance in practical applications of electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a self-supporting bifunctional electrocatalyst with a NiFe layered double hydroxide/Fe2O3/Ni3S2 heterostructure (NiFe LDH/Fe2O3/Ni3S2/IF) for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) is synthesized by the self-corrosion of iron foam (IF) and hydrothermal strategies. The constructed NiFe LDH/Fe2O3/Ni3S2/IF hierarchical heterostructure was not only beneficial to expose active sites and promote charge/mass transfer but also generate a superhydrophilic/superaerophobic surface, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics to improve the HER/OER activity. Therefore, NiFe LDH/Fe2O3/Ni3S2/IF exhibited superior overpotentials of 226.2 and 162.8 mV for the OER and HER at 100 mA cm–2, respectively. NiFe LDH/Fe2O3/Ni3S2/IF was employed as both the cathode and the anode to assemble a device for overall water splitting and displayed a voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm–2. The overall water splitting device was coupled with a solar cell to simulate a solar-powered water splitting system, resulting in a superior solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 15.16%. This work can promote the development of clean energy sources such as solar hydrogen production.

The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton‐exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)2‐assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium‐doped IrOx catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir‐O covalency. This design facilitates direct O‐O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr‐IrOx catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr‐IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72 V at 1 A cm‐2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500 hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium‐based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.

Developing cost-effective, readily available materials for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting is a crucial step toward enhancing the profitability and sustainability of energy conversion systems. This research introduces a novel synthesis method for NiFeP/NPC OHs from banana peel bio-waste, a method that could revolutionize the field of materials science and electrochemistry. The use of metallic phosphides, known for their excellent electrical conductivity and catalytic activity, as bifunctional catalysts, combined with the efficient synthesis of nanoporous carbons (NPC) from banana peel bio-waste (BPW), could pave the way for a new era of sustainable and cost-effective energy conversion. By chemically activating different porogens, such as nickel, iron, and phosphorus (NiFeP), to form (oxy) hydroxides (OHs), functional carbonaceous structures with a high density of pores and large specific surface areas can be achieved. The resulting materials, designated as NiFeP/NPC OHs, are characterized by their remarkable porosity, high conductivity, large surface area, and chemical stability. These properties make NiFeP/NPC OHs particularly suitable for electrocatalysis, where they exhibit outstanding activity in both HER and OER. The optimized NiFeP/NPC OHs material shows a very low overpotential of 93 mV for HER and 243 mV for OER at 10 mA cm⁻

Robust electrocatalysts required to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during water electrolysis are still a missing component toward the path for sustainable hydrogen production. Here a new family of OER active quaternary mixed-oxides based on X–Sn–Mo–Sb (X = Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) is reported. These nonstoichiometric mixed oxides form a rutile-type crystal structure with a random atomic motif and diverse oxidation states, leading to the formation of cation vacancies and local disorder. The successful incorporation of all cations into a rutile structure was achieved using oxidizing agents that facilitates the formation of Sb5+ required to form the characteristic octahedral coordination in rutile. The mixed oxides exhibit enhanced stability in both acidic and alkaline environments under anodic potentials with no changes in their crystal structure after extensive electrochemical stress. The improved stability of these mixed oxides highlights their potential application as scaffolds to host and stabilize OER active metals.

Abstract To realize the practical application of rechargeable Zn–Air batteries (ZABs), it is imperative to develop a non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalyst with high electrochemical performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Ni‐doped Co 9 S 8 nanoparticles dispersed on an inverse opal‐structured N, S co‐doped carbon matrix (IO─Ni x Co 9‐x S 8 @NSC) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst is presented. The unique 3D porous structure, arranged in an inverse opal pattern, provides a large active surface area. Also, the conductive carbon substrate ensures the homogeneous dispersion of Ni x Co 9‐x S 8 nanocrystals, preventing aggregation and increasing the exposure of active sites. The introduction of heteroatom dopants into the Co 9 S 8 structure generates defect sites and enhances surface polarity, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solutions. Consequently, the IO─Ni x Co 9‐x S 8 @NSC shows excellent bifunctional activity with a high half‐wave potential of 0.926 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 289 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for OER. Moreover, the rechargeable ZAB assembled with prepared electrocatalyst exhibits a higher specific capacity (768 mAh g Zn −1 ), peak power density (180.2 mW cm −2 ), and outstanding stability (over 160 h) compared to precious metal‐based electrocatalyst.

Abstract Seawater direct electrolysis (SDE) using renewable energy provides a sustainable pathway to harness abundant oceanic hydrogen resources. However, the side-reaction of the chlorine electro-oxidation reaction (ClOR) severely decreased direct electrolysis efficiency of seawater and gradually corrodes the anode. In this study, a redox-mediated strategy is introduced to suppress the ClOR, and a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis (DSDE) system incorporating a separate O 2 evolution reactor is established. Ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN) 6 ] 3−/4− ) serves as an electron-mediator between the cell and the reactor, thereby enabling a more dynamically favorable half-reaction to supplant the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This alteration involves a straightforward, single-electron-transfer anodic reaction without gas precipitation and effectively eliminates the generation of chlorine-containing byproducts. By operating at low voltages (~1.37 V at 10 mA cm −2 and ~1.57 V at 100 mA cm −2 ) and maintaining stability even in a Cl − -saturated seawater electrolyte, this system has the potential of undergoing decoupled seawater electrolysis with zero chlorine emissions. Further improvements in the high-performance redox-mediators and catalysts can provide enhanced cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the DSDE system.

Abstract The construction of sub‐nanometer cluster catalysts (<1 nm) with almost complete exposure of active atoms serves as a promising avenue for the simultaneous enhancement of atom utilization efficiency and specific activity. Herein, a core–shell cobalt‐cerium bimetallic oxide protected by high coverage sub‐nanometer Ir clusters (denoted as Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 ) is constructed by a confined in situ exsolution strategy. The distinctive core–shell structure endows Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 with enhanced intrinsic activity and high conductivity, facilitating efficient charge transfer and full‐pH water splitting. The Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 achieves low overpotentials of 49/215, 52/390, and 54/243 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 , 1.0 m PBS, and 1.0 m KOH, respectively. The small decline in performance after 300 h of operation renders it one of the most effective catalysts for full‐pH water splitting. DFT calculations indicate that oriented electron transfer (along the path from Ce to Co and then to Ir) creates an electron‐rich environment for surface Ir clusters. The reconstructed interface electronic environment provides optimized intermediates adsorption/desorption energy at the Ir site (for HER) and at the Ir‐Co site (for OER), thus simultaneously speeding up the HER/OER kinetics.

Metal–support interaction (MSI) is pivotal and ubiquitously used in the development of next-generation catalysts, offering a pathway to enhance both catalytic activity and stability. However, owing to the lattice mismatch and poor solubility, traditional catalysts often exhibit a metal-on-support heterogeneous structure with limited interfaces and interaction and, consequently, a compromised enhancement of properties. Herein, we report a universal and tunable method for supersaturated doping of transition-metal carbides via strongly nonequilibrium carbothermal shock synthesis, characterized by rapid heating and swift quenching. Our results enable ∼20 at. % Ni2FeCo doping in Mo2C, significantly surpassing the thermodynamic equilibrium limit of <3 at. %. The supersaturation ensures more catalytically active NiFeCo doping and sufficient interaction with Mo2C, resulting in the maximized MSI (Max-MSI) effect. The Max-MSI enables outstanding activity and particularly stability in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction, showing an overpotential of 284 mV at 100 mA cm–2 and stable for 700 h, while individual Ni2FeCo and Mo2C only last less than 70 and 10 h (completely dissolved), respectively. In particular, the SD-Mo2C catalyst also exhibits excellent durability at 100 mA cm–2 for up to 400 h in 7 M KOH. Such a significantly improved stability is attributed to the supersaturated doping that led to each Mo atom strongly binding with adjacent heteroatoms, thus elevating the dissolution potential and corrosion resistance of Mo2C at a high current density. Additionally, the highly dispersed NiFeCo also facilitates the formation of dense oxyhydroxide coating during reconstruction, further protecting the integrated catalysts for durable operation. Furthermore, the synthesis has been successfully scaled up to fabricate large (16 cm2) electrodes and is adaptable to nickel foam substrates, indicating promising industrial applications. Our strategy allows the general and versatile production of various highly doped transition-metal carbides, such as Ni2FeCo-doped TiC, NbC, and W2C, thus unlocking the potential of maximized or adjustable MSI for diverse catalytic applications.

A novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst was prepared by a synthesis strategy consisting of the solvothermal growth of Ni3S2 nanostructures on Ni foam, followed by hydrothermal incorporation of Fe species (Fe–Ni3S2/Ni foam). This electrocatalyst displayed a low OER overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA·cm–2, a low Tafel slope of 43 mV·dec–1, and constant performance at an industrially relevant current density (500 mA·cm–2) over 100 h in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, despite a minor loss of Fe in the process. Based on a detailed characterization by (in situ) Raman spectroscopy, (quasi-in situ) XPS, SEM, TEM, XRD, ICP-AES, EIS, and Cdl analysis, the high OER activity and stability of Fe–Ni3S2/Ni foam were attributed to the nanostructuring of the surface in the form of stable nanosheets and to the combination of Ni3S2 granting suitable electrical conductivity with newly formed NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides at the surface of the material providing the active sites for OER.

The production and consumption of protons by an electrocatalyst will, under certain conditions, generate localized microenvironments with properties distinct from those of the bulk solution. These local properties are particularly impactful for reactions involving proton-coupled electron transfer, where the generation of locally basic or acidic environments may significantly influence the energy efficiency and reaction selectivity of the electrocatalyst. Whereas local pH environments have been observed and characterized in reductive half-reactions, including the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, the incompatibility of conventional techniques and materials has limited studies in oxidative half-reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which provides the reducing equivalents for solar-to-fuels electrolysis. With the straightforward parameters bulk pH, buffer composition and pKa, and mass transport, we develop a model for describing local pH as a function of current density regardless of the microscopic details of the mechanism. Using an acid-stable PbOx OER catalyst, we observe the formation and dissipation of pH gradients during the OER and validate the model with voltammetric and potentiometric studies. The model predicts how local acidic environments can develop over a narrow OER current density window, thus providing further motivation for the development of OER catalysts that are stable to acid, even when operating in basic aqueous conditions. More generally, the model is not restricted to the OER and is useful for determining the onset of local pH gradients for other electrocatalytic reactions that involve the consumption or generation of protons in energy conversion reactions.

Designing catalysts with desirable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance under pH-universal conditions is of great significance to promote the development of hydrogen production. Herein, we successfully synthesized a crystalline–amorphous IrOx supported on perovskite oxide nanotubes to obtain IrOx@La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 with superior OER performance in whole pH media. The overpotential of the IrOx@La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 catalyst in media of pH 14, 7.2, and 1 has been demonstrated to be 120, 400, and 143 mV, respectively, with no significant element dissolution as well as double-layer capacitance decay after the durability test. Through comparative experiments with IrOx@CNT and the physical mixture of IrOx and La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3, it is found that the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) in IrOx@La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 makes IrOx exist in an amorphous state rich in Ir3+, which is closely associated with the surface-active species Ir-OH. Through the regulation of Ir by a perovskite oxide support at the heterointerface, the reaction breaks through the limitation of the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and converts to a lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM), which was fully demonstrated by the addition of the probe tetramethylammonium cation (TMA+), a LOM reaction intermediate, to the electrolyte. This work fills the research gap of perovskite oxide supported Ir-based catalysts with heterogeneous structures, providing an excellent strategy for the structural design of efficient pH-universal OER catalysts for hydrogen production systems.

In this study, a supramolecular micelle hydrogel as the ink to fabricate 3D‐structured TMS is utilized. Initially, the hydrogels are printed and infused with metal salt solutions to stabilize the structures, which are then calcined to convert into miniaturized 3D‐TMS replicas. The micellar hydrogels crosslink via hydrophobic interactions, with sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) micelles providing both a hydrophobic environment and sulfur sources. During calcination, the decomposed sulfur precursors coordinate with metal ions to form various TMS, including FeS 2 , Cu 2 S, Ni 3 S 2 , and Co 9 S 8 , along with several metal sulfides like PbS and SnS. Additionally, the method also allows for the preparation of transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS 2 and WS 2 . The formation mechanism is demonstrated using Ni 3 S 2 as an example which exhibits notable catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Given its simplicity and versatility, this dynamic micellar hydrogel‐derived strategy offers a promising pathway for creating advanced TMS materials.

IrOx of the amorphous phase has long been recognized to exhibit higher catalytic activity than crystalline analogues toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but always at the expense of reduced stability. Here, we report an ultrathin Ir surface with high-density grain boundaries (GBs), which transforms into locally stabilized amorphous IrOx by forming an Ir/IrOx interface under OER conditions. The catalyst displays a low overpotential of 263 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a mass activity (5.8 A mgIr–1 at 1.53 V) of over 90-fold higher than that of commercial IrO2, along with long-term stability for over 350 h. The activity enhancement arises from the stronger binding strength of *OOH on the amorphous GBs relative to the crystalline region, thus breaking the scaling relationship between *OH and *OOH and reducing the energy barrier for the potential determining step of the OER. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis using this catalyst achieves 2.7 A cm–2 at 2 V cell voltage and operates stably at 1 A cm–2 for over 200 h. The stabilization of the amorphous IrOx phase at GBs may accelerate the development of more active and robust acidic OER electrocatalysts.

Quick and easy synthetic methods and highly efficient catalytic performance are equally important to anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for alkaline seawater electrolysis. Herein, we report a facile one-step route to in situ growing PO43– intercalated NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) on Ni foam (denoted as NiFe-P/NF) by a room-temperature immersion for several minutes. This ultrafast approach transforms the NF surface into a rough PO43– intercalated NiFe-LDH overlayer, which demonstrates outstanding OER performance in both alkaline simulated and natural seawaters owing to good hydrophilic interface and the electrostatic repulsion of PO43– against Cl– anions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the intercalated PO43– can not only promote electron transfer but also prevent Cl– from entering the interlayer and simultaneously inhibit the migration of Cl– over the NiFe-LDH surface. In alkaline simulated and natural seawater electrolytes, NiFe-P/NF needs low overpotentials of 248 and 298 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm–2, respectively. NiFe-P/NF can stably run over 42 h in an alkaline high-salty electrolyte (1 M KOH + 2.5 M NaCl) at 250 mA cm–2, more than 70 times that of NiFe/NF (0.6 h), emphasizing the critical role of the intercalated PO43– anions on the excellent durability. This study offers a new strategy to modify commercial NF to prepare efficient and stable OER catalysts for seawater electrolysis.

The recent detection of super-solar carbon-to-oxygen and nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in a group of metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times and prompted fresh inquiries into their origins. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in the Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at $z = 10.6$ and GS-z12 at $z = 12.5$ To this aim, we incorporated a stochastic star formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data while focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range $-4.5 Fe/H -1.5$ can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) versus log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs (redshifts). Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11 and GS-z12 we provide an alternative interpretation of their high N/O and C/O abundance ratios demonstrating that an anomalously high N or C content can be reproduced through enrichment from faint Pop III SNe. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high C/O and N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.

Vacancy-ordered perovskite oxides are attracting attention due to their diverse functions such as resistive switching, electrocatalytic activity, oxygen diffusivity, and ferroelectricity. It is important to clarify the chemical lattice strains arising from compositional changes and the associated vacancy order–disorder phase transitions at the atomic scale. Here, we elucidate the intermediate process of a topotactic phase transition in Ca-doped bismuth ferrite films consisting of alternating stacks of oxygen perovskite layers and a brownmillerite-type oxygen vacancy layer. We use Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to closely examine the evolution of local strains exerted on the constituent sub-layers by electrochemical oxidation. A negative Raman chemical shift is observed during oxidation, which is linearly correlated with the local negative chemical expansivity of the oxygen layer. It seemingly contradicts with the general trend that oxides undergo lattice contraction upon oxidation. Oxygen vacancies initially confined in the vacancy layers can be understood to diffuse into the oxygen layers during melting of the ordered structure. The finding deepens our understanding of the electro-chemo-mechanical coupling of vacancy-ordered oxides.

The circulatory system provides the tissues with oxygen, nutrients and hormones, and removes waste products and carbon dioxide therefrom. In mammalian species there is no alternative for the exchange of gasses, nutrients and metabolites. Therefore, a well functioning circulatory system, which can adapt regional blood flow according to the local needs, is essential. Disruption of the blood flow by wounding or by obstruction of the blood vessel causes ischemia and severe damage to the distal tissues and may cause death of the organism. During evolution a complex system has developed to guarantee blood fluidity, to limit blood loss after wounding, and to adapt this control system after exposure to infectious microorganisms. The functioning of this system represents hemostasis, a group of balanced activities that keeps the blood running.

In the early 1960s, I was working as a traditional chemical engineer studying inanimate objects without the slightest clue of the biological world. At that time, I met Dr Melvin H. Knisely and he encouraged me to use my engineering skills to improve on the Krogh capillary tissue cylinder. I derived a detailed mathematical model and performed a complex computer simulation to achieve that goal. We attended professional meetings on oxygen transport to tissue all over the world, but mainly in Europe, presenting case studies. It became my goal to honour Dr Knisely with a meeting on oxygen transport to tissue at Clemson University in South Carolina, USA. Melvin's wife, Verona, convinced me to also have the meeting at the Medical University of South Carolina located in Charleston, since it was meant to honour Dr Knisely's work with his quartz rod crystal for illumination. He is credited as the first human being to observe the particulate matter in blood flowing in the microcirculation. He was nominated for the Nobel prize four times as a result of his discoveries. When I decided to have part of the meeting at the medical school, I invited Dr Haim Bicher to work with me from there and I focused on Clemson University and the combined meeting structure. As the meeting evolved, we decided it would be a good idea to establish an international society and call it the "International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue" (ISOTT). I wrote a paper on the pillars of our young society, "ISOTT from the Beginning: A Tribute to Our Deceased Members (Icons)," and another that shares more detail about its beginnings, "The Founding of ISOTT: The Shamattawa of Engineering Science and Medical Science". The roots of ISOTT are all the members, new and old, who continue to make valuable contributions to an exceedingly important component of human health. I hope that the society lasts for a long time, continuing to make important contributions to the medical world. It is a society that has been instrumental in bringing together brilliant scientists from the medical, engineering, and natural science fields to work together. It has contributed to the evolution of "bioengineering" as we know it today.

Extraembryonic membranes provide protection, oxygen, water, and nutrients to developing embryos, and their study generates information on the origin of the terrestrial egg and the evolution of viviparity. In this research, the morphology of the extraembryonic membranes and the types of placentation in the viviparous snake Conopsis lineata are described through optical microscopy during early and late gestation. When embryos develop inside the uterus, they become surrounded by a thin eggshell membrane. In early gestation, during stages 16 and 18, the embryo is already surrounded by the amnion and the chorion, and in a small region by the chorioallantois, which is product of the contact between the chorion and the growing allantois. A trilaminar omphalopleure covers the yolk sac from the embryonic hemisphere to the level of the equator where the sinus terminalis is located, and from there a bilaminar omphalopleure extends into the abembryonic hemisphere. Thus, according to the relationship of these membranes with the uterine wall, the chorioplacenta, the choriovitelline placenta, and the chorioallantoic placenta are structured at the embryonic pole, while the omphaloplacenta is formed at the abembryonic pole. During late gestation (stages 35, 36, and 37), the uterus and allantois are highly vascularized. The allantois occupies most of the extraembryonic coelom and at the abembryonic pole, it contacts the omphaloplacenta and form the omphalallantoic placenta. This is the first description of all known placenta types in Squamata for a snake species member of the subfamily Colubrinae; where an eggshell membrane with 2.9 μm in width present throughout development is also evident. The structure of extraembryonic membranes in C. lineata is similar to that of other oviparous and viviparous squamate species. The above indicates not only homology, but also that the functional characteristics have been maintained throughout the evolution of the reproductive type.

The gas–liquid–solid interface plays a crucial role in various electrochemical energy conversion devices, including fuel cells and electrolyzers. Understanding the effect of gas transfer on the electrochemistry at this three-phase interface is a grand challenge. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is an emerging technique for mapping the heterogeneity in electrochemical activity; it also inherently features a three-phase boundary at the nanodroplet cell. Herein, we quantitatively analyze the role of the three-phase boundary in SECCM involving gas via finite element simulation. Oxygen reduction reaction is used as an example for reaction with a gas reactant, which shows that interfacial gas transfer can enhance the overall mass transport of reactant, allowing measuring current density of several A/cm2. The hydrogen evolution reaction is used as an example for reaction with a gas product, and fast interfacial gas transfer kinetics can significantly reduce the concentration of dissolved gas near the electrode. This helps to measure electrode kinetics at a high current density without the complication of gas bubble formation. The contribution of interfacial gas transfer can be understood by directly comparing its kinetics to the mass transfer coefficient from the solution. Our findings aid the quantitative application of SECCM in studying electrochemical reactions involving gases, establishing a basis for investigating electrochemistry at the three-phase boundary.

Abstract. Developing reliable methods for quantifying past temperature changes is essential for understanding Earth's climate evolution and predicting future climatic shifts. The degree of methylation of branched tetraethers (MBT’5ME), of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), a group of bacterial membrane lipids, has become a widely accepted tool for lacustrine paleothermometry. To allow this, an empirical calibration was developed, based on MBT’5ME values of surface sediments across large spatial scales. As these sediments integrate variability across several years to decades, the sensitivity of MBT’5ME to seasonal and short-term environmental changes in the water column remains underexplored. Here, we present a record of brGDGTs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from a monomictic, eutrophic temperate lake (Rotsee, Switzerland) over a 10-month period, examining both core lipids and intact polar lipids. Rotsee offers an ideal setting for this study due to its strong seasonal variations in temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen caused by summer warming and associated stratification. In the oxic epilimnion, a minor increase in MBT'5ME during stratified summer months was caused by a rise in brGDGT Ia concentration. A similar increase in concentration of 6-methyl brGDGTs indicates a sensitivity to water temperature. In the seasonally anoxic hypolimnion, MBT'5ME correlated with water pH rather than temperature, suggesting that water chemistry influences this ratio, complicating its use as a temperature proxy. The production of intact polar lipid (IPL) tetraethers was observed exclusively in the anoxic hypolimnion during stratification, confirming anoxia as a key trigger for IPL tetraether production. Surface sediment samples along a depth gradient have a distinct depth-dependent distribution. Sediments below the oxic water column showed lower MBT'5ME values, likely due to the sedimentary production of brGDGTs IIa and IIIa. Sediments from seasonally anoxic areas reflected average epilimnion SPM values, suggesting the deposition of epilimnion brGDGTs into the sediments. This study of brGDGTs in Rotsee SPM and sediments thus indicates that temperature, pH and oxygen concentration impact GDGT distribution, with significant implications for using MBT'5ME as a temperature proxy in sediments from stratified lakes.

ABSTRACT The microbial communities associated with sponges contribute to the adaptation of hosts to environments, which are essential for the trophic transformation of benthic-marine coupling. However, little is known about the symbiotic microbial community interactions and adaptative strategies of high- and low-microbial abundance (HMA and LMA) sponges, which represent two typical ecological phenotypes. Here, we compared the 1-year dynamic patterns of microbiomes with the HMA sponge Spongia officinalis and two LMA sponge species Tedania sp. and Haliclona simulans widespread on the coast of China. Symbiotic bacterial communities with the characteristic HMA–LMA dichotomy presented higher diversity and stability in S. officinalis than in Tedania sp. and H. simulans , while archaeal communities showed consistent diversity across all sponges throughout the year. Dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, dissolved organic phosphorus, and especially temperature were the major factors affecting the seasonal changes in sponge microbial communities. S. officinalis -associated microbiome had higher diversity, stronger stability, and closer interaction, which adopted a relatively isolated strategy to cope with environmental changes, while Tedania sp. and H. simulans were more susceptible and shared more bacterial Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) with surrounding waters, with an open way facing the uncertainty of the environment. Meta-analysis of the microbiome in composition, diversity, and ecological function from 13 marine sponges further supported that bacterial communities associated with HMA and LMA sponges have evolved two distinct environmental adaptation strategies. We propose that the different adaptive ways of sponges responding to the environment may be responsible for their successful evolution and their competence in global ocean change. IMPORTANCE During long-term evolution, sponge holobionts, among the oldest symbiotic relationships between microbes and metazoans, developed two distinct phenotypes with high- and low-microbial abundance (HMA and LMA). Despite sporadic studies indicating that the characteristic microbial assemblages present in HMA and LMA sponges, the adaptation strategies of symbionts responding to environments are still unclear. This deficiency limits our understanding of the selection of symbionts and the ecological functions during the evolutionary history and the adaptative assessment of HMA and LMA sponges in variable environments. Here, we explored symbiotic communities with two distinct phenotypes in a 1-year dynamic environment and combined with the meta-analysis of 13 sponges. The different strategies of symbionts in adapting to the environment were basically drawn: microbes with LMA were more acclimated to environmental changes, forming relatively loose-connected communities, while HMA developed relatively tight-connected and more similar communities beyond the divergence of species and geographical location.

Abstract Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a tool for mapping tissue susceptibility. Using QSM for functional brain mapping, it is possible to directly quantify blood‐oxygen‐level‐dependent (BOLD) susceptibility changes. This study presents a submillimeter functional QSM (fQSM) approach compared to BOLD fMRI from data acquired with 3D gradient‐echo echo planar imaging (EPI) at ultra‐high field. Complex EPI data were acquired in nine healthy subjects with varying temporal and spatial resolutions and used for BOLD fMRI and for fQSM. Right‐hand finger tapping experiments were performed as well as one measurement with intentional subject movement. Susceptibility maps were computed using 3D path‐based unwrapping, the variable‐kernel sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data, and the streaking artifact reduction for QSM algorithm. Functional data analysis included general linear modeling and computation of z ‐scores. Submillimeter data were denoised using NOise reduction with DIstribution Corrected (NORDIC), which improved z ‐scores in the motor cortex for fQSM and fMRI. An expected increase in BOLD fMRI signal and corresponding decrease in magnetic susceptibility was observed in sensorimotor areas during active periods. For all experiments, fQSM showed smaller activation regions compared with fMRI. The percentage of high negative t ‐values localized in the cortex was higher for fQSM (52%) than for positive or negative t ‐values for fMRI (45%). For the scans with intentional motion, movement exceeded the size of a voxel, but paradigm dependent signal evolution could be recovered using motion correction. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of submillimeter whole‐brain fQSM with voxel volume of 0.53 μL. In comparison to traditional BOLD fMRI, fQSM provided improved localization of brain activation within the cortex, especially in submillimeter 3D EPI sequences.

Abstract. Within the oligotrophic subtropical oceans, summertime DIC drawdown despite nutrient limitation in surface waters and subsurface oxygen consumption in the absence of Redfieldian stoichiometric nitrate release are two phenomena still awaiting a full mechanistic characterization. The distribution, intensity and seasonality of these phenomena are identified with preformed nitrate as a tracer, where negative preformed nitrate (NPN) anomalies below the euphotic zone correspond to oxygen consumption without Redfieldian NO3- release, and positive performed nitrate (PPN) anomalies found within the upper 100 m occur where O2 is produced without stoichiometric NO3- drawdown.  Many processes that may contribute to these anomalies including N2 fixation, non-Redfieldian DOM cycling, vertically migrating phytoplankton, heterotrophic NO3- uptake and vertical NO3- injection events have been measured or modelled, yet generally cannot fully account for the magnitudes of preformed nitrate anomalies and excess DIC drawdown observed in many oligotrophic subtropical waters. One other candidate process that may contribute to both phenomena is the formation of carbon-rich transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie-stainable particles (CSP) from dissolved organic precursors in surface waters and their subsequent remineralization below the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). However, few data exist to quantify exopolymer production and vertical distributions in oligotrophic oceans over an annual cycle, which is necessary to understand their potential role in the evolution of seasonal preformed nitrate anomalies and DIC drawdown. To investigate the significance of exopolymer formation and export to North Pacific subtropical gyre biogeochemistry, we undertook a multi-year time-series (Jan 2020 – Sep 2022) analysis of TEP, CSP and total dissolved polysaccharides concentrations at Station ALOHA (22° 45’,158° W), and along a transect from 22° 45’ to 31° N to measure latitudinal variability in June 2021.  Exopolymer C:N stoichiometry at Station ALOHA varied between 16.4 – 34.3, with values being more carbon-rich in summer; ratios were higher (32–38) toward the gyre centre at 31° N. TEP concentrations were consistently elevated in surface waters through Spring–Autumn (4–8 µM C after carbon conversion) at Station ALOHA with lower concentrations (~1.5–3 µM C)  and more uniform vertical distribution during winter, indicating that TEP accumulated in surface waters may vertically sink and be exported with winter mixing. The accumulation of TEP in surface waters through Spring–Autumn and its subsequent export may account for 6.5–20 % of net community production (NCP), helping reduce the estimated imbalance of N supply and N demand at this site to <10 %. The upper ocean TEP cycle may explain 22–67 % of the observed PPN/NPN anomalies, helping to close the C, N, and O2 budgets at station ALOHA, while leaving room for significant contributions from other processes such as vertically migrating phytoplankton and heterotrophic nitrate uptake to be further validated. These results suggest that exopolymer production and cycling may be more important to open ocean carbon biogeochemistry than previously expected, with considerable seasonality and spatial variability influenced by physical processes and phytoplankton activity.

To the Editors: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children. The most frequent clinical manifestations include pharyngotonsillitis, acute bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia, which is usually mild and self-limited while it can be severe and complicated in patients with immunodeficiency and chronic cardiorespiratory diseases. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection accounts for 10%–40% of community-acquired pneumonia in children between 9 and 14 years old, and it is less frequent before 5 years of age.1,2 Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can also be responsible for rare extrapulmonary manifestations.3,4 Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin) are the recommended first-line treatment for moderate to severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in school-aged children.5,6 However, the efficacy and clinical benefit of antibiotic therapy for this kind of infection is controversial. In this article, we report the cases of 2 children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection detected through polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab who were admitted to our emergency department for persistent fever and had radiologic evidence of parenchymal hypoventilation and severe mediastinal lymphadenitis suspicious of active pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, we performed a review literature to better investigate the association between Mycoplasma pneumoniae and mediastinal lymphadenitis. CASE 1 A 12-year-old girl with no significant medical history was admitted to our emergency department for fever for 4 days and chest pain. She came back from Romania the month before the appearance of clinical manifestations, where she met her grandfather who was receiving antitubercular treatment. The patient had just completed a 3-day treatment with clarithromycin prescribed by her pediatrician without clinical benefit. She had not experienced increased work of breathing and her vital parameters were the following: temperature 37.7°C, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturation were normal. The physical examination showed bilateral basal hypophonesis in the respiratory auscultation, with abolished vesicular murmur, no wheezing. Blood laboratory tests revealed a C-reactive protein of 173.5 mg/L [normal values (n.v.) 0.00–5.00 mg/L], white blood cells 15.400/mmc (n.v 4.5–13.000/mmc), neutrophils 11.110/mmc (n.v. 1.5–6.000/mmc), normal hepato-renal function. Chest radiograph (Fig. 1A) was required and it showed left pleural effusion associated with basal consensual parenchymal hypoventilation and a bit enlarged cardiac shape.FIGURE 1.: Radiologic findings in 2 patients. A: Chest radiograph showing left pleural effusion associated with basal consensual parenchymal hypoventilation; (B) chest CT scan revealing a ribbon-like area of parenchymal consolidation with air bronchogram. This formation is surrounded by several areas of slightly increased density of the pulmonary parenchyma, with ground-glass appearance, with multiple centrilobular micronodules some of which had a tree-in-bud aspect. In the right superior lobe, some calcified nodular formations are described, associated with calcified lymph nodes, compatible with the primary complex. Furthermore, there are several mediastinal lymphadenopathies. C: Chest radiograph showing a right hilar round-shaped parenchymal hypoventilation, surrounded by another medio-basal hypoventilation; (D) Chest CT scan revealing several bilateral areas of parenchymal consolidation, with irregular margins and a confluent appearance, and partially obstructed bronchi; several mediastinal lymphadenopathies, some of which characterized by internal necrosis. CT indicates computed tomography.The patient was started on amoxicillin and clavulanic acid endovenous treatment and was admitted to the pediatric ward. We performed a bedside lung ultrasound showing bilateral pleural effusion and several atelectasis, so the antibiotic treatment was shifted to ceftriaxone. Since we did not observe clinical benefit, we added vancomycin to the treatment. In addition, due to the provenience from a high-tuberculosis (TB) burden country, we performed Mantoux intradermal skin test which resulted positive. Quantiferon test and microbiologic diagnostic tests to find Mycobacterium tuberculosis on 3 samples of sputum were negative. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 1B) was required to better characterize the images revealed with lung ultrasound and it showed a ribbon-like area of parenchymal consolidation with air bronchogram. This formation was surrounded by several areas of slightly increased density of the pulmonary parenchyma, with ground-glass appearance, with multiple centrilobular micronodules some of which had a tree-in-bud aspect. In the right superior lobe, some calcified nodular formations were described, associated with calcified lymph nodes, compatible with the primary complex. Interestingly, the CT scan showed several reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathies. In suspicion of active pulmonary tuberculosis, specific first-line antitubercular treatment was started. Because of the persistence of fever 15 days after the admission and the negativity of microbiologic analysis made on sputum, a fibrobronchoscopy was performed to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and to do a needle aspiration of the subcarinal lymphadenopathies. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was found both on nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The patient underwent a new chest CT scan 3 weeks later showing a significant reduction of the areas of parenchymal consolidation, whereas the mediastinal lymphadenitis was not resolved at all. In consideration of negativity of microbiologic examinations, during a follow-up evaluation, the antitubercular treatment was interrupted. Long-term follow-up confirmed full recovery and no new diagnosis of TB. CASE 2 A 9-year-old boy with no significant medical history was referred to our emergency department for fever and productive cough for 10 days. He was originally from India and his father was diagnosed with TB 1 year earlier. He had completed a 7-day course of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid on the recommendation of his pediatrician and he was afebrile only 1 day at the end of the antibiotic therapy. On clinical evaluation, his vital parameters were the following: temperature 39.4°C, heart rate 80 bpm, peripheral oxygen saturation 98%–99%, normal respiratory rate. Physical examination revealed right basal hypophonesis, with diffuse wheezing. Laboratory tests found an increased value of C-reactive protein (39.5 mg/L, n.v. 0.00–5.00 mg/L), normal white blood cell count (7.890/mmc, n.v 4.5–13.000/mmc) and neutrophils (6.050/mmc, n.v. 1.5–6.000/mmc), normal hepatorenal function. Chest radiograph (Fig. 1C) showed a right hilar round-shaped parenchymal hypoventilation, surrounded by another medio-basal hypoventilation compatible with a tubercular excavation. He was admitted to the pediatric ward and isolated according to the suspicion of active pulmonary tuberculosis. We performed Quantiferon test and microscopic, molecular and cultural diagnostic tests on 3 samples of sputum to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis but all of them resulted negative. Bedside lung ultrasound showed 3 consolidated areas of parenchyma with air-arborized bronchograms and left basal pleural effusion. Chest CT scan (Fig. 1D) performed to better characterize the formations described by radiograph and ultrasound revealed several bilateral areas of parenchymal consolidation, with irregular margins and a confluent appearance, and partially obstructed bronchi. Furthermore, the images showed areas with ground-glass appearance and several centrilobular micronodules, some of which had a tree-in-bud aspect. Also, in this case, there were several mediastinal lymphadenopathies, some of which were characterized by internal necrosis. Because of the high suspicion of tuberculosis, we prescribed first-line antitubercular treatment, interrupted 6 days later for intolerance. To obtain a definitive diagnosis, we required microbiologic analysis also on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which excluded a mycobacterium tuberculosis infection so we interrupted antitubercular treatment. The main microbiologic finding was a nasopharyngeal swab positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Since the general clinical conditions of the patient were improving and the fever disappeared 6 days after the admission, we did not prescribe a specific macrolide treatment and we repeated 1 month after the beginning of the clinical manifestations in outpatient setting a lung ultrasound which was normal. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children can cause different and noncharacteristic clinical, laboratory and radiologic manifestations.7 It is often responsible for self-limited community-acquired pneumonia, but sometimes it is the pathogen of severe low respiratory tract inflammation causing atelectasis and massive lung infiltration. In this article, we reported the cases of 2 children who came to our attention for persistent fever and with evidence of basal ipophonesis on respiratory auscultation. In both cases, CT scan showed parenchymal hypoventilation, areas with ground-glass appearance and centrilobular micronodules, some of which with a tree-in-bud aspect, compatible with the suspicion of tuberculosis. Interestingly both had severe mediastinal lymph node swelling. In a retrospective audit, we acknowledge the excessive diagnostic procedures (including invasive ones like CT and bronchoalveolar lavage), due to lack of awareness of this possible Mycoplasma pneumoniae localization and the social risk factors for TB. Pediatric mediastinal lymphadenitis has been rarely reported in literature as a possible radiographic pattern of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Lee et al8 analyzed the CT features of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in 11 pediatric patients and they described hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathies in 9 of them. In a Chinese prospective study published in 2016,4 the authors made an analysis of the diagnostic value of CT scan images in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia during the pediatric age. Among the 1280 children included in the study, 128 (corresponding to 10%) had hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenitis. Hsieh et al9 described clinical and radiographic features in 39 children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and they found lymphadenopathy in 5 children, corresponding to 13% of the population. The authors also looked for a relationship between lymphadenopathy, duration of hospitalization, C reactive protein level and patient age but they found no significative values. As van der Pijl et al10 suggested, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be suspected also in adults with radiologic evidence of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. These cases highlight the importance of considering Mycoplasma pneumoniae as a possible exclusive cause of mediastinal lymphadenitis, particularly if no other active tuberculosis clues like weight loss or positive interferon gamma release assays are associated. These reports are particularly important nowadays considering the huge increase in postpandemic Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections that is being recorded worldwide.11 As we learned from our experience, in these cases, close follow-up may be more reasonable rather than performing invasive diagnostic procedures. Our literature review showed that many authors focused only on the diagnostic phase, however it should be interesting to examine the clinical and radiologic evolution of these patterns as in our case the patients healed without a specific treatment in few weeks, therefore adding to the available knowledge about possible outcomes of Mycoplasma pneumoniae–associated mediastinal lymphadenitis.
