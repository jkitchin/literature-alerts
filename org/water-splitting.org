Efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with fast kinetics, high efficiency, and stability are essential for scalable green production of hydrogen. The rational design and fabrication of catalysts play a decisive role in their catalytic behavior. This work presents a high-entropy catalyst, FeCoNiCuMo-O, synthesized via carbothermal shock. Synergistic optimization of the adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) was realized and demonstrated through the combination of in situ spectra/mass spectrometry and chemical probe analysis in FeCoNiCuMo-O. Furthermore, the robust stability is reinforced by the inherent properties conferred by the high-entropy design. The catalyst exhibits outstanding performance metrics, featuring an exceptionally low Tafel slope of 41 mV dec–1, a low overpotential of 272 mV at 10 mA cm–2, and a commendable endurance (a mere 2.2% voltage decline after a 240-h continuous chronopotentiometry test at 10 mA cm–2). This study advances the development of efficient, durable OER electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

Ir-based catalysts are the best in terms of activity and stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in proton exchange water electrolysis. Due to their cost, efforts have been made to decrease their load without a loss of activity. In this paper, Ir nanoparticles measuring 2–3 nm were loaded on TiO2 anatase supports of submicrometric size in different amounts using the microwave polyol method to optimize their mass activity. Using anatase particles with a diameter of about 100 nm and titania nanotubes (TNTs), Ir/TiO2 catalysts with Ir contents of 5, 10, 20, and 40 wt.% were synthesized and characterized via structural and electrochemical techniques. It was shown that the amount of Ir must be regulated to obtain continuous coverage on titania with strong Ir–TiO2 interactions which, for the 100 nm diameter anatase, is limited to about 20 wt.%. A higher percentage of Ir over 40 wt.% can be dispersed over the TNTs. Exceeding one layer of coverage leads to a decrease in the catalyst’s utilization. Ir/TiO2(10:90), Ir/TiO2(20:80), and Ir/TiO2(40:60) presented the highest pseudocapacitive currents per unit of Ir mass. The electrochemical active areas and mass activities for these later catalysts were also the highest compared to Ir/TiO2(05:95), Ir/TNT(40:60), and the unsupported catalysts and increased from 40 to 10 wt.% Ir. They also presented the lowest overpotentials of about 300 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER, with Ir/TiO2(10:90) presenting the best specific activities and surface turnover frequencies, thus showing that the size of the support can be regulated to decrease the Ir content of the catalyst without a loss of activity.

Transition-metal layered double hydroxides are widely utilized as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), undergoing dynamic transformation into active oxyhydroxides during electrochemical operation. Nonetheless, our understanding of the non-equilibrium structural changes that occur during this process remains limited. In this study, utilizing in situ energy-dispersive X-ray absorption spectroscopy and machine learning analysis, we reveal the occurrence of deprotonation and elucidate the role of incorporated iron in facilitating the transition from nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) into its active oxyhydroxide. Our findings demonstrate that iron substitution promotes deprotonation process within NiFe LDH, resulting in the preferential removal of protons from the specific bridged hydroxyl group (Ni2+-OH-Fe3+) linked to edge-sharing [NiO6] and [FeO6] octahedron. This deprotonation behavior drives the formation of high-valence Ni3+δ species (0 <δ < 1), which subsequently serve as the active sites, thereby ensuring efficient oxygen evolution activity. This approach offers high-resolution insights of dynamic structural evolution, overcoming the limitations of extended acquisition times and advancing our understanding of OER mechanisms.

Designing and constructing hierarchically structured materials with heterogeneous compositions is the key to developing an effective catalyst for overall water-splitting applications. Herein, we report the fabrication of hollow-structured selenium-doped nickel–cobalt hybrids on carbon paper as a self-supported electrode (denoted as Se–Ni|Co/CP, where Ni|Co hybrids consist of nickel–cobalt alloy-incorporated nickel–cobalt oxide). The procedure involves direct growth of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) on bimetal-based nickel–cobalt hydroxide (NiCoOH) electrodeposited on CP, followed by selenous etching and pyrolysis to obtain the final Se–Ni|Co/CP electrocatalytic system. The optimized Se–Ni|Co/CP [Se–Ni1|Co9/CP(0.3)] exhibits remarkable performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), displaying a current density of 10 mA cm–2 at small overpotentials of 105 mV for HER and 235 mV for OER. Furthermore, it allows an alkali electrolyzer to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm–2 at a cell voltage of only 1.51 V. The outstanding catalytic activity of Se–Ni|Co/CP is ascribed to the high intrinsic activity of the bimetallic catalyst, efficient interfaces, and charge transport facilitated by the heterogeneous component, the hollow structure inherited from the metal–organic frameworks (MOF)-derived material providing ample porosity and active sites, and structural robustness achieved through self-supported construction.

Electrocatalytically converting nitrates in sewage to ammonia, which can not only achieve the purpose of eliminating sewage but also obtaining valuable ammonia, is an effective supplement to the traditional Haber–Bosch process. Although significant progress has been made in cathodic catalyst design, the overall ammonia electrolysis from nitrate reduction is still restricted by the anodic oxygen evolution heavily relying on noble-based catalysts. Herein, a bimetallic NiFe-MOF nanosheet array electrode is fabricated and serves as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for nitrate reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. The introduction of Fe to Ni-MOF facilitates the formation of a nanosheet structure with higher electrochemical active surface area, as well as provides synergetic NiFe sites. The NiFe-MOF electrode reaches a greatly enhanced ammonia yield rate of 0.94 mmol cm–2 h–1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 90.8% at the cathode and −0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, as well as an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction with a declined overpotential of 424 mV at 50 mA cm–2. As a bifunctional catalyst in the overall electrocatalysis, the performance of NiFe-MOF in the nitrate reduction reaction is comparable with that using Pt mesh as a counter electrode.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO 2 /N 2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal‐air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen–oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

Iridium-based electrocatalysts are the most promising candidates for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Considering their high cost and scarcity, it is imperative to maximize atom utilization and enhance the intrinsic activity of iridium. In this work, IrOx sub-2 nm clusters are stabilized on TiO2 supports via metal support interaction (MSI) induced by vacancy defects in TiO2. The strength of MSI is readily tuned by the type of vacancies: oxygen vacancies in TiO2 (VO-TiO2) induce the adsorbed MSI with relatively weak strength, while titanium vacancies in TiO2 (VTi-TiO2) lead to the strong embedded MSI. The tunable MSI further modulates the electronic structure of IrOx sub-2 nm clusters. IrOx/VO-TiO2 with adsorbed MSI exhibits an optimized electronic structure with a downshifted d-band center of IrOx, resulting in a reduced binding energy with oxygen and a low energy barrier of the rate-determining step for OER. Consequently, IrOx/VO-TiO2 delivers an activity twice that of commercial IrO2 and a good stability for 120 h in a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Our study provides a guideline for the rational design of acidic OER catalysts based on modulating the electronic structure of IrOx sub-2 nm clusters via tunable MSI.

The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is severely limited by the poor stability, low activity, and high cost of available catalysts. Enhancing intrinsic activity while maintaining stability and reducing reliance on precious metals is crucial. The typical adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) leads to high overpotentials and low activity, making the transition to alternative mechanisms, such as the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) or oxide path mechanism (OPM), highly desirable due to their lower overpotentials. Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with experimental validation to enhance the activity and stability of β-MnO2 via co-substitution with ruthenium (Ru) and iridium (Ir), enabling the transition from AEM to OPM. DFT calculations reveal that AEM is hindered by the weak nucleophilicity of water, while LOM suffers from high kinetic barriers due to structural distortions. In contrast, OPM demonstrates a significantly lower kinetic barrier, facilitated by the synergistic interaction between Ru and Ir. Experimentally, IrRuMnOx was synthesized through co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, showing an 80-fold improvement in mass activity and a 96-fold increase in stability compared to commercial IrO2, with minimal noble metal leaching, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). IrRuMnOx exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 475 mV at 1 A·cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 44.26 mV·dec–1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, maintaining stable performance for over 100 h. Moreover, the IrRuMnOx-based membrane electrode, with a low Ir loading of 0.075 mgIr·cm–2, achieved remarkable current densities of 1.0 A·cm–2 at 1.66 V and 2.0 A·cm–2 at 1.91 V at 80 °C. This performance surpasses that of both unsupported and conventional supported Ir-based catalysts at comparable Ir loading levels. This study offers critical insights into OER mechanisms in acidic media and paves the way for developing efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.

Abstract Engineering nanomaterials at single‐atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO 2 ‐based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi‐RuO 2 single‐atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) RuBi single‐atom alloy. This Bi‐RuO 2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192 mV and superb stability over 650 h at 10 mA cm −2 , enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm −2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate‐evolving mechanism on Bi‐RuO 2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi 1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high‐performance electrocatalysts at atomic‐level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

Abstract Wide spread adaptation of green hydrogen can help to mitigate the serious climate issues, increasing global energy demands and the development of advanced electrocatalysts robust under industrial conditions is one of the key technological challenges. Herein, chromium‐doped nickel‐boride‐phosphide (Cr/NiBP) micro sphere (MS) electrocatalyst is demonstrated via a two‐step hydrothermal approach along with post‐annealing. The Cr/NiBP MS demonstrates low hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evaluation reaction over potentials of 78 and 250 mV at 100 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH, out performing most of the reported catalysts. The Cr/NiBP ǁ Cr/NiBP exhibits only 1.54 V at 100 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH and surpasses the benchmark of RuO 2 (+) ǁ Pt/C (−) up to 2000 mA cm −2 , which sets it as one of the best bifunctional electrocatalysts. Impressively, it maintains stable performance for over 240 h at 1000 mA cm −2 in 6 m KOH at 60°C, demonstrating rapid response, anti‐corrosion resistance, and robust structural integrity to meet the industrial operational conditions. Further, Cr/NiBP ǁ Pt/C exhibits a super‐low cell‐voltage of 2.25 V at 2000 mA cm −2 . The small amount of Cr atoms incorporation can significantly enhance active sites and intrinsic properties, accelerating water dissociation and rapid intermediate formation.

Abstract Integration of different active sites by heterostructure engineering is pivotal to optimize the intrinsic activities of an oxygen electrocatalyst and much needed to enhance the performance of rechargeable Zn–air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a biphasic nanoarchitecture encased in in situ grown N‐doped graphitic carbon (MnO/Co‐NGC) with heterointerfacial sites are constructed. The density functional theory model reveals formation of lattice oxygen bridged heterostructure with pyridinic nitrogen atoms anchored Co species, which facilitate adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Consequently, the well‐designed catalyst with accessible active sites, abundant oxygen vacant sites, and heterointerfacial coupling effects, simultaneously accelerate the electron/mass transfer and thus promotes the trifunctional electrocatalysis. The assembled aqueous ZAB delivers maximum power density of ≈268 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 797.8 mAh g zn −1 along with excellent rechargeability and extremely small voltage gap decay rate of 0.0007 V h −1 . Further, the fabricated quasisolid‐state ZAB owns a remarkable power density of 163 mW cm −2 and long cycle life, outperforming the benchmark air‐electrode and many recent reports, underlining its robustness and suitability for practical utilization in diverse portable applications.

Various sustainable energy conversion techniques like water electrolyzers, fuel cells, and metal-air battery devices are promising to alleviate the issues in fossil fuel consumption. However, their broad employment has been mainly inhibited by the lack of advanced electrocatalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the three involved half-reactions including oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent advances have witnessed the cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n])-directed strategy as a prominent tool to develop high performance electrocatalysts with either OER, ORR, or HER activities. In this review, the recent progress on CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts ranging from molecular complexes to heterogeneous nanostructures and single-atoms for the three half-reactions are reviewed, and future opportunities are discussed. A concise introduction to the fundamentals of CB[n]s regarding their synthesis, structure, and chemistry is given first. Subsequently, the systematic summary of CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts and their performance for the OER/ORR/HER are discussed in detail, with a specific emphasis on correlating their structure and activities by combining diverse physiochemical characterizations, electrochemical experiments, and theory simulations. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspective for future opportunities regarding CB[n]-derived electrocatalysts for many other electrocatalytic applications are proposed.

Abstract Designing cost‐effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge in green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two OWS half‐cell reactions. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesiz hierarchical heterostructure MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH and MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low IR‐corrected overpotentials of 156 and 61 mV with at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 under light assistance. The MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH‐MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐LDH OWS cell achieves a low cell voltage of 1.46V at 10 mA cm −2 during light‐assisted water electrolysis. Both materials exhibited exceptional stability under industrially relevant HER and OER conditions, maintaining a current density of 1 A cm −2 with minimal alterations in their potential and performance. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping the LDH matrix with high‐valence Mo atoms and MoS 2 quantum dots improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the electrocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the thermodynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, this work develops a facile synthesis method to design highly active and stable MoS 2 @NiFeCo‐Mo(doped)‐LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.

An ideal water-splitting electrocatalyst is inexpensive, abundant, highly active, stable, selective, and durable. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the main bottleneck for H2 production with a complex and not fully resolved mechanism, slow kinetics, and high overpotential. Nickel oxide-based catalysts (NiOx) are highly active and cheaper than precious metal catalysts. However, rigorous catalyst tests and DFT calculations are still needed to rationally optimize NiOx catalysts. In this work, we combine plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) and density functional theory (DFT) to address the role of dopants in promoting NiOx OER activity. Ultrathin films of NiOx doped with Zn2+, Al3+, and Sn4+ presented improved intrinsic activity, stability, and durability for the OER. The results show a low to high catalytic performance of ZnNiOx < NiOx < AlNiOx < SnNiOx, which we attribute to an increase in the concentration of valence band (VB) holes combined with conduction band (CB) electron conductivity, characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of doping on the electronic structure and catalytic activity was investigated using advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (PEB0/pob-TZVP). DFT complements the experimental results, showing that the dopant charge states and orbital hybridization enhance the OER by improving the charge carrier concentration and mobility, thus allowing optimal binding energies and charge dynamics and delocalization. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PE-ALD-doped nanofilms NiOx and DFT to rationally design and develop catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

Constructing a built-in electric field (BIEF) within heterostructures has emerged as a compelling strategy for advancing electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Herein, the p-n type nanosheet array heterojunction Ni2P-NCDs-Co(OH)2-NF are successfully prepared. The variation in interaction affinity between nitrogen within N-doped carbon dots (NCDs) and Ni/Co induces charge redistribution between Co and Ni in the Ni2P-NCDs-Co(OH)2-NF-3 heterostructure, thereby enhancing the intensity of the BIEF, facilitating electron transfer, and markedly improving OER activity. The optimized electrocatalyst, Ni2P-NCDs-Co(OH)2-NF-3, demonstrates a remarkably low overpotential of 389 mV at 500 mA cm-2, alongsides a small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec-1, expansive electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), low impedance, outstanding stability exceeding 425 h at 500 mA cm-2, and a Faradaic efficiency of up to 96%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations elucidate the OER mechanism, revealing that the enhanced BIEF optimizes the adsorption energy of Co3+ to OH- and weakened the desorption energy of oxygen during the reaction. The work ponieeringly employed the NCDs as a regulator of the BIEF, effectively tuning field intensity and achieving superior electrocatalytic OER performance under large current density, thus charting new pathways for the development of high-efficiency oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.

Heterogenous single-atom catalysts (SACs) are reminiscent of homogeneous catalysts because of the similarity of structural motif of active sites, showing the potential of using the advantage of homogeneous catalysts to tackle challenges in hetereogenous catalysis. In heterogeneous oxygen electrocatalysis, the homogeneity of adsorption patterns of reaction intermediates leads to scaling relationships that limit their activities. In contrast, homogeneous catalysts can circumvent such limits by selectively altering the adsorption of intermediates through secondary coordination effects (SCEs). This inspired us to explore potential SCEs in metal–nitrogen-carbon (M–N-C), a promising type of oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. We introduced SCEs with a neighboring metal site that can modulate the adsorption strengths of oxygen-containing intermediates. First-principles calculations show that the second site in the heteronuclear duo four-nitrogen-coordinated metal center can induce SCEs that selectively stabilize the OOH intermediate but with minor effects on the OH intermediate and, thereby, disrupt the scaling relation between oxygen species and eventually increase the catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reactions. Additionally, the activity of oxygen reduction reaction of selected M–N-C is also enhanced by such SCE. Our computational work underscored the critical role SCEs can have in shaping activities of SACs, particularly in favorably altering scaling relationships, and demonstrated its potential to address catalytic challenges in heterogeneous catalysis.

Exploring a general method for constructing uniform heterostructures with sub-5 nm crystallites and dense interfaces is crucial yet challenging for advancing water electrocatalysis. Herein, a bottom-up cocrystallization strategy, involving in situ transformation of amorphous Ni–P through gas–solid reactions, is proposed to synthesize a series of nickel-based heterojunctions on carbon cloth (CC). Thereinto, interface-wealthy NiS2-Ni2P/CC with densely packed 3–4 nm crystallites demonstrates superb catalytic performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The electrolyzer merely requires cell voltages of 1.79 and 1.89 V to propel overall water splitting currents of 200 and 400 mA cm–2, respectively, outperforming the vast majority of reported nickel-based heterojunctions. Theoretical calculations reveal that charge redistribution and electronic structure modulation optimize the hydrogen and oxygen evolution pathways at the NiS2 and Ni2P sides of the interfaces, respectively. Moreover, uniform hybridization with densely distributed heterointerfaces offers abundant active sites for electrocatalysis, pioneering an extendable approach for constructing advanced heterojunction catalysts for green hydrogen production.

Abstract Ni‐rich cathodes are more promising candidates to the increasing demand for high capacity and the ability to operate at high voltages. However, the high Ni content creates a trade‐off between energy density and cycling stability, mainly caused by the chemo‐mechanical degradation. Oxygen evolution, cation mixing, rock salt formation, phase transition, and crack formation contribute to the degradation process. To overcome this problem, strategies such as doping, surface coating, and core‐shell structures have been employed. The advantage of doping is to engineer the cathode surface, structure, and particle morphology simultaneously. This review aims to summarize recent advances in understanding chemo‐mechanical degradation mechanism and the role of different dopants in enhancing the thermal stability and overall electrochemical performance. The pinning and pillaring effects of dopants on suppressing oxygen evolution, cation mixing, and phase transition are introduced. It is found that the higher ionic radii enable dopants to reside on cathode particles, preserving the particle surface and refining particle morphology to suppress crack formation. Finally, the effect of doping on Li ion diffusion, rate capability, and long‐term stability are discussed.

Abstract The development of noble‐metal free electrocatalysts with low production cost is of utmost importance for sustainable water electrolysis. Herein, we present a fast flexible synthesis pathway for the preparation of a variety of different medium‐ and high‐entropy spinel sulfides of various compositions, using a non‐aqueous microwave‐assisted synthesis without any H 2 S. Nanoparticulate high‐entropy sulfides containing up to 8 different metal cations can be obtained after an extremely short synthesis time of only 1 min and comparatively low temperatures of 200–230°C. We further demonstrate the high activity of the obtained sulfides for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

The space charge effect induced by high-quality heterojunctions is essential for efficient electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we delicately manipulate intermolecular charge transfer by modifying substituents (-g = -CH3, -H, -NO2) with various electron donating/withdrawing capabilities in CoPc-g/CoS organic-inorganic heterostructures. CoPc-CH3, as a typical electron donor, transfers more electrons to CoS due to the presence of -CH3, forming the strongest space electric field and thus regulating the dual active sites at the interface. Furthermore, oxygen-containing intermediates preferentially adsorb on the positively charged CoPc-CH3 side, and the rapid accumulation of electrons on the CoS side decelerates catalyst dissolution at the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential, ensuring the stable OER process under the optimized adsorbate evolution mechanism. As a result, CoPc-CH3/CoS catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential and remains stable for 150 h at 0.5 A cm-2 in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The method provides a novel strategy for accurately regulating the space electric field of heterojunctions.

The incorporation of non-metal dopants can significantly enhance catalytic activity and improve stability. Furthermore, the creation of heterostructures is particularly advantageous to facilitate charge transfer and optimize electronic properties. This study presents an effective bifunctional mixed-valence Ruthenium heterostructure synthesized through a cascading process involving grinding with carbon nitride and subsequent thermal treatment. The catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance with remarkably low overpotentials of 197 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 24.8 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, with the stability exceeding 24 h at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻2 in acidic media. Additionally, when employed in an acidic oxygen water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer, the bifunctional catalyst demonstrates excellent activity, achieving an ultralow cell voltage of 1.53 V to sustain 10 mA cm⁻2. Enhanced performance is attributed to efficient charge transfer and increased exposure of active sites, providing valuable insights for the development of effective acidic water-electrolysis catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) to ammonia presents a promising alternative strategy to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. However, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reduces the Faradaic efficiency toward ammonia, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) increases the energy consumption. This study designs IrCu4 alloy nanoparticles as a bifunctional catalyst to achieve efficient NO3RR and OER while suppressing the unwanted HER. This is achieved by operating the NO3RR at positive potentials using the IrCu4 catalyst, which allows a Faradaic efficiency of 93.6% for NO3RR. When applied to OER catalysis, the IrCu4 alloy also shows excellent results, with a relatively low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Stable ammonia production can be achieved for 50 h in a 16 cm2 flow electrolyzer in simulated working conditions. Our research provides a pathway for optimizing NO3RR through bifunctional catalysts in a tandem approach.

Traditional hydrometallurgy methods for recycling the spent lithium-ion battery materials face some challenges, including the complex processes, and difficulties in separating Ni/Co/Mn. To address these issues, this work proposes a simple one-pot method to achieve a high Li leaching efficiency (99.2%) and simultaneously transform the majority of Ni (99.5%) and Co (99.9%) into a high-performance multifunctional electrocatalyst (LNMCO-HS-180). LNMCO-HS-180 with single-phase structure shows a hollow microsphere morphology. LNMCO-HS-180 can efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER), and methanol oxidation reactions (MOR), with the ORR half-wave potential of 0.732 V and, OER potential of 1.469 V at 10 mA cm-2. This is mainly attributed to the unique hollow microsphere morphology, suitable Ni/Co/Mn oxidation states, and reduction in the free energy barriers for OER and ORR. Additionally, LNMCO-HS-180 exhibits an MOR potential of only 1.43 V at 100 mA cm-2 and excellent formate selectivity (>99%).

Decoupled water electrolysis, which utilizes redox mediators to separate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in space and time, is considered a potential method for producing high-purity green hydrogen. However, there are some key challenges in decoupled water electrolysis using solid-state redox mediators, such as redox potentials, voltage distribution, capacity limitations, and material stability. Here, F-doped Na0.7MnO2.05 (NMOF) with an appropriate redox potential, high capacity, and stability was synthesized by a simple sol–gel method. The redox peak pair of NMOF was located at −0.064 V/–0.314 V (vs Hg/HgO), which is located between the onset potentials of the HER and OER. By F-doping, F–Mn bonds significantly inhibited the dissolution of Mn2+ in the electrolyte, thereby reducing the Jahn–Teller effect and improving the cycling stability of Na-ion insertion and removal in Na0.7MnO2.05. NMOF prepared by adding 5 mol/% NaF at 850 °C (named NMOF2) exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, with a discharge capacity of 114.3 mAh/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. Using NMOF2 for decoupled water electrolysis, voltage balance distribution was achieved, and hydrogen and oxygen production was achieved at such low voltages (0.85 V for the HER process and 0.89 V for the OER process) at a current density of 5 mA/cm2. These suggest that NMOF2 could be a promising material for decoupled water electrolysis.

The scarcity of cost-effective and durable iridium-free anode electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses a significant challenge to the widespread application of the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). To address the electrochemical oxidation and dissolution issues of Ru-based electrocatalysts, an electron-donating modification strategy is developed to stabilize WRuOx under harsh oxidative conditions. The optimized catalyst with a low Zirconium doping (Zr, 1 wt.%) enhances durability noticeably, with a 77% reduction in degradation rate in the durability test of 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 m H2SO4. When integrated into a homemade PEMWE device, the Zr-doped catalyst achieves excellent long-term stability, lasting up to 650 h at 100 mA cm⁻2. Additionally, the electronic modulation from the Zr modification leads to superior activity with a low overpotential of 208 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Theoretical calculation results further reveal that electron-donating Zr modification effectively suppresses Ru overoxidation and lattice oxygen participation, maintaining a robust structure during acidic OER. This modification also promotes deprotonation through stronger Brønsted acid sites, significantly improving both long-term stability and activity.

Dye-sensitization is a promising strategy to improve the light absorption and photoactivity abilities of wide-bandgap semiconductors, like TiO2. For effective water-splitting photoanodes with no sacrificial agents, the electrochemical potential of the dye must exceed the thermodynamic threshold needed for the oxygen evolution reaction. This study investigates two promising organic cyanoacrylic dyes, designed to meet that criterion by means of theoretical calculations. Both yellow-colored dyes were synthesized and characterized by optical and photoelectrochemical techniques, demonstrating strong light absorption in the visible region, suitable experimental reduction potentials, and adsorption from the organic solvent onto mesoporous TiO2 layers. In addition, to promote immobilization in aqueous electrolytes, the dyes were hybridized with graphene oxide or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Photoelectrochemical analysis of the dye-sensitized photoelectrodes demonstrated efficient charge transfer from the dyes to the TiO2 photoanode under simulated solar light. While the starting photocurrent notably surpassed the blank TiO2, a subsequent decay points to kinetic obstacles that still need to be overcome.

Hydrogen is gaining attention as a fossil fuel alternative due to its potential to meet global energy demands. Producing hydrogen from water splitting is promising as a clean and sustainable fuel pathway. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial in electrocatalytic water splitting for energy conversion and storage. However, water electrolysis faces challenges in cost, efficiency, and scalability. Alternative transition metal electrocatalysts and emerging 2D materials advance electrolysis research, though transitioning from academia to industry remains challenging. The introduction of 3D‐printing technologies has revolutionized electrode fabrication for HER and OER. This review explores integrating 3D‐printing technologies and surface functionalization with non‐noble metal‐based electrocatalysts and emerging 2D materials. It focuses on surface‐functionalized 3D‐printed electrodes using technologies like selective laser melting, stereolithography, and fused deposition modeling with non‐noble metal electrocatalysts such as transition metal oxides, hydroxides, and emerging 2D materials like transition metal carbide/nitride (MXenes) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The review highlights the opportunities and challenges in scalable fabrication, long‐term durability, and cost‐efficiency for practical implementation. Future research directions include exploring new materials for 3D printing and alternative electrocatalysts alongside leveraging theoretical and machine‐learning approaches to accelerate the development of competitive materials for water electrolysis.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials present novel electronic and catalytic performances, showing a promising application as nano-device. In this investigation, a family of 2D material, X 2 B 6 (X = K, Na and Rb), is predicted with puckered crystal structure by elemental mutation method. The dynamic and thermal stability of the X 2 B 6 monolayer is addressed. The anisotropic mechanical properties of the X 2 B 6 monolayer is obtained by the Young’s modulus (296–406 N/m) and the Poisson’s ratio (0.36–0.35). Interestingly, the K 2 B 6 and Rb 2 B 6 monolayers demonstrate a metallic band structure, while the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is a semiconductor with an ultra-narrow bandgap only about 0.42 eV. Then, the ultra-high electron mobility in the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is calculated as about 9942 cm 2 .V −1 .s −1 , and the excellent optical performance of the Na 2 B 6 monolayer is also addressed. More importantly, the advantageous catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reduction (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is explored in these X 2 B 6 monolayers. Our work suggests a theoretical guidance to use the X 2 B 6 monolayer as a high-speed electronic devices and highly efficient catalyst.

The 90-year-old Hume–Rothery rule was adapted to design an outstanding bifunctional tetra-metallic alloy electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. Following the radius mismatch principles, Fe (131 pm) and Ni (124 pm) are selectively incorporated at the Pd (139 pm) site of Mo0.30Pd0.70 nanosheets. Analogously, Cu (132 pm) alloys with only Pd, while Ag (145 pm) alloys with both Pd and Mo (154 pm). The face-centered cubic Mo0.30Pd0.35Ni0.23Fe0.12 nanosheets with 10–12 atomic layers, featuring in-plane compressive strain along the {111} basal plane, show 1/3 (422) reflection from local hexagonal symmetry. The more electronegative Pd attracts electron density from Ni/Fe in Mo0.30Pd0.35Ni0.23Fe0.12, synergistically boosting the mass activities for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to 89 ± 5 and 38.6 ± 3.1 A g–1 at ±400 mV versus RHE, respectively. Full water electrolysis continues for ≥550 h, requiring cell voltages of 1.51 and 1.63 V at 10 and 100 mA cm–2, delivering 45 mL h–1 green H2.

Abstract The idea of grid‐scale hydrogen production by water electrolysis has been made possible by developing catalyst‐anchored three‐dimensional (3D) foam‐based electrodes. Catalytic performance in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions is improved by incorporating catalyst in 3D interlinked porous architecture, which enhances electrical conductivity and speeds up the discharge of gas bubbles. The detailed study on the role‐play of 3D frameworks in energy generation is explained in this article. The review also focuses on the recent development in utilizing these 3D substrates in the field of electrochemistry. Furthermore, it is imperative to enhance their compatibility with renewable energy systems and high‐temperature electrolysis for the sustainable production of hydrogen. Therefore, this review briefly explores the innovative design of self‐supported 3D framework electrodes using heterostructures and doping techniques to develop stable, durable, and efficient electrocatalysts. These catalysts aim to provide near‐zero overpotential, high selectivity, and long‐term stability for hydrogen production through water electrolysis, paving the way for commercial‐scale green energy production. 3D foam‐based electrodes can emerge as a key technology in the field of electrochemistry.

Designing cost-effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge in green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two OWS half-cell reactions. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesize hierarchical heterostructure MoS2@NiFeCo-LDH and MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low IR-corrected overpotentials of 156 mV and 61 mV with at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 under light assistance. The MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH‖MoS2@NiFeCo-LDH OWS cell achieves a low cell voltage of 1.46V at 10 mA cm-2 during light-assisted water electrolysis. Both materials exhibited exceptional stability under industrially relevant HER and OER conditions, maintaining a current density of 1 A cm-2 with minimal alterations in their potential and performance. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping the LDH matrix with high-valence Mo atoms and MoS2 quantum dots improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the electrocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the thermodynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, this work develops a facile synthesis method to design highly active and stable MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.

Abstract This investigation explores the potential of co‐incorporating nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) into copper oxide (CuO) nanostructures for bifunctional electrochemical charge storage and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). A facile wet chemical synthesis method is employed to co‐incorporate Ni and Co into CuO, yielding diverse nanostructured morphologies, including rods, spheres, and flake. The X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman analyses confirmed the formation of NiCo‐CuO nanostructure, with minor phases of nickel oxide (NiO) and cobalt tetraoxide (Co 3 O 4 ). High‐resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) also confirms the diverse morphologies and the minor phases of oxides. Synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy revealed higher charge states of Cu, Ni, and Co in the NiCo‐CuO nanostructure, enhancing its charge storage and OER. Site‐selective X‐ray absorption near edge structure analysis elucidated the spatial distribution of Cu, Ni, and Co in the nanostructure. Furthermore, extended X‐ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy provided insights into the local atomic structures, revealing increased coordination numbers and interatomic distances in the NiCo‐CuO nanostructure. In situ Raman analysis discloses the transformation of Co 3 O 4 into cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH) 2 ) and cobalt oxide (CoO) into cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) The NiCo‐CuO nanostructures exhibited superior specific capacitance, favorable Tafel behavior, and low overpotential positioning as promising bifunctional materials for energy storage and conversion applications. This work contributes to the development of efficient CuO nanocatalysts.

Recent ground- and space-based surveys have shown that planets between Earth and Neptune in size, known as "super-Earths," are among the most frequently found planets in the Galaxy. Although the JWST era has provided high-quality atmospheric data on several such super-Earths, modeling tools are crucial for understanding their unobservable interiors. Consequently, interior studies represent the next essential step in gaining a comprehensive understanding of this class of exoplanets. This study investigates the interior structure, thermal evolution, and atmospheric dynamics of the super-Earth GJ 486b using SERPINT, a 1-D self-consistent coupled interior structure and evolution model, aiming to understand the planet's thermal evolution based on an Earth-like structure. Our results indicate that GJ 486b's core is approximately 1.34 times larger than Earth's, with a core pressure of about 1171 GPa. The thermal evolution model predicts that the planet's mantle cools and solidifies over approximately 0.93 million years. As the magma ocean cools, water is released from the melt, forming a water-rich atmosphere during early solidification. Photolysis of water vapor and subsequent hydrogen escape lead to oxygen accumulation, forming a water- and oxygen-rich secondary atmosphere. Future high-sensitivity JWST observations, with improved wavelength coverage and the detection of additional trace gases, will enable a detailed analysis of the planet's atmospheric composition, providing crucial insights into the interior, surface, and subsurface properties of GJ 486b.

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high hydrostatic pressure and, more recently, biaxial compression in epitaxial thin films has ignited significant interest in understanding the interplay between atomic and electronic structure in these compounds. Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.

Exsolution is a promising approach for fabricating oxide-supported metal nanocatalysts through redox-driven metal precipitation. A defining feature of exsolved nanocatalysts is their anchored metal-oxide interface, which exhibits exceptional structural stability in (electro)catalysis. However, the electronic interactions at this unique interface remain unclear, despite their known impact on catalytic performance. In this study, we confirm charge transfer between the host oxide and the exsolved metal by demonstrating a two-stage Fermi level (EF) evolution on SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3−δ (STF) during metallic iron (Fe0) exsolution. Combining ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with theoretical analysis, we show that EF initially rises due to electron doping from oxygen vacancy formation in STF. Subsequently, upon Fe0 precipitation, EF stabilizes and becomes insensitive to further oxygen release in STF, driven by EF equilibration and charge transfer between STF and the exsolved Fe0. These findings highlight the importance of considering electronic metal–support interactions when optimizing exsolved nanocatalysts.

The present study focuses on electrical stimulation for composting. Using the PSALSAR method, a systematic review resulted in 24 relevant articles. For each system, the review describes key materials, composter design, operating conditions, temperature evolution, compost maturity, microbial community, and outcome. The examined studies fall into four main systems: electric field-assisted aerobic composting (EAAC), electrolytic oxygen aerobic composting (EOAC), microbial fuel cells (MFC), and thermoelectric generators (TEG). Apart from the main systems highlighted above, there is a rare case, which remains hardly studied. This includes bioelectrochemically assisted anaerobic composting (AnCBE, III). EAAC and EOAC systems biologically balance microbial activity and organic matter decomposition, whereas MFC and TEG systems have dual functioning due to energy generated alongside waste degradation. These innovative systems significantly improve composting efficiency by speeding up organic matter breakdown, increasing oxygen supply, and facilitating energy recovery. Together, they overcome the drawbacks of conventional composting systems and promote more environmentally friendly waste management solutions.

The presence of trace CO impurity gas in hydrogen fuel can rapidly deactivate platinum‐based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts due to poisoning effects, yet the precise CO tolerance mechanism remains debated. Our designed Au@PtX bifunctional core‐shell nanocatalysts exhibit excellent performance of CO tolerance in acidic solution during HOR and possess exceptional Raman spectroscopy enhancement. Through capturing and analyzing in situ Raman spectroscopy evidences on *OH, metal‐O species and *CO evolution under 0.3 V, we confirm that oxygen‐containing species on PtRu and PtSn catalysts promote the oxidation and desorption of *CO. While Ru enhances *CO adsorption on Pt, the primary CO tolerance performance of PtRu arises from *CO oxidation via a bifunctional pathway. Additionally, electronic structure of Sn reduces *CO adsorption on Pt sites, complementing the bifunctional mechanism to further enhance the CO tolerance performance of PtSn. These discoveries significantly deepen our understanding of the anti‐poisoning mechanism of Pt‐based catalysts in the HOR process and offer valuable insights for rational catalyst design.

Avascular necrosis (AVN) is characterized by compromised blood supply to bone tissue, often resulting in significant pain and functional impairment. Conservative treatment options for early-stage AVN of the talus are scarce, with non-weight-bearing protocols and hyperbaric oxygen therapy showing limited efficacy. This report presents a potential novel approach to managing non-traumatic AVN of the talus using a combination of adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). A 60-year-old male presented with progressive right ankle pain of a two-year evolution. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed stage II AVN of the talus with extensive bone infarctions occupying almost all of its volume but with no collapse. A single injection of SVF and PRP was performed after diagnostic arthroscopy, followed by a tailored rehabilitation protocol. The patient experienced significant pain relief, with no further need for analgesics, and was able to return to non-impact sports. At the 18-month follow-up, functional scores showed significant improvement, and MRI showed stable AVN with no evidence of collapse. This report highlights SVF and PRP as a potential effective conservative option for non-traumatic talar AVN.

Symbiosis with chemoautotrophic bacteria has evolved in many animal lineages inhabiting reducing habitats such as hydrothermal vents, allowing these holobionts to thrive in dark biospheres. In certain instances, the symbionts have become intracellular, residing within specialised bacteriocytes. The integration of microbial symbionts with eukaryotic cells vary across known animals; however, no specialised organelle dedicated to chemosynthesis has been identified yet. Here, we report a mode of symbiosis where sulphur-oxidising bacteria cultured within spherical multilamellar compartments (~12 μm) in the cold-seep aplacophoran mollusc Chaetoderma shenloong. This organelle, which we name 'dracosphera', is ubiquitous within the hypertrophied and intricately reticulate digestive gland of C. shenloong, which has otherwise lost most of its gut. Given that the symbionts are strictly anaerobic and the host resides in anoxic sediments tens of centimetres below the surface, the dracosphera may serve to minimise oxygen diffusion to the bacteria, akin to mechanisms observed in microbial diazotrophs or termite hindguts, as supported by our genomic and spatial transcriptomic analyses. Hypoxic conditions have been known to induce radical adaptations in meiofauna, exemplified by the acquisition of hydrogenosomes. Our discovery of similarly exceptional adaptations in C. shenloong provides new insights into the evolution of such organelles also in larger animals.

ABSTRACT Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are attractive electrochemical systems for large‐scale energy storage. Despite the most developed ones being those based on vanadium, the search for new chemistries is essential to overcome several problems associated with this metal identified as a critical raw material. All‐iron redox flow battery (A‐IRFB) is an interesting device due to iron abundance and worldwide distribution. However, the poor performance of its negative half‐cell, due to the sluggish plating/stripping processes related to the Fe 2+ /Fe 0 redox pair, negatively impacts its energy efficiency and long‐term performance. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of a low concentration of NaHSO 3 (10 mM), as a novel additive, to an electrolyte formulation based on 0.5 M FeCl 2 , 3 M NaCl, and 10 mM citric acid (H 3 Cit) remarkably improves the electrochemical behavior of the negative half‐cell. The enhanced performance can be explained as the additive guarantees a low oxygen solution content (reductant agent), promotes the plating/stripping reactions (improving the kinetics of the Fe 0 deposit through the formation of a FeHSO 3 + complex), and diminishes the contribution of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. The use of this key additive opens up a promising scenario for the development of A‐IRFBs with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, thus boosting their potential commercial development.

Abstract Gold catalysts are extensively utilized in photothermal processes that rely on localized surface plasmon resonance effects. However, the development of novel gold(I)‐organic frameworks that function as highly efficient photothermal catalysts for the production of hydrogen peroxide from water and oxygen presents a fascinating and challenging research opportunity. Herein, three gold(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes (Au‐CTCs) based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are prepared, exhibiting good photothermal conversion efficiency and H 2 O 2 evolution rates. Utilizing the optimized Au‐TFPT, the production rates of H₂O₂ can reach as high as 51,987 µ m g⁻¹ h⁻¹, surpassing the performance of most reported metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), even with the use of sacrificial agents to accelerate the reaction. The thermal‐assisted photocatalytic mechanism is comprehensively studied by transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance, electron paramagnetic resonance, rotating ring disk electrode test, catalytic performance and among others, demonstrating thermal energy can enhance the mobility of photogenerated carriers and apparent quantum yield, regulate the reactive species ratio and H 2 O 2 selectivity, reduce the apparent activation energy of photocatalysis, and improve mass transfer rates, thereby accelerating the reaction process. This study offers new insights into the thermal‐assisted photocatalytic production of H 2 O 2 .

ABSTRACT Oxidative stress (OS) is a key biological challenge and selective pressure for organisms with aerobic metabolism. The result of the imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and antioxidant defense, OS can damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and plays an important role in driving variation in biological aging and health. Among humans, OS research has focused overwhelmingly on adults, with demonstrated connections between OS, inflammation, and metabolic and neurodegenerative conditions. Relatively little attention has been given to OS during childhood and adolescence. This lack of early life OS research exists despite clear implications for informing human life history evolution, subadult development, and lifelong health. Here, we review current knowledge on OS during human subadulthood. Our objectives are threefold: (1) To highlight common methods for measuring OS among children and adolescents and to establish typical measurement values; (2) To summarize the evidence linking demographic and ecological factors to variation in subadult OS; (3) To identify avenues for future OS research in human biology. Our review underscores an expanding methodological toolkit for assessing OS among children and adolescents. Subadult OS is considerably elevated compared to OS among adults, a pattern eliciting unknown consequences and likely related to increased early life metabolic demands (e.g., unique human brain development). Factors such as diet, physical activity, infectious disease, and structural neglect also appear to drive subadult OS. Current limitations for research on subadult OS are evident. Future work should emphasize evolutionary, biocultural, and energetic life course perspectives to advance this promising area of human biology.

Abstract We present an investigation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the spatially resolved Keplerian disk around V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, based on a spectral survey carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6 (220.7−274.9 GHz). We identified about 3700 molecular emission lines and discovered 23 COMs in the disk. We estimated the column densities of the COMs detected, using the iterative LTE line-fitting method. According to our analyses, using only optically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of COMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies of COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori disk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH 3 CN are missing, whereas various oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH 2 OH-bearing molecules, are detected. The missing CH 2 OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice dominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various objects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a solar system comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on the COM compositions. In general, the COM abundances relative to methanol in V883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are comparable to the cometary values. This may indicate the planet-forming material chemically evolves in the disk midplane after being accreted from the envelope. In addition, as found in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, nitrogen might also be trapped as ammonium salt within the dust grains in the V883 Ori disk.

Nova shells are the remnants of a nova eruption in a cataclysmic variable system. By studying their geometry we can better understand the physical mechanisms that shape them during the nova eruption. A nova shell that challenges our current understanding of these processes is the shell observed around V1425 Aql. It has at least two different components: an inner and symmetric shell, and an outer and asymmetric shell, with the latter expanding faster than the former. The physical reason behind the asymmetric ejecta is not clear. We aim to characterize the properties and differences between these two components to understand the origin behind the unusual shape. We acquired MUSE data to study the spatial position and kinematics of the expanding gas across the shell. Our analysis includes channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and the reconstruction of the 3D geometry of the nova shell. Several emission lines are detected within the MUSE wavelength coverage, including but not limited to Balmer, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Helium lines. There are significant differences in the spectra of the inner and outer shells, with the latter being observed only in forbidden transitions, while the inner shows a mix of forbidden and allowed ones. Our analysis reveals that the outer shell has a geometry consistent with an arc-shaped structure that partially encircles the more spherical inner shell. Within the inner shell, clumpy structures start to be noticeable in the lines of H$\alpha$+[Nii]. We have constrained the geometry of the outer shell to an arc-shaped structure, although the physical reason behind its origin is still eluding us. Further monitoring of the evolution of both shells in this object might help to clarify the mechanism behind this unusual configuration.

Traditional water injection profile monitoring primarily relies on methods such as isotope tracers and oxygen activation. Conventional resistive temperature instruments, which are drag-measured, are highly sensitive to production interference and can only capture the transient temperature response of the wellbore at a single depth. As a result, the temperature data obtained from well temperature logging has certain limitations. Using DTS (Distributed Temperature Sensing) for pre-and post-well opening and shut-in water injection profile testing, along with quantitative analysis of water absorption, addresses the limitations of traditional well temperature logging, which typically offers only qualitative insights. However, the interpretation of DTS data still requires further refinement to improve its alignment with actual conditions. In this study, COMSOL software 6.1 was used to simulate the temperature distribution within the downhole temperature field, both spatially and temporally. The Sobol method was employed to analyze the influence of fluid flow rate and rock thermal conductivity on the temperature field. The results indicated that the fluid flow rate in the wellbore has a more significant impact and is the primary controlling factor of the downhole temperature field. Based on actual field conditions and the forward simulation results, the differential evolution algorithm was applied to invert and interpret the water injection profile. The inversion results showed minimal error, confirming the feasibility of this approach. It is helpful to interpret the well temperature profile measured by the distributed fiber optic temperature sensor, which is helpful to improve the ability of well temperature logging to identify the output profile, which has important academic value and practical significance for the development of water injection wells.

The paper presents new data on the structure and composition of ultramafic rocks in the eastern part of the South Kraka massif. It is shown that the studied area is composed predominantly of spinel peridotites, among which the main role belongs to lherzolites with a low content of clinopyroxene (2–5%) and harzburgites, among which lens-shaped and bandshaped inclusions of monomineral olivine rocks – dunites – are quite often observed. The leading role in the structure of the rocks belongs to high-Mg olivine (Fo 87-94 ), a secondary role (2016). Nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Arabian Shield and genesis of Al-spinel micropods: Evidence from the mantle xenoliths of Harrat is played by high-Mg orthopyroxene (enstatite) and Ca-Mg clinopyroxene diopside. Rare minerals of the mantle stage are amphibole and plagioclase. A typical accessory mineral of ultramafic rocks is spinel, the composition of which varies from high-Al in lherzolites (Cr# = 0.16–0.3), to moderate-Al in harzburgites (Cr# = 0.3–0.55) and to high-Cr in dunites (Cr# = 0.6–0.85). Of the rare accessory minerals in the rocks, the following were identified: native copper, pentlandite, awaruite and PGM (laurite, irarsite, Os-Ir-Ru-alloys). The section of mantle ultramafic rocks of the Sargan Range completed its high-temperature evolution to the levels of the plagioclase peridotite facies, partly in the transition zone from spinel to plagioclase facies. An assessment of oxygen fugacity allows us to speak about more reducing conditions for the formation of rocks of the studied area compared to other similar formations of upper mantle origin and allows us to classify the studied ultramafic rocks as moderately depleted restites of the upper mantle under the riftogenic structure of the Paleo-Ural basin. The geochemical specialization of PGM also indicates a restite origin of ultramafic rocks. At the stage of cooling and tectonic transformations in the crust, ultramafic rocks underwent serpentinization.

The role of the State in the exercise of typical state activity in the face of international responsibility and sovereignty.The thesis aims to analyze the theme of international responsibility of the State in the exercise of empire activity.In the work, contextualizes the theme, relating it to the new challenges of DIMA and the protection of the marine environment.Discusses the sea and its importance for life, as a source of food and in the production of spare oxygen, in addition to its use for various human activities, especially in the transport of goods, in general, and oil, to demonstrate the importance of this study.It addresses the sea strips.It is a division for legal purposes, behold, the sea, in the general sense, understand the oceans and seas, is unique, thus only having the objective of establishing territoriality, sovereignty and sovereignty rights.This study is important for a better understanding of the attribution of the international responsibility of the State.Briefly, the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, the continental shelf, the high sea and the Area are analyzed.Several conventions of importance to the DIMA and to the Law of the Sea are analyzed about their implications to the State when using ships in the exercise of governmental activity or warships.As a rule, the various conventions addressed are important in the protective system of the marine environment, but have reservations regarding the application to warships or that are at the service of the State in carrying out typical activity, constituting true immunity to states when exercising empire activity.Among the conventions analyzed, we highlight the OILPOL Convention, 1954; the Convention on Intervention in the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969; the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969; the SOLAS Convention, 1974, and the ISPS, IMDG, ISM and HSC Codes; the MARPOL 73/78 Convention and theMontego Bay Convention, among others.Issues related to sovereignty and international accountability are addressed: current studies and projects related to the theme.In relation to sovereignty, the objective is to punctuate its evolution to the current times and the change of its nature, no longer seen as an obstacle to the responsability of the State but as an institute to assign responsibilities.At work, we seek to bring several institutes that can assist in the international responsability of the State more effectively or that there is greater commitment to the protective system of the marine environment, such as cooperation; the possible application of proportionality and reasonableness, although they are institutes of internal law focused on the application of principles of constitutional law; emphasis on the principles of prevention and precaution, as mitigating possible responsability; valuing soft law and sources of international law; a reading of the application of human rights from the perspective of environmental protection and the analysis of rhetoric in DIMA.And, finally, the conclusion whether or not there is the international responsibility of the state for the act of empire.The development of the work will have as main approach method the dialectic, in order to identify possible contradictions between conventions and principles of DIMA.Inductive, deductive, hypothetical-deductive and systemic methods will also be used.

Nørskov Festschrift".I received a PhD in physics from Århus University, Denmark, under the inspiring supervision of Bengt Lundqvist. After postdoc experiences at Århus University, IBM Yorktown Heights Research Laboratories, and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, I found it hard to find a faculty position in Denmark in the early 1980s. There simply were no openings. Fortunately, I was offered a position at the Haldor Topsøe Research Laboratories─strongly supported by Haldor Topsøe, Henrik Topsøe, and Bjerne Clausen. The involvement with the Topsøe company, one of the world's largest suppliers of catalysts and technology for the chemical and energy industry, influenced my career in many ways. Most importantly, it became clear to me that a theory of heterogeneous catalysis was essential to further advance this important area of science and technology. I kept that focus when starting an academic career, and kept the association with the Topsøe company, now serving on its Board of Directors.In the late 80s the Danish government started to realize that they were about to lose a whole generation of scientists and instituted some special professorships with applicants competing in all fields and at all universities in the country. That got me started at the Technical University of Denmark building up a research group with the funding that came with the professorship. The focus was on understanding surface reactivity as well as impurities in bulk metals.The impurity work started an extremely fruitful collaboration with Flemming Besenbacher at Århus University that continued for the next decades. With Besenbacher, I founded the Center for Atomic- scale Materials Physics with large-scale funding from the first round of grants from the Danish National Research Foundation. Here my group established the beginning of an understanding of the surface chemical bond. It started with simple models like the effective medium theory. Later, as more accurate density functional calculations became possible, it formed the foundation of the d-band model, or Hammer–Nørskov model, of chemisorption. The model allowed an understanding of trends in bond energies of adsorbates on transition metal surfaces including variations from metal to metal, the effect of alloying, the effect of structure and defects, and the effect of strain. The interplay with the experimental groups of Flemming Besenbacher, Ib Chorkendorff and Anders Nilsson became extremely important in supporting the theory efforts.Combining DFT calculations of trends in adsorption energies and transition state energies of elemental surface processes with microkinetic modeling opened the possibility of calculating trends in full catalytic rates, for the first time. This also opened the possibility of making predictions for new catalysts, several of which were synthesized and tested in the groups of Claus Hviid Christensen and of Ib Chorkendorff.I established a Center for Atomic-scale Materials Design with Karsten Jacobsen, Kristian Thygesen, Thomas Bligaard, and Jan Rossmeisl in the late 2000s with funding from the Lundbeck Foundation. An important new effort was aimed at an understanding electrocatalysis. The theory of electrocatalysis was not nearly as developed as the theory of heterogeneous catalysis in terms of a quantitative description of processes and trends in reactivity. One aspect that makes the theoretical description of adsorption and reaction processes at the solid–liquid interface extremely demanding is the description of the solvated reactants. We developed the so-called computational hydrogen electrode, which opened up for a description of thermo-chemical trends in electrocatalysis. Our first application provided an understanding of trends in reactivity of different catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) providing insights into why Pt is the best elemental electrocatalyst for the cathode process in fuel cells, and how it can be made even better by alloying.The discovery of scaling relations between adsorption energies of different intermediates and between transition energies and adsorption energies opened the possibility of reducing the enormous complexity associated with the calculation of trends for full catalytic rates. We found that many adsorption energies of CHx species scaled and it took us some time to understand the physical basis for this amazing effect well enough to publish the result. Later, we found that this is extremely general. The fact that many activation energies scale with reaction energies, known as Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relations, have been realized for many years. The scaling we discovered of adsorbed species is considerably more general than that. First, it includes scaling between adsorption energies of intermediates, and therefore transition state energies not only scale with reaction energies but with any chosen representative adsorption energy. This gives an enormous simplification.Moving to Stanford and SLAC in 2010, DOE funding to a new Catalysis center, SUNCAT, allowed a large expansion of the theory efforts, and Thomas Bligaard, Frank Abild Petersen, Felix Studt, and Alexandra Vojvodic moved along to SLAC to form the core theory group in this center. The Center also included a number of outstanding experimentalists, in particular Anders Nilsson, Tom Jaramillo, Matteo Cargnello, Stacey Bent, and Zhenan Bao.A systematic theory of transition metal catalysis was developed in those years. We showed that the scaling relations are extremely general for many surfaces and reactions, and eventually you can plot the rate as a function of a few adsorption energies, or descriptors, for any reaction in a volcano plot directly identifying the optimum catalyst. Sabatier had postulated such a relationship between a bond energy and the rate many years before. The scaling relations directly showed that a single or a few bond energies can in fact be used as a descriptor, it defined what the descriptor should be, and most importantly, it made volcano relations quantitative, allowing its use to search for new catalysts. Many reactions were analyzed including hydrogenation reactions and methane activation reactions.Another development that accelerated considerably during the time at Stanford was the description of electrochemical processes for energy conversion, including models of activation energies in electrocatalysis. This included the oxygen evolution reaction, the CO and CO2 reduction reactions and the N2 reduction reaction. For the latter we developed an understanding of the requirements for a high ammonia selectivity, something that laid the foundation for the thinking in the experimental groups we worked with (Ib Chorkendorff at DTU and Tom Jaramillo and Matteo Cargnello at Stanford).In 2018 I moved back to DTU in a Villum Kann Rasmussen Chair and with good funding from the Villum Foundation. I also took on the position as Chair of the Danish National Research Foundation. The work on electrochemical ammonia synthesis became a cornerstone. Additional work on thermal ammonia synthesis resulted in the discovery of a new promotion mechanism. Surfaces with a spin moment bind adsorbates weaker than the non spin polarized surface of the same metal, and certain adsorbates quench the spin in their vicinity and thus act as promotors by lowering the energy of transition state of important elementary steps. Experimental work in the Chorkendorff and Kibsgaard groups validated the effect for several ammonia synthesis catalysts. Another new effort was in translating the theory we developed to understand trends in heterogeneous catalysis to homogeneous catalysts. All of this work continues ....In all my career I have been fortunate to have worked with outstanding students and postdocs as well as some of the best scientists in the field. I have mentioned some of the colleagues in the above but it would be completely impossible to do all students and postdocs justice in this short piece. Let me just thank everyone profoundly. The picture above, taken at a conference celebrating my 70th birthday, shows many of the students and postdocs I have worked with over the years.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorJens K.

Male echidnas have spurs on their hind legs which connect to a crural gland, similar to the platypus. Unlike platypus, echidnas do not attempt to strike with their spurs. The crural gland produces a milky substance during the breeding season. Platypuses weigh from 0.6 to 3.0 kg. Males possess a sharp spur on each hind leg that is connected to a venom gland located in the upper thigh region. Venom is only produced by sexually mature males from about 4 years of age. Platypuses are anesthetized using a mask placed over the bill and induced with isoflurane and oxygen. They are impossible to intubate because of their small gape, inability to visualize the larynx, and bulbous structure (torus linguae) at the base of the tongue. References Bodley K. 2019 .

For field capture of rhinoceroses on the ground or from a helicopter a robust and reliable darting method such as the Cap-Chur system is preferable. Recumbency and positioning are critical considerations for safe anesthesia of rhinoceroses whether in a zoological setting or in the wild. Respiratory depression is the most significant life-threatening complication encountered during routine anesthesia of the rhinoceros. The rhinoceros, like other large mammals, is prone to hyperthermia during capture and translocation. All black rhinoceroses require tranquilization during transport to preclude excessive struggle and associated trauma. Short-acting tranquilizers such as azaperone, xylazine or detomidine, and diazepam or midazolam are useful agents to produce a calming effect in rhinoceroses during transport.

This chapter discusses the methods for handling fish with and without anesthesia that have minimal impact on the animal and ultimately reduce stress when performed properly. Lungfish and polypterids possess true lungs with ventrally situated pneumatic duct openings in the alimentary canal instead of a traditional gas or "swim" bladder. Teleost fish have an anatomic separation between aerobic, slow-oxidative muscles and anaerobic, fast-twitch, glycolytic muscles. Propofol has been used as an immersion anesthetic in other species, including silver catfish, Nile tilapia, koi, Persian sturgeon, and goldfish with reported efficacy. Immobilization of fishes in the field is a commonplace event. Electroanesthesia is a common fisheries tool for group immobilization to tag, survey, or remove animals from an area. Considerations for immobilizing fish in remote areas include having portable equipment that can connect to car batteries or portable generators/batteries.

The field of reptile anesthesia has undergone a gradual and continuing evolution from hypothermia and manual restraint to contemporary balanced and well-controlled anesthesia. The most reliable vascular access site is the ventral tail vessels, located immediately ventral to the coccygeal vertebrae. In snakes, these vessels are mostly approached from the ventral midline, but in many lizards a lateral approach is often more convenient. Most monitoring modalities for domestic species can be applied to reptiles. Body temperature should be monitored with a cloacal or esophageal thermometer or temperature probe able to measure low temperatures. The clinical signs associated with induction of general anesthesia in reptiles are fairly consistent. Inhalational anesthesia is commonly used for induction and maintenance of reptile anesthesia. Recovery times in reptiles are prolonged compared to birds and mammals. References Anderson N , Wack R , Calloway L , Hetherington T , Williams J . 1999 .

They inhabit many different habitats, from tropical rain forests to deserts, from freshwater swamps to oceans. The wide variety of environments, dietary preferences, and activity levels explains the substantial differences in metabolic rate among chelonian species. The cardiovascular system is characterized by many morphological and functional peculiarities. The ventricular anatomy is such that, in physiologic conditions of normal ventilation, there is a high degree of separation between the systemic and pulmonary circulations, with minimal mixing between venous and arterial blood. An important factor that modulates cardiac shunting is thermoregulation. Among opioid analgesics, morphine has been shown to provide analgesia in chelonians whereas butorphanol, even at dosages largely exceeding the mammalian therapeutic doses, did not have any effect on thermal threshold. Recovery time from anesthesia appears to be prolonged in chelonians when compared to mammals exposed to the same anesthetic agent. References Bagatto B , Blankenship EL , Henry RP . 1997 .

Much of the information relied on for anesthesia in cartilaginous fishes has been anecdotal. Many elasmobranchs housed in public aquaria share large systems with mixed species. Elasmobranchs are very responsive to behavioral conditioning and training techniques. Tonic immobility or "hypnosis" is a defensive behavior resulting in a temporary state of "profound and reversible motor inhibition elicited by some forms of physical restraint". Access to elasmobranchs vasculature is determined by the size and position of the animal rather than which vessel is most ideal. The use of chemical restraint can provide a safer, less stressful procedure for the fish and staff involved. Injectable anesthetics are an alternative when waterborne anesthesia is impractical due to large water volume or when sedation is necessary to safely capture animals from complex primary exhibits.

Amphibians are found from the equatorial rainforest to Canada, where they may remain frozen through the winter. Amphibians are routinely maintained in human care as pets, in laboratories, and in zoos for education, as well as conservation and reintroduction projects. The respiratory physiology of amphibians is unlike that of any other animal taxa. Vascular access is limited by animal size. Transillumination is a useful technique for highlighting the pathways of major vessels. Intramuscular injections can be administered in the large muscles of the hind limbs. The aquatic nature and skin permeability of amphibians makes topical use of anesthetic agents a convenient means of achieving systemic effects. Respiratory ventilation is reduced or absent during amphibian anesthesia. The dermis is kept moist to allow for efficient dermal respiration. Analgesia should be considered for any noxious procedures in amphibians. References Adami C , Spadeavecchia C , Angeli G , d'Ovidio D . 2015 .

Across species of raptors, the anatomy of the respiratory system does not vary appreciably except in size, and it exhibits the basic avian anatomy and physiology of lungs and air sacs as found in other avian groups. Procedures involving anesthesia in raptors are regularly conducted in dorsal, lateral, and sternal recumbency without marked overt differences in ventilation or manner of managing the anesthetic episode. Inhalant anesthetic agents are the workhorse of avian anesthesia and presently are highly recommended over injectable agents. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam and midazolam have been used successfully for short nonpainful procedures or preanesthetic sedation. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, produces dose-related unconsciousness and analgesia, but with highly variable species-specific results and recoveries characterized by uncontrolled movements.
