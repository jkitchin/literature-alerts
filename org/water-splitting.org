Abstract Integrating active sites for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) is pivotal for advancing bifunctional oxygen electrodes. Addressing the geometric/electronic properties of these sites is essential to disrupt the linear scaling relationship between the adsorption and desorption of complex intermediates. Herein, a proof‐of‐concept is presented for constructing asymmetric trinuclear sites employing both composition‐ and size‐based asymmetric coupling strategies. These sites comprise ORR‐active Fe single atom (Fe SA ), OER‐active atomically clustered Fe species (Fe AC ), and Ni SA sites as modulators. This Fe AC‐SA ‐Ni SA @N‐doped carbon exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activities, with a narrow potential gap of 0.661 V between an ORR half‐wave potential of 0.931 V and an OER potential of 1.592 V at 10 mA cm −2 . The Zn‐air battery employing this material achieves a peak power density of 293 mW cm −2 , a specific capacity of 748 mAh g Zn −1 , and remarkable stability. Experimental findings and theoretical simulations reveal that Ni SA sites induced strong electronic coupling among the trinuclear centers, facilitating charge redistribution and optimizing the adsorption and desorption barriers for intermediates. This enhances the rapid release of * OH during ORR and the efficient transformation from * O to * OOH during OER. This study presents a novel strategy for developing robust bifunctional oxygen electrodes.

Abstract Transition metal oxides are state-of-the-art materials for catalysing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whose slow kinetics currently limit the efficiency of water electrolysis. However, microscale physicochemical heterogeneity between particles, dynamic reactions both in the bulk and at the surface, and an interplay between particle reactivity and electrolyte makes probing the OER challenging. Here, we overcome these limitations by applying state-of-the-art compressive Raman imaging to uncover concurrent bias-dependent pathways for the OER in a dense, crystalline electrocatalyst, α-Li 2 IrO 3 . By spatially and temporally tracking changes in stretching modes we follow catalytic activation and charge accumulation following ion exchange under various electrolytes and cycling conditions, comparing our observations with other crystalline catalysts (IrO 2 , LiCoO 2 ). We demonstrate that at low overpotentials the reaction between water and the oxidized catalyst surface is compensated by bulk ion exchange, as usually only found for amorphous, electrolyte permeable, catalysts. At high overpotentials the charge is compensated by surface redox active sites, as in other crystalline catalysts such as IrO 2 . Hence, our work reveals charge compensation can extend beyond the surface in crystalline catalysts. More generally, the results highlight the power of compressive Raman imaging for chemically specific tracking of microscale reaction dynamics in catalysts, battery materials, or memristors.

Abstract Constitutional‐isomerized covalent organic frameworks (COFs), constructed by swapping monomers around imine bonds, have attracted attention for their distinct optoelectronic properties, which significantly impact photocatalytic performance. However, limited research has delved into the inherent relationship between isomerization and the enhancement of H 2 O 2 photosynthesis. Herein, a pair of isomeric COFs linked by imine bonds (PB‐PT‐COF and PT‐PB‐COF) is synthesized, and it is proved that isomeric COFs exhibit different rate‐determining steps in the generation process of H 2 O 2 , resulting in a twofold increase in photocatalytic efficiency. Specifically, PT‐PB‐COF demonstrates effective adsorption and activation of molecular oxygen (O 2 + e − → •O 2 − + e − → H 2 O 2 ), leading to a significant improvement in H 2 O 2 photocatalytic efficiency. In contrast, PB‐PT‐COF exhibits robust interaction with H 2 O, enabling direct oxidation of H 2 O (H 2 O + h + → H 2 O 2 ). This study provides a thorough understanding of the intrinsic mechanism underlying the constitutional‐isomerized COFs in the photocatalytic H 2 O 2 generation, offering insights for further optimizing building units.

Abstract Asymmetric coordination has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, yet achieving a controlled synthesis of asymmetric structures to comprehensively understand the structure‐activity relationship remains challenging. In this study, a facile and effective symmetry‐breaking strategy is reported for tailoring the asymmetric MO 5 S 1 ‐type metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) catalyst, establishing the correlation between the sulfur (S)‐mediated electron rearrangement and the adsorption/desorption dynamics of oxygen‐related intermediates in OER. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that a well‐designed asymmetric structure can effectively lower the d‐band center, optimizing the adsorption behavior of OH * and significantly decreasing the reaction energy barrier for the rate‐determining step (OH * → O * ) with enhanced O–H bond cleavage process. The S‐NiFe‐MOF/CFP catalyst demonstrates a remarkable OER performance in an alkaline electrolyte environment. More importantly, the self‐assembled anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell showcases a low voltage of 1.84 V to deliver the current density of 1 A cm −2 , maintaining long‐term stability for over 100 h. This study unveils a precise asymmetric synthesis strategy employing S, highlighting the critical role of manipulating electron redistribution through asymmetric coordination to promote catalytic activity and develop advanced MOF‐based catalysts.

Electrocatalysts derived from earth-abundant transition metals offer a viable alternative to noble metals for water electrolysis, yet they often suffer from poor catalytic behaviour and limited lifespan. In this study, nanostructured nickel molybdate on nickel foam (NiMoO 4 /NF) were synthesized via a straightforward hydrothermal process at three different durations (6, 12, and 24 h) to assess their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The electrodes, specifically NiMoO 4 -6h, NiMoO 4 -12h, and NiMoO 4 -24h, demonstrated significant OER activity in 1.0 M KOH solution, achieving overpotentials of 315 mV, 290 mV and 320 mV for respectively. Notably, the NiMoO 4 -12h electrode showed an exceptional stability, with only a 1.28% activity decrease after 200 hours at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 . This study presents a novel approach to enhancing the electrocatalytic efficiency of these catalysts through optimizing their electrical conductivity, active surface sites, and surface reaction dynamics.

We investigated the oxygen evolution behavior of nine types of commercially available Ni-containing alloys in a NaOH–KOH hydrate melt. The oxygen overpotential of all Ni-containing alloys was lower than that of the Ni electrode (453 mV) at 500 mA cm –2 and 150°C. The Kovar (Fe–Ni–Co alloy) electrode exhibited the lowest oxygen overpotentials of 280 mV at 150°C and 227 mV at 200°C. The Tafel slope of the Kovar electrode at 150°C was 63 mV dec –1 , which was slightly lower than that of the Ni electrode (67 mV dec –1 ). The upper limit of the Tafel region for the Kovar electrode was extended to a higher current density of 300 mA cm –2 compared to that for the Ni electrode (100 mA cm –2 ) at 150°C. It further extended to 1000 mA cm –2 at 200°C, indicating that highly efficient water electrolysis can be expected.

The transcriptional response to low oxygen (hypoxia) in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is transduced through group VII Ethylene Response Factor (ERFVII) transcription factors, whose proteolysis is oxygen-dependent via the PLANT CYSTEINE OXIDASE (PCO) N-degron pathway. When and how this response to hypoxia evolved in land plants remains unknown. Here we investigated the conservation and divergence of transcriptional responses to hypoxia in major land plant clades. We identified induction of gene functions associated with glycolysis and fermentation as part of a conserved response across all land plant divisions. Our results indicate that ERFVIIs appeared in the last common ancestor of vascular plants with true roots, concurrently with oxygen-dependent destabilisation, to regulate hypoxia-adaptive genes. Proteins from other ERF groups have been recruited multiple times in different clades as substrates of the PCO N-degron pathway. Our results demonstrate that the response of land plants to hypoxia has been refined in derived clades through the evolution of ERFVIIs as transcriptional transducers, that occurred concomitantly with the appearance of vascular systems and roots as foraging systems through hypoxic soil.

Abstract Currently, developing materials with high power capability is crucial to the rapid deployment of electric vehicles. The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) anode material with zero strain rate upon lithium insertion and extraction. The successful implementation of this anode material depends on strategies to overcome the low electronic and ionic conductivity. In this study, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was synthesized using solid‐state approach in which different phases (anatase and rutile) of TiO 2 as precursors were used. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman analysis confirmed the formation of oxygen vacancies with the existence of Ti 3+ ions, which is believed to greatly enhance the electronic conductivity of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The electrochemical performance revealed that the rutile TiO 2 precursor concentration significantly affects the resultant Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 capacity and power capability. The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 synthesized using 80% anatase and 20% rutile TiO 2 (N2‐LTO) exhibits a specific capacity of 169, 145, 140, 133, 122, 101, and 84 mAh g −1 at 1C, 3C, 5C, 7C, 10C, 20C, and 30C. In addition, LFP||N2‐LTO pouch‐cell was fabricated which showed promising results with 95% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1C rate. The oxygen vacancies created due to the presence of Ti 3+ /Ti 4+ mixed valances and reduced particle size for faster lithium‐ion diffusion significantly enhanced the overall electrochemical performance.

Mn:CsPbX3 (X= Cl, Br) nanosheets with excellent electrocatalytic properties are reported in this paper. Compared to conventional catalyst arrays, the band gap of Mn:CsPbBr3 nanocrystalline is easily tuned, the carrier diffusion distance is remote, the band edge position of the band structure is favorable for a wide range of electrocatalytic redox reactions, and the catalytic active site is maximally exposed. The Mn:CsPbBr3 exhibited preferable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) performance in 1 mol/L KOH. The excess potential of the oxygen evolution reaction(OER) required to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm‐2 is only 114.4 and 505.4 mV, with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec‐1. At a current density of 10 mA cm‐2, the excess potential required for the HER is 158.6 mV and it exhibited excellent electrochemical stability. The Mn:CsPbBr3 nanocrystalline consists of two electrodes for the overall water splitting, requiring a voltage of only 1.45 V. Which in turn provides implications for the optimization of electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes with the aim of developing the next generation of 2D electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

Abstract Exploring excellent non‐noble bifunctional electrocatalysts for freshwater/seawater splitting at high current densities has attracted extensive interest owing to strong anodic oxidation and severe chloride corrosion challenges. Herein, hierarchical bimetal Ni‐Co metaphosphate/molybdenum oxide heterostructure nanowires (NiCoMoPO) are rationally designed and fabricated to efficiently boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline freshwater/seawater, where the favorable electronic structure from heterostructures, signified by X‐ray absorption spectra, endows NiCoMoPO with the enhanced intrinsic activity, while its hierarchical nanowire structure and heterostructures provide abundant active sites. Additionally, the PO 3 − improves the chloride‐corrosion resistance and efficiently facilitates the OER kinetics verified by theoretical and experimental studies. Therefore, NiCoMoPO drives 1000 mA cm −2 at low overpotentials of 467 and 442 mV for OER and HER in alkaline freshwater respectively, as well as a small cell voltage of 2.135 V for overall freshwater splitting with robust durability of 300 h. Impressively, due to the strong corrosion resistance, at 500 mA cm −2 of overall seawater splitting, NiCoMoPO maintains almost 2.096 V for 1200 h, indicating promising practical applications. This work sheds light on the rational design and fabrication of outstanding electrocatalysts at high current densities of seawater/freshwater splitting.

Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis, as the pivotal circle of many green energy technologies, sets off a worldwide research boom in full swing, while its large kinetic obstacles require remarkable catalysts to break through. Here, based on summarizing reaction mechanisms and in situ characterizations, the structure–activity relationships of oxygen electrocatalysts are emphatically overviewed, including the influence of geometric morphology and chemical structures on the electrocatalytic performances. Subsequently, experimental/theoretical research is combined with device applications to comprehensively summarize the cutting‐edge oxygen electrocatalysts according to various material categories. Finally, future challenges are forecasted from the perspective of catalyst development and device applications, favoring researchers to promote the industrialization of oxygen electrocatalysis at an early date.

Rechargeable Zn-air batteries with near-neutral electrolytes hold promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices, but they suffer from slow charge kinetics and remain poorly studied. Here we reveal a charge storage mechanism of near-neutral Zn-air batteries that is mediated by H2O2 formation upon cell discharge and its oxidation upon charge. The manifestation of this mechanism strongly depends on the electrolyte composition and positive electrode material, being pronounced when ZnSO4 solutions and carbon nanotubes are employed. Oxidation of dissolved H2O2 is facile, enabling oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at low potentials (~1.5 V vs. Zn2+/Zn) which, in contrast to conventional four-electron OER, does not induce corrosion of carbon electrodes. Facilitation of the H2O2-mediated pathway might therefore be helpful for developing high-performance near-neutral Zn-air batteries.

Abstract The strategic enhancement of manganese–oxygen (Mn─O) covalency is a promising approach to improve the intercalation kinetics of sodium ions (Na⁺) in manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ). In this study, an augmenting Mn─O covalency in MnO 2 by strategically incorporating cobalt at oxygen edge‐sharing Co octahedral sites is focused on. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an increased electron polarization from oxygen to manganese, surpassing that directed toward cobalt, thereby facilitating enhanced electron transfer and strengthening covalency. The synthesized Co–MnO 2 material exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance, demonstrating a superior specific capacitance of 388 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and maintaining 97.21% capacity retention after 12000 cycles. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor constructed using Co–MnO 2 achieved a high energy density of 35 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 1000 W kg −1 , underscoring the efficacy of this material in practical applications. This work highlights the critical role of transition metal–oxygen interactions in optimizing electrode materials and introduces a robust approach to enhance the functional properties of manganese oxides, thereby advancing high‐performance energy storage technologies.

Abstract Owing to sluggish reaction kinetics and high potential, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts face a trade‐off between activity and stability. Herein, an innovative topological strategy is presented for preparing 2D multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide, including ternary CoFeZn, quaternary CoFeMnZn, and high‐entropy CoFeMnCuZn. The key to the synthesis lies in using Ca‐rich brownmillerite oxide as a precursor, which possesses inherent structural flexibility enabling tailored elemental adjustments and topologically transforms from a point‐shared structure of metal‐oxygen octahedrons into an edge‐shared structure under alkaline conditions. The presence of Zn in the catalysts causes a shift in the center of the O2p band toward the Fermi level, resulting in more Co 4+ species, which drive holes into oxygen ligands to promote intramolecular oxygen coupling. The triggered lattice oxidation mechanism is identified by detecting peroxo‐like (O 2 2− ) negative species using tetramethylammonium chemical probe, along with 18 O isotope labeling experiments. As a result, the catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 267 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , ranking it among the top‐performing non‐Ni‐based catalysts. Importantly, the catalysts also show high Fe‐leaching resistance during OER compared to conventional NiFe and CoFe hydroxides/(oxy)hydroxides. The assembled zinc‐air battery enables stable operation for over 225 h at a low charging voltage of 1.93 V.

Abstract NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are state‐of‐the‐art catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, yet they still face significant overpotentials. Here, quantitative boron (B) doping is introduced in NiFe LDHs (ranging from 0% to 20.3%) to effectively tailor the Ni‐Fe‐B electronic interactions for enhanced OER performance. The co‐hydrolysis synthesis approach synchronizes the hydrolysis rates of Ni and Fe precursors with the formation rate of B─O─M (M: Ni, Fe) bonds, ensuring precise B doping into the NiFe LDHs. It is demonstrated that B, as an electron‐deficient element, acts as an “electron sink” at doping levels from 0% to 13.5%, facilitating the transition of Ni 2+ to the active Ni 3+δ , thereby accelerating OER kinetics. However, excessive B doping (13.5–20.3%) effectively generates oxygen vacancies in the LDHs, which increases electron density at Ni 2+ sites and hinders their transition to Ni 3+δ , thereby reducing OER activity. Optimal OER performance is achieved at a B doping level of 13.5%, with an overpotential of only 208 mV to reach a current density of 500 mA cm −2 , placing it among the most effective OER catalysts to date. This Ni‐Fe‐B electronic engineering opens new avenues for developing highly efficient anode catalysts for water‐splitting hydrogen production.

Abstract Photo‐assisted electrocatalysis has arisen as a promising approach for hydrogen generation by incorporating photocatalysts into electrocatalysts. 2D SnS 2 is a photocatalyst that absorbs visible light. However, the rapid recombination of photo‐generated electron‐hole pairs significantly reduces the overall photocatalytic efficiency of SnS 2 , limiting its practical application. Thus, this study prepares an in situ heterojunction SnS 2 @SnO 2 using a one‐step hydrothermal method. The degradation efficiency of methyl orange (MO) using SnS 2 @SnO 2 is measured, achieving a degradation rate of 92.75% within 1 h, which is 1.9 times higher than that of pure SnS 2 . Additionally, FeNiS/SnS 2 @SnO 2 is synthesized and exhibited significant improvements in the photo‐assisted oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It achieves an overpotential of 260 mV and a Tafel slope of 65.1 mV dec −1 at 10 mA cm −2 , showing reductions of 11.8% and 31.8%, respectively, compared to FeNiS alone. These enhancements highlight the strong photo‐response capability of SnS 2 @SnO 2 . Under the internal electric field of SnS 2 @SnO 2 , the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of SnS 2 quickly move toward SnO 2 , facilitating efficient photocatalytic reactions. FeNiS, with a lower Fermi energy level (E F ), facilitates electron transfer from SnS 2 @SnO 2 and enhances OER performance by efficiently participating in the reaction. This study paves a new path for 2D photocatalyst materials.

Abstract Active and robust electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are of crucial importance for efficient proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEM‐WE). Ruthenium (Ru) oxide has attracted considerable attention due to its high activity. However, the unsatisfying stability of Ru oxide in acidic OER environments hinders the application. Here, Ce‐doped RuO 2 nanoparticles are designed and supported on Co─N─C material (Ce@RuO 2 /CoNC) for acidic OER. It is demonstrated that Ce@RuO 2 /CoNC delivers a super low overpotential of 150 mV and an excellent stability of 1000 h at 10 mA cm −2 , outperforming most previously reported Ru‐based catalysts. The mass activity is estimated as 2365.5 Ag Ru −1 at 1.5 V (vs RHE), representing ≈2× advance compared to the best prior study. Furthermore, applied in a single‐cell PEM‐WE device, it can steadily operate for 1000 h at 200 mA cm −2 . The studies show that Ce‐doping and Co─N─C support synergistically enhance the activity and stability of Ru oxide by optimizing the free energies of OER intermediates and suppressing the dissolution of Ru.

Nickel-based oxyhydroxides have emerged as promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) among Earth-abundant metals. While the incorporation of foreign elements is recognized to enhance catalytic activity, the origin of this enhancement is still debated. We synthesize and examine Ni hydroxide nanosheets, both with and without Cr doping, to elucidate the underlying enhancements. Operando UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy are employed to unravel the behavior of the catalysts. The Cr doping facilitates the oxidation of Ni, resulting in the generation of active oxygen species. The enriched active oxygen species improves OER performance through a lattice oxygen-mediated pathway in Fe-free KOH, and further contribute to the creation and increased activity of FeO

High-/medium-entropy materials have been explored as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art materials face the dilemma of explaining the enhancement mechanism, which is now limited to theoretical models or an unclear cocktail effect. Herein, a medium-entropy NiCoFeMnP with an advanced hierarchical particle-nanosheet-tumbleweed nanostructure has been synthesized via simple precursor preparation and subsequent phosphorization. Evaluated as the electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the medium-entropy NiCoFeMnP displays a lower overpotential of 272 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm

High‐entropy oxides (HEOs), similar to high‐entropy materials (HEMs), have "four‐core effects", i.e., high‐entropy effect, delayed diffusion effect, lattice distortion effect and cocktail effect, which have attracted more and more attention in the scientific field of renewable energy technology due to their unique structural characteristics, variable chemical composition and corresponding functional properties. HEOs have become potential candidates for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a key half reaction for electrolytic CO2, nitrogen reduction, and water electrolysis. However, the precise synthesis of HEOs with a wide range of components and structures is challenging, not to mention their active and stable operation for OER. In this paper, we review the recent advancements in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution facilitated by HEOs in water electrolysis. We analyze these developments from the perspectives of activity and stability in acid and alkaline conditions, respectively. Furthermore, we summarize the design from the aspect of element composition, structure, morphology, and catalyst‐support interactions, along with related reaction mechanism of HEOs. Additionally, we discuss the current challenges faced by HEOs in the field of OER and suggest potential directions for the future development of HEOs beyond water electrolysis application.

Abstract Developing low‐cost and exceedingly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is vital for application of hydrogen production from water splitting. Herein, three different nickel sulfides on nickel foam were fabricated via a simple sulfuring the as‐formed Ni‐MOF with different sulfide as the sulfur source. The effect of sulfur source on OER performance, morphology and structure of the as‐prepared product are well discussed. The optimized Ni‐MOF/NF‐SS deliver overpotentials of 253 and 330 mV to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm −2 with a small Tafel slope of 70.9 mVdec −1 , and stability of over 50 h. This work provides insights into the relationship between the OER activity and the structures of nickel sulfides, but also affords a new route to fabricate nickel sulfides‐based electrocatalysts for OER.

Abstract The development of low‐cost, readily scalable catalytic systems for green hydrogen production is crucial for diverse research and industrial applications. This work demonstrates the facile coupling of carbon/NiFe‐layered double hydroxide (LDH) onto flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates deposited by blade coating and spray coating techniques. These low‐temperature solution processes enable high‐throughput electrode fabrication. The resulting carbon electrode exhibits sheet resistance of 25 Ω sq −1 , comparable to other state‐of‐the‐art works, and displays excellent adhesion to the substrate and catalyst layer, thereby ensuring system stability. Remarkably, the developed electrode exhibits high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving an overpotential of 215.9 and 267.4 mV at 10 mA cm − 2 in rigid and flexible substrates respectively, and maintaining its performance even at 10 mA cm − 2 for 24 h. This work highlights the potential of this methodology for producing readily transportable, flexible electrocatalytic systems with exceptional performance and minimal surface treatment of the substrate. Additionally, the use of low‐cost, readily recyclable PET plastic aligns with the principles of circular economy, promoting the integration of this platform into both research and industrial environments.

A mixed-metal ternary chalcogenide, cobalt molybdenum telluride (CMT), has been identified as an efficient tri-functional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting, leading to enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CMT was synthesized by a single step hydrothermal technique. Detailed electrochemical studies of the CMT-modified electrodes showed that CMT has a promising performance for OER in the simulated seawater solutions, exhibiting a small overpotential of 385 mV at 20 mA cm−2, and superior catalyst durability for prolonged period of continuous oxygen evolution. Interestingly, while gas chromatography analysis confirmed the evolution of oxygen in an anodic chamber, it showed that there was no chlorine evolution from these electrodes in alkaline seawater, highlighting the novelty of this catalyst. CMT also displayed remarkable ORR activity in simulated seawater as indicated by its four-electron reduction pathway forming water as the dominant product. One of the primary challenges of seawater splitting is chlorine evolution from the oxidation of dissolved chloride salts. The CMT catalyst successfully and significantly lowers the water oxidation potential, thereby separating the chloride and water oxidation potentials by a larger margin. These results suggest that CMT can function as a highly active tri-functional electrocatalyst with significant stability, making it suitable for clean energy generation and environmental applications using seawater.

Abstract The fascinating properties and versatile nature of 2D MXenes have generated significant interest in the scientific community. This has led to extensive research on expanding these materials into 1D and 0D forms. This review investigates the synthesis, properties, and applications of 1D MXenes, elucidating their potential across various fields. 1D MXenes, including nanowires, nanoribbons, nanorods, and nanotubes, inherit the remarkable properties of their 2D counterparts while also exhibiting unique anisotropic characteristics that enhance their performance in various applications. The review explores various methods for synthesizing 1D MXenes and examines their structural, electronic, and optical properties. The transition from 2D to 1D results in MXenes that offer superior properties, which are advantageous for various next‐generation systems. The increased aspect ratio and surface area of 1D MXenes broaden their usage in energy storage, photothermal therapy, oxygen evolution reactions (OER), hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), microwave absorption, filtration membranes, gas sensors, metal detection, etc. The review also addresses the challenges associated with 1D MXenes, such as limited synthesis methods, scalable production, size customization, preservation of structural integrity, and stability. Furthermore, potential opportunities and future directions in the field of 1D MXenes have also been proposed.

Oxygen electrocatalysts play a key role in renewable and fossil‐free energy production. Bifunctional catalysts active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) allow use of the same material system for both energy production (ORR) and fuel generation (OER). However, optimizing the performance of bifunctional catalysts requires in depth understanding of the catalyst structure, its surface chemistry in terms of active sites and the underlying catalytic mechanism. Here, the catalytic performance of CoCrFeNi thin films is investigated, synthesized using high‐power impulse magnetron sputtering, as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. The film crystal structure and morphology, and thereby the catalytic performance, can be tuned by the ion acceleration (bias) to the substrate. To further enhance the catalytic activity, anodization is used to electrochemically modify the films, forming a thicker oxide layer enriched in Co and Ni cations which significantly improves the ORR performance. Anodization improves the catalyst stability during OER, with an OER potential of 1.45 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm −2 for more than 24 h. While the corrosion resistance is high both before and after anodization, in terms of catalytic activity the anodized films outperformed the as‐deposited ones. This makes anodized films excellent electrocatalyst candidates in corrosive alkaline environments such as fuel cells and electrolyzers.

Abstract Alkaline water electrolysis at high temperatures can rival acidic proton-exchange membranes.&#xD;However, they suffer from increased energy consumption, reduced lifespan of materials and heightened safety risks. Magnetic hyperthermia is a method of localizing intense heating in the presence of an external high-frequency alternating magnetic field. In this study, we developed a custom electromagnetic induction device capable of generating a small magnetic field of about 2 µT. High-permeability nickel foam is used as electrodes. Results show that the iron coated nickel foam decreases the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction by ~150 mV and 60 mV, respectively, at 20 mAcm−2 when subjected to magnetic heating in a high-frequency alternating magnetic field. The overall water splitting current of Ni foam/Fe increases 540% under intermittent induction. The enhanced stability of Ni foam/Fe is attributed to the high binding energy of metal-O on the surface. The density function theory calculations further indicates that the lattice expansion of the metal electrode under induction heating optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H*, thereby enhancing the HER performance.&#xD;

Efficient water electrolysis for green hydrogen production relies on the development of robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, particularly for acidic environments. This study introduces amorphous/crystalline Mn‐Ru binary oxides nanoflowers (a/c‐Mn0.9Ru0.1O2) as a promising acidic OER catalyst, synthesized via a two‐step phase engineering approach. The optimized a/c‐ Mn0.9Ru0.1O2‐200 composition exhibits exceptional OER activity, requiring a low overpotential of 168 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and demonstrating remarkable stability over 28 hours. This significantly outperforms commercial RuO2 catalysts, which require an overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and exhibit a stability of only 0.5 h under identical conditions. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis results reveals the formation of Mn‐O‐Ru linkages and an optimized d‐band electronic structure, attributed to strong electronic coupling at the amorphous/crystalline interface. This unique architecture promotes optimal adsorption/desorption of OER intermediates, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This study offers a novel strategy for the rational design and production of efficient acidic OER catalysts.

Self‐repairing catalysts are useful for achieving alkaline water electrolyzers with long lifetimes under intermittent operation. However, rational methodologies for designing self‐repairing catalysts have not yet been established. Herein, hybrid cobalt hydroxide nanosheets (Co‐ns), with a high deposition (repairing) rate, and β‐FeOOH nanorods (Fe‐nr), with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) ability, are electrostatically self‐assembled into composite catalysts. This strategy is developed to integrate multifunctionality in self‐repairing catalysts. Positively charged Co‐ns and negatively charged Fe‐nr form uniform composites when dispersed in an electrolyte. These composites are electrochemically deposited on a nickel electrode by electrolysis at 800 mA cm −2 . Co‐ns form a conductive mesoporous assembly of CoOOH nanosheets as a support. Fe‐nr are then distributed on the CoOOH nanosheets as active sites for the OER. Because of the high deposition rate of Co‐ns, the amount of Fe‐nr deposited increases 22 times compared to when Fe‐nr is deposited alone, and the OER current density increases 14 times compared to that of Co‐ns alone. The composite self‐repair catalyst shows the highest activity and durability under an accelerated durability test (ADT), and its degradation rate decreases from 84 μV cycle −1 (Fe‐nr only) to 60 μV cycle −1 (composite catalyst) under ADT conditions without repair.

Abstract This study investigated the treatment of petroleum-contaminated water from the crude oil storage tank by employing sequential coupling electrocoagulation and electrochemical oxidation using Fe and Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes as the sacrificial and oxidation anodes respectively. Although the Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode is commonly used, its short lifetime disadvantages have limited its performance in industrial applications. A long-standing (highly stable) Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode with high electro-oxidation capability was fabricated by applying an electrodeposited-annealed Sb-SnO2 interlayer between the Ti substrate and the Top Sb-SnO2 coating. Physical characterization results, including Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), revealed the presence of SnO2 and Sb in the anode composition. The surface appeared flat with a uniform spherical shape, averaging about 13–22 nm in size. The 2 V oxygen evolution overpotential and the accelerated lifetimes of 11 hours demonstrated that using the electro-deposited interlayer improved the electrocatalytic performance and stability of the electrode for electro-oxidation applications. The highest COD removal of the mentioned wastewater was optimized using the RSM methodology for EC and EO, respectively. The integrated EC-EO process achieved a maximum COD reduction efficiency of 96.5% at a current density of 20 mA/cm2, with electrodes placed 2.5 cm apart in a neutral pH environment for 120 minutes.

Processes determining the amount and spatial distribution of dissolved oxygen in the ocean have been a focus of intense research over the last two decades. Anomalies known as Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) have been attracting growing attention, in particular because their growth is believed to be a result of the global environmental change. Comprehensive understanding of factors contributing to and/or controlling the emergence and evolution of OMZs is still lacking though. OMZs are usually thought to result from an interplay between the oxygen transport through the water column from the ocean surface and variable oxygen solubility at different water temperature. In this paper, we suggest a different, novel mechanism of the OMZ formation relating it to the oxygen production in phytoplankton photosynthesis in a stratified ocean. We consider a simple, conceptual model of the coupled phytoplankton-oxygen dynamics and show that the model predictions are in qualitative agreement with some relevant field observations.

Abstract &#xD;Objective: This work aims to investigate the iso-effectiveness of conventional and FLASH radiotherapy on tumors through in-silico mathematical models. We focused on the role of radiolytic oxygen depletion (ROD), which has been argued as a possible factor to explain the FLASH effect.&#xD;&#xD;Approach: We used a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model, including ROD, to simulate tumor oxygenation and response. From those oxygen distributions we obtained surviving fractions (SFs) using the linear-quadratic (LQ) model with the oxygen enhancement ratios (OER). We then employed the calculated SFs to describe the evolution of preclinical tumor volumes through a mathematical model of tumor response, and we also extrapolated those results to calculate tumor control probabilities (TCPs) using the Poisson-LQ approach.&#xD;&#xD;Main results: Our study suggests that the ROD effect may cause differences in SF between FLASH and conventional radiotherapy, especially in low α/β and poorly oxygenated cells. However, a statistical analysis showed that these changes in SF generally do not result in significant differences in the evolution of preclinical tumor growth curves when the sample size is small, because such differences in SF may not be noticeable in the heterogeneity of the population of animals}. Nonetheless, when extrapolating this effect to TCP curves, we observed important differences between both techniques (TCP is lower in FLASH radiotherapy). When analyzing the response of tumors with heterogeneous oxygenations, differences in TCP are more important for well oxygenated tumors. This apparent contradiction with the results obtained for homogeneously oxygenated cells is explained by the complex interplay between the heterogeneity of tumor oxygenation, the OER effect, and the ROD effect.&#xD;&#xD;Significance: This study supports the experimentally observed iso-effectiveness of FLASH and conventional radiotherapy when analyzing the volume evolution of preclinical tumors (that are far from control). However, this study also hints that tumor growth curves may be less sensitive to small variations in SF than tumor control probability: ROD may lead to increased SF in FLASH radiotherapy, which while not large enough to cause significant differences in tumor growth curves, could lead to important differences in clinical TCPs. Nonetheless, it cannot be discarded that other effects not modeled in this work, like radiation-induced immune effects, can contribute to tumor control and maintain the iso-effectiveness of FLASH radiotherapy. The study of tumor growth curves may not be the ideal experiment to test the iso-effectiveness of FLASH, and experiments reporting TCP or D50 may be preferred.

Gaseous oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) are crucial precursors of atmospheric organic aerosols. OOMs in urban atmospheres have complex compositions, posing challenges to understanding their formation, evolution, and influences. In this study, we identify 2403 atmospheric gaseous OOMs in urban Beijing using online nitrate-based chemical ionization Orbitrap mass spectrometry based on one-year atmospheric measurements. We find that OOMs in urban atmospheres can be identified with higher accuracy and wider coverage, compared to previously used online mass spectrometry. With optimized OOM resolving capabilities, previous knowledge of OOMs in urban atmospheres can be expanded. First, clear homologous and oxygen-addition characteristics of the OOMs are revealed. Second, OOMs with lower concentrations or higher masses are identified and characterized with high confidence, e.g., OOMs with masses above 350 Da. In particular, dimers of OOMs (e.g., C

Abstract. The global spread of lake hypoxia, [O2] < 2 mg L−1, during the last 2 centuries has had a severe impact on ecological systems and sedimentation processes. While the occurrence of hypoxia was observed in many lakes, a detailed quantification of hypoxia spread at centennial timescales remained largely unquantified. We track the evolution of hypoxia and its controls during the past 200 years in a lake, Tiefer See (TSK; NE Germany), using 17 gravity cores recovered from between 10 and 62 m water depth in combination with lake monitoring data. Lake hypoxia was associated with the onset of varve preservation in the TSK and has been dated by varve counting to 1918 ± 1 at 62 m water depth and reached a lake floor depth of 16 m in 1997 ± 1. This indicates that oxygen concentration fell below the threshold for varve preservation at the lake floor (> 16 m). Sediment cores at 10–12 m depth do not contain varves indicating good oxygenation of the upper-water column. Monitoring data show that the threshold for hypoxia, and the intensity and duration of hypoxia which are sufficient for varve preservation, is a period of 5 months of [O2] < 5 mg L−1 and 2 months of [O2] < 2 mg L−1. Detailed total organic carbon (TOC), δ13Corg, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning analyses of the short cores indicate that the decline in dissolved oxygen (DO) started several decades prior to the varve preservation. This proves a change in the depositional conditions in the lake, following a transition phase of several decades during which varves were not preserved. Furthermore, varve preservation does occur at seasonal stratification and does not necessarily require permanent stratification.

Accurate atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of planet hosts play a major role in characterising exoplanets and understanding their formation and evolution. Our objective is to uniformly determine atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen(O), and the alpha -elements, magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si), along with C/O, N/O and Mg/Si abundance ratios for planet-hosting stars. In this analysis, we aim to investigate the potential links between stellar chemistry and the presence of planets. e tai Observatory telescope. The determination of stellar parameters was based on a standard analysis using equivalent widths and one-dimensional, plane-parallel model atmospheres calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium. The differential synthetic spectrum method was used to uniformly determine the carbon C(C2), nitrogen N(CN), oxygen O I magnesium Mg I, and silicon Si I elemental abundances as well as the C/O, N/O, and Mg/Si ratios. We analysed elemental abundances and ratios in dwarf and giant stars, finding that C/Fe O/Fe and Mg/Fe are lower in metal-rich dwarf hosts; whereas N/Fe is close to the Solar ratio. Giants show smaller scatter in C/Fe and O/Fe and lower than the Solar average C/Fe and C/O ratios. The (C+N+O) abundances increase with Fe/H in giant stars, with a minimal scatter. We also noted an overabundance of Mg and Si in planet-hosting stars, particularly at lower metallicities, and a lower Mg/Si ratio in stars with planets. In giants hosting high-mass planets, nitrogen shows a moderate positive relationship with planet mass. C/O and N/O ratios show moderate negative and positive slopes in giant stars, respectively. The Mg/Si ratio shows a negative correlation with planet mass across the entire stellar sample.

Electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies play a crucial role in ensuring a sustainable energy future. In these regards, nanostructured carbon-based materials (NCMs) are very critical in the development of novel energy technologies and devices. NCMs include CNTs, graphene, fullerene, and ordered mesoporous carbon materials, which exist in different morphologies. NCMs offer great opportunities for effective modifications through surface functionalization, doping with heteroatoms, and fabrication of composites with organic or inorganic species. Particularly, the composites of NCMs with inorganic materials such as metallic NPs, metal oxide NPs, and their other derivatives (MNPs) have gained considerable recognition in electrochemical energy applications. These materials demonstrate distinct properties, including excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, large surface area, and chemical stability. Herein, we have highlighted some of the trends and outlooks in this exciting area, including fundamentals of these substances according to material science perspective. Besides, the latest research and development of multifunctional MNPs@NCMs composites for electrochemical energy applications have also been illustrated. Particularly, the utilization of these composites from the perspective of different electrochemical energy applications has been summarized, such as energy conversion processes like hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors.

Oxygen deprivation or hypoxia is poorly dealt with by most terrestrial species and often leads to permanent tissue damage and death. One prominent exception is the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) which is remarkably adapted to withstand prolonged periods (~18 mins) of severe hypoxia, a trait likely driven by its crowded underground lifestyle. Other African mole-rat species are less social or entirely solitary like the Cape mole-rat (Georychus capensis). Here, we asked whether cellular and molecular adaptations to hypoxia map to social traits. We discovered that at the cellular level naked mole-rat fibroblasts survive >30 hours in 1% oxygen, while fibroblasts from terrestrial or non-social mole-rat species (human, mouse and Cape mole-rat) die rapidly under hypoxic conditions. We further show that naked mole-rat mitochondria have evolved morphological, functional and proteomic adaptations crucial for hypoxia resistance, remaining unaffected after long periods of severe hypoxia. We identify the mitochondrial protein Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) as a key player in naked mole-rat hypoxia resilience. Naked mole-rat mitochondria not only express more protective forms of OPA1, but also harbor a structurally unique isoform that likely protects cells from hypoxic damage. We show that evolutionary changes including the functionalization of a unique Opa1 exon support mitochondrial mediated cellular protection. Indeed, knockdown of OPA1 in naked mole-rat cells is sufficient to render them equally susceptible to hypoxia as human cells or cells from non-social African species. Our study demonstrates how molecular evolution drives unique adaptations that enable cells to achieve unprecedented resistance to hypoxic damage. We also show that molecular changes at the level of mitochondria are crucial in conferring hypoxia resistance. Our results thus chart a novel molecular path to understand how robust cellular hypoxia resistance can be achieved. Such knowledge may eventually inspire novel strategies to circumvent the consequences of hypoxic-damage in humans.

The early evolution of eukaryotes and their adaptations to low-oxygen environments are fascinating open questions in biology. Genome-scale data from novel eukaryotes, and particularly from free-living lineages, are key to answering these questions. The Parabasalia are an ancient lineage of anaerobes, and the most speciose lineage of Metamonada, a major lineage of eukaryotes. The most well-studied metamonads are parasitic parabasalids including Trichomonas vaginalis, Tritrichomonas foetus, and Giardia intestinalis, but very little genome-scale data is available for free-living members of the group. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome of Pseudotrichomonas keilini, a free-living parabasalian. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that P. keilini possesses a metabolism and gene complement that are in many respects similar to its parasitic relative Trichomonas vaginalis, and that in the time since their most recent common ancestor, it is the Trichomonas vaginalis lineage that has experienced more genomic change, likely due to the transition to a parasitic lifestyle. Features shared between P. keilini and Trichomonas vaginalis include a hydrogenosome (anaerobic mitochondrial homologue) that we predict to function much as in Trichomonas vaginalis, and a complete glycolytic pathway that is likely to represent one of the primary means by which P. keilini obtains ATP. Phylogenomic analysis indicates that P. keilini branches within a clade of endobiotic parabasalids, consistent with the hypothesis that different parabasalid lineages evolved towards parasitic or free-living lifestyles from an endobiotic, anaerobic or microaerophilic common ancestor.

Globular clusters (GCs) are sites of extremely efficient star formation, and recent studies suggest they significantly contributed to the early Milky Way's stellar mass build-up. Although their role has since diminished, GCs' impact on the Galaxy's initial evolution can be traced today by identifying their most chemically unique stars--those with anomalous nitrogen and aluminum overabundances and oxygen depletion. While they are a perfect tracer of clusters, be it intact or fully dissolved, these high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] GC-origin stars are extremely rare within the current Galaxy. To address the scarcity of these unusual, precious former GC members, we train a neural network (NN) to identify high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] stars using low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra. Our NN achieves a classification accuracy of approximately $\approx99\%$ and a false positive rate of around $\approx7\%$, identifying 878 new candidates in the Galactic field. We validate our results with several physically-motivated sanity checks, showing, for example, that the incidence of selected stars in Galactic GCs is significantly higher than in the field. Moreover, we find that most of our GC-origin candidates reside in the inner Galaxy, having likely formed in the proto-Milky Way, consistent with previous research. The fraction of GC candidates in the field drops at a metallicity of [Fe/H]$\approx-1$, approximately coinciding with the completion of spin-up, i.e. the formation of the Galactic stellar disk.

Abstract This study aims to investigate the response mechanisms of groundwater microbial‐toxicological indicators, specifically total bacteria count (TBC) and total coliform count (TCC), to water quality indicators and environmental conditions. Using data from a water source in the western plateau of China, a predictive model focusing on TBC and TCC was developed. An orthogonal experimental design was employed to manipulate environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and porosity, facilitating laboratory experiments. These experiments measured pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), TBC, and TCC at varying depths and environmental conditions. Principal component analysis elucidated the mechanisms by which water quality indicators and environmental conditions affect groundwater microbial–toxicological indicators. A prediction model for these indicators in plateau regions was established based on a backpropagation neural network (BP‐NN), using TBC and TCC as target variables and the newly extracted principal components as influencing factors. The results demonstrate that environmental conditions and water quality indicators primarily influence the evolution of groundwater microbial–toxicological indicators by altering the ionic charge quantities, redox conditions, and temperature of the groundwater. The predictive model for groundwater microbial–toxicological indicators shows trends consistent with experimental outcomes, with an average relative error of less than 15%, meeting engineering requirements. Practitioner points The values of total bacteria count (TBC) and total coliform count (TCC) under different conditions were obtained by column experiments. The influence mechanism of environmental conditions and groundwater indicators on TBC and TCC was elaborated by principal component analysis. TBC and TCC prediction models were established through the investigation of water sources in a plateau area and laboratory experiments.

Abstract Context The field of chemistry has significantly evolved, with catalysis playing a crucial role in transforming chemical processes. From Valerius’ use of sulfuric acid in the sixteenth century to modern advancements, catalysis has driven innovations across various industries. The introduction of gold as a catalyst marked a pivotal shift, expanding its applications beyond ornamentation to homogeneous catalysis. Gold’s unique properties, such as its electrophilic nature and flexibility, have enabled its use in synthesizing complex molecules, including those in nanomedicine and sustainable chemical processes. The development of gold-based complexes, particularly in hydroalkoxylation and hydroamination reactions, showcases their efficiency in forming carbon–oxygen bonds under mild conditions. Recent studies on dual gold catalysis and heterobimetallic complexes further highlight gold’s versatility in achieving high turnover rates and selectivity. This evolution underscores the potential of gold catalysis in advancing environmentally sustainable methodologies and enhancing the scope of modern synthetic chemistry. The debate about the nature of monogold and dual-gold catalysis is open. Methods DFT calculations have played a key role in promoting the activation of alkynes, in particular the hydrophenoxylation of alkynes by metal-based catalysts. They not only help identify the most efficient and selective catalysts but also aid in screening for those capable of performing a dual metal catalytic mechanism. The most commonly used functionals are BP86 and B3LYP, with the SVP and 6-31G(d) basis sets employed for geometry optimizations, and M06 with TZVP or 6-311G(d,p) basis sets used for single-point energy calculations in a solvent. Grimme dispersion correction has been explicitly added either in the solvent single point energy calculations or in the gas phase geometry optimizations or in both. To point out that M06 implicitly includes part of this dispersion scheme.

Abstract We explore the relations between the gas-phase metallicity radial profiles (few hundred inner parsec) and multiple galaxy properties for 15 Seyfert galaxies from the AGNIFS (Active Galactic Nuclei Integral Field Spectroscopy) sample using optical Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations from Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) processed archival data. The data were selected at z ≲ 0.013 within black hole mass range [6 &lt; log (MBH/M⊙) &lt; 9] with moderate 14–150 keV X-ray luminosities $\left[42\, \lesssim \, \log L_X (\rm erg\, s^{-1})\, \lesssim \, 44\right]$. We estimated the gas-phase metallicity using the strong-line methods and found mean values for the oxygen dependent (Z ∼ 0.75 Z⊙) and nitrogen dependent (Z ∼ 1.14 Z⊙) calibrations. These estimates show excellent agreement with ΔZ ≈ 0.19 dex and ΔZ ≈ 0.18 dex between the mean values from the two strong-line calibrations for GMOS and MUSE respectively, consistent with the order of metallicity uncertainty via the strong-line methods. We contend that our findings align with a scenario wherein local Seyferts have undergone seamless gas accretion histories, resulting in positive metallicity profile over an extended period of time, thereby providing insights into galaxy evolution and the chemical enrichment or depletion of the universe. Additionally, we argue that metal-poor gas inflow from the local interstellar medium (ISM) and accreted through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) onto the galaxy systems regulates the star formation processes by diluting their central metallicity and inverting their metallicity gradients, producing a more prominent anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and Eddington ratio.

Strong emission from doubly ionized oxygen is a beacon for some of the most intensely star forming galaxies known. JWST enables the search for this beacon in the early universe with unprecedented sensitivity. In this work, we extend the study of faint [OIII]$_{5008}$ selected galaxies by an order of magnitude in line luminosity. We use publicly available UNCOVER DR1 JWST/NIRCam and HST imaging data of the cluster lensing field, Abell 2744, to identify strong (rest-frame EW$>500$\AA) [OIII]$_{5008}$ emitters at $z\sim7$ based on excess F410M flux. We find $N=68$ $z\sim7$ [OIII] candidates, with a subset of $N=33$ that have deep HST coverage required to rule-out lower redshift interlopers (13.68 arcmin$^2$ with F814W $5\sigma$ depth $>28$ AB). Such strong emission lines can lead to very red colors that could be misinterpreted as evidence for old, massive stellar populations, but are shown to be due to emission lines where we have spectra. Using this deep HST sample and completeness simulations, which calculate the effective survey volume of the UNCOVER lensing field as a function of [OIII] luminosity, we derive a new [OIII] luminosity function (LF) extending to $41.09<\rm{log}_{10}(L/\rm{erg\,s}^{-1})<42.35$ which is an order of magnitude deeper than previous $z\sim6$ [OIII] LFs based on JWST slitless spectroscopy. This LF is well fit by a power law with a faint-end slope of $\alpha=-2.07^{+0.22}_{-0.23}$. There is little or no evolution between this LF and published [OIII] LFs at redshifts $3\lesssim z\lesssim7$, and no evidence of a turnover at faint luminosities. The sizes of these extreme [OIII] emitters are broadly similar to their low redshift counterparts, the green peas. The luminosity function of [OIII] emitters matches that of Lyman-$\alpha$ at the bright end, suggesting that many of them should be Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters.
