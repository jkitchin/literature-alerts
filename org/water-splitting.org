Abstract The development of non‐precious metal‐based electrodes that actively and stably support the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis systems remains a challenge, especially at low pH levels. The recently published study has conclusively shown that the addition of haematite to H 2 SO 4 is a highly effective method of significantly reducing oxygen evolution overpotential and extending anode life. The far superior result is achieved by concentrating oxygen evolution centres on the oxide particles rather than on the electrode. However, unsatisfactory Faradaic efficiencies of the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) parts as well as the required high haematite load impede applicability and upscaling of this process. Here it is shown that the same performance is achieved with three times less metal oxide powder if NiO/H 2 SO 4 suspensions are used along with stainless steel anodes. The reason for the enormous improvement in OER performance by adding NiO to the electrolyte is the weakening of the intramolecular O─H bond in the water molecules, which is under the direct influence of the nickel oxide suspended in the electrolyte. The manipulation of bonds in water molecules to increase the tendency of the water to split is a ground‐breaking development, as shown in this first example.

Abstract Metal‐doped ruthenium oxides with low prices have gained widespread attention due to their editable compositions, distorted structures, and diverse morphologies for electrocatalysis. However, the mainstream challenge lies in breaking the so‐called seesaw relationship between activity and stability during acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, strain wave‐featured Mn‐RuO 2 nanowires (NWs) with asymmetric Ru‐O‐Mn bonds are first fabricated by thermally driven rapid solid phase conversion from RuMn alloy nanoparticles (NPs) at moderate temperature (450 °C). In 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 , the resultant NWs display a surprisingly ultralow overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA cm –2 and run at a stable cell voltage (1.67 V) for 150 h at 50 mA cm –2 in PEMWE, far exceeding IrO 2 ||Pt/C assemble. The simultaneous enhancement of both activity and stability stems from the presence of dense strain waves composed of alternating compressive and tensile ones in the distorted NWs, which collaboratively activate the Ru‐O‐Mn sites for faster OER. More importantly, the atomic strain waves trigger dynamic Ru‐O‐Mn regeneration via the refilling of oxygen vacancies by oxyanions adsorbed on adjacent Mn and Ru sites, achieving long‐term stability. This work opens a door to designing non‐precious metal‐assisted ruthenium oxides with unique strains for practical application in commercial PEMWE.

Rationalizing the development of highly active, non-precious electrocatalysts through facile and cost-effective synthesis methods for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a paramount research objective. In this study, we introduce an innovative molten salt approach to fabricate an arrayed nanorod architecture supported on a cobalt foam substrate denoted as Ce doped cobalt hydroxyl nitrate (Ce-CoNH). Cerium (Ce) is strategically employed to induce oxygen vacancies and effect localized electronic structure modifications of the cobalt (Co) sites. In comparison to individual CoNH catalysts, Ce-CoNH exhibits exceptional catalytic activity in alkaline water oxidation, achieving a notably low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. Notably, the Ce-CoNH catalyst also demonstrates remarkable durability, sustaining a current density of 100 mA cm−2 for an impressive duration of 50 h, surpassing the performance of Ce-free CoNH samples, which can be attributed to the flexible influence of Ce doping and the robust nanorod structure. Collectively, our study underscores the viability of molten salt-synthesized heteroatom substitution, accompanied by the introduction of defect-rich structures, as an effective strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts tailored for water electrolysis applications.

The three primary reactions in metal-air batteries and electrochemical hydrolysis are the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Therefore, it is crucial to develop efficient low-cost trifunctional catalysts. In this study, we design a self-supported electrocatalyst with hierarchical nanostructure, in which the bamboo-like nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) encapsulated CoFe nanoparticles (CoFe NPs) in-situ anchored on nanoflower like CoFe2O4 via chemical vapor deposition. Strikingly, the resulting catalysts CoFe@NC/CoFe2O4/IF demonstrate exciting trifunctional catalytic performance, overpotential of 66 mV and 185 mV for HER and OER at current densities of 10 mA cm−2, and a half-wave potential of 0.852 V for ORR, respectively. In addition, the maximum power density of the Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) assembled with CoFe@NC/CoFe2O4/IF as the cathode electrode is 134.5 mW cm−2; and the overall water splitting requires only a voltage of 1.50 V at a decomposition current density at 10 mA cm−2. This method provides a new strategy for trifunctional electrocatalysts and offers a promising approach for self-driven water electrolysis devices.

Catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs) relies fundamentally on the electronic nature and local coordination environment of the active site. Here, based on a machine-learning (ML)-aided density functional theory (DFT) method, we reveal that the intrinsic dipole in Janus materials has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of SACs, using 2D γ-phosphorus carbide (γ-PC) as a model system. Specifically, a local dipole around the active site is a key degree to tune the catalytic activity and can be used as an important descriptor with a high feature importance of 17.1% in predicting the difference of adsorption free energy (ΔGO* – ΔGOH*) to assess the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, the catalytic performance of SACs can be tuned by an intrinsic dipole, in stark contrast to those external stimuli strategies previously used. These results suggest that dipole engineering and the revolutionary DFT-ML hybrid scheme are novel approaches for designing high-performance catalysts.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water fuels the planet through photosynthesis and is a primary means for hydrogen storage in energy technologies. Yet the detection of intermediates of OER central to the catalytic mechanism has been an ongoing challenge. This review covers the relevance of ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of the electrochemical transformations of a metal-oxide surface undergoing OER. The electron doped SrTiO3/electrolyte is the system under review because of its high photocurrent efficiency with an ultrafast light trigger and because it allowed for detection of intermediate forms across the electromagnetic spectrum. The first part covers how the efficient catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the Schottky diode, the depletion layer, and Helmholtz layer under operating conditions to the extent possible. The second part covers the detection of the surface bound intermediates by transient spectroscopy. These target ultrafast (ps-ns) electron transfer from (or hole-trapping to) bound surface water species that are associated with the reactive oxygen intermediates of OER (e.g. OH*, O*). Their detection via a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and coherent acoustic waves is then described. These target, respectively, the electronic states, the vibrational levels, and the lattice strain associated with the intermediates. The review is primarily concerned with how the measurements are made and the intermediates’ experimental spectra. The theoretical descriptions are brought in as a needed to provide context to spectra that are difficult to interpret on their own. A concluding section summarizes the essential findings and methodologies.

Abstract Water electrolysis is a crucial technology for independency on fossil fuels. However, water splitting is limited by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While many studies report highly active, non‐precious metal‐based electrocatalysts for alkaline OER, applicability under industrial conditions is often omitted. Such conditions require catalysts being applied on nickel or nickel‐containing alloys in elevated electrolyte concentrations. In contrast to the rather inert substrates often used in scientific studies, such industrially applied substrates exhibit significant OER activity themselves and show dynamic behaviour. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the OER behaviour of such substrates. Here, nickel and seven commercially available nickel‐containing alloys are investigated as anodes in alkaline OER and their elemental compositions correlated to their corresponding activities. Repeated potential cycling across the Ni(II)/Ni(III)‐redox couple is established as activity‐enhancing procedure. Overall, the nickel‐base alloy Hastelloy® X exhibits the highest activity due to its Fe‐, Cr‐, Mo‐ and Co‐content. Though, the activity gain differs significantly for the various materials. Comparing Ni and Hastelloy® X as least and most active materials, the positive impact of activation on both activity and stability becomes evident. While untreated Ni suffers from poor OER stability, the activity‐enhancing procedure also significantly increases electrode stability in 24 h chronopotentiometry.

Developing ruthenium‐based heterogeneous catalysts with an efficient and stable interface is essential for enhanced acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a defect‐rich ultrathin boron nitride nanosheet support with relatively independent electron donor and acceptor sites, which serves as an electron reservoir and receiving station for RuO2, realizing the rapid supply and reception of electrons. Through precisely controlling the reaction interface, a low OER overpotential of only 180 mV (at 10 mA cm−2) and long‐term operational stability (350 h) are achieved, suggesting potential practical applications. In‐situ characterization and theoretical calculations have validated the existence of a localized electronic recycling between RuO2 and BNNS. The electron‐rich Ru sites accelerate the adsorption of water molecules and the dissociation of intermediates, while the interconnection between the O‐terminal and B‐terminal edge establishes electronic back‐donation, effectively suppressing the over‐oxidation of lattice oxygen. This study provides a new perspective for constructing a stable and highly active catalytic interface.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an integral step in the water‐splitting process. Hence, to promote OER, efficient catalysts are required to lower the energy barriers at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Low‐cost and highly active catalysts are in great demand. Herein, a ternary metal oxide, CoCuMnO x , synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method is reported, which possesses excellent catalytic ability for OER in alkaline electrolytes. The nanoscale morphology of the catalyst with flower‐like nanostructures is instrumental in increasing the electrochemical surface area of the electrode. The presence of multivalent ions and the incorporation of copper greatly enhance the electrochemical properties of the catalysts. The catalysts typically demonstrate an overpotential value of 220 mV for achieving 10 mA cm −2 current density and a Tafel slope of 73 mV dec −1 . The catalysts demonstrate good stability with minimal degradation in OER activity even after 20 h of chronopotentiometry test. For practical applications, this low‐cost material holds great potential.

Abstract Using powder‐based ink appears to be the most suitable candidate for commercializing the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), while research on the powder‐based NPM catalyst for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is currently insufficient, especially at high current density. Herein, a sulfur source (NiFe Layered double hydroxide adsorbed ) confinement strategy is developed to integrate Ni 3 S 2 onto the surface of amorphous/crystalline NiFe alloy nanoparticles (denoted NiFe/Ni‐S), achieving advanced control over the sulfidation process for the formation of metal sulfides. The constructed interface under the sulfur source confinement strategy generates abundant active sites that increase electron transport at the electrode‐electrolyte interface and improve ability over an extended period at a high current density. Consequently, the constructed NiFe/Ni‐S delivers an ultra‐low overpotential of 239 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and 0.66 mA under an overpotential of 300 mV. The AEMWE with NiFe/Ni‐S anode exhibits a cell voltage of 1.664 V @ 0.5 A cm −2 and a 400 h stability at 1.0 A cm −2 .

Abstract Developing efficient and economical electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). Cobalt oxides are considered promising non-precious OER catalysts due to their high activities. However, the severe dissolution of Co atoms in acid media leads to the collapse of crystal structure, which impedes their application in PEMWE. Here, we report that introducing acid-resistant Ir single atoms into the lattice of spinel cobalt oxides can significantly suppress the Co dissolution and keep them highly stable during the acidic OER process. Combining theoretical and experimental studies, we reveal that the stabilizing effect induced by Ir heteroatoms exhibits a strong dependence on the distance of adjacent Ir single atoms, where the OER stability of cobalt oxides continuously improves with decreasing the distance. When the distance reduces to about 0.6 nm, the spinel cobalt oxides present no obvious degradation over a 60-h stability test for acidic OER, suggesting potential for practical applications.

The structure and properties of materials are determined by a diverse range of chemical bond formation and breaking mechanisms, which greatly motivates the development of selectively controlling the chemical bonds in order to achieve materials with specific characteristics. Here, an orientational intervening bond‐breaking strategy is demonstrated for synthesizing ultrathin metal–organic framework (MOF) nanosheets through balancing the process of thermal decomposition and liquid nitrogen exfoliation. In such approach, proper thermal treatment can weaken the interlayer bond while maintaining the stability of the intralayer bond in the layered MOFs.

The produced MOF nanosheets with five cycles of treatment are primarily composed of nanosheets that are less than 10 nm in thickness. The MOF nanosheets exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxygen evolution reactions owing to the ultrathin thickness without capping agents which provide improved charge transfer efficiency and dense exposed active sites. This strategy underscores the significance of orientational intervention in chemical bonds to engineer innovative materials.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are increasingly being investigated as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their unique modular structures that present a hybrid between molecular and heterogeneous catalysts, featuring well-defined active sites. However, many fundamental questions remain open regarding the electrochemical stability of MOFs, structural reconstruction of coordination sites, and the role of in situ-formed species. Here we report structural transformation of a surface-grown MOF containing cobalt nodes and 1,1’-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid linkers (denoted as CoFc-MOF) during OER in alkaline electrolyte. Ex situ and in situ investigations of CoFc-MOF film suggests that the MOF acts as a pre-catalyst and undergoes a two-step restructuring process under operating conditions to generate a metal oxyhydroxide phase. The MOF-derived metal oxyhydroxide catalyst, supported on nickel foam electrodes, displays high activity towards OER with an overpotential of 190 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm–2. While this study demonstrates the necessity of investigating structural evolution of MOFs in electrocatalysis, it also shows potential of using MOFs as precursors in catalyst design.

This research addresses the inherent challenges of low catalytic activity and stability often associated with Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) catalysts. We designed composites with outstanding electrocatalytic performance. The methodology is characterized by low-temperature operation and environmentally friendly substrates. We have successfully fostered a synergistic interplay between Fe and oxygen, carbon and nickel, respectively. Fabricated material composed of three different heterojunctions triggered the stability of the catalyst and facilitated efficient charge transfer in OER. Our optimized catalyst (Fe/Ni_3.0h), emerges as a promising candidate for practical applications, exhibiting an overpotential of 310 mV, a Tafel slope of 37 mV/dec, and a potential retention of 98.8% which is a 50% lower drop in respect to commercial RuO2. Therefore, our approach underlines the substantial influence of conductive Fe-based materials: FeNi3, Fe3C, and Fe3O4 on OER performance with revealed comprehensive mechanism via ex-situ XRD and Mössbauer spectroscopy analyses.

Electrocatalysts, particularly earth-abundant metal oxide ones, exhibit poor performance in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under neutral conditions due to low ionic concentrations. This study introduces a novel strategy for fabricating a PbO2 + Ag composite electrode with significantly improved OER activity and stability in a pH-neutral environment. Our results suggest that incorporating Ag as a surface additive improves the efficiency of utilizing adsorbed oxygenated species via the bridge-site-top-site pathway. Moreover, the surface decoration of Ag resulted in enhanced electrocatalytic stability by diverting the attack of oxygenated species to Pb thereby effectively preventing Pb dissolution. The results not only establish a method for utilizing PbO2 in pH-neutral OER applications, but also propose a potential strategy for employing less noble catalysts in cost-effective electrochemical energy conversions.

Hydrogen fuel is a clean and versatile energy carrier that can be used for various applications, including transportation, power generation, and industrial processes. Electrocatalytic water splitting could be the most beneficial and facile approach for producing hydrogen. In this work, transition metal selenide composites with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been investigated for electrocatalytic water splitting. The synthesis process involved the facile one-step hydrothermal growth of transition metal nanoparticles over the CNTs and acted as an efficient electrode toward electrochemical water splitting. Scanning electron microscopy and XRD patterns reveal that nanoparticles were firmly anchored on the CNTs, resulting in the formation of composites. The electrochemical measurements reveal that CNT composite with nickel–cobalt selenides (NiCo-Se/CNTs@NF) display remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in basic media, which is an important part of hydrogen production. It demonstrates the lowest overpotential (η10mAcm−2) of 0.560 V vs. RHE, a reduced Tafel slope of 163 mV/dec, and lower charge transfer impedance for the OER process. The multi-metallic selenide composite with CNTs demonstrating unique nanostructure and synergistic effects offers a promising platform for enhancing electrocatalytic OER performance and opens up new avenues for efficient energy conversion and storage applications.

Abstract Water splitting is a critical process for the production of green hydrogen, contributing to the advancement of a circular economy. However, the application of water splitting devices on a large scale is primarily impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Thus, developing and designing efficient OER catalysts is a significant target. NiFe‐based catalysts are extensively researched as excellent OER electrocatalysts due to their affordability, abundant reserves, and intrinsic activities. However, they still suffer from long‐term stability challenges. To date, few systematic strategies for improving OER durability have been reported. In this review, various advanced NiFe‐based catalysts are introduced. Moreover, the OER stability challenges of NiFe‐based electrocatalysts in alkaline media, including iron segregation, structural degradation, and peeling from the substrate are summarized. More importantly, strategies to enhance OER stability are highlighted and opportunities are discussed to facilitate future stability studies for alkaline water electrolysis. This review presents a design strategy for NiFe‐based electrocatalysts and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzers to overcome stability challenges in OER, which also emphasizes the importance of long‐term stability in alkaline media and its significance for achieving large‐scale commercialization.
