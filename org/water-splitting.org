Metal oxyhydroxides produced by the surface reconstruction were widely considered as active catalytic species in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, simultaneous activation of metal sites in surface oxyhydroxides remains a great challenge. In this study, the interface self-activation strategy was utilized to simultaneously activate both the iron and nickel sites at the surface oxyhydroxides of (Fe,Ni)OOH-NiSe2 nano heterostructure. The OER activity was greatly boosted by the dual activation of active sites, resulting in an overpotential of 245 mV@100 mA cm−2 with a small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1. The finely constructed FeOOH-NiSe2 heterostructure was transformed into (Fe,Ni)OOH-NiSe2 through the formation of distinct bonds of M(Fe,Ni)-O-Se during the OER process, which was discovered through a combination of experimental studies with DFT calculations. A fast OER reaction dynamic was achieved due to the unique self-optimized interface structure which produced a dual synergistic effect between the interface structure and the active sites of Fe and Ni of oxyhydroxides, modulated the electronic structure and d band center of active sites, and increased the number of optimum active sites. This work paves a way to design high-performance electrocatalysts with multiple active sites for other electrochemical reactions.

Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of NiCo LDH electrocatalysts can be improved through fluorine doping. The roles of Ni and Co active sites in such catalysts remain ambiguous and controversial. In addressing the issue, this study draws upon the molecular orbital theory and proposes the active center competitive mechanism between Ni and Co. The doped F‐atoms can directly impact the valence state of metal atoms or exert an indirect influence through the dehydrogenation, thereby modulating the active center. As the F‐atoms are progressively aggregate, the e g orbitals of Ni and Co transition from e 2 g to e 1 g , and subsequently to e 0 g . The corresponding valence state elevates from +2 to +3, and then to +4, signifying an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in the electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, a series of F‐NiCo LDH catalysts are synthesized to verify the e g orbital occupancy analysis, and the catalytic OER overpotentials are 303, 243, 240, and 246 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm −2 , respectively, which coincides well with the theoretical prediction. This investigation not only provides novel mechanistic insights into the transition and competition of Ni and Co in F‐NiCo LDH catalysts but also establishes a foundation for the design of high‐performance catalysts.

Electrocatalytic water splitting is a sustainable way to produce hydrogen energy. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode always has sluggish kinetics and low energy conversion efficiency, which is the major bottleneck for water splitting. In this paper, the electronic structure of the Co3O4/carbon composites was regulated by anion doping. The F-doped carbon substrate is compounded with ZIF-67, and the active component Co3O4 is encapsulated in the skeleton formed by ZIF-67. The prepared hybrid nanocomposite catalyst F-Co3O4@NF has excellent OER performance. It requires an overpotential of only 172 mV with the current density of 50 mA cm-2, and the Tafel slope is 88 mV dec-1. It can maintain good stability after 24 hours of continuous operation, and the catalytic activity exceeds most of the similar series of catalysts. The characterization show that F doping can affect the catalytic activity in the form of adjusting the electronic structure and lifting d band center. These structural changes effectively optimize the adsorption/desorption capacity of the composite catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen intermediates in the catalytic process, thereby improving the catalytic activity for alkaline oxygen evolution.

Abstract Organic supramolecular photocatalysts have garnered widespread attention due to their adjustable structure and exceptional photocatalytic activity. Herein, a novel bis‐dicarboxyphenyl‐substituent naphthalenediimide self‐assembly supramolecular photocatalyst (SA‐NDI‐BCOOH) with efficient dual‐functional photocatalytic performance is successfully constructed. The large molecular dipole moment and short‐range ordered stacking structure of SA‐NDI‐BCOOH synergistically create a giant internal electric field (IEF), resulting in a remarkable 6.7‐fold increase in its charge separation efficiency. Additionally, the tetracarboxylic structure of SA‐NDI‐BCOOH greatly enhances its hydrophilicity. Thus, SA‐NDI‐BCOOH demonstrates efficient dual‐functional activity for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution, with rates of 372.8 and 3.8 µmol h −1 , respectively. Meanwhile, a notable apparent quantum efficiency of 10.86% at 400 nm for hydrogen evolution is achieved, prominently surpassing many reported supramolecular photocatalysts. More importantly, with the help of dual co‐catalysts, it exhibits photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H 2 and O 2 evolution rates of 3.2 and 1.6 µmol h −1 . Briefly, this work sheds light on enhancing the IEF by controlling the molecular polarity and stacking structure to dramatically improve the photocatalytic performance of supramolecular materials.

Abstract Heterostructure or doping engineering on Mo 2 C by coupling with transition metal nanoparticles/atoms can optimize catalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the intrinsic catalytic activity of Mo 2 C is not fully stimulated at the atomic level, which is challenging. Herein, an adjacent‐confined pyrolysis strategy to manipulate the intrinsic electronic structure of Mo 2 C directly is reported. During the nucleation and growth of Mo 2 C, the replacement of Mo atoms by adjacent Ni atoms induces the generation of high‐density phase boundaries (PBs) with alternating face‐centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close‐packed (hcp) hetero‐phase. The lattice deformity in PBs affords an ultrahigh density of active sites, endowing Mo 2 C nanosheets with excellent OER activity and superior stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that introduced Ni atoms activate the adjacent Mo sites and optimize the thermodynamic reaction energetics for enhanced OER activity. The work offers a general adjacent‐confined pyrolysis strategy to achieve PBs‐controlling in Mo 2 C nanosheets for catalytic application and beyond.

Design the electrocatalysts without noble metal is still a challenge for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media. Herein, we reported the manganese doping method to decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancy (Vo) and form the Mn−O structure adjacent octahedral sites in spinel NiCo2O4−δ (NiMn1.5Co3O4−δ), which highly enhanced the activity and stability of spinel NiCo2O4−δ with a low overpotential (η) of 280 mV at j = 10 mA cm−2 and long‐term stability of 80 h in acid media. The isotopic labelling experiment based on differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) clearly demonstrated the lattice oxygen in NiMn1.5Co3O4−δ is more stable due to strong Mn‐O bond and synergetic adsorbate evolution mechanism (SAEM) for acid OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal highly increased oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVO) of NiCo2O4−δ after Mn doping. More importantly, the highly hydrogen bonding between Mn−O and *OOH adsorbed on adjacent Co octahedral sites promote the formation of *OO from *OOH due to the greatly enhanced charge density of O in Mn substituted sites.

Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for future renewable energy technology. Here, we use first-principles calculations combined with genetic algorithm to determine the structures of various Pd clusters supported on experimentally available C2N monolayer and evaluate the OER and ORR performance. Our findings show that the activity of the supported Pd clusters is closely linked to the local geometrical and electronic structure of the active site. Furthermore, we establish the activity trends of the clusters based on the adsorption free energies of intermediates. In particular, C2N supported Pd7 and Pd8 clusters exhibit outstanding OER activity with low overpotentials. We identify a volcano relation for the OER on the clusters, suggesting that the high activity of the cluster is related to the moderate adsorption strength of intermediates. Mechanistic analysis indicates that the second water formation is the potential-determining step for ORR on the clusters due to the strong adsorption of *OH. Additionally, we identify a linear scaling relationship between the ORR overpotentials and adsorption free energies of *OH, demonstrating that reducing the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on Pd clusters can improve the activity. This work unravels the activity trends of cluster catalysts and provides strategies for the rational design of highly efficient single-cluster catalysts for OER and ORR.

Abstract The generation of green hydrogen by water splitting is identified as a key strategic energy technology, and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one of the desirable technologies for converting renewable energy sources into hydrogen. However, the harsh anode environment of PEMWE and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving four‐electron transfer result in a large overpotential, which limits the overall efficiency of hydrogen production, and thus efficient electrocatalysts are needed to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetic process. In recent years, noble metal‐based electrocatalysts (e.g., Ru/Ir‐based metal/oxide electrocatalysts) have received much attention due to their unique catalytic properties, and have already become the dominant electrocatalysts for the acidic OER process and are applied in commercial PEMWE devices. However, these noble metal‐based electrocatalysts still face the thorny problem of conflicting performance and cost. In this review, first, noble metal Ru/Ir‐based OER electrocatalysts are briefly classified according to their forms of existence, and the OER catalytic mechanisms are outlined. Then, the focus is on summarizing the improvement strategies of Ru/Ir‐based OER electrocatalysts with respect to their activity and stability over recent years. Finally, the challenges and development prospects of noble metal‐based OER electrocatalysts are discussed.
