Nickel-iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two-step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100 mA cm-2, the overpotentials amount to 255 mV in 1 M KOH, 263 mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346 mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200 hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.

Abstract Development of high‐performance and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at neutral pH is important for direct seawater splitting and organic electrosynthesis but remains challenging due to the sluggish OER kinetics and diverse side reactions inherent to the constituents of working electrolytes. Herein, we report on a P:NiFe electrode, containing P‐doped NiFe alloy, as an excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER pre‐catalyst for efficient OER in both seawater and organic electrolyte for adiponitrile (ADN) electrosynthesis at neutral pH. Fe and P species modulate the coordination environment of nickel sites, which enables the simultaneous formation of OER‐active nickel species and FePO x passivation layer, thus transforming HER‐active P:NiFe to OER‐active a ‐P:NiFe. Besides, the redox‐dependent interconversion between HER‐active P:NiFe and OER‐active a ‐P:NiFe is fast and reversible. Finally, efficient and stable overall seawater‐splitting and ADN electrosynthesis at an industrially relevant current density (100 mA cm −2 ) in pH‐neutral media are also demonstrated.

Abstract Oxygen electrochemistry, which encompasses the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is of utmost importance in energy‐related reactions such as zinc‐air batteries (ZABs). However, due to their four‐electron transfer process, these reactions are still significantly restricted by sluggish reaction kinetics. Supporting atomically‐dispersed (AD) catalyst or metal nanoparticles (NPs) on nitrogen‐doped carbon (NC) is proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of oxygen electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the performance of these types of catalysts still fails to meet the critical requirements for ZABs. Herein, a novel Fe AD Co NPs @NC, which consists of both AD Fe‐N 1 and Fe sites in the Co lattice, is developed. Spectroscopy studies and density functional theory calculations indicate that the Fe site in the Co lattice facilitates the conversion of Co NPs to an amorphous CoOOH, and the Fe‐N 1 serves as the main active site for ORR. Fe AD Co NPs @NC demonstrates remarkable activity for both OER and ORR. When it is used as an air‐electrode for ZABs, it demonstrates a power density of 247.49 mW cm −2 . This work presents a simple yet efficient method to enhance oxygen electrochemical performance through the synergy between AD sites and metal NPs.

Implementing a hydrogen economy on an industrial scale poses challenges, particularly in developing cost-effective and stable catalysts for water electrolysis. This study explores the catalytic potential of selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) synthesized via a simple chemical bath deposition method for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The successful fabrication of Se-NPs on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes has been confirmed using a wide range of analytical tools like X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Importantly, electrochemical measurements revealed superior electrocatalytic activity of the modified Se-NPs/FTO electrodes, with low overpotential (220 mV at 10 mA cm–2) and Tafel slope (90.13 mV dec–1), indicating faster reaction kinetics and reduced energy inputs for oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the Se-NPs/FTO electrode was employed for PEC water splitting in Na2S electrolyte, showing a notable enhancement in photocurrent density with a difference of 700 μA cm–2 between light and dark conditions at 1.5 V vs RHE, demonstrating efficient light-driven hydrogen production. The overall findings of this work establish that the proposed Se-NPs/FTO electrodes are promising composites for both electrochemical and PEC performance, thereby providing insights into developing cost-effective catalysts for large-scale water splitting.

Interfacial engineering is considered an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical water-splitting activity of catalysts by modulating the local electronic structure to expose more active sites. Therefore, we report a platinum–cobaltic oxide nanosheets (Pt/Co3O4 NSs) with plentiful grain boundary as the efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. The Pt/Co3O4 NSs exhibit a low overpotential of 55 and 201 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide, respectively. A negligible degradation of 1.52 V at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 after continuous operation for 100 h, demonstrates the long-term stability of the catalyst. Furthermore, the overall water-splitting performance of the Pt/Co3O4 NSs surpasses that of the commercial Pt/C||RuO2. The density functional theory calculation results explain that the improvement of catalyst activity is attributed to the moderate adsorption/desorption energy of *H and the low reaction energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This work presents a novel vision to design bifunctional catalysts for the storage and conversion of hydrogen energy.

Nickel–iron-based catalysts are recognized for their high efficiency in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive their superior performance remain unclear. Herein, we revealed the molecular OER mechanism and the structure-intermediate-performance relationship of OER on a phosphorus-doped nickel–iron nanocatalyst (NiFeP). NiFeP exhibited exceptional activity and stability with an overpotential of only 210 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH and a cell voltage of 1.68 V at 1 A cm–2 in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The evolution of active sites and intermediates during OER on NiFeP was in situ probed and correlated using shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, complemented by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory. These results provide direct evidence that OER proceeds via the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism. Remarkably, phosphorus doping plays a critical role in stabilizing the active β-Ni(Fe)OOH phase, which facilitates the *OH deprotonation and the subsequent O–O coupling to form *OO intermediates. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the OER mechanism, providing a clear pathway for designing next-generation OER catalysts with improved efficiency and durability.

CoFe-based catalysts have shown excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with the oxidation states of the active sites playing a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. However, how to effectively increase the oxidation state of these active sites remains a key challenge. In this work, a facile treatment with NaBH4 solution was employed to modulate the surface state of CoFeOxHy catalysts, inducing an enhanced OER activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 for the NaBH4-treated CoFe catalyst was reduced to 270 mV, indicating improved OER activity. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that NaBH4 treatment induced a phase reconstruction of the CoFe oxalate framework, a critical step in enhancing its catalytic properties. The strong reducing ability of NaBH4 strengthened the Co-Fe interaction, allowing the retention of low-valence Co species while facilitating the formation of high-valence Fe sites. This dual modulation of Co and Fe oxidation states significantly accelerated charge transfer kinetics, ultimately boosting OER performance. These findings highlight the importance of improving the oxidation states of active sites in CoFe-based catalysts, providing insights for developing efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.

RuO2 has been considered as a promising, low-cost, and highly efficient catalyst in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it suffers from poor stability due to the inevitable involvement of the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Here, we construct a unique metallene-based core-skin structure and unveil that the OER pathway of atomic RuO2 skin can be regulated from the LOM to an adsorbate evolution mechanism by altering the core species from metallene oxides to metallenes. This switch is achieved without sacrificing the number of active sites, enabling Pd@RuO2 metallenes to exhibit outstanding acidic OER activity with a low overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm–2, which is 54 mV lower than that of the counterpart PdO@RuO2 metallenes. Additionally, they also exhibit robust stability with negligible activity decay over 100 h at 50 mA cm–2, outperforming most reported RuO2-based catalysts. Multiple spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Pd-metallene core, acting as an electron donor, increases the migration energy of subsurface oxygen atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of intermediates on the active Ru sites, enabling a switch in the reaction mechanism. Such a unique metallene-based core-skin structure offers a novel way for tuning the catalytic behaviors of electrocatalysts.

We investigate the ultrafast electronic and thermal properties of the bulk amorphous cobalt oxide water oxidation catalysts cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) and cobalt borate (CoBi) using optical pump/X-ray probe correlated with in situ electrochemical transient absorption spectroscopy. The electronic signature of a light-generated intermediate species is compared to steady-state in situ heating X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), suggestive of non-thermal contributions to charge transfer formation on ultrafast timescales. With Co K-edge transient absorption spectroscopy, we observe a net photoreduction following 400 nm excitation that also initiates a potential-dependent increase in the excited-state fraction of trapped charge carriers that persists on nanosecond to microsecond timescales and is identified as a potential precursor state to oxygen evolving reactions (OER). Distinctly, the formation of excited-state species cannot be fully explained by photothermal reaction dynamics alone, with potential contributions from electronic motion acting in concert with macroscopic redox activity. The results can influence the design of water-splitting catalytic materials for tuning dimensionality, confinement, and charge delocalization across structures.

Low‐iridium acid‐stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in situ reconstruction of Ir‐based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade‐off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom‐bonded structure triggers rational surface‐confined reconstruction to form self‐stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir‐Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in‐situ/ex‐situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir‐O‐Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6 times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir‐Mn IMC as anode “pre‐electrocatalyst” (0.24 mgIr cm−2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0 A cm−2@1.851 V@80 °C) and runs stably at 2.0 A cm−2 for more than 2,000 h with the cost of USD 0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface‐confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical challenge in electrocatalytic water splitting, hindered by high energy demands and slow kinetics. Polyoxometalates (POMs), recognized for their unique redox capabilities, structural archetypes, and molecular precision, are promising candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, their application is hindered by high water solubility, causing rapid degradation and efficiency loss under harsh OER conditions. This study enhances the performance and stability of polyoxometalates (POMs) for OER by anchoring keggin‐type POM [TiCoW11O40]7‐ nanosheets onto a conductive, carbon‐protected manganese oxide (C‐Mn2O3) nanospheres support. The acquired porous framework enhances POM/C‐Mn2O3 (PCM) contact, improving stability, reaction kinetics, and redox activity by offering nucleation sites, electronic pathways, and abundant active sites, significantly boosting OER activity. The resulting PCM nanohybrid demonstrates remarkable OER activity in 1M KOH, requiring only a 300 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 with a Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec. The PCM electrocatalyst also shows high mass activity (784 A/g at 1.6 V) and maintains stability over 100 hours at 100 mA cm‐2 without performance fatigue. Consequently, this study offers a viable strategy for developing efficient, durable electrocatalysts using low‐cost materials.

The exploration and rational design of high-performance, durable, and non-precious-metal bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts are highly desired for the large-scale application of overall water splitting. Herein, an effective and straightforward coupling approach was developed to fabricate high-performance bifunctional OER/HER electrocatalysts based on core–shell nanostructure comprising a Ni/Ni3N core and a NiFe(OH)x shell. The as-prepared Ni/Ni3N@NiFe(OH)x-4 catalyst exhibited low overpotentials of 57 and 243 mV at 10 mA cm–2 for the HER and OER in 1.0 m KOH, respectively, superior to most bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts reported so far. Compared to the unmodified Ni/Ni3N, the Ni/Ni3N@NiFe(OH)x-4 catalyst exhibited a 43.3-fold increase in mass activity for the OER and an 8.7-fold increase for the HER, as well as a 29.5-fold increase in intrinsic activity for the OER and a 2.6-fold increase for the HER. When employed as both the cathode and the anode of the electrolyzer for the overall water splitting reaction, its voltage was reduced to 1.58 V at 10 mA cm–2. This surface reconstruction method increased the electrochemically active surface area and enhanced the catalytic activity. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the Fe etching reduced the onset potential for the active phase NiOOH, promoted its formation, and accelerated the reaction kinetics, thereby enhancing the overall electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst.

Abstract Li‐O 2 batteries urgently needs high discharge capacity and stable cycling performance, requiring effective and reliable bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Hovenia acerba Lindl ‐like heterostructure composed of cobalt sulfide and tin dioxide supported on carbon substrate (CoS/SnO 2 @C) is prepared via CO 2 laser irradiation technology. The half‐wave potential of CoS/SnO 2 @C for the ORR is 0.88 V, while the overpotential of the OER at 10 mA cm −2 is as low as 270 mV. The Li‐O 2 batteries employing the bifunctional CoS/SnO 2 @C catalyst displays a high discharge specific capacity of 3332.25 mAh g −1 and long cycling life of 226 cycles. Additionally, theory calculations demonstrate that the construction of heterostructure decreases energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (RDS) for both ORR and OER. Notably, SnO 2 behaves as the electronic promoter to optimize the electronic structure of heterostructure interface and triggers charge redistribution of CoS, which weakens the adsorption strength of the * O‐intermediates and allows to break the linear scaling relationship, thus further enhancing the catalytic performance of CoS/SnO 2 @C. This research furnishes directions for the design of heterogeneous catalysts, highlighting its great potential for application in rechargeable Li‐O 2 batteries.

Abstract The preferential adsorption toward OH − on the anode most likely blocks the accessibility of organic molecules and triggers competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER), typically precipitating a narrow potential window. Here, an OH − deconfinement strategy enabled by CO 3 2− self‐transformed from C 2 O 4 2− on metallic nickel oxalate (NiC 2 O 4 ) for efficient synthesis of bioplastic monomer 2,5‐furanedicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with faradaic efficiency of >95% via electrocatalytic 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (e‐HMFOR) at a wider potential window of 1.38–1.56 V RHE , outperforming state‐of‐the‐art Ni‐based electrocatalysts is presented. In situ, tests corroborate that the construction of NiOOH with surface‐adsorbed CO 3 2− (NiOOH‐CO 3 2− ) from NiC 2 O 4 can be facilitated by self‐liberating CO 3 2− . The CO 3 2− ions serving as an electric field engine can effectively weaken OH − coverage through electrostatic repulsion and enhance HMF adsorption at the NiOOH‐CO 3 2− surface, thereby heightening e‐HMFOR while inhibiting OER. Computational results further indicate that the CO 3 2− on NiOOH hoists the energy barrier of oxygen intermediate conversion (O* → OOH*) to suppress OER but promotes the e‐HMFOR kinetics. The precise modulation of OH − adsorption behavior on the electrocatalyst offers a powerful kit for boosting the oxidative upgrading process while circumventing the competing reaction OER.

Catalyst design plays a critical role in ensuring sustainable and effective energy conversion. Electrocatalytic materials need to be able to control active sites and introduce defects in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, producing efficient catalysts with a distinct surface structure advances our comprehension of the mechanism. Here, a defect‐engineered heterointerface of ruthenium doped cobalt metal organic frame (Ru‐CoMOF) core confined in MoS2 is reported. A tailored design approach at room temperature was used to induce defects and form an electron transfer interface that enhanced the electrocatalytic performance. The Ru‐CoMOF@MoS2 heterointerface obtains a geometrical current density of 10 mA‐2 by providing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at small overpotentials of 240 and 289 mV, respectively. Density functional theory simulation shows that the Co‐site maximizes the evolution of hydrogen intermediate energy for adsorption and enhances HER, while the Ru‐site, on the other hand, is where OER happens. The heterointerface provides a channel for electron transfer and promotes reactions at the solid‐liquid interface. The Ru‐CoMOF@MoS2 model exhibits improved OER and HER efficiency, indicating that it could be a valuable material for the production of water‐alkaline and acidic catalysts.

Abstract Rechargeable Zn‐air batteries (ZABs) have attracted widespread attention due to their advantages, such as high energy density, low price, and environmental friendliness. However, the sluggish kinetics of ORR/OER greatly prevent the practical application of rechargeable ZABs. In recent years, efficient, durable, and cost‐effective bifunctional catalysts are developed to accelerate the kinetics of ORR/OER and enhance the performance of ZABs. This review provides a systematic overview of ZABs and describes the standards of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. The latest research progress in the development of non‐noble metal‐based and nano‐metallic electrocatalysts for the air electrode of ZABs is systematically summarized, including the classification, design, synthesis methods, active site structures, and mechanism. Finally, the challenges faced by bifunctional catalysts and probable solutions are proposed. This review will provide a comprehensive guidance for development of efficient oxygen electrocatalyst in the future.

The evolution of bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts that are highly active, stable, and conductive is crucial for advancing metal-air batteries and fuel cells. We have here thoroughly explored the OER and ORR performance for a category of two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) called TM3(HADQ)2, and Rh3(HADQ)2 exhibits a promising bifunctional OER/ORR activity, with an overpotential of 0.31 V for both OER and ORR. The d-band center (εd) and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) are utilized to study the relationship between OER/ORR activity and the electronic structure of catalysts, and it is found that the elementary d-electron number (Ne) of the central TM for TM3(HADQ)2, as well as the electronegativity of the ligand TM-N4 and the intermediate O atom, are the main reason that affects the catalytic activity of OER/ORR. Additionally, Rh3(HADQ)2 can be proven through the constant potential method (CPM) and microkinetics method that it is an acidic OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst. Rh3(HADQ)2 has a high toxicity tolerance, making it a potential bifunctional catalyst. Our research contributes to both the rational design of SACs for various catalytic processes and the fabrication of bifunctional, cost-effective oxygen-electric catalysts.

Water‐assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)‐based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo‐based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co‐Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet‐like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co‐Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi‐LDH, demonstrating that the PBA‐derived Co‐Ni(O)OH was more effective.

The addition of a redox mediator as soluble catalyst into electrolyte can effectively overcome the bottlenecks of poor energy efficiency and limited cyclability for Li‐O2 batteries caused by passivation of insulating discharge products and unfavorable byproducts. Herein we report a novel soluble catalyst of bifunctional imidazolyl iodide salt additive, 1,3‐dimethylimidazole iodide (DMII), to successfully construct highly efficient and durable Li‐O2 batteries. The anion I− can effectively promote the charge transport of Li2O2 and accelerate the redox kinetics of oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions on the cathode side, thereby significantly decreasing the charge/discharge overpotential. Simultaneously, the cation DMI+ forms an ultrathin stably solid‐electrolyte interphase film on Li metal, greatly inhibiting the shuttle effect of I− and improving the stability of anode. Using this DMII additive, our Li‐O2 batteries achieve an extremely low voltage of 0.52 V and ultra‐long cycling stability over 960 h. Notably, up to 95.8% of the Li2O2 yield further proves the reversible generation/decomposition of Li2O2 without the occurrence of side reactions. Both experimental and theoretical results disclose that DMII enables Li+ easily solvated, testifying the dominance of the solution‐induced reaction mechanism. This work provides the possibility to design the soluble catalysts towards high‐performance Li‐O2 batteries.

Hydrogen production via water splitting is one of the latest low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is to develop inexpensive and highly active catalysts. Herein, we present the preparation of electrocatalysts based on cobalt–phosphorus (Co-P) coatings with different P contents for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The Co-P coatings were deposited on the copper (Cu) surface using the economical and simple method of electroless metal deposition. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Co-P coatings deposited on the Cu surface were studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), while their activity for HER and OER in 1 M KOH was investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chrono-techniques. It was found that the catalyst activity for both HER and OER depends on the P content of the catalyst and varies based on the highest efficiency for each reaction. The Co-P coating with 11 wt% P exhibited the lowest overpotential value of 98.9 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 compared to the Co-P coatings with 8, 5, 1.6, and 0.4 wt% P (107.6, 165.9, 218.2, and 253.9 mV, respectively). In contrast, the lowest OER overpotential (378 mV) was observed for the Co-P coating with 8 wt% P to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 as compared to the Co-P coatings with 5, 11, 1.6, and 0.4 wt% P (400, 413, 434, and 434 mV, respectively). These results suggest that the obtained catalysts are suitable for HER and OER in alkaline media.

Unbearable to the high catalytic potentials, most materials undergo either reversible or irreversible structural reconstruction during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis, involving valence changes as well as coordination alternation of both metal and oxygen active sites. Such potential-dependent evolution happening on the local surface brings about certain challenges but also necessity to explore in-situ structure-performance relations. However, corresponding researches prove intractable to reach a consensus due to universally undeveloped operando characterization techniques.

Atomically dispersed metal catalysts coordinated with nitrogen coordination and anchored to carbon substrates (M-N-C) have become highly effective alternatives to platinum-group catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis. However, the catalytic efficacy of M-N-C systems remains constrained by the suboptimal performance associated with the symmetric charge distribution around the active metal centers. The synergistic co-design of asymmetric metal single-atom catalytic centers with heteroatom doping significantly enhances the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity and durability, advancing the capabilities of next-generation flexible zinc-air batteries. Herein, we developed a pyrolysis-secondary coordination strategy to generate a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, characterized by single Co atoms integrated within an asymmetrical Co-N5S1 moiety, along with nanocluster complexes embedded in N,P,S-codoped carbon frameworks, labeled CoSA+NC/NPSC. In the CoSA+NC/NPSC catalyst, the Co-N5S1 active sites exhibit an optimized electronic configuration, achieved through the synergistic coordination of heteroatom doping and nanocluster integration. Theoretically, this configuration significantly lowers the energy barriers and adjusts the d-band center, ensuring a more balanced binding strength between active sites and the oxygen-containing intermediates and contributing to the promoted bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction efficiency. The experimentally analytical results reveal that the CoSA+NC/NPSC demonstrates an impressive oxygen evolution reaction activity (Ej=10 = 1.58 V) and a narrow bifunctional potential gap (ΔE = 0.75 V), remarkably superior to the counterparts with symmetric Co-S coordination or phosphorus-free doping. When assembled as an air electrode, the CoSA+NC/NPSC-based flexible zinc-air battery exhibits ultralong charge-discharge life (>105 h) and impressive initial round-trip efficiency of 72.42% even at 0 °C.

Microsensors for resolving local pH are versatile analytical tools for studying reactions at solid-liquid interfaces in applications such as electrocatalysis and corrosion. However, the achievable temporal resolution is limited, hindering the operando investigation of local pH at surfaces in electrochemical reactions. Here, we present a methodology to achieve a high time resolution by deploying AC voltammetry with a pH microsensor. The sensor is composed of a gold ultramicroelectrode functionalized with electropolymerized methylene blue at its tip, allowing for continuous monitoring of pH in aqueous solutions in the neutral and acidic regime at a subsecond time resolution. As a proof-of-principle, we show that our sensors can be used for detecting interfacial pH at an electrified platinum nanoparticle-modified carbon electrode during the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The fast pH sensing capability is expected to open an avenue for routine operando studies of local pH at electrified interfaces.

Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in fuel cells and metal‐air batteries, which hold immense potential for energy conversion and storage systems due to their superior theoretical energy density, cost‐effectiveness, and safety profile. However, carbon‐based materials in air electrode face challenges stemming from the harsh oxidative environment of oxygen catalysis, leading to thermodynamic instability. This underscores the urgent necessity for the development of effective carbon anti‐oxidation strategies. This comprehensive review initially explores the complex mechanisms underlying the oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and the prevalent issue of carbon corrosion in carbon‐based materials. It then delves into diverse strategies aimed at mitigating catalyst corrosion through doped carbons, encompassing techniques such as graphitization, active site management, surface modification using functional groups, and corrosion resistance coating. Moreover, the review discusses methods to counteract carbon oxidation in catalyst supports, including the utilization of novel carbons, highly active catalysts to minimize oxidation, and the exploration of non‐carbon alternatives. Furthermore, the review also sheds light on protecting current collectors and conductive additives within the air electrode from corrosion. Ultimately, it outlines emerging challenges and opportunities for addressing carbon oxidation in air electrode, paving the way for enhanced performance and longevity in fuel cells and metal‐air batteries.

Low‐iridium acid‐stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in situ reconstruction of Ir‐based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade‐off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom‐bonded structure triggers rational surface‐confined reconstruction to form self‐stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir‐Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in‐situ/ex‐situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir‐O‐Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6 times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir‐Mn IMC as anode “pre‐electrocatalyst” (0.24 mgIr cm−2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0 A cm−2@1.851 V@80 °C) and runs stably at 2.0 A cm−2 for more than 2,000 h with the cost of USD 0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface‐confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.

Abstract Transition metal hydroxides (TMHs), comprising metal-centered polyhedra, are abundant in nature and have a broad range of applications. Although the intercalation/deintercalation of polyhedra with unconventional coordination number (UCN) plays a pivotal role in their formation process and influences their chemical behavior, the detailed mechanism remains obscure. Here, by combining kinetically controlled growth of Co(OH)2 as a model system (where polyhedra with UCN refer to 4-coordinated tetrahedra), in situ pH measurement, and in situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, we tracked Co2+ tetrahedral intercalation/deintercalation with varying OH− concentration, discovering that the initial Co2+ tetrahedral intercalation into the Co(OH)2 lattice is inevitable and its retention is influenced by the effective OH− concentration, challenging previous beliefs about the formation of Co(OH)2 and potentially other hydroxides. More importantly, understanding the intercalation mechanism significantly contributes to optimizing the synthesis conditions of hydroxides with tunable coordination environments, which hold significant application potential, as evidenced by a proof of concept application in the oxygen evolution reaction.

The electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2eRR) to high value-added chemicals in an aqueous electrolyte usually faces challenges, including sluggish oxygen evolution at the anode and the competing reaction of hydrogen evolution at the cathode. A novel CoNi@NC composite with high saturation magnetization, prepared by facile pyrolysis, was used as the cathode and a Pt sheet as the anode in an ionic liquid (IL)-methanol electrolyte to conduct the CO2eRR to produce CH4 and CO, and oxidation of methanol to generate methylal (dimethoxymethane, DMM). A magnetic CoNi alloy nanomaterial (CoNi@NC) with a nitrogen-doped carbon layer-coated structure was synthesized by a one-pot method. The system achieved an associative strategy for synchronous production of high-valued chemicals via two half-reactions at the cathode and anode, respectively. The optimal CoNi@NC composite exhibited efficient catalytic activity, obtaining an average of 54.5% faradaic efficiency (FE) for DMM within 48 h and 91.9% of momentary FE for CO and CH4 at 24 h under lower energy consumption. The electrode catalyst and ionic liquid electrolyte also exhibited good recyclability and stability in the CO2eRR. Mechanism studies indicated that magnetic CoNi alloy species served as adsorption and active sites for CO2 conversion. In addition, the carbon layer coating enhanced the stability of the CoNi alloy, and N-doping introduced surface defects on the carbon layer, thereby promoting CO2 adsorption and electrocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the magnetic CoNi (1 1 1) species was conducive to CO2 adsorption and activation, exhibiting high selectivity for the CO2eRR.

Abstract Mass transfer factor plays an indispensable role in high current density to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, yet research on modulating reactant mass transport remains limited. Herein, by leveraging the dual acid‐base properties of aluminum sites, both the activation of the electronic activity of the layer for layered double hydroxides (LDH) and construction of the interlayer hydroxide coordination field (IHCF) have been achieved through in situ electrochemical reconstruction. It not only facilitates charge transfer and the surface catalytic transformation of reaction intermediates but, most notably, the presence of the IHCF significantly enhances the mass transport of reactants. As a result, the overpotential of LDHs with IHCF is only 164 mV, significantly better than the reported Ni‐based catalysts. Deuterium kinetic isotope effect experiments and pH‐dependence measurements demonstrate that the IHCF effectively enhances substrate mass transport capability and structural stability, thereby accelerating the proton‐coupled electron transfer process. To further validate the high mass transport characteristics, stability tests of the alkaline flow electrolyzer show that catalysts maintain over 1000 h of stability at a high current density. This work suggests that the IHCF effect can be utilized for further design and synthesis of efficient water oxidation catalysts for practical application.

Developing low-cost and highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts using earth-abundant elements through simple and efficient synthesis methods holds paramount importance for sustainable hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Porous catalyst materials have proven versatile in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high surface area and fast mass diffusion. Herein, we developed a simple and sustainable approach for synthesizing high-surface-area, porous Co3O4 nanomaterials from perovskite materials, i.e., SrCoO3 and LaCoO3. The resulting porous Co3O4 nanomaterials exhibit exceptional efficiency in the water oxidation reaction. Notably, the acid-treated sample (AT-SCO-1M) demonstrated superior photochemical and electrochemical activities. It exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 8.13 × 10–3 s–1, along with a lower overpotential (375 mV) and Tafel slope (117 mV/dec) compared to the untreated Cg-Co3O4 nanoparticles (4.28 × 10–3 s–1, 465 mV, and 220 mV/dec). This method's selective removal of A-site cations from the perovskite precursors increases the catalyst surface area, porosity, and hydrophilicity, all collectively contributing to improved water oxidation activity. Our sustainable approach for synthesizing high-surface-area, porous nanomaterials through a simple, environmental, and recyclable method shows a new way to design highly active water oxidation catalysts and other catalytic applications.

Anion redox in layered Li-rich cathodes provides a high capacity but triggers a series of cascading issues. Current research predominantly focuses on how oxygen species participate in redox and how transition metals move, often ignoring the influence of magnetic frustration. This work systematically investigates the potential link between the evolution of magnetic frustration, structural evolution and oxygen redox in honeycomb Li2RuO3. Our findings indicate that the phase transition from C2/c to R3 exacerbates the magnetic frustration during Ru oxidation. Subsequently, during oxygen oxidation, the strong magnetic frustration drives the generation of (O2)n− and trapped O2, which serves to relieve and eventually eliminate the magnetic frustration. This (O2)n−/O2 formation mechanism, termed "magnetic-frustration-driven mechanism", provides a plausible explanation for the formation of trapped O2 in the systems with strong covalent TM–O bonds. Accordingly, we emphasize that improvement strategies should not only enhance the covalent TM–O bonds but also relieve strong magnetic frustration.

Atomic oxygen, due to its unique chemical properties, is widely used in astrophysics to study chemical composition, nucleosynthesis conditions, and the processes of formation and evolution. The recent detection of the O I 1304 Å and 7774 Å lines in the upper atmospheres of exoplanets using space and ground-based telescopes opens the possibility to evaluate its abundance in these objects and constrain important atmospheric parameters. However, the simple approximation of thermodynamic equilibrium is often inaccurate in describing the formation and absorption for many spectral lines in stars and hot exoplanets. The development of a kinetic model that takes into account detailed radiative and collisional processes in advanced atomic models is required to interpret the observations. In this work we for the first time analyze the advantages of transit absorption measurement of two oxygen lines simultaneously.

Abstract From a spectroscopic survey of candidate H ii regions in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with MMT/Hectospec, we have identified 294 H ii regions using emission line ratios and calculated elemental abundances from strong-line diagnostics (values ranging from sub-solar to super-solar) producing both Oxygen and Nitrogen radial abundance gradients. The Oxygen gradient is relatively flat, while the Nitrogen gradient is significantly steeper, indicating a higher N/O ratio in M31’s inner regions, consistent with recent simulations of galaxy chemical evolution. No strong evidence was found of systematic galaxy-scale trends beyond the radial gradient. After subtracting the radial gradient from abundance values, we find an apparently stochastic and statistically significant scatter of standard deviation 0.06 dex, which exceeds measurement uncertainties. One explanation includes a possible collision with M32 200 - 800 Myrs ago. Using the two-point correlation function of the Oxygen abundance, we find that, similar to other spiral galaxies, M31 is well-mixed on sub-kpc scales but less so on larger (kpc) scales, which could be a result of an exponential decrease in mixing speed with spatial scale, and the aforementioned recent merger. Finally, the MMT spectroscopy is complemented by a dust continuum and CO survey of individual Giant Molecular Clouds, conducted with the Submillimeter Array. By combining the MMT and SMA observations, we obtain a unique direct test of the Oxygen abundance dependence of the α′(12CO) factor which is crucial to convert CO emission to dust mass. Our results suggest that within our sample there is no trend of the α′(12CO) with Oxygen abundance.

The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are excellent locations to study stellar dust emission and its contribution to galaxy evolution. Through spectral and photometric classification, MCs can serve as a unique environment for studying stellar evolution and galaxies enriched by dusty stellar point sources. We applied machine learning classifiers to spectroscopically labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, which involved 12 multiwavelength filters and 618 stellar objects at the MCs. We classified stars into five categories: young stellar objects (YSOs), carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars, oxygen-rich AGB (OAGB) stars, red supergiants (RSG), and post-AGB (PAGB) stars. Following this, we augmented the distribution of imbalanced classes using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Therefore, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy, reaching 89% based on the recall metric, in categorizing dusty stellar sources before and after data augmentation. In this study, SMOTE did not impact the classification accuracy for the CAGB, PAGB, and RSG categories but led to changes in the performance of the OAGB and YSO classes.

Since the long-range structure of the Gd-doped system (Ce1−xGdxO2−x/2) remains in the fluorite structure in the x-range [0–0.3], it is of interest to study this system in the local range. Molecular dynamics simulations seem to be particularly suitable for this purpose. Among all the possible parameters used to describe the local order/disorder, we focus on the behavior of the bond lengths. Doping cations and oxygen vacancies are introduced inside the fluorite structure following two arrangements, the random (R) and the neighbor (N). We investigate the evolution of the bond lengths with the temperature and doping level and identify different trends depending on the bond type (cation–anion, cation–cation). The bond length thermal expansion can be drastically different from the long-range thermal expansion mainly for the bonds implying Gd3+ cation. The presence of C-type Gd2O3 clusters is discussed through the study of the double component of the Gd–Gd Radial Distribution Function. Comments are provided for evolution of distances beyond the first and second shells of the cations’ environment. This study also demonstrates the impact of point defect distribution (R or N) on the evolution of the local structure, while maintaining the long-range fluorite structure.

Abstract The dissolution of sulfide minerals in subsurface porous media has important environmental implications. We investigate the oxidative dissolution of pyrite under evaporative conditions and advance a mechanistic understanding of the interactions between multiple physical processes and mineral/surface reactions. We performed a set of experiments in which initially water saturated and anoxic soil columns, containing a top layer of pyrite, are exposed to the atmosphere under no evaporation (single‐phase) and natural evaporative (two‐phase) conditions. The oxidative dissolution of pyrite was monitored by non‐invasive high‐resolution measurements of oxygen and pH. Additionally, we developed and applied a multiphase and multicomponent reactive transport model to quantitatively describe the experimental outcomes and elucidate the interplay between the physico‐chemical mechanisms controlling the extent of pyrite dissolution. The results confirm that the extent of pyrite dissolution under single‐phase conditions was constrained by the slow diffusive transport of oxygen in the liquid phase. In contrast, during evaporation, the evolution of fluid phases and interphase mass transfer processes imposed distinct physical constraints on the dynamics of pyrite oxidation. Initially, the invasion of the gaseous phase led to a fast delivery of high oxygen concentrations in the reactive zone and thus markedly increased pyrite oxidation and acidity/sulfate production. However, such enhanced release of reaction products was progressively limited over time as drying conditions prevailed in the reactive zone and inhibited pyrite oxidation. The transient phase displacement was also found to control the distribution of aqueous species and formation of secondary minerals by creating spatio‐temporally variable redox conditions.

In this paper investigates the Methylene Blue degradation using two common reactors: the nanosecond pulsed discharge in oxygen bubbles and the Argon Microwave plasma jet above the treated solution. The aim of this study is to compare the evolution of the reactors' performance when the electrical conductivity increases. In deionized water, the Methylene Blue degradation and the energy efficiency in the nanosecond pulsed discharge configuration were significantly higher than the Argon microwave plasma jet. However, when the solution electrical conductivity is increased, the energy efficiency of the nanosecond pulsed discharge drops significantly by ~82%, whereas the performance of the microwave plasma jet reactors decreases by ~37% only for a greater variation of the electrical conductivity of the solution. Under these conditions, the efficiency of both reactors becomes comparable, suggesting the necessity to consider various parameters to compare the reactors' efficiency.

Zn-air batteries (ZABs) present high energy density and high safety but suffer from low oxygen reaction reversibility and dendrite growth at Zn electrode in alkaline electrolytes. Non-alkaline electrolytes have been considered recently for improving the interfacial processes in ZABs. However, the dynamic evolution and reaction mechanisms regulated by electrolytes at both the positive and Zn negative electrodes remain elusive. Herein, using in situ atomic force microscopy, we disclose that thin ZnO2 nanosheets deposit in non-alkaline electrolyte during discharge, followed by the formation of low-modulus products encircled around them. During recharge, the nanosheets are completely decomposed, revealing the favorable reversibility of the O2/ZnO2 chemistry. The circular outlines with low-modulus, composed of C = C and ZnCO3, are left which play a key role in promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during the subsequent cycles. In addition, in situ optical microscopy shows that Zn can be uniformly dissolved and deposited in non-alkaline electrolyte, with the formation of homogeneous solid electrolyte interphase. Our work provides straightforward evidence and in-depth understanding of the interfacial reactions at both electrode interfaces in non-alkaline electrolyte, which can inspire strategies of interfacial engineering and material design of advanced ZABs. Zinc-air batteries typically employ alkaline electrolytes and the fundamental understanding of their operation with non-alkaline electrolytes is less explored. Here, authors use in situ atomic force microscopy to elucidate the interfacial reactions at both electrodes in non-alkaline electrolytes.

Abstract The design of cathode/electrolyte interfaces in high‐energy density Li‐ion batteries is critical to protect the surface against undesirable oxygen release from the cathodes when batteries are charged to high voltage. However, the involvement of the engineered interface in the cationic and anionic redox reactions associated with (de‐)lithiation is often ignored, mostly due to the difficulty to separate these processes from chemical/catalytic reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Here, a new electron energy band diagrams concept is developed that includes the examination of the electrochemical‐ and ionization‐ potentials evolution upon batteries cycling. The approach enables to forecast the intrinsic stability of the cathodes and discriminate the reaction pathways associated with interfacial electronic charge‐transfer mechanisms. Specifically, light is shed on the evolution of cationic and anionic redox in high‐energy density lithium‐rich 0.33Li 2 MnO 3 ·0.67LiNi 0.4 Co 0.2 Mn 0.4 O 2 (HE‐NCM) cathodes, particularly those that undergo surface modification through SO 2 and NH 3 double‐gas treatment to suppress the structural degradation. The chemical composition and energy distribution of the occupied and unoccupied electronic states at the different charging/discharging states are quantitatively estimated by using advanced spectroscopy techniques, including operando Raman spectroscopy. The concept is successfully demonstrated in designing artificial interfaces for high‐voltage olivine structure cathodes enabling stable battery operation up to 5.1 V versus Li + /Li.

The high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses distinctive thermal stability and electronic characteristics, which exhibits substantial potential for diverse applications in electrocatalytic reactions. However, accurately controlling the size of HEA still remains a challenge, especially for the ultrasmall HEA nanoparticles. Herein, we firstly calculate and illustrate the size impact on the electronic structure of HEA and the adsorption energies of crucial intermediates in typical electrocatalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) and NO3– electroreduction (NO3RR). Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, we synthesize a range of ultrasmall PtRuPdCoNi HEA nanoparticles with adjustable sizes (1.7, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9 nm) using a one‐step spatially confined approach. Specifically, HEA nanoparticles with 1.7 nm size (HEA‐1.7) endows a 16 mV overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm−2, yielding a mass activity of 31.9 A mgNM‐1 of noble metal in HER, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy can also be easily applicable to other reduction reactions attributed to the richness of metal components and size adjustability, presenting a promising platform for various electrocatalytic applications as advanced catalysts.

In this study, GQDs/WO3 composite porous photoanodes were fabricated using a pulsed anodization method in an aqueous electrolyte containing hydroxyl GQDs. The morphology and crystal structure of the as-prepared GQDs/WO3 porous films were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, Raman spectra, and FTIR. The successful embedding of GQDs into the WO3 walls to form tightly bound heterojunctions was confirmed. It was investigated how the GQD content influenced the photoelectrochemical properties of the GQDs/WO3 heterojunctions. The optimal photocurrent densities observed in the GQDs/WO3 samples (10-WO3) were found to be three times higher compared to those obtained from pure WO3 porous films. This significant enhancement clearly indicates the positive impact of GQDs on the PEC performance. The boosted PEC activity of the GQDs/WO3 heterojunction photoanode was attributed to the fact that the introduction of GQDs promotes more efficient light absorption, charge separation, and transport processes within the heterojunction structure. Moreover, the GQDs/WO3 composites photoelectrodes exhibited excellent PEC stability, predicting its enormous potential for practical applications.

ABSTRACT The plant defense against insects is multiple layers of interactions. They defend through direct defense and indirect defense. Direct defenses include both physical and chemical barriers that hinder insect growth, development, and reproduction. In contrast, indirect defenses do not affect insects directly but instead suppress them by releasing volatile compounds that attract the natural enemies of herbivores. Insects overcome plant defenses by deactivating biochemical defenses, suppressing defense signaling through effectors, and altering their behavior through chemical regulation. There is always a genetic war between plants and insects. In this genetic war, plant–insect co‐evolution act as both weapons and messengers. Because plants always look for new strategies to avoid insects by developing adaptation. There are molecular processes that regulate the interaction between plants and insect. Here, we examine the genes and proteins involved in plant–insect interactions and explore how their discovery has shaped the current model of the plant genome's role. Plants detect damage‐associated and herbivore‐associated molecular patterns through receptors, which trigger early signaling pathways involving Ca 2+ , reactive oxygen species, and MAP kinases. The specific defense mechanisms are activated through gene signaling pathways, including phytohormones, secondary metabolites, and transcription factors. Expanding plant genome approaches to unexplored dimensions in fending off insects should be a future priority in order to develop management strategies.

Herein, we first report a photocatalytic OCM using CO2 as a soft oxidant for C2H6 production under mild conditions, where an efficient photocatalyst with unique interface sites is constructed to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, while concurrently boosting CH4 dissociation. As a prototype, the Au quantum dots anchored on oxygen‐deficient TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the Au‐Vo‐Ti interface sites for CO2 adsorption and activation are collectively disclosed by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, quasi in situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Compared with single metal site, the Au‐Vo‐Ti interface sites exhibit the lower CO2 adsorption energy and decrease the energy barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation step from 1.05 to 0.77 eV via Au‐C and Ti‐O dual‐site bonding. The adsorbed CO2 reduces the energy barrier of *CH4 dissociation to *CH3 from 2.13 to 1.59 eV, contributing to CH4 oxidation. Additionally, in situ Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy unveils the Au site facilitates ethane production by engaging in *CH3‐Au interaction and accelerating CH3‐CH3 coupling. Thus, the photocatalyst demonstrates a high C2H6 evolution rate of 2.60 mmol g‐1 h‐1 for OCM using CO2 as the soft oxidant, surpassing most of previously reported photocatalysts regardless of OCM and nonoxidative coupling of methane.

We report on a series of SrMo1-xMnxO3-δ perovskite oxides designed as potential anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). These materials were synthesized using a citrate method, yielding scheelite-type precursors with nominal SrMo1-xMnxO4 compositions, which were further reduced to obtain the active perovskite oxides. Their structural evolution was examined through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD). These techniques provided insights into the crystallographic changes upon Mn doping, revealing key factors influencing ionic conductivity. Whereas the oxidized scheelite precursors are tetragonal, space group I41/a, the reduced perovskite specimens are cubic, space group Pm-3m, and show the conspicuous absence of oxygen vacancies, even at the highest temperature of 800ºC. The transport properties were analyzed through electrical conductivity measurements, exhibiting a metallic-like behavior. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dilatometry give insights into the thermal stability and expansion behavior, essential for SOFC operation. Test single SOFC were built in an electrolyte-supported configuration, on LSGM pellets of 300m thickness, assessing the performance of the title materials as anodes. This work emphasizes the critical relationship between the crystal structure and its electrochemical behavior, providing a deeper understanding of how doping strategies can optimize fuel cell performance.

Abstract Ruthenium (Ru)‐based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are promising candidates for assembling high‐performance anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) while their intrinsic activities are restricted due to the strong Ru─H bond strength. Herein, we present the synthesis and stabilization of electron‐deficient Ru nanoclusters on oxygen‐functionalized carbon nanotube (Ru/O‐CNT) via strong electronic metal‐support interaction (EMSI) toward highly efficient and stable alkaline HER. A scalable high‐temperature shock method is used to anchor Ru nanoclusters on O‐CNT, which suppresses the aggregation of Ru clusters and the loss of O anion during synthesis, thus strengthening the EMSI between the two components via Ru–O–C link. The strong EMSI helps to stabilize Ru at electron‐deficient state at reductive potentials and optimizes the Ru─H bond strength. Consequently, Ru/O‐CNT delivers outstanding performances for alkaline HER with a small overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , which is superior to the benchmark Pt/C and most reported Ru‐based electrocatalysts. More impressively, an AEMWE assembled with Ru/O‐CNT as cathode achieves high current densities of 1 and 5 A cm −2 at low cell voltages of 1.68 and 2.09 V, respectively, at a Ru mass loading of only 20 µg cm −2 .

Manifestations of sulfuric acid speleogenesis (SAS) documented in several caves in the areas of Aghia Paraskevi, Konitsa, W. Peloponnese, Elassona, Lavrion and Kammena Vourla in Greece are examined and discussed in this work. Carbonate and sulfate samples collected from caves in Aghia Paraskevi and western Peloponnese areas were investigated using methods, such as fluid inclusion, scanning electron microscopy, carbon, sulfur and oxygen stable isotopes, X-ray powder diffraction, and chemical analysis. The examined caves are mainly developed at or in the proximity of the local water table and they are related to hydrothermal springs and geothermal fields. In addition to the documentation of SAS in one case study from Aghia Paraskevi, calcite spar with a homogenization temperature peak at 280°C, indicates an early speleogenetic stage that involves meteoric-origin hydrothermal fluids under deep-seated settings. Sulfur isotope composition of sulfates (–4 ‰) is indicative for pyrite oxidation. The Konitsa caves represent a system developed at multiple altitudes that is related to the evolution of Sarantaporos River. The caves in West Peloponnese are located in two different geotectonic units. However, the caves in both units are active and share common characteristics, such as their development near sea level, morphology and fracture-guided pattern, and the presence of gypsum with δ34S values (average –26 ‰) that are plausibly related to hydrocarbons and bacterial activity. Morphological and geochemical aspects of the caves in these two regions suggest long-lasting, multiphase speleogenetic systems.

Herein, we first report a photocatalytic OCM using CO2 as a soft oxidant for C2H6 production under mild conditions, where an efficient photocatalyst with unique interface sites is constructed to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, while concurrently boosting CH4 dissociation. As a prototype, the Au quantum dots anchored on oxygen‐deficient TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the Au‐Vo‐Ti interface sites for CO2 adsorption and activation are collectively disclosed by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, quasi in situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Compared with single metal site, the Au‐Vo‐Ti interface sites exhibit the lower CO2 adsorption energy and decrease the energy barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation step from 1.05 to 0.77 eV via Au‐C and Ti‐O dual‐site bonding. The adsorbed CO2 reduces the energy barrier of *CH4 dissociation to *CH3 from 2.13 to 1.59 eV, contributing to CH4 oxidation. Additionally, in situ Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy unveils the Au site facilitates ethane production by engaging in *CH3‐Au interaction and accelerating CH3‐CH3 coupling. Thus, the photocatalyst demonstrates a high C2H6 evolution rate of 2.60 mmol g‐1 h‐1 for OCM using CO2 as the soft oxidant, surpassing most of previously reported photocatalysts regardless of OCM and nonoxidative coupling of methane.

ABSTRACT The low‐permeability oil‐bearing tuffaceous sandstones of the second member of the lower Jurassic Sangonghe Formation (J 1 s 2 ) in the Well Pen‐1 west sag of the central Junggar Basin occur in a deep burial setting (> 4000 m). They contain abundant oil and gas shows and hold promising exploration prospects. However, the reservoir heterogeneity is strong due to complex lithofacies and diagenesis, leading to significant productivity differences between adjacent wells. Therefore, identifying the lithofacies and diagenesis of the J 1 s 2 sandstones and elucidating their influence on the evolution of relatively high‐quality reservoirs is of utmost importance for oil and gas exploration and development in this area. Samples from the Well Pen‐1 west sag, representing the J 1 s 2 sandstones, were investigated utilising core and thin section observations, scanning electron microscopy, X‐ray diffraction, fluid inclusions and carbon and oxygen isotope analyses. The J 1 s 2 sandstones are mainly medium‐ to fine‐grained and moderate‐ to‐well‐sorted feldspathic litharenites and litharenites. The tuffaceous contents range from 2.6% to 25% and the authigenic clay contents, produced by diagenesis, range from 0.6% to 12%, although carbonate cements are not abundant (av. 3.1%). Four sandstone lithofacies have been identified based on mineral compositions, leading to variations in diagenetic evolution and reservoir quality. Early diagenetic events included compaction, alteration of tuffaceous matrix and feldspar, and development of smectite, chlorite, kaolinite and early calcite. Mesogenic alteration included feldspar and tuffaceous matrix dissolution, alteration of kaolinite, chlorite and illite, and precipitation of quartz, anhydrite, late calcite and ferrocalcite. The alteration of the tuffaceous matrix resulted in a complex pore‐throat structure in the J 1 s 2 sandstones. The pebbly sandstone and conglomerate (SC) and fine‐grained sandstone (Sm) lithofacies are generally characterised by high compaction resistance, low tuffaceous matrix and cement contents, and abundant secondary dissolution pores, and they exhibit better reservoir quality and great potential for oil and gas enrichment.

The role of subducting slab-derived supercritical fluids in transferring oxidized components in subduction zones remains poorly constrained. We investigated the oxidation state and effect of supercritical fluids by a combined study of petrology and geochemistry on an ultrahigh-pressure eclogite-vein system from the Dabie orogen, China. These samples record the composition and evolution of supercritical fluids at subarc depths. Multiphase crystal inclusions trapped within minerals in the vein encompass calcite, anhydrite, and magnetite, suggesting that the supercritical fluids contain such cations as S6+, C4+, and Fe3+. Whole-rock and mineral compositions of the eclogites vary systematically with distance from the vein, suggesting that the eclogites adjacent to the vein were metasomatized by vein-forming supercritical fluids. The garnet-clinopyroxene oxybarometric results indicate that the metasomatism of supercritical fluids resulted in the elevation of oxygen fugacity in the eclogites. The metasomatized eclogites exhibit decreases in Fe and S contents, Fe3+/Fetotal ratios, and modes of omphacite and pyrite. This observation suggests that the supercritical fluids dissolving omphacite and pyrite were accompanied by a Fe-S redox coupling process during fluid-rock reactions. This process further releases Fe3+ and S6+ from the eclogites to supercritical fluids. In combination with the mineral composition of the vein, it is inferred that sulfur was likely transported farther by the supercritical fluids. Therefore, some supercritical fluids were oxidizing at the subducting slab-mantle wedge interface and thus can oxidize the metasomatized rocks. Therefore, supercritical fluids are efficient carriers of oxidized components from the subducting slab to the mantle wedge, eventually contributing to the oxidization of arc magma sources.

Realization of a sustainable hydrogen economy in the future requires the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for its production at scale. MXenes (Mn+1Xn) are a class of 2D materials with 'n' layers of carbon or nitrogen (X) interleaved by 'n+1' layers of transition metal (M) and have emerged as promising materials for various applications including catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Their properties are intimately related to both their composition and their atomic structure. Recently, high entropy MXenes were synthesized, opening a vast compositional space of potentially stable and functionally superior materials. Detailed atomistic modeling enables us to systematically explore this extensive design space, which is otherwise infeasible in experiments. We have developed a Neural Network Potential (NNP) to model (TixVyNbzMop)n+1Cn MXenes (x+y+z+p = 1; n = 1,2,3) by training against Density Functional Theory (DFT) data in an active learning fashion. We then used the developed NNP to perform hybrid Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD) simulations to identify thermodynamically stable compositions and investigate the relative arrangement of transition metal atoms within and across layers. Thermodynamic stability increased with Mo content and its presence on the surface layer. We further investigated the catalytic performance of stable MXenes for the HER and observed that the center of the oxygen p-band (εp) correlated well with the energy of adsorption of a hydrogen atom ΔG(*H). Subsurface metal atoms significantly influenced the ΔG(*H) values at the surface via both ligand and strain effects. Our work expands the space of potentially stable MXene compositions, providing targets for synthesis and their evaluation in various applications.

Opportunistic bacterial infections emerging from the environment are an increasing threat, especially for immunocompromised individuals such as people with cystic fibrosis (CF), driving morbidity, and mortality. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen from this group associated with chronic lung infections that has been extensively studied in this context, but the mechanism driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung is not fully understood. This work focuses on the adaptations of P. aeruginosa to long-term hypoxia, one of the important environmental pressures present in the CF lung, to investigate whether it drives the development of persistence in CF patients. We examined how an early CF isolate adapted to 6% oxygen over 28 days using an experimental evolution approach and showed that two distinct P. aeruginosa small colony variants (SCVs) emerged, one exclusively in hypoxia exposure cultures. Importantly, SCVs were more prevalent in hypoxia-adapted cultures than in normoxia-adapted cultures (98% vs <35%). Proteomic analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of >200 proteins within 28 days, including proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, stress response, iron acquisition, biofilm formation and those previously associated with chronic infection. Importantly the observed changes in the proteome were distinct from changes reported after short-term exposure to hypoxia. Phenotypic characterisation of adapted cultures supported these findings, showing that hypoxia-adapted cultures developed higher resistance to 8 of 13 antibiotics tested; increased biofilm (1.8-4.1-fold (p<0.0001) and decreased pyocyanin production (2.6-fold, p<0.0001). All hypoxia-adapted cultures showed decreased siderophore production (2.9-3.6-fold, p<0.02). Two distinct patterns of adaptation to hypoxic conditions were observed, with the phenotypes of one culture being markedly different from the other two. Overall, we demonstrate that long-term hypoxia exposure contributes to multiple phenotype and proteome changes that are also observed in P. aeruginosa CF lung chronic infection, possibly opening the path to treatment of chronic infections.

These batteries offer enhanced safety, stability, and potential for high energy density, addressing limitations of conventional liquid-state designs, such as flammability and side reactions under operational conditions. This perspective reviews the latest advancements in solid-state Li-O2 batteries, focusing on performance metrics such as cycle life, areal capacity, and current density. Material selections from recent studies are examined. Key reporting practices, such as liquid content, operation temperature, availability of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry results, and reporting completeness on loading information are summarized. Additionally, relationships among various performance metrics are explored. Despite significant progress, solid-state Li-O2 batteries continue to face limitations with low current densities and limited cycle capacities, indicating that existing materials and designs have yet to fully exploit the technology's theoretical potential. This analysis highlights areas for future research, particularly in stability and interfacial engineering, to bridge the gap toward commercially viable, high-energy-density solid-state Li-O2 batteries. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction In recent years, the global push to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources has significantly boosted the demand for next-generation energy storage devices. As a critical component of these devices, battery technology has become central to meeting the increasing energy density requirements brought by advancements in electric vehicles (EVs), commercial aviation, locomotives, and portable electronics. The lithium-oxygen battery (LOB) is recognized for having the highest theoretical energy density among current battery technologies, capable of delivering a specific energy of up to 5.2 kWh/kg, far exceeding the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries.1–3 A typical liquid-state LOB generally comprises a lithium metal anode, a separator, a porous cathode, and an electrolyte.4 In the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge, lithium atoms lose electrons on the anode and become Li+ ions, which are then transported to the cathode to react with O2 and electrons, forming lithium peroxide (Li2O2). In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging, Li2O2 decomposes into Li+ ions and O2; the Li+ ions then diffuse back to the anode, where they gain electrons to reform lithium metal. Liquid electrolytes facilitate faster Li+ ion transport and maintain excellent contact between active materials, enabling efficient electrochemical reactions. However, liquid-state LOBs are limited to electrolyte instability, parasitic reactions with oxygen, and safety concerns related to flammability, which hinder their long-term performance and reliability. Solid-state LOBs utilize solid electrolytes, which improve electrolyte stability, extend cycle life, and enhance potential energy density. Solid electrolytes are less flammable than liquid electrolytes, providing greater safety and stability by reducing degradation and minimizing undesirable side reactions with oxygen. Additionally, the compact design and lighter weight of the electrolyte in solid-state LOBs enable higher potential energy density. Solid-state electrolytes can also mitigate lithium dendrite formation and provide better compatibility with lithium metal anodes, both of which are essential for maximizing energy density.5,6 Though promising, several challenges restrict the energy density and practical applications of solid-state LOBs. These challenges include interfacial impedance between battery component layers, the stability of solid-state electrolytes when exposed to air, low ionic conductivity, compatibility and reactivity with lithium metal, and scalability of production processes.7–14 Researchers have attempted to address these challenges by exploring various materials for solid-state electrolyte (SSE), adding interlayers between electrodes, incorporating small amount of liquid electrolytes, and operating cells at temperatures above room temperature.15 Despite the growing diversity of material choices and significant improvements in cell performance, the path to achieving practical, high-energy-density solid-state LOBs remains distant. In this article, we will summarize recent research progress and trends, examine key reporting practices and experimental conditions, and explore the correlation among various performance metrics. All discussions are based on quantitative metrics extracted from a large majority of research papers published between 2009 and 2024 on solid-state/quasi solid-state/hybrid LOBs (totaling 48, collected data set can be found in Supporting Information spreadsheet).16–41 In this work, current density and specific capacity are consistently compared using the units of mA/cm2 and mAh/cm2, respectively. We find that while solid-state LOBs have made progress in material selections and performances, they remain limited by low current densities, cycle capacities, and interfacial stability issues. Inconsistent reporting practices, particularly on liquid content, operational conditions, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS)/titration data, and loading information hinder accurate comparisons across studies. Addressing these challenges and standardizing reporting are essential steps toward realizing the commercial potential of solid-state lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries. Research Progress and Trends Cycle current density is a critical parameter for evaluating the rate capability and efficiency of solid-state LOBs. Figure 1a shows the reported cycle current densities over time, ranging from 2009 to 2024. The data indicates a diverse range of current densities explored in the range of 0.013–0.516 mA/cm2. A high proportion, 86.7%, of research works have primarily focused on low current densities, which are define as less than 0.3 mA/cm2. Only three studies reported current densities above 0.5 mA/cm2. However, the two of the studies used a specific amount of liquid electrolyte,25,30 while another study demonstrated its performance for only 10 cycles.17 In addition, there is no clear trend of increasing current densities over the years (Figure 1a), indicating that the cycle performance of solid-state LOBs is limited to low current densities. At higher current densities, the number of achievable cycles decreases significantly. Similarly, the reported cycle capacities are generally low, with 90.9% of reported values under 1 mAh/cm2 (Figure 1b). However, they were either incorporated with certain amounts of liquid electrolyte21,22,38 or operated at high temperatures.27 In fact, it appears that studies of recent years have clustered to an areal capacity range of 0.1–0.5 mAh/cm2, suggesting it has become a sort of standard practice to remain within these bounds for cycling. One of the possible reasons is that the electrochemical efficiencies of these cells are insufficient to support long-term cycling at high rates. It is known that Li2O2 titration and DEMS are effective approaches to examine the efficiency of OER and ORR. Unfortunately, our analysis indicates that Li2O2 titration and DEMS results are missing from many papers. This will be further discussed in a later section. Figure 1 | Research progress and trends. (a) Cycle current densities; (b) cycle capacity; (c) cycle number; and (d) throughput capacity over time, ranging from 2009 to 2024. Download figure Download PowerPoint Interestingly, we still observed a steady increase in cycle life over time for solid-state LOB (Figure 1c). Given the significant impact of the volume of liquid electrolyte on the performance of solid-state LOBs, it is important to point out that there are two clear groups of studies. Articles that incorporate high liquid (>5 uL) and those that incorporate none to limited amounts (>5 uL) of explicitly added electrolyte. When these two groups are separated (Figure 1c inset), the increasing trend in cycle life becomes arguably more pronounced. The magnitude of such trends proved to be deceiving. Unfortunately, upon a more detailed investigation, the upward trends in cycle life are very much amplified due to the decreasing trend in cycling capacity that used during long cycle tests. If we adopt a figure of metric for Li metal anodes, the throughput capacity,42,43 the cycling capacity is also taken into account by computing a total cycled capacity (areal capacity × cycle number), and we can see that the grouping of the performance over the years becomes tighter with a significantly weaker upward trend. Specifically, solid-state LOBs could only operate for less than 132 cycles before 2019, while the cycle life of cells have been extensively improved in the recent years. Notably, the cycle life of a Li2O-based solid-state LOB44 and a cell with an integrated cathode/electrolyte structure45 has reached 1000 cycles. Both works focus on solving at least one of the essential challenges of solid-state LOBs. An LOB with Li2O as the main discharge product, produced through a four-electron process, can achieve significantly higher energy density compared to an LOB with Li2O2 as the main discharge product, which is formed through a two-electron process. More importantly, Li2O can be generated at a lower charge potential, reducing the formation of side products and minimizing SSE degradation, thereby extending cycle life. Meanwhile, the integrated cathode and electrolyte was proven to be an effective approach to mitigating the high interfacial impedance issue which has already been recognized as one of the main challenges for solid-state LOBs. The solid-state cells from these two works exhibited both long cycle life and high throughput capacity. Both cases encourage a strategic focus on addressing fundamental challenges in solid-state LOBs. By concentrating on these critical issues, researchers are making significant progress in improving the longevity and overall performance of solid-state LOBs, advancing them toward practical application. This analysis shows that the performance of solid-state LOBs has improved to some extent over the past decade. However, most studies are limited to low current densities and small specific capacities, indicating that current solid-state materials or solid-state LOB systems are not yet capable of supporting high areal capacity cycle testing effectively. Among these 48 research articles, there exists a large range of different materials with different performances. The types of SSE materials used from 2009 to 2024 are shown in Figure 2a. They were primarily categorized into five classes: polymer, lithium lanthanum titanium oxide (LLTO), lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO), lithium aluminium germanium phosphate (LAGP) or LATP, and composite types. Polymer refers to SSEs primarily composed of a polymer matrix and Li+ salt. LLTO, LLZO, and LAGP or LATP refer to SSEs where these materials constitute the majority composition, without polymers. The composite type includes SSEs made from Li+ salt, polymers, and additional materials such as metal–organic frameworks, perovskite (LLTO), garnet (LLZO or LLZTO), or NASICON-type (LAGP or LATP) materials. It is clear that NASICON-type and polymer type are always common choices across the decades. LLZO and composite types have been extensively studied since 2017. After 2021, composite types have become the primary choice for SSE. This shift likely reflects researchers' efforts to address a wider range of challenges by incorporating diverse materials into SSEs, thereby enhancing overall performance factors such as mechanical stability, ionic conductivity, and interface impedance. Figure 2 | Materials for SSE. (a) Materials selection trend for SSE over time; (b) Cycle life; and (c) throughput capacity distribution for different SSE materials. Download figure Download PowerPoint The cycle life and throughput capacity distribution for different SSE materials are shown in Figure 2b,c. Composite type SSE show the widest range of cycle number and throughput capacities, suggesting that composites are relatively mature among the material studied, though high cycle life (>200) remains rare. The LAGP/LATP group shows most studies distributed in the low cycle life (0–50 and 50–100) and low throughput capacity (0–10 and 10–25), indicating that these materials often experience early capacity fade, potentially due to instability of SSE materials and high interfacial impedance. Two studies report exceptionally high throughput capacities exceeding 200; however, their cells were immersed in a certain amount of ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) liquid electrolyte. The LLTO and LLZO types exhibit similar moderate cycle life and throughput capacity, though LLZO studies scatter across a wider range. Polymer-based solid-state LOBs show a relatively even distribution across all ranges, suggesting varied performance outcomes depending on other factors, such as specific polymer formulation and cell design. Though composite and polymer types show potential in terms of cycle life and throughput capacity, there is still significant room for improvement across all material types. In addition, the composite-type solid-state LOBs with an integrated SSE/cathode structure is a promising strategy to solve the interfacial impedance issue.46 This design minimizes the physical and chemical mismatches at the interface, leading to improved ionic conductivity and reduced resistance. Additionally, the integrated structure enhances mechanical stability, mitigates the formation of voids or cracks during cycling, and ensures better contact between active materials, ultimately improving cycle life and overall cell performance. Achieving high cycle life and throughput capacity in solid-state LOBs remains challenging, especially for LAGP/LATP, LLTO, and LLZO materials. This suggests that future research should prioritize enhancing the stability and compatibility of these materials. Additionally, optimizing the composition and structure of composites and polymers could further enhance their performance, positioning them as one of the leading candidates for the next generation of solid-state LOBs. The average throughput capacity, cycle number, and operating current density of each type of SSE materials are summarized in Supporting Information Figure S1. Polymer-based electrolytes exhibit the highest cycle numbers, suggesting superior stability during cycling. However, their throughput capacity is moderate, indicating potential limitations in achieving high capacity. LAGP/LATP and composite materials show relatively balanced performance, with moderate cycle numbers and decent throughput capacities. This balance may make them suitable for applications where both cycle number and capacity are critical. LLZO displays a lower throughput capacity but competitive cycle numbers, while LLTO demonstrates higher throughput capacity, indicating potential for high-rate applications. Reporting Practices Due to the rather nascent nature of the field of solid-state LOB, reporting practices are not as well established as adjacent battery fields. At times, there are crucial details that are missing from articles that can greatly sway the conclusion of the study. One such detail is the degree of liquid addition. An all-solid-state LOB is appealing due to its potential for achieving high energy density and excellent safety performance. However, the cycle performance of all-solid-state LOBs is severely limited by poor interfacial contact. To enhance the overall performance of solid-state LOBs, researchers have opted to incorporate liquid electrolytes during cell fabrication. Several methods are used to achieve this: (1) adding a "few" microliters of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) to the SSE slurry during membrane fabrication; (2) soaking the SSE in a 1 M LiTFSI solution with TEGDME as the solvent; (3) adding a few microliters of 1 M LiTFSI with TEGDME to the cathode during cell assembly. The boiling point of TEGDME is as high as 275 °C, which is hard to evaporate even under vacuum conditions. We summarized the percentage of SSEs incorporating liquid electrolyte across all 48 studies. Any study that explicitly described using one of the liquid incorporation methods mentioned above was considered a liquid inclusive study. As shown in Figure 3a, 35.4% of studies incorporated liquid electrolyte or solvent. In 64.6% of the studies, there was no claim of the direct use of liquid electrolyte. However, it is also noted that common polymer solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF), cannot be fully removed by vacuum drying at typical temperatures of 50–80 °C, as used in many studies.7 These solvent molecules can also interact with Li+ salt molecules, making complete removal unlikely. Therefore, 64.6% of studies cannot be conclusively classified as fully solid-state LOBs, as residual liquid may remain in the SSEs. Based on these criteria, we have identified eight studies that likely describe 100% all-solid-state electrolytes with negligible liquid content, as noted in Supporting Information Table S1. These electrolytes are predominantly LAGP- or LLZO-based and are fabricated using methods such as cold pressing, hot pressing, or sintering. Figure 3 | Reporting practices. (a) Percentage of studies incorporating liquid in solid-state LOBs. (b) Distribution of operation temperature for solid-state LOBs. (c) Availability of DEMS results across 48 papers. (d) Number of loading information reported across 48 papers. Download figure Download PowerPoint Though performance improved, the involvement of liquid electrolyte or solvent would introduce additional challenges: (1) Liquid solvents, such as TEGDME, can still decompose into byproducts, as observed liquid-state LOB cells, leading to increased overpotential and reduced cycle life; (2) the performance improvements brought by liquid residue may diminish over time due to the gradual evaporation of the liquid, such as NMP and DMF; and (3) some solvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide, are known to be reactive with intermediates in the LOB reactions.47 Adding liquid without careful design solely for performance improvement risks being a shortsighted solution without addressing the fundamental issues of solid-state LOBs. The percentage of operation temperature of solid-state LOBs is also summarized in Figure 3b. Of the works, 83.7% focus their studies on room temperature (25 °C). It is known that elevated temperature can improve ion conductivity of SSE, resulting in an improvement of battery performance. Several studies operated their cells at higher temperatures because they used pure LLZO or LAGP to fabricate the SSE, which may imply insufficient conductivity (especially at the interfaces) at room temperature. In general, room temperature solid-state LOBs are more practical, but high temperature solid-state LOBs are also valuable for certain extreme operating conditions. Li2O2 titration and DEMS results are important indicators of ORR and OER efficiency. Li2O2 can be quantified by Ti(IV)OSO4 solution though UV–vis spectroscopy technique or by potassium iodide under acidic conditions, the resulting elemental iodine (I2) can be titrated using sodium thiosulfate solution (Na2S2O3).48,49 DEMS can quantify gas evolution and evaluate electron transfer number of OER process. However, most studies lack titration results, and only 12.5% of them include DEMS data (Figure 3c). It is understandable that the discharge products of LOBs are influenced by various factors, such as SSE materials, liquid fraction, and cathode composition. Additionally, some studies may not focus on the discharge products of the first cycle. However, high-performance solid-state LOBs typically begin with a promising initial result, making it important to include this fundamental information at the early stages of research. Some solid-state LOB systems can even discharge without oxygen or charge in the absence of Li2O2 because the complex battery system includes multiple materials, some of which may decompose during operation. Without basic characterizations, such as discharge product confirmation and DEMS analysis, it is challenging to confirm whether the cell operates via a true oxygen redox electrochemical process or majorly through irreversible side reaction. Future research should prioritize using titration to determine the Li2O2 yield rate during the ORR process and DEMS to measure O2 evolution during the OER process. Combining these results will enable accurate calculations of the true efficiency of solid-state LOBs. Additionally, conducting these tests at various cycle numbers of cycled cells can provide deeper insights into performance degradation and reaction mechanisms over time. Although irreversible, since the cycling areal capacity is controlled to be small, the large mass of cell component can sustain cycling that appears to be reversible. In fact, the mass of many of the cell components remains to be under reported. To estimate energy density of a solid-state LOB, some basic loading information is needed, including mass loading of anode, SSE, cathode, and catalysts/carbon loading on the cathode. The number of loading information reported across the 48 papers is summarized in Figure 3d. Unfortunately, only a meager 4 out of the 48 studies have all information available to calculate energy density at the chemistry level (mass of anode, electrolyte, cathode). Taking the weight of the above battery components without case into account, their energy densities are 33.47, 542.1, and 727.84 Wh/kg.16,30,45 We can observe a trend of improvement in the energy density of solid-state LOBs, increasing from 33.47 Wh/kg in 2009 to 727.84 Wh/kg in 2018, although it still falls short of practical levels.50 More importantly, with 91.7% of studies lacking the necessary loading information to calculate cell energy density, it is difficult to claim whether advancements in energy densities have been made. This indicates that most research groups are not yet focused on achieving high energy density and are likely still studying the fundamental mechanism of the system. To have a better comparison among different studies in the future, it is recommended that all studies report specific loading information of each battery components, especially the unit of performance matrix is mA/g or mAh/g. It is also important to specify liquid addition and operation temperature information. Relationship Among Different Performance Metrics Although energy density cannot be calculated for many of the 48 papers, we can still draw some conclusions about the performance of solid-state LOB. Specifically, the correlations among current densities, throughput capacity, and cycle number are further examined to investigate the research stage of solid-state LOBs. In general, cells cycling at low current densities are expected to achieve a higher cycle number and larger throughput capacity as the Li metal anode is known to behave better at low current densities while the air cathode is known to experience side reaction-inducing overpotential. This appears to be somewhat true when looking at the cycle life versus current density plot shown in Figure 4a. Solid-state LOBs cycled at low current densities tend to have longer cycle numbers. However, when the throughput capacity is used, we see that lower current density does not significantly imply high throughput capacity (Figure 4b). In fact, there is little trend between the throughput capacity versus current density. If the throughput capacity is taken as a more significant metric than cycle number for quantifying performance, this suggests that the current density regime that is commonly operated are not influential to the performance. Other factors beyond current densities, such as interfacial impedance, stability of SSE, ionic conductivity, and compatibility and reactivity with lithium metal, play a more crucial role in determining the performance of solid-state LOBs. Figure 4 | Apparent relationship between different parameters. The correlation between (a) cycle number and current density; (b) throughput capacity and current density; and (c, d) throughput capacity and cycle number with unlimited liquid and limited liquid. Download figure Download PowerPoint The rate capability can depend on the ionic conductivity of SSE, interfacial impedance, and material stability. Ionic conductivity of SSE is not the primary limitation in rate capability of solid-state LOB performance. For example, a typical SSE with an ionic conductivity of 10−4 S/cm, a voltage drop of 0.2 V, and a thickness of around 200 μm can theoretically support a current density of up to 1 mA/cm2, which is already higher than what is reported in most studies. Additionally, even at low rates, high energy density is achievable just as the process is simply slower. Similarly, if the voltage drop across the interface is 0.1 V and interfacial impedance increases from 200 to 500 ohms after long-term cycling, the maximum achievable current density will decrease 0.5–0.2 mA/cm2, reducing the cell rate performance. Such estimation proves the importance of interfacial impedance issues in a solid-state cell. It is also worth noting that the degradation of the SSE and cathode materials due to high current densities can further reduce performance, emphasizing the importance of stability studies. When the cases with unlimited and limited liquid electrolyte are analyzed separately, reasonably strong correlations (R2 = 0.77 or 0.76) are found between throughput capacity and cycle number (Figure 4c,d). This suggests that solid-state LOBs with longer cycle life also tend to have higher throughput capacity. Cells with high long-term stability are more likely to deliver better performance. Based on this, it is important to include more stability related studies, such as analysis of failure mechanisms and degradation of SSE, in research studies. However, most works have not yet incorporated or explored this information in depth. Meanwhile, most studies continue to focus on low cycle life and throughput capacity, indicating that current research on solid-state LOBs remains in the early stages. Conclusion In summary, solid-state Li-O2 batteries hold significant promise for high-energy-density energy storage solutions, suitable for advanced applications such as EVs, aviation, and portable electronics. Despite recent progress in material selection and performance optimization, these batteries still face critical challenges, including low current density, limited cycle capacity, and persistent issues with interfacial impedance and stability. Our analysis suggests that reporting practices, particularly regarding liquid content and operational conditions, are essential to enhance consistency and comparability across studies. Availability of DEMS and titration are important results to ensure that batteries are operating through a true oxygen redox electrochemical process. The loading amount is also essential to calculate and compare energy density of cells across all other solid-state LOB studies and battery chemistries. The relationships among different performance matrixes reveal that current research on solid-state LOBs remains in its infancy. To achieve practic

We calculate the energy dependence of inclusive and diffractive neutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering cross sections within the dipole picture, focusing on the ultrahigh-energy regime. We predict an up to ∼10% nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-oxygen scattering originating from the nonlinear QCD dynamics in the small-x Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. Diffraction is found to be a small 1%−4% contribution to the total cross section across a wide range of neutrino energies relevant for current and near-future experiments. The diffractive cross section is calculated separately for the coherent and incoherent channels that are found to be of equal importance. Additionally, we include the dominant contribution from the |qq¯g⟩ Fock state of the W± and Z bosons in the high-Q2 limit, along with the lowest-order |qq¯⟩ contribution. The |qq¯g⟩ contribution is found to be numerically significant, reaching up to 40% of the diffractive cross section. Published by the American Physical Society 2024

Characterized by confined structures, these materials exhibit exceptional properties that differ fundamentally from their bulk counterparts, including enhanced electronic, optical, chemical, and catalytic functionalities. With applications spanning energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics, low-dimensional nanomaterials offer unparalleled opportunities for developing advanced technologies. (1,13−15,26−29) This Forum (Special Issue) explores the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of low-dimensional nanomaterials, with a particular focus on their role in energy applications.The versatility of low-dimensional nanomaterials lies in their ability to undergo precise tuning at the atomic or molecular level, which allows for optimization in a wide range of energy applications. 0D nanoparticles and clusters, characterized by a high proportion of surface atoms relative to their volume and exhibiting quantum confinement effects, are ideal for catalytic and energy storage applications. For example, FeCo bimetallic alloy nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon significantly enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in zinc–air batteries. (3) This synergy between bimetallic nanoparticles and pyridinic nitrogen-active sites delivers a half-wave potential superior to commercial Pt/C, showcasing the potential of nanoparticle-based catalysts. (3) For lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), boron and phosphorus co-doped silicon nanoparticles (∼7 nm) exhibit high capacity (3300 mAh/g) and cycling stability. These single-nanometer-sized particles mitigate volume expansion during lithiation and demonstrate the value of precise size control in optimizing LIB performance. (4)1D nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanotubes, and nanofibers, enable anisotropic charge and ion transport. Nickel and sulfur co-confinement in nitrogen-rich carbon nanofibers leverages pseudocapacitive charge storage to enhance sodium-ion storage, achieving a high capacity of 320 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and excellent cycling stability. (10)2D materials, including graphene, MXenes, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are celebrated for their tunable interlayer chemistry, high surface area, and unique electronic properties. An article about 2D materials discusses their applications in batteries and highlights their ability to improve ion diffusion and capacity retention. (15) Moreover, post-transition metal monochalcogenides (PTMMCs) represent an advanced class of 2D materials with remarkable electronic and optical properties. These 2D materials, with their tunable bandgap and unique interfacial behaviors, are poised to play a significant role in next-generation devices, including photovoltaics and nanoscale transistors. (30) Additionally, 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites were identified as promising materials for polarization-sensitive photodetectors. (17) Their layered structures enable stability and efficient charge transport, making them ideal for optoelectronic applications. (17)3D architectures and nanocomposites amplify the benefits of low-dimensional materials. Fe7Se8 nanoparticles encapsulated in a carbon skeleton form a core–shell structure that mitigates volume expansion during lithiation. (24) The resulting anode demonstrates a high capacity of 457.8 mAh/g after 300 cycles. (24) A SnO2 nanoflower-holey graphene composite achieves high areal capacity (3 mAh/cm2) in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). (23) This hierarchical 3D structure enhances Na+ transport, ensuring high performance even at high mass loading.The synthesis and assembly of low-dimensional nanomaterials require advanced fabrication techniques. The ability to assemble atoms, molecules, and particles at interfaces with atomic precision has opened new frontiers in materials science. Advances in processing and assembling, such as layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly, nanoparticle assembly, and 3D printing technologies, are enabling the development of novel nanomaterial architectures with tailored properties. For example, a scalable wet-chemistry method produced SiOx@ZrO2@C nanospheres, addressing issues of volume expansion and low conductivity in LIBs. (31) The resulting electrodes retain 72.2% of their capacity after 500 cycles, showcasing the practical scalability of this method. (31) A light-driven nanonetwork assembly via 3D printing integrates top-down patterning with bottom-up nanoparticle assembly to create high-resolution structures for optical sensing. (32) This innovative method balances fabrication resolution and scalability. (32) An article highlights LbL self-assembly as a method for constructing multilayered composites from atomically thin 2D nanomaterials. (33) LbL assembly uses noncovalent interactions to create stable, controllable structures, with applications in energy storage, catalysis, sensors, and drug delivery. The article also discusses various LbL methods, such as van der Waals, electrostatic, Langmuir–Blodgett, and hydrogen-bonded assembly, and highlights challenges and future directions in using LbL for constructing multifunctional composites. (33) Moreover, the utilization of molten salt electrolysis for CO2 reduction represents a dual-purpose approach for decarbonization and the synthesis of valuable nanomaterials. An article highlights the potential of CO2-derived carbon-based nanomaterials, which are produced through the electroreduction of CO2 in molten salt. (34) These materials exhibit unique properties suitable for energy storage and electrocatalysis. By offering a sustainable route to synthesize carbon-based nanostructures, this process aligns with the goals of low-carbon-footprint technologies. (34) These innovations not only push the boundaries of material design but also bring us closer to realizing scalable, high-performance energy devices.This Forum (Special Issue) illustrates innovative solutions using low-dimensional nanomaterials and their assembled hierarchical forms to address challenges across various energy applications. In addition to LIBs, metal–air batteries, including zinc–air and lithium–air systems, rely heavily on efficient catalysts to overcome the sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Low-dimensional materials have enabled significant breakthroughs in this field. In lithium–oxygen batteries, amorphous RuO2 supported on TiO2 nanosheets outperforms its crystalline counterpart by promoting smaller and more reversible Li2O2 deposits. (35) This amorphous structure improves the discharge capacity (2.3 mAh/cm2) and extends cycling stability to 160 cycles, demonstrating the critical role of material morphology in optimizing catalytic performance. (35)Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have garnered interest as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to LIBs. However, the larger ionic radius of Na+ or K+ poses challenges for electrode materials to deliver stable cycling performance. Low-dimensional structures offer practical solutions. For example, by a nanoscale coating of octadecylamine chains, hydrophobic Prussian blue (PB) cathodes with open structures overcome moisture sensitivity during fabrication and usage. (36) This modification ensures stable capacities (145 mAh/g at 1 C) even after extended exposure to humid environments. (36) A hybrid cathode design combining Na3V2(PO4)3 and activated carbon introduces a dual energy storage mechanism. (37) The "nanoreservoir" effect enhances both energy density (218.6 Wh/kg) and cycle life (over 14,000 cycles), bridging the gap between batteries and capacitors. (37) For PIBs, challenges such as dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers hinder their development. An in situ-formed Fe-based protective layer provides a novel solution by suppressing dendrite formation and enhancing ionic conductivity. (38) This artificial SEI improves the cycling stability of potassium metal anodes to over 1700 h, highlighting the importance of interface engineering in ensuring long-term battery performance. (38)Lithium–sulfur batteries (Li–S) promise high energy density but are plagued by polysulfide shuttling and poor sulfur utilization. Advanced nanostructures have enabled significant progress in this area. Self-supporting nanoporous carbon films decorated with Co–N–C single-atom sites address these challenges by catalyzing sulfur conversion reactions and stabilizing polysulfides. (39) These materials achieve a specific capacity of 1310.1 mAh/g and an areal capacity of 5.6 mAh/cm2 at a high sulfur loading of 6.7 mg/cm2, showcasing the potential of single-atom catalysis for high-performance Li–S batteries. (39)Separators are critical for maintaining safety and performance in batteries, particularly in aqueous systems where dendrite growth and electrolyte instability pose significant challenges. Functionalized nanoporous separators designed for zinc-ion batteries improve electrolyte transport, enhance mechanical toughness, and mitigate dendrite formation. (40) These modifications extend cycle life and improve overall safety, emphasizing the role of separator engineering in advancing aqueous battery systems. (40)Supercapacitors, with their high power density and rapid charge–discharge cycles, benefit greatly from low-dimensional nanomaterials. δ-MnO2 nanosheets activated by Zn2+ intercalation demonstrate enhanced oxygen vacancies, facilitating Na+ adsorption and improving charge transport. (41) These materials achieve a capacitance of 3240 mF/cm2 even at high mass loading (16 mg/cm2), making them viable for commercial applications. (41) The assembly of 2D nanosheets into layered stacking structures provides open pathways for ion diffusion and electron transport. These architectures exhibit excellent stability and bridge the functionality gap between batteries and supercapacitors, demonstrating the versatility of 2D materials in hybrid energy devices. (16)Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) provides a pathway for sustainable energy conversion and carbon capture. Copper nanowires, with diameters as small as 0.8 nm, exhibit enhanced selectivity for converting CO2 into carbon monoxide due to uncoordinated surface atoms. (11) These findings highlight the importance of surface structure in tuning catalytic activity and selectivity. (11) A Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, comprising Cu-doped ZIF-67 and Bi4O5Br2, achieves a remarkable CO2-to-CO conversion rate of 6469.88 μmol·g–1·h–1 with a high selectivity of 97%. (25) The synergistic band alignment and intermediate desorption properties underscore the importance of heterostructure design in advancing CO2 photoreduction technologies. (25)Low-dimensional materials also play a pivotal role in optoelectronics. Hybrid organic–inorganic 2D perovskites exhibit exceptional polarization-sensitive properties, making them ideal for high-performance photodetectors. Their tunable layered structures and environmental stability position them as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic devices. (17)In summary, the studies presented in this Forum (Special Issue) illustrate the immense potential of low-dimensional nanomaterials to transform energy technologies. Moving forward, the integration of machine learning and high-throughput experimentation will accelerate material discovery. Interface engineering, particularly in heterogeneous structures, holds the key to unlocking synergistic performance enhancements. As we push the boundaries of nanomaterial capabilities, collaboration across disciplines will be essential. Advances in operando techniques and computational modeling will provide deeper insights into material behavior, guiding the rational design of next-generation energy devices. This Forum (Special Issue) underscores the transformative potential of low-dimensional nanomaterials in energy applications, offering innovative solutions to global challenges in energy storage, conversion, and sustainability.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsHongtao Sun, The Harold & Inge Marcus Department of Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States; Materials Research Institute (MRI), The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States, https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3259-6091, Email: [email protected]Jian Zhu, State Key Laboratory for Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan Key Laboratory of Two-Dimensional Materials, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9852-1645, Email: [email protected]NotesViews expressed in this editorial are those of the authors and not necessarily the views of the ACS.ReferencesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!

(American Chemical Society) A review. Isolated atoms featuring unique reactivity are at the heart of enzymic and homogeneous catalysts. In contrast, although the concept has long existed, single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) have only recently gained prominence. Host materials have similar functions to ligands in homogeneous catalysts, detg. the stability, local environment, and electronic properties of isolated atoms and thus providing a platform for tailoring heterogeneous catalysts for targeted applications. Within just a decade, we have witnessed many examples of SACs both disrupting diverse fields of heterogeneous catalysis with their distinctive reactivity and substantially enriching our understanding of mol. processes on surfaces. To date, the term SAC mostly refers to late transition metal-based systems, but numerous examples exist in which isolated atoms of other elements play key catalytic roles. This review provides a compositional encyclopedia of SACs, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the introduction of this term. By defining single-atom catalysis in the broadest sense, we explore the full elemental diversity, joining different areas across the whole periodic table, and discussing historical milestones and recent developments. In particular, we examine the coordination structures and assocd. properties accessed through distinct single-atom-host combinations and relate them to their main applications in thermo-, electro-, and photocatalysis, revealing trends in element-specific evolution, host design, and uses. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, including multimetallic SACs, atom proximity control, and possible applications for multistep and cascade reactions, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this flourishing field. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3cXitFSltL3P&md5=f4c3e96ec0d47aa32db16737ef0965e62Fei, H.; Dong, J.; Feng, Y.; Allen, C.

(Nature Research) Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently attracted broad research interest as they combine the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Rational design and synthesis of SACs are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report a general approach to a series of monodispersed at. transition metals (for example, Fe, Co, Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with a common MN4C4 moiety, identified by systematic X-ray absorption fine structure analyses and direct transmission electron microscopy imaging. The unambiguous structure detn. allows d. functional theor. prediction of MN4C4 moieties as efficient oxygen evolution catalysts with activities following the trend Ni > Co > Fe, which is confirmed by electrochem. measurements. Detn. of atomistic structure and its correlation with catalytic properties represents a crit. step towards the rational design and synthesis of precious or nonprecious SACs with exceptional atom utilization efficiency and catalytic activities. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC1MXhtFGisLzN&md5=ba4f0c2bc55d7aa8cc41ca3196bd2cde3Li, W.; Zhang, M.; Xie, X.; Liang, A.; Peng, H.; Ma, G.; Xu, Y.

(Nature Publishing Group) Nanowires and nanotubes carry charge and excitons efficiently, and are therefore potentially ideal building blocks for nanoscale electronics and optoelectronics. Carbon nanotubes have already been exploited in devices such as field-effect and single-electron transistors, but the practical utility of nanotube components for building electronic circuits is limited, as it is not yet possible to selectively grow semiconducting or metallic nanotubes. Here we report the assembly of functional nanoscale devices from indium phosphide nanowires, the elec. properties of which are controlled by selective doping. Gate-voltage-dependent transport measurements demonstrate that the nano- wires can be predictably synthesized as either n- or p-type. These doped nanowires function as nanoscale field-effect transistors, and can be assembled into crossed-wire p-n junctions that exhibit rectifying behavior. Significantly, the p-n junctions emit light strongly and are perhaps the smallest light-emitting diodes that have yet been made. Finally, we show that elec.-field-directed assembly can be used to create highly integrated device arrays from nanowire building blocks. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXkt1WqsA%253D%253D&md5=4afc91799c3ba9d1f2b1627f3861c3d97Huang, Y.; Duan, X.; Wei, Q.; Lieber, C.

(American Association for the Advancement of Science) One-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanowires and nanotubes, represent the smallest dimension for efficient transport of electrons and excitons and thus are ideal building blocks for hierarchical assembly of functional nanoscale electronic and photonic structures. The authors report an approach for the hierarchical assembly of one-dimensional nanostructures into well-defined functional networks. They show that nanowires can be assembled into parallel arrays with control of the av. sepn. and, by combining fluidic alignment with surface-patterning techniques, that it is also possible to control periodicity. In addn., complex crossed nanowire arrays can be prepd. with layer-by-layer assembly with different flow directions for sequential steps. Transport studies show that the crossed nanowire arrays form elec. conducting networks, with individually addressable device function at each cross point. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXntlWlsw%253D%253D&md5=a2fcb7702dd0b767a9d2716c00d3105b8Hao, G.; Xiao, J.; Hao, Y.; Zhou, G.; Zhu, H.; Gao, H.; Xu, Z.; Zhao, Z.; Miao, L.; Li, J.

(Elsevier Ltd.) One-dimensional (1D) tellurium (Te) nanowires (NWs) have triggered intense attention due to their remarkable properties in electronics, optoelectronics and nonlinear optics. However, the saturable absorption properties of Te NWs and the ability to be bleached by strong pulsed energy need to be further improved. Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibit prominent nonlinear optical properties. Direct epitaxial growth of large-area 1D/2D Te-TMDC vdW heterostructures is still rarely investigated. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable epitaxial growth of large-scale 1D/2D vertical Te-TMDC heterostructures via two-step vapor phase deposition method. Our exptl. results have confirmed that the saturable absorption properties of as-prepd. Te-TMDC heterostructures can be obviously enhanced. The first principle calcns. and surface potential measurements demonstrate that effective interlayer charge transfer between Te NWs and TMDC nanosheets is beneficial for promoting the saturable absorption properties. Systematic investigation of vdW Te-TMDC heterostructures with nonlinear optical properties is vital for the next generation of nanophotonics and integrated photonics, which paves the way for the development of saturable absorbers and light modulators based on Te-TMDC vdW heterostructures. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXntlyqtLY%253D&md5=7c55c94e2eaaffd6580ecb1adc8a16fd9Wang, K.; Sun, J.; Yang, H.; Zhang, Y.; Zhong, X.; Song, Y.; Hou, F.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, H.

Graphene is a wonder material with many superlatives to its name. It is the thinnest known material in the universe and the strongest ever measured. Its charge carriers exhibit giant intrinsic mobility, have zero effective mass, and can travel for micrometers without scattering at room temp. Graphene can sustain current densities six orders of magnitude higher than that of copper, shows record thermal cond. and stiffness, is impermeable to gases, and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a benchtop expt. This review analyzes recent trends in graphene research and applications, and attempts to identify future directions in which the field is likely to develop. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3A
