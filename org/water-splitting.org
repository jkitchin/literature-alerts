Abstract The dual‐site electrocatalysts formed by metal single atoms combines with metal nanoparticles represent a promising strategy to enhance both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Herein, defect engineering is applied to dual‐site ORR and OER electrocatalysts. Its design, synthesis, structural properties, and catalytic performance experimentally and theoretically are insightfully studied for the single‐atomic Fe─N 4 and the adjacent Fe 7 Co 3 nanoalloy (FeCo NA ) as dual‐site loading on nitrogen‐doped graphene aerogel (Fe─N/FeCo@NGA). The high‐density dual‐sites, together with the good electronic conductivity of NGA, synergistically improve the electronic structure for superior electrocatalytic activity. The half‐wave potential of Fe─N/FeCo@NGA in ORR is 0.92 V and the overpotential of it in OER is 1.58 V. Corresponding all‐solid‐state Zn‐air battery demonstrates a peak power density of 147.6 mW cm −2 and charge/discharge durability for over 140 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that the single‐atomic Fe‐N 4 and FeCo NA dual‐site on the skeleton defect optimized NGA, further refine the local electronic structure, modulating the tensile force on the O─O bond in * OOH intermediate, leading to its spontaneous dissociation and facilitating a significantly reduced energy barrier. This work takes a promising shortcut in the application of defect engineering for the development of highly efficient dual‐site bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with single atoms.

Abstract The sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis necessitates applied bias to facilitate electron transfer as well as bond cleavage and formation. Traditional electrocatalysis focuses on analyzing the effects of electron transfer, while the role of charge accumulation induced by the applied overpotential has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence mechanism of bias‐driven charge accumulation, capacitive Mn is incorporated into IrO 2 to regulate the local electronic structure and the adsorption behavior. The applied bias triggers dynamic redox reactions at the active sites, which introduce local charge accumulation on the surface of electrocatalyst. Under bias, Mn oxidation induced a noticeable pseudocapacitance in the pre‐OER region, promoting the OER kinetics of iridium sites. Meanwhile, the increased oxygen vacancy formation energy further prevents the lattice oxygen activation. The PEM electrolyzer, equipped with optimal materials as an anode, operates at a low driving voltage of 1.637 V under 2.0 A cm −2 , maintaining stable performance for over 800 h with a low degradation rate (19.4 µV h −1 ). This work provides insights into the performance of metal oxide catalysts in acidic environments and offers forward‐looking strategies for enhancing the catalytic performance through dynamic redox induced capacitive behavior.

Abstract Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exfoliated from bulk layered materials possess interesting properties. Most transition metal oxides are not layered and therefore cannot be exfoliated. Here we report the synthesis of a family of ultrathin materials—transition metal oxychalcogenides (TMOCs)—and demonstrate their unique properties. Two-dimensional TMOCs (MX x O y , M = group IV or V transition metal, X = chalcogen, O = oxygen; x , y = 0–2) from bulk transition metal dichalcogenides (MX 2 ) have been fabricated using tetrabutylammonium intercalation. The stoichiometry of TMOCs can be adjusted, which enables control of their optical bandgaps and tunability of electrical conductivity by more than eight orders of magnitude. By tuning the chalcogen-to-oxygen ratio along with local atomic structure in TMOCs, it is possible to impart unexpected properties. For example, in contrast to conventional TMDs, the hybrid structure of TMOCs renders them surprisingly stable and electrochemically active in strong acids, allowing them to be used as proof-of-concept catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction at pH ≈ 0. The HfS 0.52 O 1.09 catalyst shows high mass activity (103,000 A g −1 at an overpotential of 0.5 V) and exhibits durability in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers.

The production, conversion and storage of energy based on electrocatalysis, mainly assisted by oxygen evolution reaction (OER), plays a crucial role in alkaline water electrolyzers (AWEs) and fuel cells. Nevertheless, the insufficient availability of highly efficient catalyst materials at a reasonable cost that overcome the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of the OER is one of the significant obstacles. Herein, we report a fast and facile synthesis of vapor phase deposition of dual-phase nickel sulfide (Ni-sulfide) using low-temperature annealing in the presence of H2S and demonstrated as an efficient catalyst for OER to address the issues with sluggish electrochemical kinetics. The dual-phase Ni-sulfide structures consist of densely packed 10–50 μm microcrystals with 40–50 individual dual-phase layers, such as NiS and Ni7S6. As an electrocatalyst, the dual-phase Ni-sulfide exhibits excellent OER activity by achieving a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential (η10) of 0.29 V and excellent electrochemical stability over 50 h. Besides, the Ni-sulfide displays considerable electrochemical robustness in alkaline conditions and forms OER-active Ni-oxide/hydroxide species during the process. Using an energy-efficient synthesis method, the fabricated unique crystalline nanodesign of dual-phase Ni-sulfide could open new pathways for the controlled synthesis of a high-efficiency group of electrocatalysts for a long-time stable electrochemical catalytic activity.

Using metal oxides to disperse iridium (Ir) in the anode layer proves effective for lowering Ir loading in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). However, the reported low-Ir-based catalysts still suffer from unsatisfying electrolytic efficiency and durability under practical industrial working conditions, mainly due to insufficient catalytic activity and mass transport in the catalyst layer. Herein we report a class of porous heterogeneous nanosheet catalyst with abundant Ir-O-Mn bonds, achieving a notable mass activity of 4 A mgIr−1 for oxygen evolution reaction at an overpotential of 300 mV, which is 150.6 times higher than that of commercial IrO2. Ir-O-Mn bonds are unraveled to serve as efficient charge-transfer channels between in-situ electrochemically-formed IrOx clusters and MnOx matrix, fostering the generation and stabilization of highly active Ir3+ species. Notably, Ir/MnOx-based PEMWE demonstrates comparable performance under 10-fold lower Ir loading (0.2 mgIr cm−2), taking a low cell voltage of 1.63 V to deliver 1 A cm−2 for over 300 h, which positions it among the elite of low Ir-based PEMWEs. Building an efficient proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzer with low Ir loading remains important but challenging. Here, the authors report an Ir/MnOx catalyst with rich Ir-O-Mn bonds that serve as charge-transfer channels to generate and stabilize active Ir3+ species, enhancing both activity and stability.

Regulating the spintronic structure of electrocatalysts can improve the oxygen evolution reaction performance efficiently. Nonetheless, the effects of tuning the spintronic structure for the oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms have rarely been discussed. Here, we show a ruthenium-cobalt-tin oxide with optimized spintronic structure due to the quantum spin interaction of Ru and Co. The specific spintronic structure of ruthenium-cobalt-tin oxide promotes the charge transfer kinetics and intermediates evolution behavior under applied potential, generating long-lived active species with higher spin density sites for the oxygen evolution reaction after the reconstruction process. Moreover, the ruthenium-cobalt-tin oxide possesses decoupled proton-electron transfer procedure during the oxygen evolution reaction process, demonstrating that the electron transfer procedure of O-O bond formation between *O intermediate and lattice oxygen in Co-O-Ru is the rate-determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction process. This work provides rational perspectives on the correlation between spintronic structure and oxygen evolution reaction mechanism. Tuning the spintronic structure in oxygen evolution reactions is underexplored, despite its potential to enhance catalytic performance. Here, the authors report a ruthenium-cobalt-tin oxide with an optimized spintronic structure, highlighting its improved performance and reaction mechanisms.

Water splitting is a promising approach to producing eco-friendly and high-energy-density hydrogen, addressing both energy shortages and environmental challenges. However, the development of efficient non-noble electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains challenging due to the sluggish kinetics of four sequential proton-coupled electron transfer steps. In this study, nickel-cobalt-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets on nickel foam (NiCoFe@LDH/NF) are synthesized via a straightforward one-step solvothermal method. Unlike traditional Co doping, our work found that the proper introduction of Co could improve the lattice tolerance and inhibit the formation of Ni-rich or Fe-rich phase simultaneously. Both experimental and theoretical data collaboratively demonstrated that the proper incorporation of cobalt in NiFe-LDH optimized its electronic structure and tuned the Gibbs free energy of oxygen intermediates (*O) to an optimal value (~2.5 eV). This reduced the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, resulting in enhanced active site utilization and improved catalytic efficiency at the interface between LDH materials and water. Consequently, NiCoFe@LDH/NF exhibited excellent OER activity, with overpotentials of 149 and 246 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−1 in 1 mol∙L−1 KOH, surpassing noble metal-based catalysts like RuO2. In addition, the synthesis process was completed within four hours, enabling its potential for industrial-scale production. This work provides a novel strategy for optimizing catalytic activity of LDH interface through adjusting the O adsorption behavior on Fe sites, lays the foundation for LDH catalyst development with outstanding activity.

Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), a predominant technology for large-scale industrial hydrogen production, faces limitations in commercialization owing to the inadequate catalytic activity and stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. This study introduces a NiFeAl self-supported electrode characterized by high activity and stability for the OER and outlines a rational design strategy for NiFe (oxy)hydroxide-based self-supported electrodes. The introduction of Al, a ternary dopant with relatively low electronegativity and a small ionic radius, into the NiFe electrode effectively controls the adsorption energy of O-intermediates and facilitates the deprotonation of adsorbed OH*, thereby accelerating the OER. Remarkably, the NiFeAl self-supported electrode demonstrates approximately 50% enhanced operational activity (0.71 A cm–2 at 1.8 V) compared to NiFe alongside exceptional stability (>72 h at 0.6 A cm–2) in OER within an AWE single cell. These findings highlight the significant potential of the NiFeAl electrode for application in AWE for efficient, large-scale hydrogen production.

Abstract Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal process for sustainable hydrogen energy production, relying on efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, particularly in acidic environments, where both high activity and durability are crucial. Despite the favorable kinetics of platinum (Pt)‐based materials, their performance is hindered under harsh conditions, driving the search for alternatives. Due to their unique structural characteristic, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) emerge as attractive candidates for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts. However, modulating their properties and functionalities is crucial to overcome their conductivity issue. Herein, a reconfiguration strategy for the dual‐driven surface restructuring of the CoFe PBA involving graphene quantum dots (GQD) and UV/ozone is proposed. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis revealed that dual‐driven reconstruction plays a pivotal role in promoting the high‐valence metal ions, effectively reducing charge transfer resistance—a key limitation in HER. The optimized CoFe PBA/GQD‐UV exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance toward HER, with a low overpotential of 77 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm −2 with excellent durability for 12 h under an extremely high current density of 500 mA cm −2 in an acidic solution. This dual‐combination strategy offering a new pathway to develop highly active electrocatalysts.

This work aims to deal with the challenges associated with designing complementary bifunctional electrocatalysts and a separator/membrane that enables rechargeable zinc–air batteries (RZABs) with nearly solid-state operability. This solid-state RZAB was accomplished by integrating a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on Ru-RuO2 interface nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene (Ru-RuO2/NGr) and a dual-doped poly(acrylic acid) hydrogel (d-PAA) electrolyte soaked in KOH with sodium stannate additive. The catalyst shows enhanced activity and stability toward the two oxygen reactions, i.e., oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), with a very low potential difference (ΔE) of 0.64 V. The computational insights bring out the electronic factors contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity of Ru-RuO2/NGr based on the charge density difference (CDD) between the interfaces. The disadvantages of the existing solid-state RZABs, such as their limited lifespan brought on by passivation, dendritic growth, corrosion, and shape change, have also been taken into account. The introduction of the stannate additive to the electrolyte induced an in situ Zn-anode modification, which subsequently improved the interfacial stability of the ZABs and, hence, the battery life cycles. The experimental observations reveal that, during the charging process, the Sn nanoparticles enable the homogeneous Zn deposition on the surface of the anode. Thus, the in situ Zn-anode surface modification assisted in achieving a high-rate cycle capability, viz., the homemade catalyst-based system exhibited continuous charge–discharge cycles for 20 h at a current density of 2.0 mA cm–2, with each cycle lasting for 5 min.

Alkaline water electrolysis is one of most potential techniques for green hydrogen production, offering high energy conversion and storage. High current density and durability diaphragms are crucial for electrochemical performance. Here we have developed a high-performance composite diaphragm based on in-situ self-assemble of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) loaded on Zirfon-type substrate, and at the same time catalytic NiFe-LDHs integrated the anode side for high-performance alkaline water electrolysis. By modulating the microstructure, a unique surficial feature with high surface free energy and super-hydrophilicity to address the issue of high ohmic resistance is established and achieves rapid OH−conduction and high catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Consequently, the prepared ZLDH-χ series diaphragm affords excellent application properties, with ZLDH-10 diaphragm an ultra-short wetting time of 0.23s and a reduction of 120 mV over-voltage in single electrolytic cell. Electrolyzer with ZLDH-10 diaphragm provides exceptional current density of 1400 mA cm-2 at 2.0 V in 80oC 30wt% KOH. Importantly, large-scale ZLDH-10 diaphragm with 37 × 37 cm2 can be readily made and reaches an unprecedented durability at 1000 mA cm-2@1.8 V over 240 hours. Both simple in-situ self-assemble approach and excellent performance of ZLDH-χ series diaphragm pave a new way for manufacturing diaphragm in advanced alkaline water electrolysis. A partial polarization method was first invented to figure out the contribution ratio for cell voltage reduction between NiFe-LDHs catalytic effect and hydrophilic improving effect.

Abstract Li‐O 2 batteries urgently needs high discharge capacity and stable cycling performance, requiring effective and reliable bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Hovenia acerba Lindl ‐like heterostructure composed of cobalt sulfide and tin dioxide supported on carbon substrate (CoS/SnO 2 @C) is prepared via CO 2 laser irradiation technology. The half‐wave potential of CoS/SnO 2 @C for the ORR is 0.88 V, while the overpotential of the OER at 10 mA cm −2 is as low as 270 mV. The Li‐O 2 batteries employing the bifunctional CoS/SnO 2 @C catalyst displays a high discharge specific capacity of 3332.25 mAh g −1 and long cycling life of 226 cycles. Additionally, theory calculations demonstrate that the construction of heterostructure decreases energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (RDS) for both ORR and OER. Notably, SnO 2 behaves as the electronic promoter to optimize the electronic structure of heterostructure interface and triggers charge redistribution of CoS, which weakens the adsorption strength of the * O‐intermediates and allows to break the linear scaling relationship, thus further enhancing the catalytic performance of CoS/SnO 2 @C. This research furnishes directions for the design of heterogeneous catalysts, highlighting its great potential for application in rechargeable Li‐O 2 batteries.

Abstract The preferential adsorption toward OH − on the anode most likely blocks the accessibility of organic molecules and triggers competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER), typically precipitating a narrow potential window. Here, an OH − deconfinement strategy enabled by CO 3 2− self‐transformed from C 2 O 4 2− on metallic nickel oxalate (NiC 2 O 4 ) for efficient synthesis of bioplastic monomer 2,5‐furanedicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with faradaic efficiency of >95% via electrocatalytic 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (e‐HMFOR) at a wider potential window of 1.38–1.56 V RHE , outperforming state‐of‐the‐art Ni‐based electrocatalysts is presented. In situ, tests corroborate that the construction of NiOOH with surface‐adsorbed CO 3 2− (NiOOH‐CO 3 2− ) from NiC 2 O 4 can be facilitated by self‐liberating CO 3 2− . The CO 3 2− ions serving as an electric field engine can effectively weaken OH − coverage through electrostatic repulsion and enhance HMF adsorption at the NiOOH‐CO 3 2− surface, thereby heightening e‐HMFOR while inhibiting OER. Computational results further indicate that the CO 3 2− on NiOOH hoists the energy barrier of oxygen intermediate conversion (O* → OOH*) to suppress OER but promotes the e‐HMFOR kinetics. The precise modulation of OH − adsorption behavior on the electrocatalyst offers a powerful kit for boosting the oxidative upgrading process while circumventing the competing reaction OER.

Catalyst design plays a critical role in ensuring sustainable and effective energy conversion. Electrocatalytic materials need to be able to control active sites and introduce defects in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, producing efficient catalysts with a distinct surface structure advances our comprehension of the mechanism. Here, a defect‐engineered heterointerface of ruthenium doped cobalt metal organic frame (Ru‐CoMOF) core confined in MoS2 is reported. A tailored design approach at room temperature was used to induce defects and form an electron transfer interface that enhanced the electrocatalytic performance. The Ru‐CoMOF@MoS2 heterointerface obtains a geometrical current density of 10 mA‐2 by providing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at small overpotentials of 240 and 289 mV, respectively. Density functional theory simulation shows that the Co‐site maximizes the evolution of hydrogen intermediate energy for adsorption and enhances HER, while the Ru‐site, on the other hand, is where OER happens. The heterointerface provides a channel for electron transfer and promotes reactions at the solid‐liquid interface. The Ru‐CoMOF@MoS2 model exhibits improved OER and HER efficiency, indicating that it could be a valuable material for the production of water‐alkaline and acidic catalysts.

Abstract Rechargeable Zn‐air batteries (ZABs) have attracted widespread attention due to their advantages, such as high energy density, low price, and environmental friendliness. However, the sluggish kinetics of ORR/OER greatly prevent the practical application of rechargeable ZABs. In recent years, efficient, durable, and cost‐effective bifunctional catalysts are developed to accelerate the kinetics of ORR/OER and enhance the performance of ZABs. This review provides a systematic overview of ZABs and describes the standards of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. The latest research progress in the development of non‐noble metal‐based and nano‐metallic electrocatalysts for the air electrode of ZABs is systematically summarized, including the classification, design, synthesis methods, active site structures, and mechanism. Finally, the challenges faced by bifunctional catalysts and probable solutions are proposed. This review will provide a comprehensive guidance for development of efficient oxygen electrocatalyst in the future.

The evolution of bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts that are highly active, stable, and conductive is crucial for advancing metal-air batteries and fuel cells. We have here thoroughly explored the OER and ORR performance for a category of two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) called TM3(HADQ)2, and Rh3(HADQ)2 exhibits a promising bifunctional OER/ORR activity, with an overpotential of 0.31 V for both OER and ORR. The d-band center (εd) and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) are utilized to study the relationship between OER/ORR activity and the electronic structure of catalysts, and it is found that the elementary d-electron number (Ne) of the central TM for TM3(HADQ)2, as well as the electronegativity of the ligand TM-N4 and the intermediate O atom, are the main reason that affects the catalytic activity of OER/ORR. Additionally, Rh3(HADQ)2 can be proven through the constant potential method (CPM) and microkinetics method that it is an acidic OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst. Rh3(HADQ)2 has a high toxicity tolerance, making it a potential bifunctional catalyst. Our research contributes to both the rational design of SACs for various catalytic processes and the fabrication of bifunctional, cost-effective oxygen-electric catalysts.

The addition of a redox mediator as soluble catalyst into electrolyte can effectively overcome the bottlenecks of poor energy efficiency and limited cyclability for Li-O2 batteries caused by passivation of insulating discharge products and unfavorable byproducts. Herein we report a novel soluble catalyst of bifunctional imidazolyl iodide salt additive, 1,3-dimethylimidazole iodide (DMII), to successfully construct highly efficient and durable Li-O2 batteries. The anion I- can effectively promote the charge transport of Li2O2 and accelerate the redox kinetics of oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions on the cathode side, thereby significantly decreasing the charge/discharge overpotential. Simultaneously, the cation DMI+ forms an ultrathin stably solid-electrolyte interphase film on Li metal, greatly inhibiting the shuttle effect of I- and improving the stability of anode. Using this DMII additive, our Li-O2 batteries achieve an extremely low voltage of 0.52 V and ultra-long cycling stability over 960 h. Notably, up to 95.8% of the Li2O2 yield further proves the reversible generation/decomposition of Li2O2 without the occurrence of side reactions. Both experimental and theoretical results disclose that DMII enables Li+ easily solvated, testifying the dominance of the solution-induced reaction mechanism. This work provides the possibility to design the soluble catalysts towards high-performance Li-O2 batteries.

Since the industrial revolution, the demand for fossil fuels has increased along with technological advancements, resulting in significant environmental pollution and global warming. To address these issues, the development of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydrogen is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting energy demand. Among these, hydrogen energy is considered as a promising future energy source due to its energy density and environmentally friendly characteristics. Currently, grey hydrogen is predominantly produced through the steam reforming processes, which relies on fossil fuels and emits large amounts of carbon dioxide. Green hydrogen, generated using renewable energy and electrolysis, has emerged as a sustainable alternative. In electrochemical water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) needs a higher activation energy compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction, making the development of efficient OER catalysts crucial for energy-efficient hydrogen production. Although noble metal catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 are commonly used, their high cost and limited availability have prompted research into transition metal-based alternatives.</br>NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have gained attention for their excellent redox properties, charge transport abilities, and effective adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, bulk NiFe-LDHs exhibit low catalytic efficiency due to poor electrical conductivity and a limited number of active sites. To overcome these limitations, various structural modification methods have been developed to improve their catalytic activity and stability. This review provides recent research trends focused on enhancing the performance of NiFe-LDHs through strategies such as heteroatom doping, interface engineering, vacancy creation, and intercalation, with representative studies highlighted to demonstrate these advancements.

In the current scenario of the energy crisis and environmental concerns, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are of vital importance for their application in metal–air batteries and efficient water splitting to produce hydrogen. The best possible electrocatalysts for the OER are considered to be noble metal-based materials like RuO2 and IrO2, but their high cost and instability have prevented their wider use for application in large-scale water splitting. Here, we envisaged CrPO4 as a cost-efficient host due to the formation of CrO6 octahedra interconnected through PO4 linkage, making it a stable framework structure to harness eg electrons that are pinned over the O(2p) orbital, required for superior OER activity. The presence of more electronegative Fe3+ or Cr3+ sites in the framework structure, through the inductive effect, enhances the iconicity of the Cr–O bond in the framework, and creation of CrO42– groups at the surface of the catalyst directly facilitates the adsorption/desorption of OH– in the form of –Cr–O–OH, which reduces the overpotential of the OER with higher structural stability of the electrocatalyst. In turn, Cr0.9Fe0.1PO4 demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity toward the OER in the alkaline electrolyte, together with a low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm–2 current density with a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec–1, better than that of the well-known electrocatalyst RuO2. Enhanced OER activity was observed due to the feasibility of 3-electron transfer with Cr3+/6+ redox as there was a significant increase at the redox peak current density and the presence of Cr6+ also facilitates oxygen evolution due to the strong overlap between Cr(3d) and O(2p) orbitals, which generates superior charge transfer from O(2p) bands to the Cr(3d) orbital, resulting in the reduction of oxygen or evolution of oxygen at a lower overpotential.

Developing efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal challenge in harnessing hydrogen energy. Among the promising candidates, transition metal sulfides have garnered significant research attention due to their low cost and exceptional catalytic capabilities. In this work, we present a strategy to fabricate Co and Ce dual-doping Ni3S2 nanosheets in situ on nickel foam (CoCe-Ni3S2/NF) as an efficient and robust catalyst for overall water splitting. The introduction of Co and Ce dopants can induce an internal electronic interaction for exposing more active sites and accelerating faster electron transfer. Meanwhile, the unique ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet array nanostructure, with a thickness of 10 nm, facilitates enhanced electrolyte infiltration and establishes efficient pathways for the release of H2 and O2 bubbles. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that Co and Ce dual-doping can effectively optimize the d-band center and improve the absorption energy of intermediates. The synergy derived from these design features enables CoCe-Ni3S2/NF to exhibit a remarkable performance in both the OER and the HER, as well as in overall water splitting. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, this catalyst achieves impressive low overpotentials of 285 and 193 mV at 50 mA cm–2 for the OER and HER, respectively. Notably, during overall water-splitting tests, a potential of 1.68 V is achieved at 20 mA cm–2, accompanied by an outstanding durability for 100 h. These results underscore the exceptional potential of CoCe-Ni3S2/NF as an efficient and robust catalyst for water splitting, paving the way for advancements in sustainable hydrogen energy technologies.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts play a vital role in promoting electrocatalytic water splitting technology, which should cover low cost, superior catalytic activity, and long-term stability to ensure an efficient and sustainable water splitting process. Herein, we fabricate a NiFe-based layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheet-supported nickel-doped carbon nanofiber (Ni–CNF) as a highly efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst (Ni–CNF/NiFe-LDH), which is synthesized by electrospinning, calcination, and hydrothermal methods. The cross-linked network structure of Ni–CNF markedly increases the specific surface area, thereby facilitating the exposure of active sites. Under the synergy of highly conductive Ni–CNF and ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets, the synthesized Ni–CNF/NiFe-LDH exhibits outstanding performance in the OER, requiring only a low overpotential of 262 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA·cm–2. In alkaline media, the corresponding total electrolytic water electrolyzer requires only 1.56 V of battery voltage at a current density of 10 mA·cm–2.

Finding effective electrocatalysts from earth-abundant materials for water splitting is crucial for advancing the future hydrogen economy. Fe-based oxides have been identified as highly efficient transition-metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their performance is hindered by inappropriate intermediate binding, low intrinsic conductivity, and poor stability, preventing them from competing with precious metal catalysts. This study presents an effective electrochemical reduction strategy for incorporating oxygen vacancies in situ into Fe3O4/iron foam (IF) nanocatalysts by applying a constant negative voltage. The results indicate that the reduced Fe3O4/IF (referred to as Re-Fe3O4/IF) exhibits enhanced OER performance due to the increased oxygen vacancy, substantial electron transfer rate, and greater electrochemically active surface area. Subsequently, this strategy was applied to Ni element-doped iron oxides with electron redistribution, achieving excellent OER performance. The electrochemically optimized Re-Ni0.8Fe2.2O4–x/IF nanocatalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 239 mV at 100 mA cm–2, a small Tafel slope of 41.78 mV dec–1, and an exceptional long-term electrolysis stability of 300 h under alkaline conditions. This study presents a simple and promising approach to induce oxygen vacancies into transition-metal oxides (TMOs)-based OER nanocatalysts for efficient water-splitting systems.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a cornerstone of electrochemical energy conversion systems such as water splitting and metal-air batteries, is inherently limited by its sluggish kinetics due to the multistep proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism and high activation barriers. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a revolutionary strategy to address the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we present a novel design thermodynamically enhanced for optimizing the rate determining stage of the OER. In line with the Second law of thermodynamics we report the findings from a first principle examination of a novel high-density fish patch single-atom catalyst for OER. We employed DMOL3 and MATLAB for the molecular modelling and computation while MATLAB was used to determine the overpotential constant. With a focus on the effect of the entropy on the reaction rate for Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the optimum entropy for efficient OER was determine. Applying an external pressure of (0, 0.1333, 0.2667 and 0.4 Pascal) on the system and studying the Gibbs free energy, the study revealed that 0.2667 Pa, is the best position for efficient OER. At this value, ΔGO2 and ΔGO -0. 066993 and -0. 06297 (J)

The development of efficient catalysts for water electrolysis is crucial for advancing the low-carbon transition and addressing the energy crisis. This work involves the fabrication of graphene-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by integrating NiFe-LDH and PbO2 onto graphene using plasma treatment. The plasma process takes only 30 min. Graphene’s two-dimensional structure increases the available reaction surface area and improves surface electron transport. Plasma treatment further improves catalyst performance by facilitating nanoparticle attachment and creating carbon defects and sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the PBE provide valuable insights into the role of vacancies in enhancing catalyst performance for OER. The catalyst’s conductivity and electronic structure are greatly impacted by vacancies. While modifications to the electronic structure increase the kinetics of charge transfer, the vacancy structure can produce more active sites and improve the adsorption and reactivity of OER intermediates. This optimization of intermediate adsorption and electronic properties leads to increased overall OER activity. The catalyst NiFe-PbO2/S/rGO-45, synthesized through plasma treatment, demonstrated an overpotential of 230 mV at 50 mA·cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 44.26 mV dec−1, exhibiting rapid reaction kinetics and surpassing the OER activity of commercial IrO2. With its excellent performance, the prepared catalyst has broad prospects in commercial applications such as water electrolysis and air batteries.

Constructing fast electron transfer pathways and abundant electro-active sites is an effective strategy to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of catalysts. Herein, structural engineering and dual-phase engineering were employed to construct a NiS2 nanoparticle-encapsulated MOF configured with a pseudo-neuronal structure (NiS2/MOF/HT). It was found that the pseudo-neuronal structure, constructed with a carbon nanohorn (CNH) and carbon nanotube (CNT), provided fast electron transfer pathways and abundant exposed active sites. Moreover, the NiS2/MOF/HT composite obtained via partial vulcanization not only inherited the pseudo-neuronal structure but also prevented the aggregation and growth of NiS2 particles. NiS2/MOF composites provide various active sites. With the combination of the promotion of electronic transfer and enrichment of electro-active sites (NiS2, MOF), NiS2/MOF/HT showed excellent performance, whose overpotential at 25 mA cm−2 was reduced by 19.5% compared with MOF/HT.

Perovskites exhibit catalytic properties on the oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis. Elemental doping by specific preparation methods is a good strategy to obtain highly catalytical active perovskite catalysts. In this work, La0.5Sr0.5Co1-xNixO3-δ perovskite materials doped with different ratios of nickel were successfully synthesized by the sol-gel method. The electrochemical measurement results show that in 1 M KOH solution, La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ prepared by the sol-gel method requires only a low overpotential of 213 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2, which is significantly lower than that of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ prepared by the hydrothermal method for the increasing about 45.24 % (389 @ 10 mA cm-2). In addition, La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ by the sol-gel method can be kept stable in alkaline medium tested for 30 h without degradation. This indicates that the prepared La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ has better OER performance. The SEM results shows that layer structured La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ by the sol-gel method has more surface pores with a pore diameter of about 0.362 μm than spherical granular structured La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ by the hydrothermal method. XPS results reveal that the crystal lattice of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ by nickel doping is lengthened and the electronic configuration of Co also is changed by the sol-gel preparation process. The improved electrocatalytic performance of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ may be attributed to the pore structure formed with providing more active sites during the sol-gel process and the improved oxygen mobility with Ni doping by the sol-gel method. The doping strategy by the sol-gel method provides valuable insights for optimizing perovskite catalytic properties.

The supported RuO2 catalysts are known for their synergistic and interfacial effects, which significantly enhance both catalytic activity and stability. However, polymer-supported RuO2 catalysts have received limited attention due to challenges associated with poor conductivity. In this study, we successfully synthesized the RuO2-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) catalyst via a facile annealing process. The optimized nucleation and growth strategies enable the formation of RuO2 particles (~13.4 nm) encapsulating PTFE, establishing a conductive network that effectively addresses the conductivity issue. Additionally, PTFE induces the generation of oxygen vacancies and the formation of stable RuO2/PTFE interfaces, which further enhance the acidic OER activity and the stability of RuO2. As a result, the RuO2-PTFE catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 219 mV at 10 mA cm⁻2 in the three-electrode system, and the voltage of the RuO2-PTFE||commercial Pt/C system can keep 1.50 V for 800 h at 10 mA cm−2. This work underscores the versatility of PTFE as a substrate for fine-tuning the catalyst morphology, the crystal defect, and the stable interface outerwear. This work not only broadens the application scope of PTFE in catalyst synthesis but also provides a novel approach to the design of high-performance metallic oxide catalysts with tailored oxygen vacancy concentration and stable polymer outerwear.

Abstract Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) is a conventional anode material for solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) to catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the inferior chemical stability of BSCF results in severe surface segregation and performance degradation under high temperatures. A critical challenge lies in alleviating surface segregation and preserving the high OER performance of BSCF anode. Herein, lanthanides are introduced to substitute Ba of BSCF, labeled as Ln0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (LnSCF, Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm), to regulate its stability and performance. The introduction of La and Pr effectively enhances stability, suppresses surface segregation, and maintains high OER activity. The continuous lattice oxygen loss and Co ions oxidation of LnSCF are demonstrated upon annealing in oxidizing atmosphere, thus we propose that surface segregation is a self-regulation mechanism of perovskite lattice to tolerant oxidizing atmosphere and maintain structurally stable via decreasing A-site valence state and forming surface segregation. SOEC with La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (LSCF) anode delivers the optimal current density of 1.69 A cm-2 at1.6 V and stability for CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C, shedding light on designing advanced catalysts for high-temperature OER.&#xD;

The article describes а 2.5D non-hydrostatic model of dissolved oxygen transport in a freshwater lake. The oxygen dynamics are carried out through oxygen exchange with the atmosphere and physical transfer due to the effect of the thermal bar. An intraday change in wind speed (that influences the rate of oxygen transition from gas to liquid) is taken into account at the air-water interface. Space-time distributions of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration were obtained during the spring thermal bar on an example of Barguzin Bay of Lake Baikal. The results of simulation showed that the vertical flows generated by the spring thermal bar contributed to an increase in dissolved oxygen content in the thermoactive region of the bay. Due to the action of the thermal bar, areas with different levels of oxygen are formed in the body of water. There is not only a quantitative but also a qualitative difference between the oxygen distributions obtained for the thermoactive and the thermoinert regions. It has been also found that the wind speed and the wind duration affect the oxygen saturation of water at the thermal bar. The results of this study confirm the barrier function of the thermal bar.

The combination of theoretical calculation and experimental characterization plays a critical role in modern research for battery development. First principles density functional theory (DFT) simulation provides excellent predictions on the adsorption energies, diffusion energies and catalytic activities, based on the material's electronic properties. Briefly, the thesis includes three main topics: 1) By calculating the Li adsorption energy and diffusion energy of various of 2D materials, we discovered that the 1T VS2 is the good lithium regulating materials (LRMs) to resolve the Li dendrite issue for safe Li metal anode. 2) We study the catalytic activity of single atom catalysts (SACs) for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/ oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Atomically dispersed metal catalysts coordinated with nitrogen coordination and anchored to carbon substrates (M-N-C) have become highly effective alternatives to platinum-group catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis. However, the catalytic efficacy of M-N-C systems remains constrained by the suboptimal performance associated with the symmetric charge distribution around the active metal centers. The synergistic co-design of asymmetric metal single-atom catalytic centers with heteroatom doping significantly enhances the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity and durability, advancing the capabilities of next-generation flexible zinc-air batteries. Herein, we developed a pyrolysis-secondary coordination strategy to generate a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, characterized by single Co atoms integrated within an asymmetrical Co-N5S1 moiety, along with nanocluster complexes embedded in N,P,S-codoped carbon frameworks, labeled CoSA+NC/NPSC. In the CoSA+NC/NPSC catalyst, the Co-N5S1 active sites exhibit an optimized electronic configuration, achieved through the synergistic coordination of heteroatom doping and nanocluster integration. Theoretically, this configuration significantly lowers the energy barriers and adjusts the d-band center, ensuring a more balanced binding strength between active sites and the oxygen-containing intermediates and contributing to the promoted bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction efficiency. The experimentally analytical results reveal that the CoSA+NC/NPSC demonstrates an impressive oxygen evolution reaction activity (Ej=10 = 1.58 V) and a narrow bifunctional potential gap (ΔE = 0.75 V), remarkably superior to the counterparts with symmetric Co-S coordination or phosphorus-free doping. When assembled as an air electrode, the CoSA+NC/NPSC-based flexible zinc-air battery exhibits ultralong charge-discharge life (>105 h) and impressive initial round-trip efficiency of 72.42% even at 0 °C.

Developing cost-effective, non-precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies, including zinc-air batteries, fuel cells, and water electrolyzers. This study presents a one-pot synthesis of cobalt-manganese mixed phosphates as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER. Among the catalysts tested, Na-Co-Mn-P [NaCo1.5Mn1.5(HPO4)2(PO4)] exhibited the highest catalytic activity, with a minimal ΔE of 0.86 V, indicating superior performance. The incorporation of alkali metals and the synergistic effects of metal and phosphate components enhance conductivity, electrochemical surface area, and mixed valency of transition metals, contributing to improved electrocatalytic activity. This work highlights a straightforward synthesis method and the beneficial role of metal-phosphate synergy in oxygen electrocatalysis.

Coordination complexes are promising candidates for powerful electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction but challenges remain in favoring the kinetics behaviors through local coordination regulation. Herein, by refining the synergy of carboxylate anions and multiconjugated benzimidazole ligands, we tailor a series of well-defined and stable coordination complexes with three-dimensional supramolecular/coordinated structures. The coordinated water as potential open coordination sites can directly become intermediates, while the metal center easily achieves re-coordination with water molecules in the pores to resist lattice oxygen dissolution. In situ experiments and theory simulations indicate that nickel centers with neighboring coordinated water molecules follow an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism with a low thermodynamic energy barrier. With more coordinated water introduced, an optimized intramolecular oxygen coupling process may appear for favoring the reaction kinetics. As such, a low overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm

Nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are considered as promising substitutes for precious metals in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, most of the reported NiFe LDHs suffer from poor long-term stability because of the Fe loss during OER resulting in severe inactivation. Herein, a dynamically stable chelating interface through in situ transformation of asymmetric aldehyde-ligand (THB, 1,3,5-Tris(3'-hydroxy-4'-formylphenyl)-benzene) modified NiFe LDHs to anchor Fe and significantly enhance the OER stability is reported. The fabricated asymmetric aldehyde-containing ligand THB is capable of stimulating much more interfacial charge transfer from NiFe LDHs to the oxygen group of THB and accelerating the formation of highly valent active Fe species leading to the strong combination between Fe and ligand and the reduced activation energy barrier of the intermediate, respectively. The optimized aldehyde-ligand-chelated NiFe LDHs (NiFe LDH/THB) shows enhanced OER performance featuring an overpotential of 224 mV at 100 mA cm

Water-assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)-based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo-based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co-Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet-like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co-Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi-LDH, demonstrating that the PBA-derived Co-Ni(O)OH was more effective.

Solar-driven water splitting is achieved by connecting photovoltaics with electrolysis. Recently, integrated approaches of the two configurations for photoelectrochemical reactions have shown great potential in a combined unit, but strategies to address further material and cell development face significant scientific challenges. Here we present an experimental demonstration of photoelectrochemical (PEC) unit-cells with efficient separate dual compartments for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. The design and fabrication of cell architectures with various degrees of integration are investigated efficient and sustainable PEC processes. The effect of the nanostructured silicon (Si) photoelectrodes, including the adoption of layer architectures, surface protection layer deposition, and membrane electrode assembly is further studied to optimize the design parameters of the PEC unit-cells. This developed PEC cell with the Si photocathode achieved a photocurrent density of −4.8 mA cm–2 at −2.0 Vcell and −2.87 mA cm–2 at −1.6 Vcell. It clearly provides a critical milestone for unbiased solar water splitting. Practical solar to hydrogen (STH) can be directly estimated in investigating PEC performance in this unit-cell as assembled with a solar cell. It is a significantly meaningful step forward in practical solar fuel production.

Abstract The applications of Fe‐based electrocatalysts in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are hindered due to poor stability and catalytic activity originating from rapid Fe leaching and the intrinsic electronic structure of FeOOH. Here, the study presents a strategy to precisely and continuously tune the morphology of FeOOH and the covalent characteristics of Fe–O bonds by controlling the coverage of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the FeOOH surface. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that regulating Fe–O covalency induces changes in intermediate adsorption strength and metal leaching, leading to a volcano‐shaped trend in durability and activity as a function of Fe–O covalency. Notably, in HER, negatively charged sites of EPS exhibit superior *H adsorption compared to bare FeOOH. In particular, EPS 2 @FeOOH exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both OER (η 10 = 240 mV) and HER (η 10 = 52 mV), with outstanding stability over 200 hours at 100 mA cm⁻ 2 . The current density also reaches 10 mA cm⁻ 2 at merely 1.51 V in a two‐electrode configuration, significantly surpassing other bifunctional electrocatalysts. This approach will provide a promising pathway to enhance the stability and activity of water electrolysis through precise modulation of EPS coverage.

The development of efficient and low-cost overall water splitting electrocatalysts for an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer is desirable for hydrogen production. The control of geometrical and electronical structure of electrocatalysts can improve the catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and durability in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Spacially confined growth and heteroatom doping can achieve this prospection of the target electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepared a carbon-shell confined Mo-doped CoP electrocatalyst (Mo-CoP@C) via anion adsorption coupled pyrolytic phosphorization method. A Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) of Co was used to achieve Mo6+ doping and carbon-shell-confined-growth. Mo ion doping significantly altered the electronic structure of CoP, which produced a local polarized environment for water dissociation during alkali HER process. Meanwhile, the carbon framework confined the growth of Mo-CoP and provide protective layer to durable OER process. Consequently, Mo-CoP@C exhibits attractive alkaline electrocatalytic HER and OER activities with the overpotentials of 122 and 280 mV at 0.01 A cm-2. Finally, the assembled Mo-CoP@C-CP‖Mo-CoP@C-TFF AEM electrolyzer could operate for 500 h at 0.1 A cm-2.

To address the challenge of designing a highly reactive and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a hydrophilic Fe-CoPx nanorod array on nickel foam (NF) was designed and prepared in this work. The modulation of a d-band center of Co by adding Fe effectively optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates. The synergistic effect of the bimetallic active sites significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic performance for both reactions. In alkaline seawater, Fe-CoPx/NF exhibited excellent HER (−32 mV at −10 mA cm–2) and OER (216 mV at 10 mA cm–2) activities, maintaining stability for over 100 h at 100 mA cm–2. For overall seawater electrolysis, the catalyst achieved a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm–2, outperforming the conventional RuO2∥Pt/C electrode (1.58 V at 10 mA cm–2). Additionally, in a simulated industrial flow cell, the catalyst operated stably for over 200 h at 100 mA cm–2, indicating its strong potential for practical applications. This study introduced a simple synthesis method for bimetallic phosphides, providing a new avenue for the design of high-performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater electrolysis.

Abstract As a subclass of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) possess a highly ordered porous structure, extensive surface area, and accessible catalytically active sites, demonstrating significant potential in catalytic applications. Although the catalytic activity of individual ZIFs is relatively low, their pore structure and size distribution can be rationally designed and optimized through appropriate chemical modifications and post‐treatment strategies to enhance their catalytic performance. This process requires meticulous control of ZIFs materials to meet the specific demands of catalytic reactions. In this study, a series of CoSe/NiSe 2 nanosheets is synthesized with precisely engineered morphology and architecture using a precursor route involving ZIFs. Notably, the CoSe/NiSe 2 ‐3 nanosheets exhibit a remarkable overpotential of 250.5 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline seawater and 215.3 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, when used as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the material also shows excellent electrocatalytic activity. When integrated with the a forementioned electrocatalyst into a full cell configuration, the device operates at a low voltage of 1.956 V at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 in an alkaline seawater medium, while maintaining excellent stability over a 12‐h operational period.

Electrochemical alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is regarded as an effective method for producing high‐purity hydrogen without relying on platinum group metal (PGM) as catalyst. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the anode half‐reaction, involves a four‐electron transfer process with slow kinetics, which significantly reduces the overall reaction efficiency of AWE. Although highly efficient catalysts can accelerate the OER reaction rate, the high overpotential of the anode still remains an important factor hindering AWE. Herein, ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (U‐NiFe LDH) nanosheet arrays were synthesized and used as anode catalysts due to their robust structure, excellent flexibility, and effective interlayer anion compensation. Only 250 mV of overpotential was required for OER to reach a current density of 10 mA cm‐2 in 1 M KOH. Incorporating the additive ethanol into KOH electrolyte further reduces the required overpotential of AWE to 114 mV. The anode overpotential could be decreased by 130 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm‐2 in a three‐electrode electrolysis system with U‐NiFe LDH as the anode. This work provides a possible approach for the development of low‐energy and green AWE technology for electrocatalytic hydrogen production.

Abstract Mass transfer factor plays an indispensable role in high current density to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, yet research on modulating reactant mass transport remains limited. Herein, by leveraging the dual acid‐base properties of aluminum sites, both the activation of the electronic activity of the layer for layered double hydroxides (LDH) and construction of the interlayer hydroxide coordination field (IHCF) have been achieved through in situ electrochemical reconstruction. It not only facilitates charge transfer and the surface catalytic transformation of reaction intermediates but, most notably, the presence of the IHCF significantly enhances the mass transport of reactants. As a result, the overpotential of LDHs with IHCF is only 164 mV, significantly better than the reported Ni‐based catalysts. Deuterium kinetic isotope effect experiments and pH‐dependence measurements demonstrate that the IHCF effectively enhances substrate mass transport capability and structural stability, thereby accelerating the proton‐coupled electron transfer process. To further validate the high mass transport characteristics, stability tests of the alkaline flow electrolyzer show that catalysts maintain over 1000 h of stability at a high current density. This work suggests that the IHCF effect can be utilized for further design and synthesis of efficient water oxidation catalysts for practical application.

Global photosynthesis is the key element of the recently proposed global carbon cycle model. It describes an integral action of ensemble of photosynthesizing organisms in large systems, like biosphere and global carbon cycle. At least two main features associated with the participation of global photosynthesis in large systems, differs it from conventional photosynthesis of individual organism. The first is the cyclic character of the photosynthesis evolution, and the second is spontaneous striving of global photosynthesis to the ecological compensation point that brings the carbon cycle to a stationary state. It is shown that the conventional photosynthesis equation should be modified to describe this process in the biosphere and in the global carbon cycle. The terms “living matter” and “sedimentary organic carbon” were used as an analog of biomass in the equation of global photosynthesis. Corresponding changes were made to describe the second product of global photosynthesis-atmospheric oxygen. Considering that the global carbon cycle reached the ecological compensation point that occurred in the Miocene, when the further accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere and sedimentary organic matter in the earth’s crust ended, the obtained approximate equations of photosynthesis were used to estimate the world’s potential oil resources. To test the predictive capability of the model we compared the above characteristic with its analogue, the world’s initial summary resources, calculated by independent geological methods. In spite of various assumptions a surprising proximity was found. It evidences that the model itself and underlying physical foundations are realistic and can be used as approximation in solving different problems in geology, evolution, climatology and related fields of knowledge.

High-capacity power battery can be attained through the elevation of the cut-off voltage for LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 high-nickel material. Nevertheless, unstable lattice oxygen would be released during the lithium deep extraction. To solve the above issues, the electronic structure is reconstructed by substituting Li+ ions with Y3+ ions. The dopant within the Li layer could transfer electrons to the adjacent lattice oxygen. Subsequently, the accumulated electrons in the oxygen site are transferred to nickel of highly valence state under the action of the reduction coupling mechanism. The modified strategy suppresses the generation of oxygen defects by regulating the local electronic structure, but more importantly, it reduces the concentration of highly reactive Ni4+ species during the charging state, thus avoiding the evolution of an unexpected phase transition. Strengthening the coupling strength between the lithium layers and transition metal layers finally realizes the fast-charging performance improvement and the cycling stability enhancement under high voltage. Authors report on restructuring the electronic structure of a high-nickel material by substituting Li+ ions with Y3+ ions. This strategy suppresses the generation of oxygen defects with a reduction coupling mechanism improving high-voltage stability.

Chromium (Cr) isotopes are pivotal proxies for understanding Earth’s atmospheric oxygenation history. This review highlights δ53Cr signatures as tools for reconstructing redox dynamics during events like the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) and the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE). Advances in analytical techniques, particularly multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), have enhanced δ53Cr measurement precision, revealing critical insights into oxidative weathering and atmospheric oxygenation. Challenges such as local environmental variability and uncertainties in oxygen thresholds remain, but integrating δ53Cr with complementary proxies promises a more comprehensive view of Earth’s redox evolution. This synthesis underscores the transformative role of Cr isotopes in tracing oxygenation processes and their implications for the evolution of the biosphere.

The marsupial moles are arguably Australia’s most enigmatic marsupials. Almost indistinguishable from placental (eutherian) moles, they provide a striking example of convergent evolution. Exploring the genome of the southern marsupial mole, we provide insights into its unusual biology. We show definitively by retrophylogenomic analysis that marsupial moles are most closely related to bandicoots and bilbies (order Peramelemorphia). We find evidence of a marked decline in marsupial mole effective population size, most likely preceding the arrival of humans in regions near its range, and potentially corresponding to periods of climatic change. Our analysis of loss of eye function—an adaptation to subterranean life—reveals a structured order of loss of gene function associated first with the lens, then cone, and finally rod cells. Last, we identify genetic changes suggestive of adaptation to an oxygen-poor environment and of its evolution of partially descended testes.

Abstract Choosing the right and appropriate amount of substances in a changing environment is essential for the growth and survival of all species. We found that elevated oxygen levels significantly enhanced the iron-rich trapping devices of a nematode-trapping fungus (NTF), Arthrobotrys oligospora . Interestingly, genomic analysis revealed that all NTFs lacked coq7 , a key gene involved in ubiquinol (UQ) biosynthesis and iron chelation. Notably, A. oligospora utilizes UQ instead of UQ for low-aerobic respiration. Transcriptional, metabolic, mutational, and phenotypic analyses revealed that A. oligospora produces a chemotaxonomic class of highly oxygenated arthrobotrins with characteristics similar to UQ skeleton, for high-aerobic respiration. Disruption of arthrobotrin biosynthesis in the Δ art mutant not only enhanced UQ biosynthesis, but also triggered trapping device formation and nematicidal activity under elevated oxygen conditions. The addition of UQ to both wild-type and Δ art mutants strongly inhibited trapping device development. Remarkably, the iron-rich trapping devices preferentially capture N2 nematodes harboring iron-chelating COQ7 with ferritin properties. Time-calibrated evolutionary analyses, combined with geological data, indicated that the NTF ancestor lost the coq7 gene after acquiring the arthrobotrin biosynthetic gene cluster during the "superoligotrophy" period, characterized by dramatic shifts in global oxygen levels and temperature changes. Our results demonstrate that oxygen is a critical factor in inducing iron overload, highlighting the origin and role of coq7 loss in the evolution of predatory behavior of NTFs. Our finding that NTFs capture nematodes for iron chelation therapy, rather than for food, explains a long standing debate about the limited carnivorous ability of trapping devices.

Q355B is extensively utilised owing to its superior mechanical properties. Nevertheless, the inclusions generated during the deoxidation process with aluminium and the treatment with calcium in steelmaking can profoundly influence these properties. Consequently, this study explores the inclusions formed during the manufacturing process of Q355B utilising silicon–manganese deoxidation alloys in an industrial setting. Furthermore, this research evaluates the deoxidation efficacy of the silicon–manganese alloy and elucidates the fluctuations in oxygen and nitrogen concentrations throughout the entire process. This study further investigates the types, number density, size, morphology and transformation processes of the inclusions generated throughout the Q355B production using silicon–manganese deoxidation alloy; additionally, electrolytic treatment was performed on the cast billets to extract large inclusions. The findings reveal that the deoxidation efficiency of the SiMn alloy is enhanced at relatively low temperatures and with a high manganese-to-silicon ratio. The predominant cause for the increase in total oxygen content in the molten steel during the smelting process is the exposure of the molten steel to secondary oxidation. Manganese–silicon deoxidation adequately fulfils the production requirements for Q355B. Oxide inclusions predominantly comprise Si–Mn-type oxides and their evolved inclusions; during the evolution process, aluminium-containing spinels generate calcium aluminium silicates in conjunction with CaO present in the slag. The number density of inclusions consistently decreases; however, it may subsequently increase due to secondary oxidation and slag entrapment. Throughout the evolution process, inclusions continuously aggregate and grow, resulting in an increasing proportion of large inclusions, while small-sized sulphide inclusions precipitate during the continuous casting process. The analysis of the isothermal ternary phase diagram of the slag system, in conjunction with the electrolytic results of the cast billets, confirms the occurrence of secondary oxidation and slag entrapment during the smelting process. Thermodynamic software calculations elucidate the formation and evolution of composite inclusions, offering critical insights for composition control to mitigate the associated hazards of composite inclusions. Thermodynamic and kinetic calculations of precipitates clarify the solidification conditions and temperature required for the precipitation of MnS, demonstrating that the size of the precipitates is negatively correlated with the cooling rate and positively correlated with the concentration of the strongly segregated element sulphur.

Abstract The utilization of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs) has underscored their utility in high overpotential during the charging process. Among the currently known RMs, it is exceptionally challenging to identify those with a redox potential capable of attenuating singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generation while resisting degradation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as 1 O 2 and superoxide (O 2 •− ). In this context, computational and experimental approaches for rational molecular design have led to the development of 7,7′‐bi‐7‐azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (BAC), a newly suggested RM incorporating N–N interconnected aza‐bicycles. BAC harnesses the advantages of falling within the potential range that suppresses 1 O 2 generation, as previously reported N–N embedded non‐bicyclic RMs, and effectively defends against ROS‐induced degradation due to the incorporation of a novel bicyclic moiety. Unlike the non‐bicyclic RMs, which exhibit reduced O 2 evolution after exposure to 1 O 2 , BAC maintains consistent O 2 profiles during charging, indicating its superior 1 O 2 resistance and steady redox‐catalyst performance in LOBs. This study introduces a precise and rational design strategy for low‐molecular‐weight RMs, marking a significant step forward in advancing LOB development by improving efficiency, stability, and practical applicability.

This study investigates the structural and electronic transitions of sol–gel derived titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy, to elucidate the impact of annealing-induced phase evolution. As the annealing temperature increased from 400 °C to 800 °C, the films transitioned from amorphous to anatase, mixed anatase–rutile, and finally rutile phases. VUV spectroscopy revealed distinct absorption features: a high-energy σ → π* transition below 150 nm, associated with bonding to antibonding orbital excitations, and lower-energy absorption bands in the range 175–180 nm and near 280 nm, attributed to π → π* and t2g(π) → t*2g(π*) transitions, respectively. These spectral features highlight the material’s intrinsic electronic states and defect-related transitions. A slight redshift of the absorption band from 176 nm to 177 nm with annealing reflects bandgap narrowing, attributed to increased rutile content, crystallite growth, and defect-induced effects. Broadening and additional absorption features around 280 nm were attributed to oxygen vacancies and reduced titanium oxidation states (Ti3⁺), as corroborated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS further confirmed the presence of Ti3⁺ species and oxygen vacancies, providing complementary evidence of defect-mediated transitions observed in the VUV spectra. While complementary techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed phase transitions and the reduction of hydroxyl groups, respectively, VUV spectroscopy uniquely captured the dynamic interplay between structural defects, phase evolution, and optical properties. This study underscores the utility of VUV spectroscopy as a powerful tool for probing the electronic structure of TiO2 films, offering insights critical for tailoring their functional properties in advanced applications.

In this paper investigates the Methylene Blue degradation using two common reactors: the nanosecond pulsed discharge in oxygen bubbles and the Argon Microwave plasma jet above the treated solution. The aim of this study is to compare the evolution of the reactors' performance when the electrical conductivity increases. In deionized water, the Methylene Blue degradation and the energy efficiency in the nanosecond pulsed discharge configuration were significantly higher than the Argon microwave plasma jet. However, when the solution electrical conductivity is increased, the energy efficiency of the nanosecond pulsed discharge drops significantly by ~82%, whereas the performance of the microwave plasma jet reactors decreases by ~37% only for a greater variation of the electrical conductivity of the solution. Under these conditions, the efficiency of both reactors becomes comparable, suggesting the necessity to consider various parameters to compare the reactors' efficiency.

Abstract Tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) based metal oxide semiconductor material has been conventionally used for sensing inorganic gases at elevated temperatures. However, in this study, the gas sensing performance of tungsten oxide‐based sensors is evaluated at room temperature. In this study, WO 3 quantum dots (QDs) are synthesized via the electrochemical method, followed by a microwave treatment to dehydrate them. The newly developed process is relatively less expensive and offers the flexibility to alter the structure in terms of phase, size, shape, and vacancy concentration. It is observed that electrochemical process parameters play an important role in phase evolution and control the oxygen vacancy concentration in the powder, which are essential for enhancing its gas sensing characteristics. Results showed an enhanced gas‐sensing ability of WO 3 QDs at room temperature toward inorganic gases, such as CO, NO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 when subjected to microwave treatment. The enhanced gas‐sensing performance of microwave‐treated WO 3 QDs is attributed to its smaller size and high oxygen vacancy concentration. The minimum limit of detection values for CO, NO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 at room temperature using microwave‐treated hydrated tungsten oxide QDs were 4.60, 1.5, 0.35, and 10.25 ppm, respectively.

Abstract Understanding the behavior of high‐entropy carbides (HECs) under oxygen‐containing environments is of particular importance for their promising applications in structural components, catalysis, and energy‐related fields. Herein, the structural evolution of (Ta, Ti, Cr, Nb)C (HEC‐1) nanoparticles (NPs) is tracked in situ during the oxidation at the atomic scale by using an open‐cell environmental aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Three key stages are clearly discerned during the oxidation of HEC‐1 NPs at the atomic level below 900 °C: i) increased amorphization of HEC‐1 NPs from 300 to 500 °C due to the energetically favorable formation of carbon vacancies and substitution of carbon with oxygen atoms; ii) nucleation and subsequent growth of locally ordered nanocluster intermediates within the generated amorphous oxides from 500 to 800 °C; and iii) final one‐step crystallization of non‐equimolar MeO 2 and Me 2 O 5 (Me = metallic elements, Ta, Ti, Cr, and Nb) high‐entropy oxides above 800 °C, accompanied with the reduction in atomic defects. This result is further confirmed by theoretical calculations that these observed high‐entropy oxide phases are thermodynamically preferable to generate above 830 °C. The study provides direct evidence of the ordered–disordered–ordered structural transition of HECs during oxidation.

Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

Abstract Speleothem oxygen isotope records offer unique insights into Asian Monsoon evolution, with their precise chronologies used to identify abrupt climatic events. However, individual records are sometimes used to draw broad conclusions about global climate, without considering the dynamical context in which they exist. We present a robust framework for assessing the regional significance, and hence the potential global significance, of paleoclimate events, using the proposed Meghalayan age onset (associated with the “4.2 ka event”) as a case study. Analyzing 14 well‐dated speleothem oxygen isotope records from the SISAL v3 database and recent literature, we investigate the regional coherency of rapid shifts in Asian paleohydrology, which is the regional center of action for the proposed event, over the Holocene. Three robust methods fail to detect spatially coherent variability consistent with a 4.2 ka event across Asia, either because none exists or because it is of insufficient magnitude. In contrast, the 8.2 ka event is expressed in most records that resolve it. The absence of a clear isotopic excursion across this data set suggests that the “4.2 ka megadrought” was not global, with important implications for archeology and geochronology. This casts doubt on the proposal that the 4.2 ka event marks the onset of a new geologic age. We do, however, observe support for a gradual isotopic enrichment between 3.9 and 3.6 ka, followed by partial recovery—consistent with the “Double Drying” hypothesis and possibly related to changes in El Niño‐Southern Oscillation variability.

Abstract A detailed study of the evolution of transient arc properties in SF6 alternative gas mixtures was carried out on an experimental puffer circuit breaker. Thermal interruption tests were performed in several CO2-based mixtures under short-line fault-like current and voltage stresses, with the test-device providing a similar arc environment and interruption performance to a commercial circuit breaker. The time-evolution of arc properties including the radius, temperature, and electron density were investigated using high speed imaging and optical emission spectroscopy techniques. These results were compared with simulation results from a simple 1-D, two zone arc model. Spatially resolved measurements of the arc were obtained in the critical interruption regions of the nozzle, including the first reported 2-D measurements of the temperature distribution during the interruption process in CO2. These measurements revealed a faster temperature decay in the nozzle throat, indicative of stronger cooling in this region compared to the upstream stagnation zone. Comparisons between the behavior of SF6 and its alternatives largely agreed with the model predictions, with lower temperatures and earlier temperature decay observed in SF6, followed by CO2-based mixtures, while air exhibited the highest temperatures and latest onset of temperature decay. No significant influence of oxygen content was observed on the maximum arc temperature of CO2/O2 mixtures at currents above 500 A, where values ranging from 20 kK to 25 kK were typically observed.

Abstract To study the effect of dose-rate in the time evolution of chemical yields produced in pure water versus a cellular-like environment for FLASH radiotherapy research. &#xD;A version of TOPAS-nBio with Tau-Leaping algorithm was used to simulate the homogenous chemistry stage of water radiolysis using three chemical models: 1) liquid water model that considered scavenging of eaq-, H● by dissolved oxygen; 2) Michaels & Hunt model that considered scavenging of ●OH, eaq-, and H● by biomolecules existing in cellular environment; 3) Wardman model that considered model 2) and the chemical repair enzyme glutathione (GHS). H2O2 concentrations at conventional and FLASH dose-rates were compared with published measurements. Model 3) was used to estimate DNA single-strand break (SSB) yields and compared with published data. SSBs were estimated from simulated yields of DNA hydrogen abstraction and attenuation factors to account for the scavenging capacity of the medium. The simulation setup consisted of monoenergetic protons (100 MeV) delivered in pulses at conventional (0.2857Gy s⁻¹) and FLASH (500Gy s⁻¹) dose rates. Dose varied from 5-20Gy, and oxygen concentration from 10µM-1mM.&#xD;At the steady state, for model 1), H2O2 concentration differed by 81.5%±4.0% between FLASH and conventional dose-rates. For models 2) and 3) the differences were within 8.0%±4.8%, and calculated SSB yields agreed with published data within 3.8%±1.2%. A maximum oxygen concentration difference of 60% and 50% for models 2) and 3) between conventional and FLASH dose-rates was found between 2106 and 91013 ps for 20 Gy of absorbed dose.&#xD;The findings highlight the importance of developing more advanced cellular models to account for both the chemical and biological factors that comprise the FLASH effect. It was found that differences between pure water and cellular environment models were significant and extrapolating results between the two should be avoided. Observed differences call for further experimental investigation.

Herein, we report a simple mechanochemical dehydration (MD) method to synthesize MD-NiMoO4, which is treated with NaBH4 to generate oxygen vacancy-enriched MD-NiMoO4–SBH to understand the role of oxygen defects on water splitting performance. Among the as-prepared catalysts, MD-NiMoO4–SBH, MD-NiMoO4, MD-NiO, and MD-MoO, MD-NiMoO4–SBH exhibits superior activity by demanding a small overpotential (OER/HER) of 241/108 mV with a Tafel slope of 97/85 mV dec–1 (MD-NiMoO4: 293/156 mV; Tafel slope: 114/93 mV dec–1) and is stable for ∼100 h. The activation energies were calculated for electrolysis using MD-NiMoO4–SBH (32 kJ/mol) and MD-NiMoO4 (28 kJ/mol). The calculated integrated areas of 5.41 × 10–5 AV (MD-NiMoO4–SBH) and 3.61 × 10–5 AV (MD-NiMoO4) confirmed MOOH* formation, and the number of active sites was found to be 3.484 × 10–16 (MD-NiMoO4) and 6.540 × 10–16 (MD-NiMoO4–SBH). The superaerophobicity of MD-NiMoO4–SBH was corroborated by rapid gas bubble growth as well as fast evolution from the catalyst surface. The bifunctional electrolyzer with MD-NiMoO4–SBH (1.48 V) and MD-NiMoO4 (1.59 V) released vigorous gas bubbles in the alkaline electrolyte and exhibits robust durability, which could be employed in water splitting devices for practical utility. As observed from the electrochemical results, the MO theory reveals that the band gap state-assisted antibonding state formation, having low electron occupancy to favor OER and HER kinetics.

We report transport measurements of infinite-layer cuprate Sr1−xEuxCuO2+y films with controlled electron (by trivalent europium) and hole (by interstitial apical oxygen) carriers grown on SrTiO3(001) with molecular beam epitaxy. An unusual enhancement of superconductivity upon the moderate coexistence of electron and hole carriers in the films is found, which spans over the whole superconducting phase diagram and becomes more prominent in the underdoped regime. The superconductivity exhibits a two-dimensional nature with a thickness of approximately 5.2 nm, irrespective of the varying carriers, confirmed by angle-resolved magnetoresistance measurements and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Nevertheless, the coexisting electron and hole carriers enlarge the thermal activation energy of vortex motion that deviates obviously from the usual logarithmic evolution with the magnetic field. Our results offer a promising perspective to understand and enhance the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon locked icon Physics Subject Headings (PhySH)MagnetoresistanceSuperconductivityCupratesSuperconductorsThin filmsResistivity measurements

The 2D CdSe/CdS core/shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) have recently emerged as a new class of promising photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. Here, we have synthesized 2D/2D composites of CdSe/CdS core/shell nanoplatelets with MoS2 nanosheets for photocatalytic water splitting where hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution rates are 221.4 (909.7 μmol·g–1) and 114.8 μmol·g–1·h–1 (461.1 μmol·g–1), respectively, under 360 nm laser irradiation. Notably, an extraordinary external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 76.12% is obtained. The interfacial charge transfer dynamics are elucidated through steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates delayed recovery kinetics, corroborating the enhanced charge separation and transfer processes within the composite structure. The underlying mechanisms of the enhanced photocatalytic behavior elucidate the role of the 2D/2D interface. The synergistic integration of CdSe/CdS NPLs with MoS2 NSs results in an extended light absorption range, improved charge separation, and increased availability of catalytic active sites, collectively contributing to superior photocatalytic performance.

Small RNAs (sRNA) play an essential role in the epigenetic modulation of the genome. They are implicated in numerous processes, encompassing factors that mitigate both abiotic and biotic stressors. Notable among these are heat shock proteins (HSP), enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and nuclear factor Y (NF-Y). Molecularly, sRNAs are characterized by sequences of approximately 21–23 nucleotides in length. Based on contemporary understandings in plant science, numerous abiotic constraints have the potential to curtail crop yield, growth, and reproductive potential in plants. These constraints exert their deleterious effects by undermining cellular homeostasis, perturbing ionic equilibrium, and impinging upon essential physiological processes. However, evolution has endowed certain plant species with the ability to adapt to elevated thermal conditions through the nuanced regulation of genes and proteins, notably heat shock factors (HSF) and HSP. While there has been an incremental growth in literature concerning microRNA (miRNA) functionality in plants, the emergent targets of miRNA and their intricate relationship with the HSF-HSP complex remain underexplored. In this scholarly review, we delve into the thermal responses of HSF-HSP in both Hordeum vulgare and Arabidopsis thaliana, emphasizing their regulation by miRNA under conditions of heat stress.

The role of subducting slab-derived supercritical fluids in transferring oxidized components in subduction zones remains poorly constrained. We investigated the oxidation state and effect of supercritical fluids by a combined study of petrology and geochemistry on an ultrahigh-pressure eclogite-vein system from the Dabie orogen, China. These samples record the composition and evolution of supercritical fluids at subarc depths. Multiphase crystal inclusions trapped within minerals in the vein encompass calcite, anhydrite, and magnetite, suggesting that the supercritical fluids contain such cations as S6+, C4+, and Fe3+. Whole-rock and mineral compositions of the eclogites vary systematically with distance from the vein, suggesting that the eclogites adjacent to the vein were metasomatized by vein-forming supercritical fluids. The garnet-clinopyroxene oxybarometric results indicate that the metasomatism of supercritical fluids resulted in the elevation of oxygen fugacity in the eclogites. The metasomatized eclogites exhibit decreases in Fe and S contents, Fe3+/Fetotal ratios, and modes of omphacite and pyrite. This observation suggests that the supercritical fluids dissolving omphacite and pyrite were accompanied by a Fe-S redox coupling process during fluid-rock reactions. This process further releases Fe3+ and S6+ from the eclogites to supercritical fluids. In combination with the mineral composition of the vein, it is inferred that sulfur was likely transported farther by the supercritical fluids. Therefore, some supercritical fluids were oxidizing at the subducting slab-mantle wedge interface and thus can oxidize the metasomatized rocks. Therefore, supercritical fluids are efficient carriers of oxidized components from the subducting slab to the mantle wedge, eventually contributing to the oxidization of arc magma sources.

Abstract Helium nuclei (alpha particles) strongly influence the momentum and energy balance in the solar wind, comprising up to 20% of the solar wind mass density. In fast Alfvénic wind at heliocentric distances greater than 0.3 au, the alpha particles’ bulk flow speed is systematically different to that of the protons. This relative drift speed is of unknown origin and is often close to the local Alfvén wave speed. Novel Parker Solar Probe measurements of the solar wind below 0.3 au show that, closer to the Sun, the alpha–proton drift speed remains on the order of 100–200 km s −1 , even where the Alfvén speed is greater than 600 km s −1 . This relative speed is quantitatively similar to oxygen–hydrogen drift speeds observed in the transition region by remote sensing, suggesting similar selective acceleration processes in the corona. Due to the relative speed of the Alfvén wave to each particle population close to the Sun, the alphas fluctuate with velocity amplitudes comparable to those of the protons, altering the energy balance of the wave. As a result, alpha particles carry a significant fraction of the total kinetic energy in Alfvénic fluctuations in the near-Sun solar wind. The alpha–proton drift speed is comparable to the proton speed in the near-Sun wind, making the bulk flow of the alpha particles a significant contribution to the kinetic energy flux. These heavy-ion dynamics provide new observational constraints on quantifying the energy budget of the solar wind and the magnetic field evolution through the heliosphere.

We calculate the energy dependence of inclusive and diffractive neutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering cross sections within the dipole picture, focusing on the ultrahigh-energy regime. We predict an up to ∼10% nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-oxygen scattering originating from the nonlinear QCD dynamics in the small-x Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. Diffraction is found to be a small 1%−4% contribution to the total cross section across a wide range of neutrino energies relevant for current and near-future experiments. The diffractive cross section is calculated separately for the coherent and incoherent channels that are found to be of equal importance. Additionally, we include the dominant contribution from the |qq¯g⟩ Fock state of the W± and Z bosons in the high-Q2 limit, along with the lowest-order |qq¯⟩ contribution. The |qq¯g⟩ contribution is found to be numerically significant, reaching up to 40% of the diffractive cross section. Published by the American Physical Society 2024

She is a leader in the field of nanogeoscience, which centers around how nanoparticles lead to mineral formation in geological systems. In over half a century of research, she has made major contributions in mantle mineralogy, deep earth geophysics, and the thermodynamics behind mineral formation. She even lent her name to a recently discovered mineral─navrotskyite.Credit: Alexandra NavrotskyNow Navrotsky heads up the Navrotsky Eyring Center for Materials of the Universe at Arizona State University. The center represents a unique multidisciplinary initiative aiming to better understand what materials make up other planets, how the planets have formed, and how they evolve over time. Navrotsky is also exploring how materials form in the kinds of extreme conditions found in the universe, using ASU's new facilities for high-pressure and high-temperature materials research.Rachel Brazil talked with Navrotsky about the importance of looking at planets on the nanoscale, what we already know about the universe's many materials, and what she is still hoping to discover. This interview was edited for length and clarity.What is nanogeoscience, and why is it important for understanding the chemistry of other planets?Click to copy section linkSection link copied!If you think of how many atoms make up a nanometer, it's about four or five atoms in a row. So nanogeoscience focuses on the behavior of atoms at that scale.From the geologic and essentially planetary point of view, much, if not almost all, of the reactivity that occurs in the universe occurs with the involvement of small particles. Big particles, big single crystals are really chemically pretty unreactive, and once they are reactive, they will corrode, form small particles, etc. So the majority of reactions─whether we're talking about our solar system, whether we're talking exoplanets─most of those reactions involve small particles.Now what is interesting about it is that the small particles have very different properties from large particles. They will be different in their chemical reactivity; they will be different in their thermodynamic properties; they will be different in how they absorb impurities and how they catalyze chemical reactions.What do we know about materials on other planets?Click to copy section linkSection link copied!One has a general picture of the likely compositions [of elements on other planets], but if one looks at the variety of exoplanets, or one even looks at Mars or Jupiter, then one knows much less about the fundamental chemistry. We know the range of pressures because those are constrained by the size of the planets, and we make educated guesses about the temperatures.[We have] quite a bit of information now from the [Mars] rovers and of course the various planetary probes. But that information has to be brought together with what the likely chemistry is and what the reactions are or could be. Right now we have more ideas than facts.You're the director of the Materials of the Universe Center at Arizona State University. What is the objective of that center, and what do you hope to achieve?Click to copy section linkSection link copied![We] are addressing the fundamental question of, how do the intrinsic properties of materials determine the evolution of planets, the properties of planets, the properties of resources?Venus, Earth, and Mars: They're similar in size; they're similar in containing a lot of silicate minerals. But they're very different in how those minerals react; they're very different in what their surfaces are; they're very different in how much water and oxygen they contain; therefore, they're very different in how their properties are influenced by nanoparticles.The fascinating thing is to try to bring together what we've observed in terms of planetary atmospheres and a lot of things that we think we understand about how planets formed, and then look at this at a nanoscopic scale to understand the actual chemistry of what has gone on and what will go on. And that gets us into evolution because if you think of the way planets have changed since their formation, since the formation of the Earth, and since the eventual evolution that led to life, this is all chemistry.We're [also] interested in extracting resources from the Earth and eventually from other places in space, perhaps even bringing an asteroid to Earth for its metal content. Maybe there are planets out there that are made entirely of metals; maybe there are planets out there that are made entirely of sulfides.ASU recently received a $14.7 million US National Science Foundation grant to set up a facility for high-pressure and high-temperature materials research. What can studying materials in these conditions tell us?Click to copy section linkSection link copied!The biggest unanswered question is why materials compress and change their structures the way they do. What is that telling you about how atoms interact? That's the fundamental physics and chemistry question.The fundamental materials and geological question is, how do these reactions determine what materials form? And finally, can you harness this richness of pressure and temperature to make new materials? For example, there have been some indications that high pressures can make some interesting new superconducting materials.High pressure got started, of course, because one wanted it to make diamonds. Well, now one makes diamonds by all sorts of other methods, not just by high pressure.So similarly, if we find some materials at high pressure that really have interesting properties, then the next step always is going to be to find easier, more economical, more scalable ways of making them. But first you have to discover new materials at high pressure and temperature.The mineral navrotskyite was recently discovered in Utah. How did it get named after you?Click to copy section linkSection link copied!A mineral is typically named after somebody who has done something significant, perhaps related to that mineral. The second part is you need to have somebody that has identified and characterized a mineral and wants to name it after you. It's a long proposition through the International Mineralogical Association.[It] came as an absolute surprise to me. You don't go through life thinking you will get a mineral named after you. You go through life doing the science that you find fascinating, that you can get funding for. I'm as surprised as anybody that my career has taken me as far as it has.Rachel Brazil is a freelance contributor to Chemical & Engineering News, the independent news outlet of the American Chemical Society.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!AuthorRachel BrazilCited By Click to copy section linkSection link copied!This article has not yet been cited by other publications.Download PDFFiguresReferences Get e-AlertsGet e-AlertsACS Central ScienceCite this: ACS Cent.

Exercise requires physiological adjustments to defend regulatory variables. Oxygen delivery is augmented to support metabolic rate, inactive tissues vasoconstrict to maintain blood pressure, the vasculature dilates to support convective heat transfer, cardiovascular reflexes maintain perfusion and arterial pressure, etc. At the whole-body level, the result is the sustainment of power output until metabolic demand outpaces oxygen supply. While numerous tissues are involved during exercise, it is fair to say that the cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal systems dominate: the former as the contractile units driving locomotion and the latter as driving oxygen transport required for energy provision. Thus, it would make sense that there is a physiological link between muscle and cardiac activity, such that they exhibit temporal coordination to achieve efficient movement. During concentric muscle contractions intramuscular pressure transiently impedes flow, followed by hyperaemia during relaxation due to an increased pressure gradient across the muscle vasculature. Theoretically, coupling of muscle contraction with cardiac rhythms (cardio-locomotor coupling) dissociates the peaks of intramuscular and arterial pressure occurring at the same time, promoting greater blood flow in muscle and decreasing cardiac afterload. Natural entrainment of heart rate (HR) and cadence occurs during running (Kirby et al., 1989), and coaching foot strikes to occur during diastole is haemodynamically beneficial. However, previous investigations used surrogates of muscle activity (foot strike) and measured only snapshots of exercise responses (i.e. stroke volume at specified time points). This is a broader limitation of physiology in general where, due to historical inertia and methodological limitations, our data sometimes fail to capture the human body as a non-linear dynamic network by relying on isolated/static measures to explain complex physiology. When viewed as a complex adaptive system, the outcomes (e.g. aerobic performance) cannot be solely determined by one component (e.g. cardiac output or mitochondrial content) (Balague et al., 2020). Even higher-level isolated variables such as running economy, which represents several individual physiological characteristics (biomechanics, muscle and tendon properties, bioenergetics), is not sufficient by itself to explain performance. Complex networks (e.g. a city) are made up of individual nodes/components (businesses, homes, people) that interact through various connections/linkages (transportation systems, relationships). The collective behaviour of the city (its economy or flow of resources and information) cannot be determined by an individual component but how all the nodes interact. Seminal work by Bashan et al. (2012) introduced the field of Network Physiology as the human organism exemplifies the integration of multiple systems to achieve an outcome. The authors showed substantial connectivity between and within the brain and periphery during sleep, and importantly, how these connections facilitated the emergence of basic physiological conditions (transition from deep to light sleep) (Bashan et al., 2012). Globally, the field focuses on how hierarchically structured organ systems interact and adapt in real time to achieve, and transition between, different physiological states (e.g. sleep/wake, rest/exercise, health/disease), relying on continuous streams of data from areas of interest. In this issue of the Journal of Physiology, Garcia-Retortillo and Ivanov studied heart–muscle coupling during exhaustive exercise through a Network Physiology framework (Garcia-Retortillo & Ch Ivanov, 2024). Their study comprehensively analysed the cardiomuscular network, its dynamic function during exercise and its relationship to fatigue. Two important methodological points differentiating this study from previous work were the use of EMG (compared to cadence) coupled with ECG and cross-correlation analyses of instantaneous EMG and ECG signals to visualize network evolution over time. The exercise protocol was relatively simple: participants performed two sets of bodyweight squats at a specified tempo (3 s eccentric/3 s concentric) until exhaustion, separated by 5 min (acute and residual fatigue). Electrodes for EMG were placed on both quadriceps and erector spinae. Decomposition of EMG spectral power signals allowed grouping into 10 different frequency bands, ranging from 10–29.5 Hz (F1) up to 205–224.5 Hz (F10), with the rationale of correspondence to muscle fibre types (type I: F1–F2; type IIa: F3–F7; type IIx: F8–F10). Cardio-muscle synchrony was determined with cross-correlations between HR (ECG) and EMG frequency bands (negative correlation = −1, positive correlation = 1), and then link strength was determined between each heart–muscle pair, resulting in >17,000 links given their sample size, exercise bouts and number of EMG locations. Essentially, link strength represents the degree of coupling observed (higher link strength = better coupling). The variability of the coupling in relation to time was further assessed by analysing the first and last third of each bout. In essence, the temporal variability (analysed at short and large time scales) would allow for the identification of the transition between sustainability and fatigue (synchrony and asynchrony). Both EMG and ECG activity were periodized into 6 s windows corresponding to the exercise tempo, with their signals virtually overlapping one another in the first half of exercise, with greater synchrony in the quadriceps than the erector spinae. Muscle activity and EMG spectral band amplitude increased progressively with fatigue, reflecting the need for higher threshold motor unit recruitment to meet the physical demand. There was also a non-linear decline in respiratory sinus arrhythmia amplitude, probably pointing to cardiovascular reflex-driven increased ventilatory demands with accumulating fatigue. As a result, HR spectral power declined with fatigue due to cardiac sympathetic activity. Remarkably, regardless of HR or EMG amplitude throughout exercise, the peaks of spectral power consistently occurred at 0.15 Hz, aligning with exercise tempo (1 squat/6 s = 0.15). Thus, EMG and ECG signals always retained their periodicity in regard to the prescribed tempo, but they fell out of sync with each other when fatigue set in. In general, link strengths between EMG and ECG signals were far stronger in the lower frequency bands, indicating the heart may be more fine-tuned with oxidative muscle fibre activity. However, as fatigue accumulated, link strength was degraded more in the low-frequency bands and the fibre type-specific link strength differences were lost. Overall link strength was reduced by ∼45 (quadriceps) to 60% (low back) compared to the non-fatigued state. During exercise bout 2 (residual fatigue), coupling strength was reduced in all frequency bands, but much more in the F6–F10 range (type IIa–IIx), exemplifying the lack of fatigue resistance in these fibres. A more frequent and earlier onset of negative cross-correlation (link strength) values was more prevalent in the higher versus lower frequency bands during exercise bouts 1 and 2. In one subject, the cross-correlation in the F10 band was almost fully negative from the first contraction onwards (fig. 6A in the paper). Accumulation of fatigue reduced the probability of positive cross-correlations (positive = better coupling) across all linkages by 20% and increased the probability of anti-correlations by ∼40%; residual fatigue further worsened these coupling probabilities. Collectively, using advanced analytical methods, the authors were able to precisely quantify how heart and muscle signals interact. Further, they demonstrate (1) its strength between different muscles and fibre types, (2) that decreased coupling relates to parasympathetic withdrawal and neuromuscular fatigue, and importantly (3) the dynamic changes over time (on a time scale of a few seconds) from the fresh to fatigued state, within and between exercise bouts. Reductionist studies have helped to explain exercise physiology mechanistically (e.g. training-induced muscle mitochondrial quality control). However, exercise involves several layers of interacting systems contributing to whole-body outcomes and isolated molecular analyses are only one facet of a larger organization. It is precisely this fact that 'exercise in a pill' remains elusive – exercise is truly an integrative phenomenon that cannot be represented or replicated by focusing on one component. While advances in molecular biology and -omics technology have been profound, by definition these methods confine exercise to a single restrained level of analysis, ignoring or overlooking the complexity of observations observed in the field (Balague et al., 2020). Molecular studies of course have an upside but may stall progress for bigger translational questions (Joyner, 2011). Placing more onus on the Network Physiology of exercise and how it complements previous methods may be an avenue to accelerate our understanding of what reductionism can provide. The unique methods and results from Garcia-Retortillo and Ch Ivanov (2024) open the door to a wide range of new research and complement previous seminal work, extending the cardio-locomotor coupling concept. Mortensen et al. (2013) showed improving muscle oxidative capacity alone favourably influences cardiac responses to exercise and improves exercise intolerance. Inherent in these findings is the role of skeletal muscle afferents in cardiac autonomic control, where heightened metaboreflex sensitivity precipitates fatigue, dyspnoea and adrenergic activation, but is modifiable by training (Aimo et al., 2021). Postural and orthostatic challenges during exercise can also influence sympathetic outflow via the baroreflex. Recently, a more crude coupling concept, the ratio of internal (%HRmax) and external workload (% of critical speed, CS) (Smyth et al., 2022), was effectively applied in an analysis of >80,000 marathon runners. Low versus high 'decouplers' ran faster by 0.3 m/s on average, experienced decoupling onset ∼14 km later (33 vs. 19 km) and ran at a higher fraction of CS (88 vs. 82%). Collectively, the cardiomuscular network is an integrator of inputs regulating cardiac sympathetic activity, with its temporal resolution precisely defining the deviation from homeostasis and onset/presence of fatigue. Further, the progressive recruitment of type II fibres is one proposed mediator of the V ̇ O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ slow component (and thus fatigue). Indeed, activity in higher EMG frequency bands temporally aligned with fatigue and cardiac sympathetic activity, indicating a loss of efficiency and suggesting better synchrony with type I fibres. The latter finding is quite profound, emphasizing muscle activity rather than cadence per se is a crucial component of the network, shedding light on another feature of the intensity–duration relationship. Fibre-specific synchrony may also have a teleological underpinning given the unique capacity of Homo sapiens for slow-twitch endurance activity. Many sport-related phenomena will probably not be resolved by further increasing our capability to measure biological molecules but by incorporating new laws of physiological regulation (Bartsch et al., 2015). Prime examples include the mechanistic basis of fatigue, which are still debated (Westerblad, 2016), and overtraining syndrome. In both cases a bottom-up model (molecules transmitting information 'up' to affect the whole body) has often been assumed. Fatigue involves various physiological (molecules, cells and organs) and psychological (motivation and stress) factors and develops across disparate time scales. Overtraining is a complex disorder of non-functional coupling between systems, and current biomarkers (e.g. hormones and HR variability) are alone inadequate for its detection. Quantifying physiological coupling between diverse systems may be a superior strategy to isolated tests and has already been demonstrated for detecting autonomic dysfunction (Balague et al., 2020; Da Silva et al., 2023). Accepting the multifactorial origin of these states, greater measurement accuracy can be achieved shifting from a microscopic to mesoscopic approach (Balague et al., 2022). Through Network Physiology, mesoscopic variables can be identified (e.g. coupling) which operate at a higher organizational level, integrate multiple levels of physiological systems and allow for various directions of causal interactions between systems (bottom-up, top-down, horizontal, circular causality, etc.) (Balague et al., 2022). It makes sense to use integrated methods to measure integrated phenomena. Importantly, these variables capture the effect of what is occurring cellularly but constrain the microscopic fluctuations. For instance, heart–muscle link strength in the current study (Garcia-Retortillo & Ch Ivanov, 2024) may be strengthened by increased muscle perfusion, but in this context it is not relevant to know whether the perfusion was caused by microscopic fluctuations in nitric oxide or prostaglandins (known vasodilators). Hence a major question to tackle in the future is how to re-compose previously decomposed physiological mechanisms of exercise and fatigue (Balague et al., 2022). This new model of physiological analysis and cardiomuscular synchrony opens the door for new ideas involving its trainability, application to training prescription, modification by disease and extreme environments, recovery from asynchrony to synchrony, changes during work rate transitions and alignment with other endurance parameters. It is likely that stronger network connectivity, complexity and diversity is a feature of high 'resilience' or 'durability' in athletes (Smyth et al., 2022) and by extension the general population, making these metrics relevant. The growing body of work in the Network Physiology field suggests it can be applied to nearly all health and disease states, and the future of its application to exercise may lead us to novel findings that are unattainable by traditional methods.
