Developing highly efficient, cost‐effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large‐scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal‐air batteries. Herein, a new ternary‐atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2‐N6 and Ni‐N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen‐doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as‐synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in an alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2‐N6 or Ni‐N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2‐N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d‐band centers by the Ni‐N4 sites. This ternary‐atom catalyst may be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt‐ and Ru‐based catalysts to drive both ORR and OER in rechargeable zinc‐air batteries and other related applications.

Hematite photoanodes, a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, are far from reaching their theoretical photocurrent limit. Further designing high-performance hematite-based photoanodes requires an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of PEC water splitting. In situ and operando spectral characterizations facilitate the mechanism investigation, revealing the dynamic surface structures and intermediates of hematite photoanodes during the PEC water splitting process. Herein, in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques were applied for a mechanistic understanding of hematite-based photoanodes in the PEC water splitting system, such as UV–visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The recent progress on charge carrier dynamics and interfacial reaction intermediates of hematite photoanodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is summarized. An outlook on challenges and prospects of in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques for PEC water splitting is given. This review will inspire future mechanism investigation of photoanodes for PEC water splitting to achieve higher performance.

Abstract Spinel‐type nickel ferrite (Ni x Fe 3‐x O 4 , x≤1) is a widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the lower hybridization of metal‐ d and oxygen‐ p orbitals, the OER process on Ni x Fe 3‐x O 4 follows the sluggish adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Generally, activating the lattice oxygen to trigger the lattice‐oxygen‐mediated mechanism (LOM) can enhance the OER activity. Herein, to trigger the LOM pathway while maintaining high stability, iron foam (IF)‐supported Ni 0.75 Fe 2.25 O 4 (NiFeO) with geometrical defects of [NiO 6 ] (nickel cation coordinated with six oxygen anions) units and higher ratio of Fe to Ni cations in octahedral sites ( d ‐NiFe HR O/IF) is prepared by ion‐exchanging with polar aprotic solvent followed by annealing. As a result, as‐synthesized d ‐NiFe HR O/IF exhibits excellent activity (at 295 mV overpotential to achieve 100 mA cm −2 ), fast kinetics (Tafel slope of only 34.6 mV dec −1 ), and high stability (maintaining a current density of 100 mA cm −2 over 130 h) for the OER. The theoretical calculations reveal that the construction of octahedral defect in Ni x Fe 3‐x O 4 enhances the overlap of Fe‐ d and O‐ p orbitals, which can activate the lattice oxygen. Therefore, increasing the ratio of Fe to Ni will further improve the lattice oxygen redox activity, and thus trigger the fast LOM pathway, ultimately facilitating the OER process.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has a significant influence on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the electrocatalytic splitting of water/seawater, because of its sluggish reaction kinetics and complex mechanism. Additionally, in the case of seawater, the presence of chloride anions is harmful for the metallic electrocatalysts and their electrode surfaces, leading to oxidation and the generation of environmentally harmful chlorine gas or hypochlorite ion during the oxidation process, decreasing the efficiency for OER and hampering the overall electrolysis process. To tackle this problem, highly potent and advanced OER electrocatalysts needs to be designed for electrolyzing seawater. This paper presents a detailed discussion on the recent progress made in the research and development of OER electrocatalysts for the process of splitting seawater. It comprehensively explores the use of many types of catalysts, such as polymetallic and heterostructure phosphides, layered double hydroxide-based materials, transition-metal oxides, spinel and perovskite metal oxides, and nitride catalysts, in the process of seawater electrolysis. A summary of the overall seawater splitting performances of few recently reported catalysts falling in the above categories has been provided. An overview of the current state of affairs that includes the expenses, synthesis difficulties, activities, and electrocatalyst stability has been provided in order to aid in a more accurate assessment. The DFT calculations and in situ characterization methods that help in catalyst development are highlighted extensively in this article. Furthermore, a number of requirements that could come up during the electrochemical conversions have been covered, including high conductivity, corrosion resistance, and the ability to avoid aside oxidation and reduction processes. Additionally, the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties of the electrode have been incorporated. This particular property enhances the electrode's interaction with the electrolyte, increases mass transfer efficiency, and speeds up the removal of O2 bubbles during the electrocatalytic OER. Compared to freshwater electrolysis, a variety of challenges have been hampering the practical application of seawater electrolysis (SWE). This paper provides a thorough summary of all relevant data required to generate an effective and active catalyst for SWE.

Resolving the three-dimensional structure of transition metal oxide nanoparticles (TMO-NPs), upon self-restructuring from solution, is crucial for tuning their structure–functionality. Yet, this remains challenging as this process entails complex structure fluctuations, which are difficult to track experimentally and, hence, hinder the knowledge-driven optimization of TMO-NPs. Herein, we combine high-energy synchrotron X-ray absorption and X-ray total scattering experiments with atomistic multiscale simulations to investigate the self-restructuring of self-assembled Co-NPs from solution under dark or photocatalytic water oxidation conditions at distinct reaction times and atomic length-scales. Using the atomic range order as a descriptor, we reveal that dissolution of a Co-salt in BO3 buffer leads to a self-optimization route forming disordered oxyborate Co3BOx-NPs unveiling a high oxygen yield due to the formation of surface oxo/hydroxo adsorbates. Those Co3BOx-NPs further self-restructure into distorted Co3O4-NPs and, lastly, into distorted CoOOH-NPs through a rate-limiting step integrating Co3+-states during the course of a representative photocatalytic assay. Self-restructuring does not proceed from amorphous-to-ordered states but through stochastic fluctuations of atomic nanoclusters of ≈10 Å domain size. Our key insight into the structure-selection dynamics of TMO-NPs from solution offers a route for tuning their structure–function relationships for wide-ranging emergent technologies.

Abstract Defect engineering is widely regarded as a promising strategy to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts for water splitting. In this work, defective NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) with a high density of edge sites (edge‐rich NiFe LDH) is synthesized via a simple reduction process during the early stages of nucleation. The introduction of edges into oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts modulates the electronic structure of the active sites. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses revealed that the edges facilitated the formation of unsaturated Ni‐Ni coordination, which is crucial for promoting the deprotonation of the OH * intermediate. Consequently, the edge‐rich NiFe LDH exhibited a significantly lower overpotential of 228 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm⁻ 2 , compared to 275 mV for pristine NiFe LDH. The assembled membrane electrode can reach a current density of 1000 mA cm⁻ 2 at a cell voltage of 2.5 V. This study highlights the role of edge effects in defect engineering to enhance OER activity and provides valuable theoretical insights for the design of efficient electrocatalysts.

Abstract Effective first‐row transition metal‐based electrocatalysts are crucial for large‐scale hydrogen energy generation and anion exchange membrane (AEM) devices in water splitting. The present work describes that SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH nanosheets on nickel foam are used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and AEM water electrolyzer study. Tuning the Ni‐to‐Fe ratios in NiFe‐LDH and doping with Sm ions improves the electrical structure and intrinsic activity. SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH has higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, and TWS activity, achieving 10 mA cm⁻ 2 current density at lower overpotentials (230 mV, 95 mV, and 1.62 V, respectively). In AEMWE cells, SmNi 0.02 Fe‐LDH as a cathode and anode pair exhibits outstanding activity (0.9 A cm⁻ 2 at 2 V) and stability over 120 h. Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations reveal that the Sm doping in NiFe‐LDH surface enhances its bifunctional activity toward OER and HER. These findings emphasize the potential of non‐noble composites for long‐term water electrolysis in total water splitting and AEMWE applications.

Abstract Perovskite oxides have been considered promising oxygen catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), owing to structural and compositional flexibility, and tailorable properties. Ingenious B‐site ordered La 1.5 Sr 0.5 NiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 O 6 (LSNMF) double perovskite is strategically designed by simultaneously interposing Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 and Ni 0.5 Fe 0.5 into B′ and B″ sites. Controlling B‐site cation systematically tailors the electronic structure of the B‐site cation with a d‐band center (M d ) upshift close to the Fermi level, increasing the overlap of the M d center and O 2p center (O P ). The strong interaction of M d and O p facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and activates the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process, thereby enhancing the ORR and OER activity. For ORR, LSNMF exhibited an onset potential of 0.9 V along with a high limiting current of −8.05 mA cm −2 . At the same time, for OER at 1 m KOH, LSNMF effectively reached a maximum current density of 3000 mA cm −2 . Most importantly, the difference between E ORR (at −1 mA cm −2 ) and E OER (at 10 mA cm −2 ), ΔE is 0.69 V, which stands among the best of recently reported perovskites. The as‐designed LSNMF is stable, efficient, lucrative, and a promising candidate for practical application.

The catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon monoxide (CO) via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction offers a promising pathway toward a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the competing Sabatier reaction presents a significant challenge, underscoring the need for highly efficient catalysts. In this study, we developed a novel catalyst comprising cobalt-oxide-supported nickel-hydroxide nanoparticles (denoted as Co@Ni). This catalyst achieved a remarkable CO production yield of ~5,144 &mu;mol gcatalyst⁻&sup1; at 573 K, with a CO selectivity of 77%. These values represent 30% and 70% improvements over carbon-supported Ni(OH)2 (Ni-AC) and CoO (Co-AC) nanoparticles, respectively. Comprehensive physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses reveal that the exceptional CO yield of the Co@Ni catalyst stems from the synergistic electronic interactions between adjacent active sites. Specifically, cobalt-oxide domains act as electron donors to Ni sites, facilitating efficient H2 splitting. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies in cobalt oxide enhance CO2 adsorption and promote subsequent dissociation. These findings provide critical insights into the design of highly efficient and selective catalysts for the RWGS reaction, paving the way for advancements in sustainable carbon utilization technologies.

Iron plays a central and critical role in the water oxidation mechanism and the activity of transition-metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides. Tracking Fe dynamics (deposition/dissolution/electrolyte transport) and unraveling the chemistries of various Fe active sites under oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) conditions are important for catalyst design, particularly for applications in alkaline electrolysis. Here, we use CoOxHy thin films as a platform to investigate Fe transport and reactivity at the catalyst-electrolyte interface and its impact on OER activity. We find that the deposition/dissolution of the surface-absorbed Fe species is governed by the transport of soluble Fe species and applied potential. Soluble Fe species in the electrolyte adsorb on CoOxHy under stirred electrolyte conditions. Accelerated Fe desorption is observed with a more-positive OER potential. The surface-localized Fe sites generated by absorption from soluble Fe species have a higher OER turnover frequency (TOFFe) compared to Fe in codeposited CoFeOxHy films. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows structural similarity between reference Fe oxyhydroxides and surface Fe sites on CoOxHy, contrasting with Fe sites within the CoOxHy structure made by codeposition, where Fe shows a different apparent X-ray absorption edge energy. The OER activity of the surface-absorbed Fe decreased by Fe desorption but was recoverable by redepositing Fe species under non-OER conditions.

Perovskites are broadly considered a promising class of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. In particular, lanthanum-based perovskites, like La0.75Sr0.25MnO3-δ (LSMO), LaFeO3-δ (LFO), La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.98O3-δ (LSFO), La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ (LSCFO) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.99O3-δ (LSCO), have been researched as catalysts for the OER showing high catalytic activity. Stability assessment, on the other hand, is rarely carried out at industrial operating conditions, despite it being a precondition for industrial uptake. In this study, the material stability and intrinsic activity were evaluated at industrial alkaline water electrolysis conditions. LSMO showed high activity but instability due to Mn leaching. LSCFO and LFO demonstrated high activity at 75°C, but computational Pourbaix diagrams of both LFO and LSCFO predict instability at the operational potential window, which was confirmed during long-term stability testing. The overall findings highlight the importance of long-term testing at industrial operating conditions, as stability investigations at mild laboratory conditions are insufficient to qualify a candidate catalyst for industrial uptake.

The increase in the production of renewable electricity offers the opportunity to transition from the usage of fossil-based hydrogen to green hydrogen. While mass production of green hydrogen by water electrolysis demands substantial freshwater resources, the abundant availability of seawater provides a promising opportunity to directly use it as an electrolyte in a water electrolyzer. However, a major challenge in seawater electrolysis is the low selectivity for oxygen evolution compared to the chlorine evolution at the anode. To address this, we proposed a strategy to boost the selectivity for oxygen evolution by hydrated electrocatalysis, in which water is itself part of the catalyst. Water molecules that are coordinately bonded to the active catalytic sites play a significant role in enhancing oxygen evolution selectivity. This approach was demonstrated with Prussian blue analogue electrocatalysts in acidified simulated seawater electrolyte using rotating ring disk electrode voltammetry. Microkinetic modeling was employed to correlate the coverage by the reactants (H2O and Cl–) with selectivity. Notably, the crystal water coverage on hydrated electrocatalysts emerged as the partial descriptor for the selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction. To gain insights for coverage by crystal water and Cl–, the thermogravimetric analysis combined with Rietveld refinement and microkinetic Tafel analysis was performed. In a nutshell, we explored the question: if the reactant molecule (H2O) is an integral part of the catalyst, can it promote the corresponding electrochemical oxidation reaction (O2 evolution) over its competitor (Cl2 evolution)?

Abstract The rapid advancement of the green hydrogen industry has driven a surge in demand for devices that operate over a broad range of current density. Despite this, the development of stable iridium‐based catalysts for high‐current‐density applications in oxygen evolution reactions remains a significant challenge. In this study, directed electron modulation (DEM) of iridium oxide clusters on cobalt hydroxide nanosheets is achieved using a cyclic Joule heating strategy in pure water. The strategy achieves a rapid change of environmental energy during electronic modulation through Joule heating, which ensures strong electronic coupling between IrO 2 and Co(OH) 2 without significant changes in initial catalyst nanostructure and cluster size. Directed electron modulation optimizes the reactant adsorption ability of the active center (IrO 2 cluster) and corresponding reaction kinetics are improved, resulting in the catalyst (DEM‐IrO 2 @Co(OH) 2 ‐NF) showing excellent performance. The DEM‐IrO 2 @Co(OH) 2 ‐NF exhibits excellent catalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes with only 296 mV overpotential up to 1 A cm −2 and no significant degradation in 1000 h stability test at 1 A cm −2 . Additionally, the anion exchange membrane electrolyzer using DEM‐IrO 2 @Co(OH) 2 ‐NF||Pt/C requires only 1.68 V at 1 A cm −2 and remains stable for 200 h. This work will provide new directions for optimization of active centers.

Abstract Developing efficient and low‐cost electrocatalysts with exceptional durability and electrocatalytic activity for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a significant challenge, primarily owing to the irreversible dissolution of the electrocatalysts in acidic electrolytes. Here, a rutile‐structured (RuSnSbReF)O x high entropy solid solution is successfully fabricated on the substrate of corrosion‐resistant titanium via a high‐temperature sintering technique. The (RuSnSbReF)O x electrocatalyst for the OER achieves a super‐low overpotential of 156 mV and a small Tafel slope of 23.87 mV dec −1 at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in a 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution. A high‐stable operation potential is performed for the long‐term measurement of 213 h at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 . There is a lower energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (RDS) on the Ruthenium (Ru)‐Rhenium (Re) bridge site of the (RuSnSbReF)O x electrocatalyst in comparison with that of other sites for acidic OER. The reservoir‐like Re species in the (RuSnSbReF)O x can bestow/save the electrons to the Ru site through O‐bridges, favorably adjusting the electronic structure and the oxidation state. This investigation opens a feasible avenue to develop an efficient and durable Ru‐based electrocatalysts of rutile‐structured high entropy solid solution for the OER toward the practical applications of electrochemical industry in acidic media.

NiFe-based materials, especially NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), are recognized as the most promising non-precious metal electrocatalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the precisely designed distribution of active sites for enhancing activities is still significantly restricted due to the lack of reasonable modulation strategies. Herein, sulfur doped Ni/Fe gradient-distributed LDH (GD-NiFe LDH/S) is fabricated by facile air-induced strategy at room temperature. This strategy accelerates the growth process with abundant CO

The transition to sustainable green hydrogen production demands innovative electrocatalyst design strategies that can overcome current technological limitations. This study introduces a comprehensive data-driven approach to predicting and understanding catalytic performance for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) using advanced machine learning methodologies. By usimg a dataset of 16,226 data points from the Catalysis-hub database, we developed a novel stacking ensemble model that integrates Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression to predict Gibbs free energy of adsorption across diverse bimetallic alloy surfaces. Our innovative feature engineering strategy combined Matminer-based compositional analysis, Principal Component Analysis for adsorption site related features, and correlation screening to generate robust predictive descriptors. The machine learning model demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities, achieving R^2 values of 0.98 for HER and 0.94 for OER, with Mean Absolute Error values of 0.251 and 0.121, respectively. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis revealed critical insights into the complex interplay of compositional, structural, and electronic features governing catalytic performance. The research provides a powerful computational framework for accelerating electrocatalyst design, offering unprecedented insights into the fundamental properties that drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. By bridging advanced machine learning techniques with fundamental electrochemical principles, this study presents a transformative approach to developing cost-effective, high-performance catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

When the ejecta of supernovae interact with the progenitor star's circumstellar environment, a strong shock is driven back into the ejecta, causing the material to become bright optically and in X-rays. Most notably, as the shock traverses the H-rich envelope, it begins to interact with metal rich material. Thus, continued monitoring of bright and nearby supernovae provides valuable clues about both the progenitor structure and its pre-supernova evolution. Here we present late-time, multi-epoch optical and Chandra} X-ray spectra of the core-collapse supernova SN 1996cr. Magellan IMACS optical spectra taken in July 2017 and August 2021 show a very different spectrum from that seen in 2006 with broad, double-peaked optical emission lines of oxygen, argon, and sulfur with expansion velocities of $\pm 4500$ km s$^{-1}$. Red-shifted emission components are considerably fainter compared to the blue-shifted components, presumably due to internal extinction from dust in the supernova ejecta. Broad $\pm 2400$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\alpha$ is also seen which we infer is shocked progenitor pre-SN mass-loss, H-rich material. Chandra data indicate a slow but steady decline in overall X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the forward shock has broken through any circumstellar shell or torus which is inferred from prior deep Chandra ACIS-S/HETG observations. The X-ray properties are consistent with what is expected from a shock breaking out into a lower density environment. Though originally identified as a SN IIn, based upon late time optical emission line spectra, we argue that the SN 1996cr progenitor was partially or highly stripped, suggesting a SN IIb/Ib.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE) have garnered significant attention over the past decade among researchers worldwide due to their economical electrolyzer components, including bipolar plates, flow fields, electrocatalysts, and membrane materials. They represent a cost-effective alternative to high-performing yet expensive proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). The allure of AEMWE lies in their affordable cell hardware and components, albeit at the expense of somewhat reduced durability and overall performance compared to PEMWE systems. While AEMWE anodes may not match the activity levels of noble metal catalysts, their abundance and cost-effectiveness render them compelling options. Interest in this domain revolves around utilizing earth-abundant metal oxides, binary and ternary metal oxides featuring transition metals like iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), and other readily available materials boasting various oxidation states and coordination configurations. Among these, manganese-based oxides such as MnO 2 and its derivatives have been extensively explored for their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Intriguingly, the complexation of manganese with calcium (Ca) to yield CaMnOx electrodes mirrors the active site complexes found in natural metalloenzymes involved in facilitating OER processes, such as those seen in photosynthetic enzymes like photosystem II. These bioinspired electrocatalysts, mimicking nature's design, hold immense promise for integration into AEMWE setups as cost-effective, durable, and efficient OER catalysts [1], [2], [3], [4]. In this study, we investigate Ca x Mn y Ox z electrocatalysts with varying atomic ratios through comprehensive performance and durability evaluations via Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE), Gas Diffusion Electrode (GDE) half-cell, and Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) testing. In-house MEA stability testing out to 25 hours at 1 A/cm 2 demonstrated steady state voltages of 1.87 V and 1.90 V for CaMn 3 Ox and CaMn 4 Ox, respectively. Additionally, polarization curves at 0 h and 20 h reveal an improvement in performance from 1.9 V at 1 A/cm 2 down to 1.8 A/cm 2 for both Ca x Mn y Ox z catalysts, suggesting an activation of the Ca x Mn y Ox z with use. Our findings reveal that these CaMnOx-based anodes perform comparably to benchmarked commercially available NiFeOx counterparts for AEMWE applications, underscoring their potential as viable alternatives in the pursuit of sustainable hydrogen production.

Tackling climate change demands the deployment of sustainable technologies, among which alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) emerges as one of the pivotal solutions. In AWE, anode morphology plays a critical role in facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a key step in splitting water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas. OER performance can be enhanced by fine-tuning the morphology of the anodes [1, 2]. Therefore, there is a critical need to quantitatively comprehend surface morphology or coating quality quantitatively and define the relationships between these surface features and the activity of anodes. We have observed that conducting a quantitative analysis of the nanoscale structure of anodes produced via ultrasonic spray coating provides a reliable metric, serving as a descriptor to evaluate the quality of particle-based catalyst coatings [3, 4]. For this quantitative analysis, it is crucial to characterize the structure with high resolution. However, high-resolution techniques commonly employed such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) have a significant limitation. They cover only a small measurement area that may not represent the entire surface area. In response to this need, we have introduced multistage data quantification (MSDQ) technique as a full-scale surface extrapolation method. The MSDQ technique is a statistical approach that facilitates an impartial characterization of surfaces by optimizing the process of region selection (ROS) and feature extraction, as exemplified in Figure 1. We validated MSDQ through the characterization of anodes produced utilizing different spray coating processing parameters. AFM was employed to capture surface morphology. Through MSDQ, the following surface characteristics are extracted: the surface roughness indicates the variations of surface texture, measuring the peaks and valleys on the surface, the roughness factor refers to the total area covered by the electrode surface to the projected area, and the homogeneity score quantifies the uniformity of the surface structure, essential for assessing the consistency of catalyst coatings were extracted. For validation, in a first proof of principle, extrinsic surface features were correlated to electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. The anode that showed a consistent surface topography yielded uniform electrochemical activity, while the anode that displayed irregular surface characteristics also lead to a more wide-spread electrochemical activity. To validate the reliability of the MSDQ technique, we conducted independent ROS measurements and found that the measured features were consistent with the ranges previously predicted by MSDQ. This consistency underscores the effectiveness of MSDQ in accurately characterizing surface features of anode, further establishing its credibility as a robust tool for surface analysis. Taken together, the developed strategy exhibits high potential for adaptability across diverse electrochemical systems and their components. Moreover, it acts as a powerful approach for linking statistically backed-up surface characteristics, also beyond AFM, with electrochemical activity. This capability enhances our understanding of how surface nuances influence the overall electrochemical performance, offering valuable insights into optimizing material compositions and processing techniques for improved functionality.

Electrochemical water splitting, a pivotal technology for clean hydrogen production, hinges on the development of efficient catalysts to expedite the challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In recent years, defect-rich catalysts have emerged as a compelling avenue in the pursuit of enhanced catalytic performance. This book chapter delves into the pivotal role played by defect-rich materials in advancing the field of electrochemical water splitting. We begin by elucidating the fundamental concepts of defects in catalyst materials, encompassing oxygen vacancies, metal cation vacancies, and edge defects. We explore how these defects can facilitate charge transfer kinetics, modulate surface reactivity, and influence the overall electrocatalytic activity of materials. The chapter showcases a diverse array of defect-rich catalysts, including transition metal oxides, layered double hydroxides, and carbon-based materials, highlighting their promising applications in both the OER and HER. Furthermore, we delve into the mechanistic insights underpinning the catalytic enhancement enabled by defects, shedding light on the intricate interplay between defect types, defect density, and catalytic activity. A discussion of the synthesis strategies to deliberately engineer defects in catalyst materials is also presented. Finally, we offer a glimpse into the prospects of defect-rich catalysts and their potential to drive innovation in sustainable hydrogen production. This chapter serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness the power of defects in the realm of electrochemical water splitting.

The energy production sector has faced many challenges, especially regarding the environmental impacts caused using fossil fuels. Renewable hydrogen, generated via electrolysis of water, has emerged as a possible solution to reducing global reliance on fossil fuels as a source of energy. Many emerging catalysts are made using hydrothermal synthesis, demonstrating good water-splitting performance. However, the methods used to make such materials can be time and energy-consuming, while generating a significant quantity of chemical waste, which remain in the environment for long periods. This study focuses on the development of a new environmentally benign, solvent-free, room-temperature synthesis design taking advantage of abundant, low-cost materials. In the first stage of this study, a room temperature deposition of Molybdate (Mo) on the surface of Nickel Foam (NF) was identified. This material resulted in a very good performance in relation to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, NF is an effective catalyst for water splitting, making it challenging to discriminate the effectiveness of immobilized electrocatalysts and the formation of oxides can give false results. To address these issues, in the second phase of the work, carbon cloth (CC) was used as a substrate due to its attractive features of low cost, porosity, and lack of catalytic performance in the absence of modification. Copper was incorporated on the CC by electrodeposition and porous copper was formed by hydrogen bubble dynamic. The Copper Foam/ Carbon cloth (CF/CC) was further modified by this novel one-pot room temperature synthetic approach. CF/CC presented a significant improvement relative to its bare form. Performance data showed good current density, impressive onset potentials, good Tafel slopes, low impedance, and good stability. Both HER and OER were tested in this study. 1–3 1 H. C. Shin and M.

The development of effective, economical, and ecologically friendly catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to advancing the production of hydrogen via electrolysis. Non-precious metal catalysts, known for their cost-effectiveness, abundance, lack of toxicity, stability, and efficiency, are at the cutting edge of this research field. Iron (Fe), the second most abundant metal on Earth, shows promise as a cost-effective alternative to traditionally used OER catalysts made from ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir), and cobalt (Co). Fe-based catalysts have typically shown limited OER activity, which has limited their practical use, despite their potential advantages. This study presents a facile, fast, and unique approach to prepare iron-based transition metal phosphate films on nickel foam (TM-Fe-Pi/NF) for OER. The TM-Fe-Pi/NF electrocatalyst has been optimized to exhibit outstanding performance, with a remarkably low overpotential of +267 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 in a 1.0 M KOH solution. Remarkably, this catalyst maintains its OER efficiency without significant degradation even after continuous operation for more than 10 hours, as confirmed by chronoamperometry measurements at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 . In addition, the synthesis method used in this study produces catalysts that have exceptional uniformity, highlighting its potential for the efficient and cost-effective production of high-performance catalysts for industrial use.

Introduction Fossil fuels are indispensable as the main energy source in modern society, but there are concerns about the environmental problems and depletion caused by increased use of them. To realize a sustainable society, high-performance energy conversion devices are required, and various secondary batteries are being developed. Among these, metal-air secondary batteries, which use atmospheric oxygen as the active material, are attracting a lot of attention. Their theoretical energy density are approximately 3 to 30 times higher than that of lithium-ion batteries. [1] At the air electrode of this battery, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs during charging and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs during discharging, but the overpotentials of these reactions are high, which is an issue for practical application that needs high current density. Therefore, cost effective bifunctional catalysts that can promote both reactions are being extensively researched. Perovskites have high catalytic activity in alkaline solutions and are inexpensive compared to noble metal catalysts such as Pt and IrO 2 . [2] It has been reported that Ruddlesden-Popper-type layered perovskite oxychlorides showed high OER and ORR activities, [3] and this study focused on fluorine, which has high electronegativity. The purpose is to clarify the effects of partial fluorination of SrFeO 3 -δ and SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 -δ containing Fe, which is one of the 3 d transition metal elements reported to have OER and ORR activity. [4] Experimental SrFeO 3 -δ and SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 -δ were synthesized by the sol-gel method. [5] Fluorination was performed by filling a fluororesin tube with the synthesized catalyst powder and fluorine gas at various pressures, and allowing it to stand overnight at room temperature or 100 °C. As for the characterization of the obtained catalyst, X-ray diffraction measurements were used to analyze the crystal structure, and a fluorine ion meter was used for the solution in which the catalyst powder was dissolved to quantify the amount of F - introduced. Catalytic activity was evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst, acetylene black, and a cation-conducting ionomer (Nafion) in tetrahydrofuran. This catalyst ink coated on a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode was used as a working electrode. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was used as the reference electrode, and an oxygen-saturated 1 mol dm - 3 potassium hydroxide aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. For OER activity measurement, the rotational speed of the working electrode was 1600 rpm, the scanning speed was 10 mV s - 1 , and the scanning range was set from 1.1 V to 1.6 V vs. RHE, and measurements were performed for 50 cycles. For ORR activity measurement, the rotational speed of the working electrode was 1600, 1200, 800, and 400 rpm, the scanning speed was 10 mV s - 1 , and the scanning range was set from 0.4 V to 1.0 V vs. RHE, and measurements were performed for 1 cycle at each rotational speed. Results As a result of X-ray diffraction measurements, it was confirmed that SrFeO 3 -d and SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 -d were synthesized before the reaction with F 2 . After the reaction, the peak positions were shifted, which confirmed that F - was doped, and it became clear that SrF 2 was produced as an impurity. Figure 1 shows the results of CV measurements normalized by the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) obtained in the potential range of 1.1 – 1.2 V vs. RHE (non-Faradaic reaction region) or electrode surface area. Regarding OER, the activity and cycling stability of SrFeO 3 -δ decreased due to fluorination. Although the surface area of SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 -δ increased due to fluorination, the activity normalized by ECSA decreased. Regarding ORR, it was confirmed that fluorination increased the electron transfer number and improved the ORR onset potential for all catalysts. Although the details are not clear so far, it is assumed that fluorination changes the valence of transition metal, local structure, and amount of oxygen vacancies, which may change the catalytic activity. Conclusion As a result of evaluating the catalytic activity of SrFeO 3 -δ and SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 -δ in which F - was doped, it was revealed that the OER activity decreased, but the ORR activity was improved.

Alkaline water electrolysis is expected to play a vital role in hydrogen production systems using renewable electricity. However, the intermittent nature of renewable electricity can often cause electrolysis cells to shut down. Such interruptions result in reverse currents that accelerate catalyst degradation. Extensive studies of catalytic activity have elucidated that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is contingent on certain descriptors [1]. Recently, the focus has been placed on the surface structure of the catalysts, as the actual OER occurs on the catalyst surface [2]. Previous research has demonstrated that the surfaces of numerous oxide materials with high OER activity undergo surface reconstruction under OER, resulting in the formation of metal oxyhydroxide phases [3]. This surface reconstruction has been reported after OER experiments, although it is challenging to analyze large numbers of samples in this manner. In order to efficiently study and utilize the state of the catalyst surface for material design, a method is needed to induce the surface reconstruction through chemical treatments. Consequently, the present study examines the chemical state of the surface following chemical treatment of perovskite-type oxide Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 (BSCF) by stirring in an alkaline solution, employing X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). BSCF was synthesized using the sol-gel process. The as-prepared samples were subjected to stirring under four different conditions: in 1 M or 7 M KOH solutions with either oxygen or nitrogen bubbling for a duration of 21 hours. The structural and chemical properties were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), XAS, and XPS. XAS measurements were conducted at the BL-2 and BL-11 beamlines of the Ritsumeikan University SR Center. Both total electron yield and partial fluorescence yield modes were employed. XRD analysis did not reveal any significant peak shifts or the formation of a second phase, indicating that the bulk structure of the samples remained unchanged. Comparative studies of the O K-edge XAS for both as-prepared and chemically treated BSCF samples in 7 M KOH with oxygen bubbling were conducted. The peak at approximately 530 eV is attributed to the transition from O 1s to the 3d orbitals of transition metals combined with O 2p. In the as-prepared sample, this peak exhibited low intensity. However, in the chemically treated sample, sharp peaks were observed at approximately 529 eV and 532 eV. These findings indicate that the surface of the perovskite-type oxide underwent a transformation to an oxyhydroxide of Co or Fe, as evidenced by the presence of peaks characteristic of transition metal oxyhydroxides. Despite these surface changes, the results from Co and Fe L-edge XAS showed no peak shifts, indicating that the valence states of Co and Fe remained unchanged. XPS analysis revealed a decrease in the surface concentrations of Ba and Sr. This work is based on results obtained from the project commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) of Japan.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction for emerging energy conversion technologies such as electrochemical water splitting and rechargeable metal–air batteries. In this talk, we will introduce the solution plasma treatment as a powerful tool for the dual enhancement of activity and durability in a Mn-doped Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 . Specifically, we find that Mn-doping in combination with solution plasma treatment boosts the OER activity of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 by a factor of 11, along with the remarkable enhancement of the OER durability. Moreover, the solution plasma treatment of Mn-doped Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 has an effect of improving the atomic order of the OER active Mn 3+ -rich surface, which contributes to the better understanding of oxygen evolution catalysis.

The process of water-splitting reactions provides a sustainable method for storing renewable energies by producing hydrogen fuel. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this procedure is hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is an intricate four-electron oxidation half-reaction. In this study, we report on the synthesis of Vanadium-based Transition Metal Oxide (TM-VO x ), a highly active and stable OER catalyst, by a simple hydrothermal method. The electrocatalysts were thoroughly analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. When used on nickel (Ni) foam, TM-VO x demonstrated an overpotential of +260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the system exhibited remarkable stability for a duration of more than 5 hours without interruption. These findings emphasise the potential of Vanadium-based Transition Metal Oxide materials as highly effective and enduring catalysts for efficient and stable overall water-splitting processes.

Our recent survey of oxygen bonding strength in the transition metal oxides revealed a broad range of reactivities resulting in a V-shape type behavior related to filling anti-bonding states. For metals with filling close to d 0 to d 10 , the oxygen reactivity is generally weak [1]. While oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is well known for metal-oxides with moderately bonded oxygen such as in IrO2 and RuO 2 , chemistry of a weakly bonded metal-oxides is significantly less explored. At the same time, photo-electrochemical solar-fuel devices, such as one developed at Liquid Sunlight Alliance (LiSA), would strongly benefit from anodic reactions which are alternative to OER as a way to produce anodic products with added value and/or having lower onset potentials. Very promising reactions currently being explored are water oxidation to peroxide, epoxidation of light olefins [2] and alcohol oxidation reactions [3]. In our theoretical analysis, we computationally re-evaluate this weakly bonded region and identify the switch from oxo bonded species species to peroxo one, previously known to occur in systems such TiO 2 . We compute the overall energetics of the above reactions and analyze which reactive oxygen species is preferential for each of the alternative reactions. We conclude with discussion of fundamental feasibility and limitations of alternative anodic reactions to OER.

Climate change has become an urgent issue due to the high carbon emission from various industrial sectors. As a result, achieving carbon neutrality has become a priority for society. Hydrogen is widely used in various industries and stands out as a promising zero-carbon energy carrier. However, most hydrogen is currently produced from steam reforming of natural gas, which is unsustainable due to its consumption of fossil fuel and the enormous amount of CO x and NO x by products released. Water electrolysis presents an attractive alternative for clean hydrogen production when coupled with renewable electricity. In recent years, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) has received significant attention due to its ability to produce hydrogen at high rate, high efficiency, and high purity. The current bottleneck of PEMWE technology comes from its reliance on pricey Ru or Ir-based catalysts with limited durability. Thus, finding a low-cost catalyst with high activity and stability for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode is crucial for the next generation PEMWE products. Co 3 O 4 , as an alternative to Ru and Ir-based catalysts, has attracted much attention due to its low cost, good activity, and acid tolerance. A significant amount of effort has been devoted to further improving the performance of Co 3 O 4 and related spinel oxides, in order to reach the superior performance of noble-metal-based catalysts 1 . However, the maintenance of both high activity and acid corrosion resistivity has remained challenging. These two factors are closely related to the OER reaction mechanism, and direct oxo coupling (DOC) has been proposed as an ideal mechanism that optimizes both activity and stability 2 . Nevertheless, the DOC mechanism requires tight control of lattice parameters and metal site distances 3,4 , consequently non-noble-metal-based spinel oxide structures that enable acidic OER via the DOC mechanism have not been reported. In this work, we present a facile method of hydrothermal synthesis that produces aggregated needle-like spinel NiCo 2 O 4 nanostructures. In 0.5M H 2 SO 4 , the NiCo 2 O 4 nanostructure exhibits remarkable activity and record-high durability for acidic OER. In-situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed a higher stability during acidic OER catalysis of the Co and Ni coordination environment in NiCo 2 O 4 compared to its less stable Co 3 O 4 counterpart. This observation indicates the formation of fewer oxygen vacancies on NiCo 2 O 4 under reactive potential, avoiding the critical structural deformation that would impair catalyst durability. Furthermore, we conducted density functional theory calculations to confirm the decreased OER overpotential arising from replacement of Co with Ni in octahedral lattice sites and to learn the preferred reaction pathway for DOC. In conclusion, this research presents NiCo 2 O 4 as an acidic OER catalyst with superior activity and stability. This investigation into NiCo 2 O 4 provides insights into the design of anode catalysts for PEMWE, advancing toward sustainable hydrogen production with high yield and low cost.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one answer for the mass production of hydrogen. However, PEMWE requires relatively high electric power because the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode has a high overpotential. In addition, IrO 2 , used as the general anode catalyst of PEMWE, is very expensive. Although it is known that RuO 2 shows higher OER activity and lower cost than that of IrO 2 , the stability of RuO 2 is quite low. Naturally, it is desirable to improve the OER activity in IrO 2 or to enhance the stability of RuO 2 . Wu et al. reported that the RuIr nano coral with 6% Ir content showed high OER activity and stability [1]. In contrast, the majority of previous reports employed around 50% Ir contents, and the variation range of Ir contents in RuIr catalyst was large, such as 25%, 50%, and 75% of Ir. Therefore, it is difficult to judge the effect of a tiny amount of Ir content on OER activity and stability at this time. The OER activity and stability of RuIr nano coral may originate from the nano coral shape rather than Ir content. This study focused on the Ir/Ru ratio in RuIr binary oxide to investigate the effects of a tiny quantity of Ir atoms in RuO 2 on OER activity and stability. The catalyst shape limited the nanoparticle and excluded the effect from the shape. The different compositions of RuIr binary oxides were synthesized by the Adams method. The Ir ratio was controlled at about 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 50%, respectively. The atomic composition of synthesized samples was estimated using XRF analysis. The electrochemical measurement was conducted by a three-electrode cell composed of a working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 (room temp.). In addition, a working electrode was rotating at 4,000 rpm during the electrochemical measurements. In this study, the potential was converted to vs. RHE from vs. Ag/AgCl. All synthesized catalysts had a rutile-type crystal structure. With the increase in Ir contents, the crystallite size increased from ~1 nm to 3.6 nm. The Ir rates relative to total metal atoms in the synthesized samples were 1.3%, 1.8%, 4.5%, 13.5%, and 46.8%. OER activity at the initial state was improved in comparison with RuO 2 when the Ir ratio was 5%. On the other hand, stability at 1.7 V was decreased in samples with a low Ir ratio. In the case of stability, a relatively high Ir ratio sample would be favored. The results of this study could indicate that initial OER activity is dependent on the Ir ratio of RuIr binary oxide, and stability may be affected by the catalyst shape.

Fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, are currently the primary energy source for the world’s needs. However, their depletion and role in the development of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming and climate change, necessitate the exploration of alternative green energy sources to promote a cleaner environment. Hydrogen, in particular, has emerged as a promising renewable energy fuel for the future. One promising method for producing hydrogen is urea-assisted water splitting, which has the potential to improve both hydrogen production productivity and energy conversion efficiency. However, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a complex six-electron transfer process with slow reaction kinetics and unclear mechanisms, which requires a high overpotential. This has led to the need to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. In general, the majority of research has been directed towards the synthesis of robust, efficient, and economically viable catalysts. In recent years, light irradiation has been introduced into an electrochemical system with the aim of enhancing the activities of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Insights into the mechanism demonstrate that external excitation effectively accelerates charge and mass transfer and thus improves the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. In contrast to previous catalyst modifications, the external field assistance approach allows for greater flexibility in engineering an electrochemical process with facile, continuous, reversible, dynamic, and universal control. However, the utilization of photothermal-assisted urea oxidation reaction has not been reported yet. In this research, we report a CuS/WO 3 composite electrocatalyst with a direct Z-scheme system for photothermally-assisted UOR. Upon irradiation with light, the CuS/WO 3 electrode exhibited a reduced overpotential of 308.2 mV, resulting in a UOR current density of 50 mA cm -2 . Additionally, the CuS/WO 3 electrode achieved a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE under irradiation. The catalytic activity of the CuS/WO 3 electrode was found to be significantly enhanced, exhibiting a 2.5- and 2.8-fold increase compared to that of CuS and WO 3 , respectively. This enhancement can be attributed to the enhanced redox abilities of charge carriers in the direct Z-scheme system. Our studies demonstrate the importance of direct Z-scheme formation in light utilization and the synergistic effect of photon and photothermal on UOR. Figure 1

In this talk, I will attempt to chart the numerous twists and turns the twin fields of photoelectrochemistry and photocatalysis have undergone since the momentous discovery by Fujishima and Honda that anodic films of titania could split water into hydrogen and oxygen under sunlight. Interestingly, these authors did not discover this phenomenon, nor did they pioneer the fact that irradiated titania (or other oxide semiconductor) films could promote the photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants to mineralized products. There are also question marks on whether in the original Nature paper, these authors (and their junior collaborators) truly demonstrated that water was being split into hydrogen and oxygen. Instead, claims have been made that what they reported was a regenerative cell involving the generation and subsequent reduction of dioxygen instead of the photoinduced reduction of protons into hydrogen. (However, these authors did demonstrate, in a subsequent paper in the J. Electrochem. Soc ., that hydrogen gas indeed was evolved in the correct stochiometric ratio with oxygen.) Nonetheless, it must be said that the Fujishima-Honda reports truly sparked intense interest in this solar conversion strategy and spawned a veritable, bonanza for the field, and indeed for the parent disciplines of photochemistry and electrochemistry. Other twists and turns that affected the evolution and growth of these twin fields including the discovery that most narrow bandgap semiconductors were photoelectrochemically unstable, and subsequent attempts to tackle this issue, will be discussed. Finally, the field of solar water splitting is truly at a pivotal point right now and its very future is murky. Avenues that may instead prove to be more profitable will be identified.

Through electrolysis utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, green hydrogen can be produced without unwanted byproducts. For efficient electrolysis, a high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is required. Transition metal-based catalysts in alkaline electrolysis have been extensively studied, offering not only their lower cost compared to noble metal catalysts including Pt, Ir, and Ru but also promising high stability and performance. Particularly, high entropy materials (HEMs) composed of five or more elements in a homogeneous mixture exhibit unique catalytic activity not solely explained by hydrogen adsorption energy, owing to the broadening and mixing of d-band centers of constituent elements. Furthermore, the overall stability of high-entropy materials (HEM) in catalytic reactions is attributed to solid-solution strengthening and the sluggish atomic diffusion effects resulting from their high entropy. In this work, we fabricated high entropy nanoparticles, where multiple elements are uniformly mixed, via a reverse precipitation method. The precursor introduced into the precipitant promptly reacted, disregarding the distinct precipitation rates of individual elements, successfully forming a random and homogeneous single phase, including transition metals (M = Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn). To further enhance catalytic performance, additional different sized atoms such as Mo and W were also incorporated during the synthesis process leading to lattice distortion of the surface atomic structure. To fabricate alkaline OER electrodes using synthesized catalysts, the Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD) method was utilized attaching nanoparticles onto substrates. The resulting catalyst electrodes exhibited optimized performance with two rounds of EPD process, each lasting 10 minutes at an applied voltage of 1000V on Ni foam. The electrode fabricated through EPD outperformed those made using drop casting with Nafion binder in experimental comparisons, demonstrating superior performance.

The imperative shift towards a sustainable energy infrastructure necessitates cost-effective production of green hydrogen, wherein enhancing the electrolysers' efficiency stands essential. Among the possible levers for reducing internal losses is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which, due to its complex four-electron reaction mechanism, causes a substantial overpotential. In alkaline water electrolysis, where nickel electrodes are conventionally employed, small additions of iron to the nickel surface can reduce the OER overpotential tremendously. 1 However, while many studies have developed catalysts based on this elemental composition with exceptional OER activity, their long-term stability under harsh industrial conditions often remains untested, which might lead to false conclusions regarding the catalyst's commercial potential. 2 The active structure of these catalysts has been identified as nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs), 3 and research has logically strived towards optimisation of their synthesis to minimise the OER overpotential. In this context, structural parameters such as the iron content, vacancies and defects, intercalated anions and edge-to-plane site ratio are often in focus. 4 The chemical environment of the electrolyser is nonetheless very different from the environment where many optimised NiFe-LDHs are formed, and despite any robust kinetic stabilisation of the initial electrocatalyst, the electrolytic environment and the operational conditions are expected to shape the structure during the electrolyser's lifetime. 5 Meanwhile, with iron present in the electrolyte, NiFe-LDHs are known to grow spontaneously during alkaline OER on unactivated nickel anodes, offering an alternative and potentially more scalable and cost-effective route to obtain an efficient OER catalyst. 6 In this study, we aim to leverage the spontaneous formation of NiFe-LDH catalysts via electrolyte-mediated pathways to produce highly active alkaline OER anodes that can endure the chemical environment of industrial electrolysers. To this end, we employ in situ Raman spectroscopy's exceptional ability to distinguish metal oxides in aqueous environments alongside electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, XPS and FEG-SEM analysis, and we monitor the evolution of various NiFe catalysts under industrially relevant conditions (80 o C, 8M KOH, 600 mA/cm 2 ). By rationalising the interplay between catalyst structure and the electrolytic environment, this research strives to elucidate whether NiFe-LDH catalysts synthesised in situ can outperform their ex situ counterparts in long-term stability, offering crucial insights for advancing sustainable hydrogen production.

Green hydrogen, produced through water electrolysis, is a vital clean energy source in pursuing carbon neutrality. nickel-iron (Ni-Fe) based materials are especially recognized for their high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline environments. Despite their promise, the low thermodynamic stability of Ni-Fe materials, particularly the dissolution of iron ions during extended electrolysis, poses a significant challenge. In this study, we developed Ni-Fe-based bifunctional electrodes with enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER activity, along with improved stability. The electrodes were fabricated using zinc phosphating, a surface coating technique known for its simplicity and efficiency. Rather than focusing solely on the basic electrode materials, we prioritized operational strategies, such as bias switching, to enhance both activity and stability. We further improved the electrode stability by intermittently applying a reverse voltage instead of maintaining a constant one. This study suggests that bias modulation may offer a promising approach to overcoming the stability limitations of Ni-Fe-based electrodes in alkaline water electrolysis (AWE).

The increasing demand for sustainable energy has prompted extensive investigations into electrochemical conversion devices such as fuel cells, water splitting systems, and metal-air batteries. The efficiency of bifunctional oxygen electrodes plays a crucial role in overall electrochemical performance. In recent times, spinel oxides (AB 2 O 4 ) have emerged as promising candidates for this purpose; however, the limited prior research emphasizes the necessity for a thorough and exhaustive exploration. This study introduces a computational framework that combines machine learning techniques with density functional theory calculations to systematically screen 1240 spinel oxides. Stability evaluations are guided by geometric relation and crystal-likeness score. A metal/nonmetal classifier based on transfer learning is utilized to address data scarcity, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Several selected candidates exhibit superior performance compared to the benchmarking perovskite oxide. Furthermore, we emphasize their potential as mixed ionic and electronic conductors, featuring a network of ion diffusion pathways. This research establishes design principles for the development of high-performance spinel oxide bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.

Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water electrolysers are one of the most promising technologies for easy production of zero-carbon green hydrogen. The global demands for decarbonised means of production have pushed for greater development of this technology. However, PEM water electrolysers reach an efficiency limit most notably due to the sluggish kinetics of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) happening at their anodes. This is heavily due to the four electron transfer steps creating a consequential energetic barrier. As such, there is significant interest in improving OER catalysts to achieve optimal performance. This entails minimising rare metal usage to meet current sustainability ambitions. Modifying catalytic structures and creating nanoshapes to reduce the metal loading is a popular method to achieve this goal. In our work, we provide a novel facile method to synthesise nanocatalysts with evidence of predicted better performance than commercial OER catalysts. Previous work conducted by the group focused on using a K 2 PtCl6 precursor to develop one-dimensional Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) catalysts. Inspired by this, K 2 IrCl 6 is used as a precursor and via a facile wet chemistry method iridium nanomaterials are obtained. The main process involves adding formic acid as the reducing agent and water solvent and letting the reaction occur in a stainless-steel autoclave at the desired temperature. The advantages of this reaction include the accessibility of the reagents and the facile extraction method that does not require centrifuging. Other attempted wet methods presented in literature were subject to consequent product losses due to strong electrostatic interactions between the iridium particles and the plastic centrifuging vessels. The focus of the experimental work is to investigate the effects of temperature, time of reaction, and quantity of reducing agent on the performance of the resulting catalysts. This was done by altering the parameters of an existing internal protocol. Electrochemical performance is measured via Linear Sweep Voltammetry, and specifically looking at the overpotential at 10 mA.cm 2 . Voltammetry tests were performed in a 0.1M perchloric acid electrolyte, purged with nitrogen for 40 minutes before each measurement. Iridium black was used as a reference commercial catalyst, giving an overpotential of 358 mV at 10 mA.cm -2 . Current results indicate that higher performance is achieved by doubling the amount of formic acid compared to the initial protocol (1.08 mL vs 0.54 mL). A difference of up to 50 mV in overpotential was observed, suggesting that further investigation on the optimal quantity of reducing agent to be added might be of interest. Improved results were also obtained by letting the reaction run for 24 hours compared to the initial setting of 14 hours. TEM images will be obtained for each sample in order to make two correlations: one between the synthesis conditions and the structure of the catalyst, and the main one between the structure and the performance of each material. The goal of this comparison will be to determine if one-dimensionality leads to the best OER performances in our catalyst. Furthermore, the catalysts will be put through single-cell tests to observe whether the performance trends observed with Linear Sweep Voltammetry hold when the catalysts are put in practical application settings. Further work will include combining the optimal catalyst with a support to further reduce iridium loading. Figure 1

The technology of hydrogen production by alkaline water electrolysis using renewable energy has the advantages of abundant energy sources and minimal environmental pollution. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in water electrolysis faces several challenges. One problem is the unstable supply of renewable energy, which leads to frequent starting and stopping of the electrolyzer. This intermittency exposes the anode catalyst to drastic potential changes that generate reverse currents, resulting in anode catalyst degradation. Therefore, there is a critical need for research on more durable electrocatalysts. In this study, we attempted to improve the stability of perovskite-type oxides by using fluorination chemistry for surface treatment. We prepared fluorine-treated LaNiO 3 by calcination with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and analyzed the electronic structures of the prepared samples by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. LaNiO 3 and PVDF, a fluorine additive, were mixed using a mortar. The mixture was then pelletized and sintered in a sealed vessel at 350 °C for 12 hours. This experimental condition was based on the fluorination reaction of HfO 2 [1] . Four different PVDF-to-LaNiO 3 mixing ratios were synthesized: 0% (pure LaNiO 3 ), 2.5%, 5%, and 10% by weight. To confirm whether the catalyst surfaces were fluorinated, XRD and XAFS measurements were performed to analyze the changes in the crystal structure and the valence changes by the introduction of fluorine. For electrochemical measurements, a measuring cell for electrolysis was used [2] , which is reported to be analyzable only with powder catalysts. A comparison of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pure LaNiO 3 and LaNiO 3 treated with PVDF showed that the addition of PVDF shifted the XRD peak to lower angles. This shift confirms a structural expansion in the LaNiO 3 crystal lattice due to the PVDF treatment. For a more detailed investigation, XAFS measurements were performed. Analysis in the F K-edge XAFS identified a distinct fluorine peak in the PVDF-treated LaNiO 3 sample, indicating successful introduction of fluorine into the structure. In addition, in the Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure, the spectrum of the PVDF-added sample shifted to a lower energy compared to pure LaNiO 3 , indicating a reduction in nickel valence, likely due to fluorine incorporation. However, electrochemical measurements indicated a decrease in the initial OER activity of LaNiO 3 treated with PVDF. [1] Steven Flynn, Chi Zhang, Kent J.

INTRODUCTION In the future, hydrogen production will be performed by direct electrolysis of seawater. However, every time hydrogen is produced, it is necessary to avoid generating chlorine because it has a negative impact on the ecosystem. We have been developing an oxygen evolution anode for seawater electrolysis that produces only oxygen without chlorine. It has been found that anodically deposited g-MnO 2 -type Mn 1-x Mo x Sn y O 2+x anodes showed the oxygen evolution efficiency for more than 4000 hours in the electrolysis of 0.5 M NaCl [1]. The anodic deposition method has required many steps and further cleaning of the electrolytic diaphragm. For these reasons, in order to commercialize oxygen evolution anodes for seawater electrolysis, it is essential to establish a simple manufacturing method. We are considering fabricating Mn oxide as an active material on an IrO 2 intermediate layer formed on a titanium substrate using calcination method. In this study, Mn oxide electrodes were fabricated by coating various concentrations of manganese nitrate butanol solutions on the IrO 2 intermediate layer and at various calcination temperatures. We have investigated the crystal structure and Mn oxide weight that would have the highest activity for oxygen evolution efficiency. EXPERIMENTAL Titanium metal substrates were immersed to roughen enhancing the anchor effect of the substrate on the electrocatalyst layer in concentrated H 2 SO 4 . IrO 2 intermediate layer was formed by coating on one side of the titanium substrate in 0.26 M Chloroiridic acid with a brush, dried at 363 K for 10 min in air. The other side was coated in the same procedure and dried. And then these substrates was calcined at 723 K for 10 min in air. This procedure was repeated three times but the final calcination of the specimen was continued for 60 min at 723 K in air for calcination. Mn oxide electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution was formed by coating on the IrO 2 / Ti in 0.073～0.52 M Mn(NO 3 ) 2 butanolsolution with a brush and drying at 353 K for 90 min in the same way as when forming the IrO 2 intermediate layer. Calcination was performed at 473, 573, and 723 K. Impurities formed without becoming manganese oxides were electrolytically cleaned in 0.5 M NaCl until no dissolution of the impurities was observed. The performance of the electrode was examined by electrolysis of 0.5 M NaCl solution at 1000Am -2 . The oxygen evolution efficiency was estimated by the difference between the total charge passed during electrolysis and the formation charge of chlorine analyzed by iodometric titration. Polarization curves were measured galvanostatically. Correction for IR drop was made with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. The characterization of the electrode was carried out by XRD and EPMA. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION XRD diffraction clarified that Mn₂O₃ were consisted at 723 K, Ramsdellite-type MnO₂ at 673 K, and IrO 2 at 573 K. Figure 1 shows the relationship between Mn oxide weight and oxygen evolution efficiency. The oxygen evolution efficiency of the anode consisted of only IrO 2 was about 8%. It found that the oxygen evolution efficiency was different due to the difference in calcination temperature, that is, the difference in crystal structure to Mn oxide weight of about 2.5 mgcm -2 . The oxygen evolution efficiency of the anode with Ramsdellite-type MnO₂ formed at 573 K was about 57 % at 1.8 mgcm -2 . The oxygen evolution efficiency of anodes formed at 473 and 723 K with the equivalent weight was about 52 and 32 % respectively. Previous research has shown that anodes containing the γ-MnO 2 formed by anodic deposition have high catalytic activity for oxygen evolution [2]. The γ-MnO 2 contains stacking faults in which β-MnO 2 is mixed into the ramsdellite-MnO 2 [3]. The electrode with 4.5 mgcm -2 of Mn₂O₃ at 723 K shows the maximum oxygen generation efficiency, which is about 83%. A future challenge is to add substances such as molybdenum as additional elements to obtain higher oxygen evolution efficiency. In conventional electrode fabrication using anodic deposition, the addition of molybdenum significantly has improved oxygen generation efficiency. REFERENSE [1]Z. Kato, J. Bhattarai , N. Kumagai, K.

Gigawatt-scale hydrogen production using proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers may be limited by the availability of iridium (oxide), the current state-of-the-art catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid [1]. And yet, iridium-free catalysts have struggled to meet both the activity and stability of iridium oxide, much in part due to the thermodynamic instability of most transition metals in acidic OER conditions. Recently, though, reports of Cu, Co, and/or Mn containing iridium-free spinels have demonstrated promising performance [2–4]. Notwithstanding, the degradation mechanisms of these spinel-type catalysts are not well understood, as well as design strategies to mitigate the degradation. To explore these topics, four iridium-free, spinel-type catalysts were synthesized, characterized, and assessed for activity and stability: CuCo 2 O 4 , MnCo 2 O 4 , Cu 0.5 Mn 0.5 Co 2 O 4 , and Co 3 O 4 . The synthetic route (sacrificial support method) was built upon a previous study on CuCo 2 O 4 for the alkaline OER by our group [5]. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were performed to investigate the crystal structure (see Figure 1A ), surface oxidation state, and morphology of the catalysts, respectively, both before and after accelerated stress tests (ASTs). Additionally, electrolyte samples were taken before and after ASTs to quantify catalyst dissolution. From Figure 1B, linear sweep voltammetry measurements revealed that the mixed metal oxides all demonstrated enhanced mass OER activity compared to the monometallic Co 3 O 4 . From chronoamperometry measurements at 1.8 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HClO 4 , the mixed metal oxide catalysts lasted over 20 hours before reaching approx. 10% of the initial activity. Stability testing in a membrane electrode assembly (750 mA cm –2 hold, Nafion 212) demonstrated over 500 hours of operation at approx. 2.6 V. Operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near edge X-ray adsorption fine structure (NEXAFS) experiments, along with in-situ inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements, are planned to complement the pre- and post-AST ex-situ catalyst characterization. Although these materials have yet to reach the activity and stability of iridium oxide, they nonetheless provide insights on a promising family of iridium-free catalysts and their development.

Novel flame-spray synthesized perovskite oxides of the composition BaSrNi x Fe y W z O 6 exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under alkaline conditions. In particular, BaSrNi 0.9 Fe 0.1 WO 6 , with a catalytic turn over frequency (TOF) six-times that of NiO, displays a competitive Tafel slope of 41 mV/dec in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The double perovskite structure, with its tunable AA’BB’O 6 formula, provides a unique opportunity to enhance the intrinsic activity of Ni sites by co-doping with Fe and W. Comparing the transformations of BaSrNi 0.9 Fe 0.1 WO 6 (BSNFW) and BaSrNiWO 6 (BSNW) using ex-situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) allows a deep exploration of the relationship between the electronic state of the B-site metals, structural changes induced by doping, and the mechanism of oxygen evolution. Ex-situ soft XAS at the Ni/Fe L 2,3 -edge and O K -edge reveals that the electron-withdrawing W 6+ stabilizes the Ni 2+ state in the linear W-O-Ni chains in pristine BSN(F)W; however, cyclic voltammetry (CV) under OER conditions induces a surface transformation of Ni 2+ →Ni 3+ . In BSNW, Ni 3+ formation facilitates the hybridization of Ni(e g ) and O( 2p ) orbitals, activating the lattice oxygen for OER participation via the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). 1 Henceforth, when the redox active Ni( 3d ) band donates electrons to the external circuit during OER catalysis, subsequent holes can be refilled by electrons from the O( 2p ) band, generating oxygen vacancies. Conversely, the presence of Fe 3+ dramatically changes the post-OER O K -edge spectral features of BSNFW; pi-donation from O( 2p ) to Fe(t 2g ) orbitals induces a transformation of high to low-spin Fe 3+ and prevents OER-induced Ni-O hybridization. Hence, it can be inferred that BSNFW favors the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) of OER catalysis. 2 Ex-situ hard XAS at the W L 3 -edge of BSNW shows a decrease in the post-OER white-line intensity, associated with surface W dissolution; this reflects the structural instability associated with lattice oxygen activation, a common problem also for the benchmark alkaline perovskite Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 (BSCF). 3 However, incorporation of Fe into to BSNW, leading to the BSNFW composition, results in high stability and durability under OER conditions, as revealed by W L 3 -edge analysis, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and operando X-ray diffraction (XRD). Operando XAS at the Ni K -edge during cyclic voltammetry provides a unique insight into the influence of Fe on the electronic transformations of Ni during the OER (Figure 1). Ni 2+ sites in BSNFW experience a strong irreversible oxidation to Ni 3+ during the first CV cycle, followed by stable and reversible transformations between Ni 2+ and Ni 3+ (Figure 1a). Comparatively, BSNW requires a longer activation period and higher oxidative potentials before stable, reversible changes in the Ni absorption edge are observed (Figure 1b); this suggests that Ni-Fe charge transfer via pi-bonding orbitals increases the reversibility of the Ni electronic changes. Moreover, the incorporation of structural Fe induces a strong cathodic shift in the Ni redox peak potential of BSNFW; the lower overpotential for the Ni 2+ →Ni 3+ transformation leads to a greater increase in the Ni absorption edge at high potentials. Indeed, a closer examination of the final CV cycle reveals that the oxidative transformation of Ni in BSNFW appears to be coupled with the Ni redox process, whereas for BSNW it occurs after the Ni redox (Figure 1c, d). Such operando characterizations provide a valuable insight into the synergistic Ni-Fe relationship regularly exploited in OER catalysis, though often poorly understood in complex multi-elemental systems. The highly competitive OER activity of BaSrNi 0.9 Fe 0.1 WO 6 establishes this underexplored class of Ni-based double perovskites as a promising avenue for further, targeted exploration.

To achieve a sustainable and environmentally benign energy paradigm shift, the utilization of renewable energy sources through water electrolysis, especially proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), emerges as a promising solution. Accordingly, enhancing catalytic activity and stability of the anode catalyst (IrO 2 ), which constitutes a significant portion of the cost of PEMWE, is crucial for its practical commercialization. Notably, recent research has shed light on the pivotal role of Ir-O bond distance in IrO 2 -based electrocatatlysts, where doping or composite formation with foreign atoms influences oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability. Therefore, understanding these Ir-O bond distance is crucial to effectively manipulate the OER activity and stability. Herein, we developed a hybrid-phase of Ti-added IrO 2 electrocatalyst, demonstrating remarkable OER activity of 233.5 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 and stability for over 25 h through fundamental insights into asymmetric interatomic interactions induced by Ti adoption. Our findings reveal that optimizing the multi-phase evolution by introducing Ti into IrO 2 yields compressive strains in IrO 2 motifs reducing the Ir-O bond distance effectively increase the OER activity. However, In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis further confirms that the longer Ir-O bond distance at 1.5 V (vs. RHE) of hybrid-phase of Ti-added IrO 2 indicates the facile formation of –OOH* intermediates, offering outstanding OER stability by suppressing Ir dissolution. These advancements represent a breakthrough in enhancing the OER activity and stability of IrO 2 , marking a significant milestone in advancing transformative energy shifts toward sustainable and environmentally integral renewable sources.

Electrocatalysts derived from earth-abundant transition metals offer a viable alternative to noble metals for water electrolysis, yet they often suffer from poor catalytic behaviour and limited lifespan. In this study, nanostructured nickel molybdate on nickel foam (NiMoO 4 /NF) were synthesized via a straightforward hydrothermal process at three different durations (6, 12, and 24 h) to assess their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The electrodes, specifically NiMoO 4 -6h, NiMoO 4 -12h, and NiMoO 4 -24h, demonstrated significant OER activity in 1.0 M KOH solution, achieving overpotentials of 315 mV, 290 mV and 320 mV for respectively. Notably, the NiMoO 4 -12h electrode showed an exceptional stability, with only a 1.28% activity decrease after 200 hours at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 . This study presents a novel approach to enhancing the electrocatalytic efficiency of these catalysts through optimizing their electrical conductivity, active surface sites, and surface reaction dynamics.

Hydroxide exchange membrane electrolyzers (HEMELs) stand to be an effective means of achieving low-cost green hydrogen. However, HEMEL durability remains a substantial barrier to realizing this goal. The United States Department of Energy has set a durability target of a voltage increase of 2 µV/hr 1 . We have previously demonstrated constant current degradation rates of 1810 and 560 µV/hr with applied current densities of 500 and 200 mA/cm 2 , respectively, thus illustrating the substantial gap between our current achievable HEMEL durability and our target durability 2 . Gaseous products are formed at both electrodes in a HEMEL; by manipulating the wettability of the electrodes, recent studies have shown that the failure of gas bubbles to detach from the electrode surface leads to overpotentials associated with the loss of accessible reaction sites and exacerbated mass transport to those sites that remain accessible 3,4 . While these studies have demonstrated the impact of gas bubbles on acute water electrolyzer performance, we have found little work to investigate the impact of trapped gas bubbles from a durability perspective. Here we find that electrode wettability can change throughout the lifetime of a device. We investigate the durability of an Fe x Ni y OOH – nF anode catalyst supported on nickel felt in a three-electrode setup with 1M KOH. We find that at a moderately low current density of 50 mA/cm 2 the performance of this catalyst degrades by tens of mV over several hundred hours and that this performance loss is recoverable with the removal of oxygen bubbles adhered to the anode surface at open circuit. Moreover, when we resume the passage of current, the surface layer of oxygen (and associated performance loss) evolves more rapidly – suggesting that the wettability of the anode has decreased throughout the experiment. This is further supported by contact angle measurements of pre- and post-mortem anodes. Finally, we investigate whether the introduction of hydrophilic ion-conducting polymers can mitigate the emergent hydrophobicity of the anode catalyst layer.

Water electrolysis is of great importance for the hydrogen production from renewable energy. The efficiency of water electrolysis depends highly on the performance of anodes because of the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Mesoporous electrodes with high surface area and relatively small pore size (2-50 nm) have attracted much attention as highly active OER electrodes; however, the mass transportation of generated oxygen molecules and hydroxide ions in mesopores often limit the OER current density. In this study, we propose a novel class of materials, namely flexible mesoporous hydrogel electrodes which consist of assemblies of CoOOH nanosheets. Flexible mesoporous hydrogel electrodes were prepared by electrochemical deposition of cobalt hydroxide nanosheets modified with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (depicted as Co-ns [1]) on nickel substrates. Co-ns formed a house-of-cards assembly, having characteristics of hydrogels, during the deposition process. The surface modifying group of Co-ns was anodically decomposed and Co-ns was transformed into CoOOH nanosheets. Because of the weak connections among CoOOH nanosheets the resultant assemblies provided flexible mesoporous frameworks. The flexible mesoporous electrodes with different thicknesses (4-37 μm) were prepared, changing the deposition time. The porosity of the flexible mesoporous electrodes were estimated to be approximately 97% because of the very thin thickness of the CoOOH nanosheets. Rigid mesoporous electrodes with Co 3 O 4 frameworks with different thicknesses (11-60 μm) were also prepared by dip-coating method, using Pluronic F127 as a template. The porosity of the rigid mesoporous electrodes was approximately 78%. The electrochemical tests were performed in a three electrode cell at 30 ºC. The OER polarization curves of the flexible mesoporous electrodes and the rigid mesoporous electrodes in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte are shown in the Figure 1. The OER current densities of the rigid mesoporous electrodes depend quantitatively on the thickness of the films at 1.50 V vs. RHE, though the current densities became independent of the thickness of the films at 1.60 V vs. RHE. On the other hand, the OER current densities of the flexible mesoporous electrodes depend quantitatively on the thickness of the films at wide potential region, even at 1.60 V vs. RHE, indicating that the high mass transport ability of generated oxygen molecules and hydroxide ions in the mesopores. In conventional rigid mesoporous electrodes, oxygen bubbles should form within mesopores with defects, i.e. large nanospace and cracks, and the generated bubbles plug the mass transport paths. The flexible mesoporous hydrogel electrodes are expected to have defect-less mesoporous structures because they can change the mesoporous structures flexibly to reduce defects, and defects can be self-healed once they are formed. It is also expected that the flexible frameworks change their mesoporous structure to optimize the mass transportation path during OER. In conclusion, novel mesoporous hydrogel electrodes were prepared for the first time by the electrochemical deposition of Co-ns. The flexible mesoporous hydrogel electrodes exhibited high OER performance, depending on the thickness of the films quantitatively at high current density region. Flexible mesoporous hydrogel electrodes are promising as novel types of electrodes to improve the efficiency of water electrolysis.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is receiving tremendous attention by many researchers in the field of the electrochemistry as it shows the potential to make the electrolytic hydrogen production more cost-effective. This technological advance has been made possible by the progress in the polymer chemistry of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) [1]. These materials can conduct hydroxide anions without suffering from the chemical degradation induced by the hydroxide itself. Like alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), AEMWE can exploit low cost and abundant materials, for example nickel and its alloys, for plates and porous transport layers and as catalysts. Furthermore, catalyst coated membranes (CCMs) can be manufactured as in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis and higher current densities can be achieved compared to AWE [2]. However, nickel-based catalysts suffer from low mass activity as many other platinum-group metals-free (PGM-free) catalysts [3]. This downside could be mitigated by employing thick and high loading catalyst layers. However, as the catalyst is placed further from the membrane, the ohmic loss induced by the thickness of the electrode increases and reduces the utilization of the catalyst [4]. As the cost of PGM-free catalysts is orders of magnitude lower than traditional platinum and iridium catalysts, the fabrication of high loading catalyst seems a viable solution. Nevertheless, as the catalyst layer thickness continues to increase, the utilization of the catalyst decreases further and eventually it limits the performance improvement [3]. This applies especially to water or low concentration electrolyte fed systems, as concentrated KOH solution has been shown to greatly reduce catalyst layer ionic resistance [5]. Furthermore, mass transport issue can also play a significant role limiting performance as thick electrode have higher diffusion resistance. To explore the fabrication and electrochemical behavior of high loading anode electrodes, catalyst coated membranes (CCMs) were manufactured via decal transfer method [6]. Raney TM Nickel mixed with Co 3 O 4 and Raney TM Nickel served as the anode and cathode catalyst and the anode catalyst layer thickness was adjusted to control the loading. Low concentration electrolyte (0.1 KOH) was fed to the anode and the cathode was left dry. As expected, the cell voltage decreased increasing the catalyst loading. Notably, the performance was improved even when the catalyst loading increased from 6 to 12 mg/cm 2 . This work aims to study the performance limitations of high loading catalyst layer with PGM-free catalysts. It was found that even high catalyst loadings (12 mg/cm 2 ) can deliver a sensible improvement of overall performance. We explain this with our systematic approach in this study.

Hydrogen (H 2 ) generation through electrolysis has attracted much attention because of growing global energy needs and the demand for green energy strategies. Hydrogen generation through water electrolysis is accompanied by two half reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, OER has the limitation of lowering the energy efficiency of the entire cell due to its sluggish reaction problem and high overpotential. Also, commercial OER electrocatalysts are limited to noble metal oxide such as IrO 2 and RuO 2 , which are scarce and have stability problems in alkaline solution. Therefore, there is a growing desire to develop an OER electrocatalyst that is abundant, stable, and highly efficient for the superior performance of overall water electrolysis. The doping, alloy, oxide, and nitride of transition metal materials have been reported as abundant materials that exceed the electrolysis efficiency of noble metals during OER. Among them, transition metal nitrides showed superior OER electrocatalytic performance due to their high electrical conductivity, which is derived from their metallic properties. To boost the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal based materials, numerous efforts have focused on modulating electronic structure related to catalytic activity in OER. The d -band center theory which proposed that the position of d -band center (E d ) has close relationship with the catalytic activity has unveiled insights into designing electrocatalysts for OER. However, most researchers have used ion exchange or doping method for modulating d -band center, which requires an additional process and leads to higher difficulty of designing electrocatalysts. Recently, Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) have been widely employed as a self-template material for the energy conversion and storage field such as water electrolysis and batteries. PBAs, which are a type of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) composed of CN groups, have emerged as a promising material due to the following characteristics: 1) numerous interstitial sites with unique 3-dimensional structure due to CN group; 2) advantages of synthesizing various compositions; and 3) chemical stability in solution. Due to these advantages, PBAs have a large specific surface area, fast diffusion kinetics, and structural stability when applied as a precursor to water electrocatalysts. Although PBAs-derived electrocatalysts have high electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic performance, they are prone to aggregate and lose their unique morphology after high temperature process. As a breakthrough of the limitation, polydomamine (PDA) coating has been attracting attention as an encapsulation method to achieve hybridization with carbon materials, as well as enhance electrocatalytic performance. PDA is simply synthesized by the polymerization of Dopamine (DA) in Tris-buffer solution, which is beneficial for mass production. In addition, PDA is advantageous for N-doped carbon formation, because it has high nitrogen content, which improves the charge transfer ability during electrocatalytic reaction. Also, because PDA has thermal stability, agglomeration between particles can be prevented when high-temperature heat treatment is performed. Due to these characteristics of PDA, PDA both prevents the aggregation of PBAs during carbonization at high temperature and improves stability in alkaline solution, while increasing reaction sites by forming a high content of N-doped carbon layer. Herein, we present a versatile but promising strategy to synthesize cobalt nitride nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon (Co/Co 4 N@NC) nanoboxes as highly efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts by modulating d -band center through the simple nitridation of self-template PBAs encapsulated by PDA. The synthesized Co/Co 4 N@NC nanoboxes have mesoporous and hollow structure, which provides a large specific surface area and fast charge transfer pathways. Especially, the d -band center of Co x N nanoparticles is strategically modulated to be more metallic and heterogeneous to favor electrocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the highly conductive N-doped carbon shell derived from PDA coating enables electrocatalysts to have not only numerous active reaction sites and fast charge transfer ability but also long-term durability in alkaline solution during OER. The Co/Co 4 N@NC nanoboxes showed a remarkable overpotential value of 262 mV and 408 mV at 10 mA∙cm -2 and 100 mA∙cm -2 , respectively, and a low tafel slope of 130 mV∙dec -1 , which is superior to RuO 2 (284 mA∙cm -2 and 470 mA∙cm -2 ). In addition, the Co/Co 4 N@NC nanoboxes maintained an overpotential value of 92.6 % after 24 h of stability test at 10 mA∙cm -2 , as well as showing outstanding durability for 100 h and at high current density of 100 mA∙cm -2 . The DFT calculation also identifies advantages of metallic cobalt nitride and heterogeneous structure derived from the modulated electronic structure of Co/Co 4 N@NC. Finally, the in-situ XANES during OER of Co/Co 4 N@NC is clear evidence that the modulated electronic structure of Co/Co 4 N@NC improves the OER catalytic activity due to reconstruction of Co 2+ into Co 3+ .

A global hydrogen economy (GHE) was envisioned by Haldane in 1923 but has only recently captured wide attention. As the movement toward a GHE accelerates, the supply vs. demand of precious metals such as platinum and iridium will inevitably force their prices skyward. In order to ensure the future of the GHE, it is crucial to intensify the R&D of earth-abundant element-based electrocatalysts. We have recently focused on electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER, HER) based on Fe, Co, Ni and Mo-containing oxides. 1-3 The use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations has enabled us to understand more deeply the origins of high catalytic activity. From OER experimental results, we have found that the activity is higher for Ni-Co oxides with lower structural order. 1 This was explained by calculations indicating that the edges of NiOOH sheets are the active sites, at which the rate-determining step M-O + MOH  M-OOH-M is facilitated by the favorable geometry, in which the initial ) O—O distance is significantly shorter than that in the ideal structure (Fig. 1A). The presence of Co ("b" structure) further lowers the activation energy, to 0.15 eV. With the addition of Mo to Ni x Co 1-x OOH, the rds M-O + M-O  M-O-O-M at the layer edges was found to become spontaneous, due to the electron-withdrawing effect of Mo. 2 However, it was found that Mo slowly leached out of the structure during actual long-term operation. Ni-Fe oxide was found to be much more stable, and the corresponding DFT calculations showed that the activation energy for the M-O + M-OH  M-OOH-M step was lowered to 0.042 eV. 3 In our work on the HER with Ni-Fe alloy/Ni-Fe oxide, we found experimentally that the activity was highest when the alloy was present in contact with a more crystalline form of the oxide. 3 The DFT calculations showed that it is necessary to consider both the water dissociation step on the surface of the Ni x Fe 1-x (OH) 2 sheets and the transfer of a proton to a metallic Ni-Fe alloy particle, on which two adsorbed hydrogens combine to produce H 2 (Fig. 1B). This mechanism, which is similar to the bifunctional mechanism proposed by Markovic and coworkers for Pt/NiO, 4 we have termed "reverse spillover." Thus, through the combination of experiment and theory, we are developing an understanding of how further increases in electrocatalytic activity for the OER and HER can be achieved with earth-abundant element-based materials.

Introduction: In proton exchange membrane water electrolysers (PEMWE) the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the rate determining step and currently catalysed by scarce and expensive iridium oxides. Because of the high iridium price and limited iridium availability, electrolysers using pure IrO 2 will struggle to fulfil the growing demand of affordable green hydrogen.[1] However, in the harsh environment inside a PEMWE anode, no non-noble metal catalyst with sufficient activity and stability is known.[2] A promising approach to reduce the iridium needed for the OER is to embed iridium into different titanium containing non-noble host oxides (e.g., Mg 2 TiO 4 ) as we show for spinels in this work. In this way, the iridium atoms are ultimately dispersed in the host matrix. In line, the iridium mass specific activity increases and the iridium sites are stabilized through the presence of titanium inside the oxide.[3] This leads to catalysts that maintain high activity and stability with significantly lower iridium content than pure IrO 2 , even at thermodynamically favoured elevated temperatures.[4] Materials and methods: Metal-oxides with different iridium molar fractions are synthesized via a modified sol-gel approach. The successful inclusion of iridium in the non-noble oxide crystal structure is proven by XRD and ICP measurements. After further analysis (e.g., SEM, conductivity, surface area (N 2 -physisorption and ECSA)), the OER-activity is determined by half-cell experiments on a rotating-disc-electrode (RDE). Additionally, the catalysts are aged for one to several days at elevated temperature (> 150 °C) in a wet atmosphere to get an idea of the catalyst’s structural behaviour for the subsequent application. First attempts to test the catalyst in a full PEMWE-cell are performed as well. AlfaAesar® IrO 2 (AA-IrO 2 ) is used as a reference catalyst. Results and discussion: The different investigated iridium containing spinels show an enhanced iridium mass specific activity compared to the commercially available iridium oxide. Our best performing material Mg 2 Ti 0.7 Ir 0.3 O 4 has around triple the iridium mass specific activity at 1.575 V vs. RHE than the IrO 2 reference (figure 1a and b). For the activity normalized to the electrocatalytic surface area the performance increase of our catalyst is even more pronounced, indicating highly active Ir-sites. The iridium to titanium ratio as well as the calcination conditions show a strong influence on the crystallite size, ECSA and consequently the electrocatalytic activity of the system. As can be seen in the XRDs in figure 1c and d, lower calcination hold times (t calc_hold , figure 1c) and temperatures (T calc , figure 1d) favour the insertion of iridium in the spinel leading to highly active catalysts. Once a second phase, assigned to rutile IrO 2 forms at slightly harsher calcination conditions the OER performance drops. This depicts the importance of the right synthesis parameters. The observed highly active Ir-sites can, in line with literature, be attributed to either the restructuring of the catalyst surface[5], an activation of previously inert titanium[1] or to the interactions of the IrO 6 -octahedra with neighbouring metals inside the crystal structure.[6] Conclusion: Our approach significantly enhances the iridium mass specific activity of the single Ir-sites. Embedding iridium into a non-noble titanium containing host matrix therefore is a promising approach to achieve high electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, the iridium demand for the acidic OER in PEMWE decreases. References: [1] X. Liang et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019 , 58 , 7631-7635. [2] C. C. L. McCrory et al., J. Am. Chem.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) play a pivotal role in the journey towards a sustainable hydrogen society [1]. Despite offering remarkable current density and exceptional hydrogen purity (99.99%), the highly acidic nature of sulfonated fluoropolymer membranes hinders material selection for anode catalysts to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [2]. Therefore, iridium-based electrocatalysts are regarded as indispensable choices owing to their strong resistance to corrosion under acidic environments based on Pourbaix diagram [3]. However, despite their remarkable stability and performance in acid, two main unsolved issues remained in iridium-based electrocatalysts. The first is the scarcity of iridium, which hampers the widespread adoption of PEMWEs. Iridium accounts for 25 % of the total cost of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA), making the reduction of iridium content an urgent necessity. The other unsolved issue is the suppression lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER) [4]. While LOER offers an opportunity to overcome the theoretical OER overpotential, such lattice oxygen participation also induces oxygen gas evolution from [IrO 6 ] crystals and consequently lattice collapse. Hence, there is a pressing need for alternative catalysts with lower iridium content but limited LOER to achieve comparable activity and stability to commercial IrO 2 . In this study, using hexagonal 9R-perovskite BaIrO 3 as starting materials, we systematically demonstrate the d orbital contribution to structural durability according to lattice oxygen participation, especially d 0 states of Nb 5+ and Ta 5+ . The choice of BaIrO 3 as a reference catalyst was governed by its structural robustness from face-sharing connectivity between [IrO 6 ] clusters, which is more difficult to disassemble compared to IrO 2 with edge-, and corner-sharing configurations [5]. Two notable features were observed when transition-metals (Mn, Co, Ni, In, Nb, and Ta) were doped into BaIrO 3 ; i) phase transformation occurs from 9R- to 6H- or 12R-type polymorphs and 2) dopants occupy specific sites in a very ordered manner ( Figure 1a ). We directly observed such ordering natures by atomic-column resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). When Nb 5+ and Ta 5+ added, 12R-Ba 4 NbIr 3 O 12 and Ba 4 TaIr 3 O 12 were formed with Nb and Ta cations located in bridging sites between face-sharing [Ir 3 O 12 ] trimers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to study the electronic structure of Ba 4 NbIr 3 O 12 ( Figure 1b ). The electron configuration of Nb 5+ consists of fully filled 4 p 6 and empty 4 d 0 states, thereby Nb 4 d orbitals contribute to the upper electronic band above +2 eV. Consequently, in contrast to the large overlap between O 2p states (black arrow) with Ir 5d states in [IrO 6 ], O 2p states (red arrow) of [NbO 6 ] beneath the Fermi level are significantly suppressed. These findings indicate that [NbO 6 ] serves as an OER inactive site and prevents structural disassembly by limiting lattice oxygen participation. We also carried out time-of-flight SIMS to quantitatively compare lattice oxygen contribution between pristine BaIrO 3 and Ba 4 NbIr 3 O 12 during OER using anodic cycling samples in 1 M HClO 18 4 . As depicted in Figure 1b, substantially lower amount of O 18 was detected in Ba 4 NbIr 3 O 12 than in BaIrO 3 , which directly demonstrated the significant suppression of LOER. The catalytic longevity of IrO 2 , BaIrO 3 , and Ba 4 NbIr 3 O 12 was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) tests (see Figure 1c ). The relative catalytic behavior was compared in terms of preserving OER activities by normalizing with initial current densities. Both CV and CA results provide straightforward evidence, validating that Ba 4 NbIr 3 O 12 is prominent among the three catalysts. As a result, we have developed promising electrocatalysts with both low iridium content and higher durability, which stem from the synergism of chemical ordering of d 0 cations to suppress lattice oxygen participation and robust face-sharing trimers in the structures. Our research proposes the proper management of chemical ordering in oxides offers a straightforward yet effective approach for developing electrocatalysts with significantly enhanced longevity.

The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important anode reaction for water electrolysis to generate green hydrogen using renewable energy sources. Numerous studies have been conducted on developing OER catalysts composed of transition metal oxides. Among them, perovskite oxides (PVs) are a group of metal oxides composed of alkali-earth metal ions and transition metal ions. It is reported that the OER activity of PVs can be improved by choosing the appropriate metal cations and tuning their composition. Recently, in addition to controlling the composition of metal cations, doping hetero-anions such as fluoride ions (F − ) into the PV structure or substituting oxide ions (O 2− ) with F − in PVs have been employed to enhance their OER activity. Certain amounts of F − substitution (F-substitution) are expected to be a promising approach to tune the valence states of metal cations in PVs due to the difference in valence of F − and O 2− . Since the valence state of the metal active center is an important factor determining the OER activity of PVs, F-substitution in PVs have been attempted in previous researches. However, since the synthesis of F-containing PVs was often conducted under high-temperature heat treatment conditions, the content of fluoride ions and enhancement of OER activity were limited. Based on these backgrounds, here we synthesized barium (Ba), iron (Fe), and cobalt (Co) containing PVs in the form of BaFe 1–x Co x O 3–d (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2) and attempted to enhance their OER activity through broad-range fluorine substitution via low-temperature fluorination. BaFe 1–x Co x O 3–d (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2) was synthesized by a sol-gel method using metal nitrates as precursors referring to a previous report.[1] F-substitution was performed by heat-treating a mixture of the as-synthesized BaFe 1–x Co x O 3–d with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) by modifying previous reports.[2,3] The OER activity was evaluated using rotating disk electrodes in O 2 -saturated 1M KOH. This abstract reports the results for BaFe 0.8 Co 0.2 O 3-d (x = 0.2, BFCO-20), BaFe 0. 9 Co 0. 1 O 3-d (x = 0.1, BFCO-10) and their F-substituted samples. The F/Ba ratios of F-substituted samples in this abstract are 1 and 0.8 for BFCO-20 (F-BFCO-20) and BFCO-10 (F-BFCO-10), respectively. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed that single-phase PVs were successfully synthesized. No formation of any impurity due to the F-substitution process was observed. The peaks of BFCO-20 and BFCO-10 were slightly shifted to the lower angle region by the F-substitution process. The Co K-edge and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra shifted to the lower energy region by F-substitution as shown in Fig. 1a, indicating that the valence was reduced by F-substitution. The cyclic voltammograms for pristine BFCO-20, BFCO-10, and F-substituted samples revealed that F-substitution enhanced the OER activity (Fig. 1b). The F-substitution increased the OER current at 1.65 V vs. RHE about 3.9 times and 2.6 times for BFCO-20 and BFCO-10 (Fig. 1b), respectively.[4] In the presentation, we will also discuss details of the structural analysis and the electrochemical analysis of the synthesized samples.

On Sep. 25, 2023, Hydrogen energy ministerial meeting (H 2 EM 2023) was held by the ministry of economy, trade and industry (METI) of Japanese government as online special event with cabinet members and officials from 23 countries, regions, and organizations. Participants shared the additional global goals to increase hydrogen demand which could potentially reach 150 million ton by 2030, with up to 90 million ton being demand for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen. In the chair’s summary of meeting, 0.7 Mt of H 2 production with 700 MW of electrolyser installed as of 2022 [1-2]. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) has already commercialized and recently applied its system for the Power-to-Gas (PtG) all over the world. In Kofu City in Yamanashi, Japan, the Komekurayama facilities has demonstrated the Power-to-Gas (P2G) system such as system of the intermittent generated electricity from the solar 10 MW generator and transform it to hydrogen using a PEMWE electrolyser of 1.5 MW capacity [3]. However, the cost of Ir metal as uses for material of anode has been raising in these two years, and it is almost 4 times higher than that of platinium in Japan [4-5]. From this point of view, the alternative anode with high durability should be required for the production of Green Hydrogen [6]. The catalytic activity of magnesium oxide has applied and studied in acidic solution [7-8] and we have also Mn oxide-based film fabricated by sputtering procedure for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [9-10]. In this study, we have investigated the OER activity of Mn Oxide-based electrocatalysts as particle fabricated by thermal decomposition. MoO 2 was prepared on Ti rods as a substrate. The 4 M Mn(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O aqueous solution was used as precursor. It dropped on substrate, and the thermal decomposition was demonstrated at 220 o C for 1 h. The loading amounts of MoO 2 was constant at 1.1 mg cm -2 . thickness of ZrO 2 film was 10 nm for preparation. We used conventional three electrode cell with each sample as working electrode while the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and carbon plate were used as reference and counter electrode to demonstrate the electrochemical measurement in 1 M H 2 SO 4 solution with saturated nitrogen atmosphere at 303 K. Several samples were demonstrated pretreatment from 0.05 to 1.2 V vs. RHE before the measurement of OER. The slow scan voltammetry was performed from 1.2 to 2.0 V to evaluate the OER activity. Figure 1 shows polarization curves of OER on MoO 2 on Ti substrate (MnO 2 (TD)/Ti). For the comparison, Mn-TaO x on Ti fabricated by sputtering procedure (Mn-TaO x (Sputter)/Ti) in our previous study [10] also shows in Fig. 1. The vertical axis was shown by the geometric current density ( i geo ). The i geo at 2.0 V of MnO 2 (TD)/Ti was ca. 200 mA cm -2 and it was so much larger than that of Mn-TaO x (Sputter)/Ti because the shape of MnO 2 (TD)/Ti as particle was different from that Mn-TaO x (Sputter)/Ti as thin film. The i geo of MnO 2 (TD)/Ti was also similar to that of MnO 2 (TD)/FTO [8]. Tafel plots of OER on MnO 2 (TD)/Ti was 115 mV dec -1 while that of Mn-TaO x (Sputter)/Ti was 62 mV dec -1 .

The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) create a bottleneck for many sustainable energy technologies, including water electrolysis, metal-air batteries, and electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). While platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts like IrO 2 and RuO 2 exhibit high OER activity in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), their cost hinders widespread adoption. Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) emerges as a promising technology with the potential to be both cost-effective and sustainable for hydrogen production. It relies on PGM-free OER catalysts, bridging the gap and merging the strengths of PEM and traditional alkaline electrolysis systems. Transition metal (TM) oxides, layered double hydroxides, and oxyphosphides, particularly in alkaline media, have emerged as promising OER catalysts due to their high activity and durability. However, the vast chemical space of oxyphosphide compositions makes traditional trial-and-error approaches to catalyst discovery inefficient. This presentation explores the application of machine learning (ML) to accelerate the discovery of novel PGM-free oxyphosphide OER catalysts for alkaline water electrolysis. Recent advancements in active learning, a powerful branch of machine learning, have demonstrated efficient and effective explorations of materials synthesis space, particularly for electrocatalytic applications. For instance, active learning has been used to optimize synthesis conditions for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, leading to a 33% improvement in activity compared to initial samples [1-4]. This presentation proposes a similar active learning strategy to explore and optimize the synthesis space for PGM-free oxyphosphide OER catalysts. This presentation will detail the following: Challenges of Traditional Approaches Active Learning for OER Catalyst Design Machine Learning and High-Throughput Synthesis This combined approach offers a powerful strategy for the rapid discovery of efficient and cost-effective PGM-free oxyphosphide OER catalysts, ultimately accelerating advancements in sustainable water electrolysis technologies.

Water electrolysis (WE) using hydrogen evolution reaction is widely recognized as a promising method for clean and sustainable hydrogen production. The currently dominant alkaline-based water electrolysis encounters several challenges including high ohmic resistance, limited current density, low efficiency, and poor long-term stability. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis can tackle these challenges by providing efficient proton transfer. However, sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid has been a major long-existing obstacle in PEM systems and, therefore, has attracted great research interest. Due to its high activity and durability, IrO 2 is currently considered the only practical OER electrocatalyst in PEM devices. However, Ir’s high cost and low global reserve limit its large-scale applications. Hence, less-expensive catalysts for acidic OER are in great demand. RuO 2 has been recognized as an attractive alternative to IrO 2 because Ru is ~100x abundant and costs ~10x less. Although RuO 2 presents higher activity than IrO 2 , it deteriorates severely in a few hours due to its dissolution under oxidizing conditions. Its long-term stability remains a big challenge. To overcome the challenge of improving the stability of Ru-based oxides, in this work we provide a rigid theoretical framework of RuO 2 dissolution under the influence of other metal species. We show that the stability of Ru-based oxides could be controlled by varying the properties of incorporated metal oxides as well as the synergy to form a complex oxide. Surveying the Materials Project database led to the rationalization of a series of metal elements that could positively improve the stability of RuO 2 . Guided by our theoretical approach, we conducted high-throughput screening and experimental evaluation of Ru-based oxides for acid OER. Our study discovered a novel Ru-based oxide with superior performance in acid OER application. A new wet-impregnation method was developed to synthesize the desired phase. The as-obtained product were uniform nanoparticles with diameters less than 5 nm in a single rutile structure. The new catalyst showed significantly better performance than pristine RuO 2 . In the rotating-disk-electrode experiment, our catalyst delivered a current density of 10 mA·cm -2 at an overpotential of less than 170 mV in 0.1 M HClO 4 . The catalyst exhibited a low degradation rate smaller than 25 μVh -1 for over 200 hours of operation at 10 mA·cm -2 . Our results show great promise of Ru-based oxides as Ir-free electrocatalysts for acidic OER in PEM water electrolysis.

Iridium oxides (IrO x ) are by far the only electrocatalysts that can be used in the anodes of commercial proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) due to their sufficient activity and stability toward acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nanoscale Ir powders (Ir black) are often used in PEMWEs since they convert to IrO x at high potential during PEMWE operation. The types of the IrO x formed and its morphology dictate the activity and durability of the anodes. It is thus imperative to understand the electrochemical conversion processes between Ir black and IrO x that may help advancing the anodes of PEMWEs. Here we reported a study on the conversion processes from Ir black to IrO x in acidic media by conducting cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) analysis, in combination with complementary characterization techniques. We found that Ir black converted to hydrous iridium oxides (IrO x ·nH 2 O) in dilute acid solution when the lower potential limit is below 0.2 V (all potentials are versus reversible hydrogen electrode) as well as the higher potential limit is beyond 1.2 V. 1,2 Rationalization of the observation led us to propose oxidation of Ir forming anhydrous IrO x at <1.2 V via the place-exchange mechanism, followed by hydration of the anhydrous IrO x at >1.2 V. The hydration process is water molecules filling the oxygen vacancies of IrO x forming coordinated water: IrO x + nH 2 O → IrO x ·nH 2 O. The hydration of IrO x moved toward the core of Ir nanoparticles layer-by-layer only if the IrO x layers get reduced at <0.2 V in association with cleavage of Ir-O-Ir bonds (or removal of lattice oxygen), leaving new oxygen vacancies on the inner side of the IrO x layers to be filled by water molecules on the next cycling. While multiple layers of IrO x ·nH 2 O can be formed via this process, only the outer layers contribute to OER activities with an ultrahigh inherent OER activity. Holding at high voltage led to degradation of IrO x ·nH 2 O, as well as dehydration followed by crystallization. We accordingly proposed that OER is a water consuming process with the rate determining step not being water adsorption (hydration), which leads to dehydration of IrO x ·nH 2 O: 2IrO x ·nH 2 O + 2H 2 O → 2IrO x + (2+n)O 2 + (4+2n)H + + (4+2n)e - . The competing dehydration (OER) and hydration processes causes the degradation and recovery of IrO x ·nH 2 O. On the other hand, Ir black converted mainly to anhydrous IrO x in concentrated acid solution 1 and in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), in association with a different degradation mode from that in dilute acid. These complex conversions among metallic Ir, anhydrous/amorphous IrO x , IrO x ·nH 2 O, and crystalline IrO 2 are made more complicated with the presence of H 2 gas (Figure 1). The implications of occurrences of these conversions on the activity and degradation of Ir-based anodes of PEMWEs will be discussed. References (1) Rand, D. A. J.; Woods, R.

Clean hydrogen from renewable energy sources via proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has great potential to decarbonize various sectors and integrate intermittent renewables into the energy mix (1). However, its large-scale deployment faces significant hurdles, mainly due to the high cost of materials like platinum and iridium used as electrocatalysts (2). Improving the characterization of catalyst layers in PEMWE helps to address this, as a better understanding of the efficiency and durability of the catalyst layers drives research advancements and facilitates cost-reduction efforts. Current characterization tools have limitations in providing realistic insights into catalyst performance in PEMWE. This contribution explores using reference electrodes (REs) to address this gap. REs offer the advantage of measuring the proton potential within the system, which helps to optimize performance and understand degradation mechanisms. However, integrating REs into PEM cells presents challenges, such as the impact of the RE device on the cell or its accuracy (3–5). This study presents the integration of two reference electrode (RE) setups, a salt bridge RE (SBRE) and a dynamic hydrogen RE (DHE), into a standardized PEMWE test cell. The focus is on overcoming design optimization challenges and mitigating performance impacts. Among these challenges is the influence of ionomer treatment of the porous transport layer (PTL), an integral part of the SBRE design, which affects cell performance. The impregnation of the PTL can result in increased ohmic, mass transport and other losses (5). The Figure below shows the full cell polarization curve for both pristine PTLs and PTLs subject to various degrees of impregnation. A clear pattern can be observed where lower impregnation volumes result in cell performance closer to that of the unimpregnated counterpart. An optimal impregnation volume of 1 µL of a 5 wt% electrolyte solution is identified. This adjustment minimizes the impact on cell performance while ensuring the necessary ionic connectivity is maintained. Additionally, another challenge lies in electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS) for half-cells. This is addressed by integrating improved EIS settings that strategically avoid high frequencies prone to inductance, enabling accurate HFR measurements in half-cells for subsequent kinetic analyses. In addition to these challenges, further obstacles, such as potential gradient across the salt bridge and RE precision, are also addressed. These challenges are thoroughly analyzed both theoretically and experimentally, and corresponding solutions are presented. Building on the thorough analysis of the RE setups and the implemented solutions and enhancements, experimental investigation and kinetic analysis are carried out. An overview of the findings is given, which includes OER and HER kinetic parameters, investigates temperature effects on kinetics, and elucidates aspects of degradation. In addition, the application of the Arrhenius equation to analyze the temperature dependence of the exchange current density provides insight into the activation energies for half-cell reactions.

Development of energy efficient electrocatalysts of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important challenges for the development of green hydrogen production by water electrolysis. In general, the use of binders for electrode fabrication may result in limited contact areas between catalyst and electrolyte decreasing electroactive sites, thus reducing electrocatalytic activities. To overcome these challenges, spinel-type ternary transition metal oxides, focusing on Fe substituted NiCo 2 O 4 , were fabricated using the electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) method without any binder. The various characterizations techniques such as XRD, XPS, and SEM were employed to explore morphological and structural features. The electrochemical OER properties were investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 M KOH. The optimized sample exhibited excellent operational stability under continuous and dynamic operating conditions without any significant performance decay. This study reveals that binder free electrocatalyst is a good candidate for inexpensive and durable electrocatalyst for commercial application.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) present a lower cost option for hydrogen generation with respect to their proton exchange membrane counterpart due to the possibility of utilizing platinum group metal-free catalysts to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. The addition of iron (Fe) to nickel-(oxy)hydroxides has been shown to significantly enhance the OER catalytic activity, although the precise mechanisms are still under debate. A clearer picture of the structure of these catalysts, particularly during operation, is needed in order to further improve their performance and durability. In this work, a range of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques are used to study NiFe-based OER catalysts synthesized via different approaches [1]. High resolution electron microscopy will be presented showing how the as-synthesized structure of these materials transforms dramatically following break-in and initial performance evaluation [2]. The results of complementary in situ Mössbauer and X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments which track the changing oxidation states of Fe and Ni under applied potential in aqueous media will also be presented. The structural changes related to catalyst degradation following extended operation in membrane electrode assemblies will also be discussed. References [1] W.

Research on future energy is underway due to the problems caused by global warming and fossil fuel depletion. Of particular interest among these is hydrogen energy, which is garnering significant attention due to its high energy density per unit mass and its abundance in space. Additionally, it has the advantage of being eco-friendly since it can be produced by electrolyzing water and does not produce carbon dioxide as a by-product when used. The methods for electrolyzing water include alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE). In alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), achieving high current density is challenging due to significant ohmic losses arising from the considerable distance between the anode and cathode. For proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the electrodes are closely situated within the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) structure, allowing for high current density. However, it suffers from the drawback of requiring precious metals due to the harsh corrosion conditions. AEMWE combines the advantages of PEMWE's compact structure and AWE's utilization of transition metals as catalysts. However, further research is needed on AEMWE as it has not yet reached the performance level of PEMWE, which uses noble metal catalysts known for their high reactivity in electrolysis. In water electrolysis, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs at the cathode, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place at the anode. In the HER, two electrons are involved in the reaction, whereas in the OER, four electrons are involved, resulting in a slower reaction rate for OER. Therefore, since the overall reaction rate of water electrolysis is determined by OER, research on the OER catalyst is essential. Among transition metals, Ni is known to be a good catalyst for OER, and research is underway on Ni-based catalysts enhanced in activity and durability through synergy effects with other transition metals such as Fe, Co, and Mo. However, as the performance still falls short compared to precious metals, incorporating a small amount of precious metals alongside can enhance the catalyst's performance. Precious metals such as Ir and Ru are known for their good activity in the OER. Nonetheless, Ir is considerably more expensive than Ru, and since Ru exhibits slightly superior activity, we intend to use Ru. There are several methods for synthesizing catalysts, including chemical precipitation, chemical vapor deposition, hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel method, and electrodeposition. Among them, electrodeposition allows for the variation of catalyst composition, morphology, thickness by changing the composition of the solution, applied voltage, and time. Moreover, it occurs at room temperature and pressure and offers rapid fabrication times, making it advantageous for scaling up from lab scale to industrial scale in the future. Galvanic replacement is a spontaneous substitution reaction that occurs due to the standard reduction potential difference between two metals. The metal with a relatively higher (more negative) standard reduction potential undergoes oxidation to form ions, while the metal with a lower standard reduction potential is reduced from ions to metal. Through this reaction, a small amount of precious metals can be doped onto the surface in nanoparticle form. Since this reaction occurs spontaneously, no additional devices are required, and it can occur at room temperature and pressure, similar to electrodeposition, making it suitable for scaling up to industrial scale. Here in, we synthesized NiFe catalysts on SUS paper via the electrodeposition method. Moreover, we incorporated a small amount of Ru through galvanic replacement. We evaluated the performance of the catalysts under 1 M KOH conditions. In the half-cell test, NiFe/SUS exhibited an overpotential of 256 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 , which was reduced to 229 mV with Ru doping. In the single-cell test, Ru-NiFe/SUS showed excellent performance, achieving 8.3 A at 80°C and 2 V.

Anion Exchange membrane water electrolyzers are reached the stage of commercialization by the advancement of durable anion exchange membranes. Highly active and stable electrocatalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are essential to achieve energy efficient and cost-effective hydrogen production. Among the two electrochemical reactions, OER is more sluggish as it involves four electron transfers for the generation of an oxygen molecule. [ 1 ] Many non-noble metal oxides-based catalysts are displayed OER activity in alkaline medium, but among them Ni, Fe, and Co based mono/bi/tri metallic oxides/hydroxide/oxyhydroxides exhibit high OER activity. [ 2–4 ] Even though the actual catalytic mechanism is still debated, Ni-Fe oxides have received much attention over all other catalysts because of the synergism between the oxides and oxyhydroxides of Fe and Ni to bring down the OER overpotential. Several methods were adopted for the synthesis of Ni-Fe oxides. However, most of them lead to the formation of mixed oxides and it affects the overall conductivity of the catalyst. The controlled electrochemical method of preparation possesses, the selective synthesis of conducting Ni-Fe oxides. In this work, we adapted a two-step electrochemical synthesis method to produce free-standing Ni-Fe oxide electrode with high OER activity. At first, a layer of γ–NiOOH was constructed over a cleaned nickel foam by applying a high voltage in 1M KOH. Raman spectra of oxidized Ni foam, represented in Figure 1A show two major peaks at 481 cm –1 and 560 cm –1 corresponding to the bending and stretching vibration of γ–NiOOH. Further, the broad peak band between 850 cm –1 and 1200 cm –1 is ascribed to the active oxygen species (NiOO – ) in oxyhydroxide. [5,6] In the second step, a thin Fe layer was electrochemically deposited over the γ–NiOOH. The Raman spectra after Fe deposition also confirmed the existence of γ–NiOOH along with the peak corresponding to FeOOH at around 684 cm –1 . [7] Cross-sectional SEM images with EDX of Fe deposited γ–NiOOH (γ–NiOOH-Fe) presented in Figure 1B show an oxide layer of ≈250 nm thickness with a uniform distribution of Fe. For a comparison, Fe deposited directly on a cleaned Ni foam (Ni-Fe) was also prepared thorough electrochemical deposition. The OER activity and stability of both catalysts were tested in 1 M KOH. γ–NiOOH-Fe catalyst attained 10 mA cm –2 at 1.47 V whereas to reach the same current density Ni-Fe took 1.49 V. No degradation in catalytic activity was observed in the case of γ–NiOOH-Fe compared to Ni-Fe catalyst after the accelerated durability test and constant current electrolysis at 10 and 50 mA cm –2 in 1 M KOH (Figure 1C and D). The above results demonstrate that the γ–NiOOH-Fe catalyst exhibits excellent activity and stability as an anode catalyst for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer.

Developing highly conductive and durable support materials for Ir-based electrocatalysts in acidic oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is one of the challenges to overcoming corrosion conduction during the anodic process. In this study, we develop an oxide-type support material(Bi 3 TaO 7 ) for IrO x electrocatalyst in acidic OER to minimize the amount of iridium loading level. Through a combination of various physical and chemical analyses(XRD, TEM, XRF, EIS, XPS, XAS, etc.), it is demonstrated that the IrO x /Bi 3 TaO 7 electrocatalyst showed remarkable OER performances and enhanced mass activity compared to unsupported IrO x electrocatalysts. Bi on the surface of Bi 3 TaO 7 suppresses the change in oxidation state of Ir element, maintains activity of IrO x electrocatalyst during electrochemical reaction and induces chemical and physical stability of the IrO x /Bi 3 TaO 7 electrocatalyst. These findings can provide further insight into a new category of anode support materials for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers.

The sluggish nature of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is responsible for a large efficiency penalty in alkaline electrolysis (AEL), with intensive research targeting more active and stable catalysts. Catalyst testing is typically carried out in RDE setups under mild conditions. Such tests are useful for evaluating the catalytic activity, but the results are seldom inter-comparable due to differences in electrode fabrication, microstructure, catalyst surface area, and test conditions. Furthermore, the material activity and stability at mild conditions does not represent the one at industrial conditions. Thus, testing the materials at industrial application conditions is crucial, i.e. at higher temperatures, e.g. 60-100°C, at concentrated KOH, e.g. 6-10M, and for longer times. Perovskites are an exciting group of materials as OER catalysts due to their reported high catalytic activities [1], and their tunable properties, allowing ample room for optimization and use of abundant elements. Even though many studies report the stability of perovskites under mild conditions and for durations of up to 2000h [2], the stability at industrial conditions is still in question. In this study, we tested the catalytic activity of La-based perovskites and others at industrial conditions. For better comparability, the tests are carried out on dense and polished pelettes with a well-defined surface area. Post-mortem analysis shows that the most researched materials are unstable at industrial conditions. However, one candidate showed excellent stability far beyond the commercial operation window, with only minor signs of degradation after 200h at 150°C, while possessing excellent intrinsic activity, with an overpotential of 240mV at 10mA/cm 2 ECSA . Furthermore, perovskites are an excellent host for exsolution, which is the partial decomposition of the host material to form well-dispersed and anchored nanoparticles on the surface of the host. We have used the exsolution process to enhance the catalytic activity even further, and short-term stability tests confirm the presence of the exsolved particles after several hours of operation at industrial conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this study shows the first report of exsolved catalysts under industrial operating conditions. [1] Liu, L. B., Yi, C., Mi, H. C., Zhang, S. L., Fu, X. Z., Luo, J.

Low-carbon hydrogen is forecast to play an essential role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions in the future. To establish the wide-scale adoption of low-carbon hydrogen via water electrolysis, reducing the levelized cost of hydrogen through high-performing electrocatalysts is necessary [1]. Alkaline-based water electrolysis has seen a recent resurgence in research and development, due to the growing concern over the reliance on platinum group metals as electrocatalysts in acidic conditions [2]. However, in alkaline water electrolysis, the kinetics of both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction are considered sluggish as opposed to acidic conditions which favour hydrogen formation [3]. This severely limits the electrical efficiency of alkaline water electrolysis and leads to an increased cost of hydrogen. Herein lies a need to develop low-cost, highly active, non-platinum group metal electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis at an industrially relevant scale. Plasma thermal spraying has recently gained attention as a large-scale electrode manufacturing technique. In this process, a catalyst powder is fed into the plasma plume of the plasma torch. Within the high temperature, high velocity plume the powder particles are melted and accelerated towards the substrate, where they collide to form a catalyst coating layer upon impact [4]. This low catalyst loading leads to a reduced capital cost. With versatile feed material and operating conditions, this method offers high tunability and is suitable for fabricating large surface area electrodes [5]. Additionally, this method allows for the rapid screening of materials and surfaces due to its short synthesis time. In this study, the feasibility of plasma-sprayed nickel-based electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis was investigated. A range of nickel-based metals, alloys, and oxides were synthesized via plasma thermal spraying and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction, and x-ray fluorescence. SEM imaging revealed the molten nature of the deposited “splats”, which resulted in rough surfaces with high active surface areas (Figure 1). Electrochemical characterization was carried out using two and three-electrode testing. Activity toward both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction was studied using three-electrode testing. It was found that with the addition of a plasma-sprayed nickel layer, the overpotential towards the hydrogen and oxygen evolution where reduce by 233 and 21 mV at -0.3 and 0.3 A cm -2 , respectively, compared to a benchmark stainless steel electrode. During two-electrode testing, the stability and cell performance of 25 cm -2 electrodes were investigated. The plasma-sprayed electrodes were stable at high operating current densities with minimal voltage decay. These preliminary results suggest plasma-sprayed nickel-based electrodes are viable electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis. With these promising initial results, further surface modifications to increase electrochemical activity and electrical efficiency will be investigated.

The electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is a critically important reaction towards realizing a sustainable energy economy through the utilization of hydrogen as an environmentally friendly fuel. However, the relatively low conductivity of conventional IrO x catalysts hinders their performance and necessitates use of high Ir loadings. [1, 2] To counteract this insufficiency, utilizing highly conductive catalyst layer supports has become an effective strategy for maintaining optimal conductivity. [3-7] While they have allowed for improved stability, TiO 2 -based fibers typically possess poor conductivity. Thus, the inclusion of an additional components (Pt, Nb, Au, etc.) has been shown to improve the catalyst layer conductivity, thereby enhancing the OER activity for this class of catalyst. [8, 9] Herein, we utilize electrospinning as a method for producing conductive Pt-based nanowires with customizable porosity and diameter on the scale of tens of nanometers to be utilized as a support for active Ir-based catalysts. By controlling the electrospinning solution and operating parameters, the characteristics of as-spun Pt-CNFs may be controlled before high-temperature treatment to obtain Pt-NWs with regulated diameter. [10] Following the fabrication of Pt-NWs, we analyze the electrochemical performance and properties of the resulting Ir@Pt-NWs electrocatalyst.

Present global energy issues have prompted demand for the actualization of carbon neutral by the establishment of hydrogen society. Green hydrogen production through anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis using renewable energy-derived electricity is a promising process because inexpensive nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts can be used in alkaline media. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side in the water electrolysis is sluggish; thus, the development of highly active electrocatalysts bearing nonprecious metals for OER is considerably desirable. Recently, we have intensively researched the OER activity of iron-based oxides and developed outstanding iron-based multimetal oxides using our proposed descriptors in terms of atomic configurations. [1–3] Furthermore, we have expanded our research on OER electrocatalysts to iron-based phosphates and reported that electrodes made by iron-based phosphates overcame those of the most active iron-based multimetal oxides and IrO 2 . [4] To further enhance the OER efficiency, we focused on nickel-based compounds. Nickel intrinsically catalyzes OER efficiently compared to other nonprecious transition metals. [5] In this study, we investigate the OER activity trend in Ni-based compounds and clarify the main factor to determine their OER activity. Remarkably, the OER activity exhibited a clear correlation with metal−oxygen bond length in their crystals, i.e. , shorter metal−oxygen bond lengths are more beneficial for the OER, which shows a good agreement to the findings in the case of iron-based oxides, as displayed in Figure 1a. [1,2] Additionally, the plots for nickel-based compounds in Figure 1a are located at higher OER activities than those for the iron-based oxides. This trend demonstrated an improvement of OER efficiency on nickel compared to iron. Furthermore, to get insights into electronic effects on the activity, we analyzed electronic states of the nickel-based oxides by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT calculations revealed that the OER activities were linearly correlated with the level of their occupied Ni 3 d orbitals, as shown in Figure 1b; i.e. , the upshifted Ni 3 d orbital strengthened interaction with nickel active site and Oxygen intermediates and boosted their OER activities. Thus, the electronic states of nickel-based compounds were reflected in metal−oxygen bond length and intrinsically determined the OER activity. This study provided a useful design guideline to improve nickel-based OER electrocatalysts and contributed to the innovation of green hydrogen production.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial half-reaction in numerous electrochemical processes including water electrolysis, CO 2 reduction, and rechargeable metal-air batteries. While precious metal-based catalysts such as IrO 2 and RuO 2 demonstrate effectiveness in OER, their high cost and instability hinder widespread adoption. Consequently, there is an urgent demand to develop low-cost transition metal-based electrocatalysts, satisfying both low overpotentials as well as robust stability. Given this perspective, research has concentrated on employing multi-metal systems as a catalyst design strategy to engineer effective transition metal-based catalysts for the OER. This approach facilitates the fine-tuning of catalytic properties by harnessing the synergistic interactions inherent within the constituent elements. Achieving this goal necessitates a profound comprehension of electronic structural modulations based on composition, coupled with rigorous analysis of the intricate redox mechanisms underlying the catalytic activity of these materials. In the course of our investigation, we synthesized high-entropy oxide in a spinel phase with a nano-sheet morphology. In addition to the flexible structure of spinel oxide accommodating various coordination environments and oxidation states, the unique physicochemical properties of high-entropy materials arising from their multi-elemental configuration make it possible to tailor the catalytic properties. We utilized OER-active metals Fe, Co, and Ni, complemented by the strategic introduction of non-3d elements Cr and Mo in their high-valence states, to significantly enhance the intrinsic activity of the catalysts by adjusting the oxide electronic structure. The resulting high-entropy spinel oxide (CrFeCoNiMo) 3 O 4 displayed promising OER activity and stability outperforming the IrO 2 benchmark, demonstrating its feasibility for practical applications. In particular, the sequential incorporation of Cr and Mo in (FeCoNi) 3 O 4 led to performance enhancements, showcasing the tunable nature of high-entropy oxides. The prepared catalysts were further extended to a lab-scale anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) to test the reliability, achieving lower overpotential than required by the IrO2 benchmark. For elucidation of catalytic activity enhancement, careful X-ray analysis was conducted. The presence of highly electronegative species such as Cr 6+ and Mo 6+ is expected to modulate the electronic structure of the other metal sites by inducing partial electron transfer through the bridging oxygen. Upon the inclusion of high-valence elements, a decrease in the electron density of the existing elements is observed, indicating the electron-withdrawing effect of high-valence elements. This decrease in electron density correlates with an increase in the oxidation state of transition metals, which in turn has been associated with enhanced oxygen activity. Consequently, the metal-oxygen bond weakened increasing the electron density at the O site, potentially enabling the detachment of oxygen from the catalysts. In conclusion, our study unveils the potential of integrating high-valence elements into high-entropy spinel oxide as a novel catalyst design approach. This optimizes the electronic structure of the catalyst and fine-tunes the metal-oxygen bond properties, thereby activating the water oxidation reaction pathway towards oxygen redox chemistry. By shedding light on this methodology, our study contributes valuable insights to the design strategy of effective electrocatalysts, emphasizing the significance of considering interactions among the constituent elements. Moreover, our research presents a diverse array of analytical approaches for elucidating elemental interactions, enriching our understanding of catalyst behavior. Additionally, experimental tests confirm the feasibility of applying these catalysts in practical electrochemical devices. Overall, our findings underscore the versability of high-entropy spinel oxides as catalysts for advancing electrochemical applications.

Introduction Renewable energy is indispensable for realizing the sustainable society, and the use of hydrogen energy as an energy carrier is recently gathering attention. It is therefore strongly needed to develop energy conversion devices with the production of hydrogen, and anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis is extensively studied due to its cost effectiveness and relative safety [1] . In these systems, however, sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require large overpotential, which motivates us to explore efficient OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media. Objective Among OER catalysts, LiCoO 2 is known as a highly active catalyst in alkaline media. In addition, it has been reported that the catalytic activity of LiCoO 2 powder can be improved by delithiation [2] . In order to discuss the electrochemical properties of the delithiated LiCoO 2 more in detail, the use of thin-film electrodes is effective because it contains no binder or conductive addictive. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method is a favorable method to fabricate thin film electrodes because dense and pinhole-free films can be grown by this method. In this study, we prepared LiCoO 2 thin-film electrodes by the PLD method, followed by the electrochemical delithiation of them. Then, their OER activities were evaluated to compare their electrocatalytic behaviors. Experimental LiCoO 2 thin films were prepared by PLD. LiCoO 2 was deposited on Pt substrate. After preparing the LiCoO 2 thin film, it was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. Electrochemical delithiation of LiCoO 2 thin films was conducted by using a three-electrode cell. LiCoO 2 thin film grown on Pt substrate was used as a working electrode, and Li metal was used as counter and reference electrodes. A solution of 1 mol dm - 3 LiPF 6 in propylene carbonate was used as the electrolyte. The delitiation process was performed by charging the cell at 4.30 V vs. Li + /Li after two charge-discharge cycles between 3.5 V and 4.2 V (vs. Li + /Li). After this process, the resultant delithiated LiCoO 2 thin films (referred to as De-LiCoO 2 thin-films) were characterized by XRD. Regarding the electrochemical evaluation of the OER activities for De-LiCoO 2 thin-film, a three-electrode cell was used. De-LiCoO 2 thin film was used as a working electrode, Pt mesh was used as a counter electrode, and Hg/HgO was used as a reference electrode. A solution of 0.1 mol dm - 3 KOH (O 2 gas was bubbled for 90 seconds) was used as an electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out at a sweep range from 0.2 to 0.8 V (vs. Hg/HgO). The electrode was cycled for 10 times at a scan rate of 10 mV s - 1 . Results and Disccusion Figure 1 shows XRD patterns of LiCoO 2 and De-LiCoO 2 . Before delithiation, the XRD pattern was in good agreement with the simulated patterns generated from ICSD database (Number 51182). After the delithiation, the XRD peaks at 2θ ≈ 19° were lowered with an appearance of a new peak at 2θ ≈ 18.4°, suggesting that the LiCoO 2 thin film was successfully delithiated by the delithiation process employed in the present study. Comparison of cyclic voltammograms between the LiCoO 2 and the De-LiCoO 2 thin films is shown in Fig. 2. The LiCoO 2 thin film showed larger Co 3/4+ peak at around 1.5 V, which is ascribed to both lithium removal into electrolyte and Li ordering within the surface/bulk [3] . On the other hand, the De-LiCoO 2 thin film did not show such peaks, implying that lithium content of the as-prepared De-LiCoO 2 was much lower than that of the pristine LiCoO 2 . The De-LiCoO 2 showed a different OER activity from that of pristine LiCoO 2 , implying that the OER activity was dependent upon lithium content of the thin films. The effect of lithium content on the OER activity and its quantitative discussion is under investigation, and details will be discussed in the conference.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is slow at most electrocatalysts and the preparation of inexpensive, sustainable, stable, and high-performance OER electrocatalysts remains the largest obstacle in the development of new electrolyzers. Carbon-coated metal/metal oxide (nano)particles have been used in such applications but the role played by the carbon coatings has provoked debate in the field and is poorly understood. Here, we show that the coating itself acts as the active site in OER, with the underlying material activating the carbon through a charge-transfer mechanism. We demonstrate this phenomenon by encapsulating < 2 nm metal-oxide (MO x ) electrocatalyst nanoparticles within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) to form Co 3 O 4 @SWNT, RuO 2 @SWNT and IrO 2 @SWNT. Access of electrolyte to the encapsulated metal oxides is blocked by plugging the SWNTs with fullerenes, which shuts off redox processes inherent to the encapsulated metal oxide but does not affect catalytic activity, showing that the carbon surface is the active OER site. This conclusion is supported by Tafel analysis which demonstrates that the rate-determining step for the OER is the same at MO x @SWNT and pristine SWNTs but different to that at bare MO x . In-situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and computational analysis demonstrate that charge transfer from the carbon shell to the metal oxide occurs during the OER. This charge transfer results in a decrease in electron density on the carbon surface, which may facilitate binding of – OH to the carbon surface. This is the first step in the OER and may be key to the activity of the hybrid nanomaterials. This understanding of how carbon coatings play an active role in electrocatalytic reactions is crucial for the development of future electrocatalysts for the OER, and the proposed charge transfer-driven mechanism could be tuneable to both oxidative and reductive reactions. These insights indicate that the route to high performance, sustainable electrocatalysts may be through electronic modification of conductive carbons, potentially through an interaction with inexpensive redox-active material which could be directed towards the development of reduction or oxidation electrocatalysts.

Numerous studies focus on replacing IrO 2 with RuO 2 in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Many previous reports conduct doping RuO 2 with various heteroatoms to enhance activity and overcome poor stability. However, understanding the impact of doping levels on the OER mechanism remains insufficient. Herein, we observed that increasing manganese doping in RuO 2 steadily enhances activity, but excessive doping reduces stability. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms electron migration from Mn and Ru atoms to bridging oxygen atoms, thereby increasing Ru-O bond covalency. Theoretical calculations suggest that as Ru-O bond covalency increases, the probability of the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) at Ru active sites rises, enhancing activity but diminishing stability. Consequently, doping Mn shifts the OER mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to LOM.

With the growing shift towards renewable energy sources, it has become significantly more urgent to explore and develop new energy storage solutions with high capacity, abundant materials and low cost. Conventional electrochemical storage systems (batteries) have been developed rapidly, but only pose as a partial solution due to their still low storage density and high cost.[1] Hydrogen occupies a key position within the energy transition attributable to its high storage density (33.33 kWh/kg) and its wide use as energy storage and as an essential raw material in industry.[2] However, two of the main problems are high investment costs and high cost of stored electricity due to the low efficiency of the conversion chain.[3] Both of these problems could be significantly improved by a new approach as described by Hahn et al. combining the functionalities of a battery and an electrolyzer. In this concept (see Fig. 1), water is oxidized to oxygen at the gas electrode during charging and zinc oxide is reduced to metallic zinc at the counter electrode. When the storage cell is being discharged as required, zinc is converted back to zinc oxide and water is reduced at the gas evolution electrode to produce hydrogen with an efficiency near 80%.[4][5] Due to the very low material costs of the galvanic Zn cell as well as the high energy density of the deposited zinc of 820Ah/kg and thus low overall dimensions, the capital costs can be reduced significantly.[6] At the core of this concept, we are working on the development of a noble-metal free bifunctional catalyst for the gas evolution electrode, realizing both hydrogen generation and oxygen generation over thousands of cycles. For this we applied multiple synthesis methods (microwave-assisted solvothermal synthesis, spray-coating technique, electrodeposition) to achieve various steel substrate-based catalysts doped with different metals (Ni, Co, Mo). The best results in terms of activity, overpotential and stability have been achieved using the microwave-assisted solvothermal synthesis. Apart from electrochemical activity and stability tests, simulating hundreds of charge and discharge cycles, we used microscopic and spectroscopic characterization methods such as SEM-EDX, thin-film XRD and ICP-OES.

Developing non-noble metal, low cost, highly efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst has attracted significant interests for several applications such as metal air battery. Herein, we report an S-doped high entropy perovskite oxide (HEPO) of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 (CrMnFeCoNi)O 3 electrocatalyst for bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst. We show that S-doped La 0.8 Sr 0.2 (CrMnFeCoNi)O 3 electrocatalyst exhibits a low OER overpotential of 385 mV at 10 mA cm -2 and a half-wave potential of 0.728 V for ORR in 0.1 M KOH. The electrocatalyst also demonstrates excellent stability. Various in-situ analyses were performed to investigate the morphological and structural change of electrocatalyst during the OER and ORR processes. This study opens a new opportunity for further exploring advanced bifunctional electrocatalyst.

The development of cost-effective and acid-stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts to replace iridium-based catalysts is essential for the implementation of proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based water electrolysis at gird scale. While ruthenium (Ru) oxide is highly efficient in acidic environments, severe Ru dissolution, caused by the formation of highly oxidized RuO 4 species, hinders its adoption. Herein, we develop a catalyst composite consisting of RuO 2 skin deposited on a manganese-cobalt-spinel oxide (MnCo 2 O 4.5 ) substrate, which demonstrates high active and stability towards acidic OER. Specifically, the optimized Ru/MnCo 2 O 4.5 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm − 2 and outstanding stability with negligible degradation rate under practical conditions. When integrated into a PEM electrolyser as the anode catalyst, Ru/MnCo 2 O 4.5 achieves an encouragingly low cell voltage of 1.83 V to reach 1 A cm −2 . Moreover, the PEM electrolyser demonstrates stable operation at 1 A cm −2 for over 130 h. Additionally, we conducted pH-dependent and kinetic isotope experiments to probe the rate-determining steps under varying reaction conditions. Our findings demonstrate that Ru/MnCoO 4.5 exhibits similar, if not improved, OER activity in acidic electrolyte compared to that in alkaline electrolyte. Finally, density functional theory calculations revealed that the incorporation of Co and Mn foreign atoms enhances the OER activity of RuO 2 and stabilizes the RuO 2 against dissolution by hindering its overoxidation into soluble RuO 4 species.

One of the cornerstones of the “hydrogen economy” is the widespread implementation of “green hydrogen” to a variety of applications spanning from transportation to industry and stationary power. The most straightforward approach to obtain such “green hydrogen” in large amounts at acceptable costs is to use the energy obtained from renewable sources to split water in an electrolyzer (EL) [1]. Low-temperature ELs running on either alkaline or neutral water are highly promising technologies to obtain “green hydrogen” since their electrode configurations can operate effectively even without the use of electrocatalysts (ECs) based on critical raw materials (CRMs) such as platinum-group metals (PGMs). To ensure that the conversion efficiency of such ELs is high enough for practical applications, it is mandatory that the overpotential in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is minimized by the implementation of a suitable EC at the anode. This report describes both conventional and high-entropy spinels as promising OER ECs for implementation at the anode of low-temperature ELs. The spinels include a variety of metal cations ( e.g. , Ni, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn, Co and Cu) and are typically obtained by a combination of steps carried out either/both at low T ( e.g. , hydrothermal processes) and at high T ( e.g. , calcination). The chemical composition of the spinels is determined both in the bulk and on the surface implementing analytical techniques such as inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray fluorescence and near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS). The morphology of the spinels is elucidated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); the porosimetric features are studied by nitrogen physisorption measurements. The structure of the spinels is probed by vibrational spectroscopies ( e.g. , confocal micro-Raman) and wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction. The OER kinetics and reaction mechanism of the spinels are quantified by means of cyclic voltammetry with the thin-film rotating ring-disk electrode (CV-TF-RRDE). Finally, the OER durability of the most promising candidates is evaluated “ex-situ” after the implementation of suitable accelerated ageing protocols. The results of the physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations are correlated with the synthetic parameters, yielding information on the most promising approaches to obtain spinel-based OER ECs able to bestow to low-T ELs a performance and durability beyond the state of the art.

Introduction For the realization of efficient hydrogen generation on alkali water electrolysis, there is an urgent need to develop high catalytic active, stable, cost-effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Up to now, many efforts have been devoted to developing OER oxide catalysts by cation doping, thus, there is little room for the future exploration and alternative developing strategies are required. Anion doping is one of promising catalysts design strategies. Recently, to realize a more flexible control of anion composition, we have developed a novel electrochemical anion-doping technique using anion-conductive solid electrolyte. [1] We have successfully demonstrated electrochemical F-doping to a perovskite oxide La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3- δ (LSC55) and found that the surface morphology can be controlled by F-doping current value. By high-rate F-doping, the mixture of amorphous and polycrystalline can be created on the surface of LSC55 particles. On perovskite OER catalysts, improvements of OER activity of perovskite oxides are previously reported by F-doping and surface amorphization. [2][3] Therefore, our electrochemically F-doped samples may have good OER activity. In this study, by preparing two kinds of F-doped samples and evaluating their OER activities, we aimed to elucidate the influence of the electrochemical F-doping on the OER activity. Experiment LSC55 was synthesized by Pechini method. For the F-doping to LSC55, an electrochemical cell, PbF 2 -Pb|BaF 2 |BaF 2 -LSC55, was assembled. Here, PbF 2 -Pb and BaF 2 were the F-source and the solid electrolyte respectively. By controlling the F-doping current density at 60 or 3000 μA/g, two kinds of F-doped samples with different surface morphology were prepared. Each F-doped sample is expressed as LSCF-low and LSCF-high in this abstract. By controlling the amount of charge, 20mol% of F was supplied to each sample. The crystal structure, distribution of F and surface morphology of the prepared samples were evaluated by x-ray diffractometry (XRD), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), annular bright field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ABF-STEM). For the OER activity measurements, catalyst inks were prepared by mixing the prepared sample, K + -exchanged nafion and tetrahydrofuran. 6.4 μL of the ink was dropped on a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode. 0.1 M KOH aq., Pt and HgO-Hg were used as an electrolyte, a counter electrode and a reference electrode respectively. OER activities were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 0.3 and 0.9 V for 100 cycles. Results and discussion The XRD measurements of LSCF-low and LSCF-high revealed that they have the same perovskite structure as the pristine sample. To evaluate the distribution of F in the particle, we performed TOF-SIMS analyses. While a negligible F signal was detected on the pristine sample, clear F signals were detected on the two F-doped samples, which supports the success in the electrochemical F doping. Furthermore, surface F-concentration of LSCF-high was much higher than that of LSCF-low, which indicates the creation of an F-rich surface phase on the LSCF-high. The ABF-STEM observation on the pristine particle revealed that crystalline structure was highly maintained around the surface. On the surface of the LSCF-low particle, while the crystal structure was relatively maintained, the about 3 nm thick amorphous layer was created. On the LSCF-high particle, the about 20 nm thick modified surface layer composed of amorphous and nano-size crystalline domains was observed. These results support that we achieved to prepare F-doped samples with different surface morphologies by the electrochemical F-doping. OER activities of each sample were evaluated by CV. LSCF-high showed the highest initial OER activity and the following order is the pristine and LSCF-low. The maximum current density was about 33% larger than that of the pristine. On the other hand, the cycle performance showed the opposite trend. LSCF-low has the best stability and the degradation rate of LSCF-high was most large. These results clearly support the distinction of OER activity due to the difference of F-doping condition. In the presentation, we will discuss the cause of the different OER activities of electrochemically F-doped samples. Reference [1] T. Katsumata, et al ., Adv. Func. Mater ., 33 , 50, 2307116 (2023).

Abstract With the increasing demand for hydrogen energy, the non-noble metal catalysts in water splitting for hydrogen production are significant for addressing global environmental issues. [1] Among them, layered transition metal oxide/hydroxide (LTMO/LTMH) materials have drawn more attention for their high tunability of surface or bulk structural transformations after introducing different cations inside the interlayer, which could manifest OER activity. [2] Therefore, birnessite-layered manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) is considered a potential material for its ability to create a container for cation intercalation, which could significantly enhance its behavior in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). [3] However, most of the investigations of its application in OER considered MnO 2 layers as active sites, which may underestimate the function of intercalated cations and hence blur its real reaction active sites. Using the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory recently sheds new light and provides a new road for improving OER performance; hard Lewis acid captures hydroxyl and thus speeds up the cleavage of water molecules, generating a demanding local alkaline environment. [4-6] Herein, we grounded the perspective of the intercalated cations based on the HSAB theory, using layered MnO 2 as the “container” for accommodating hard Lewis acid cations, achieving using Lewis acid cations for active sites, to enhance OER activity. We use the electrodeposition method to synthesize the precursor layered catalyst, TBA + /MnO 2 . With the ion exchange process, cations with different Lewis acidities (K + , Fe 3+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , and Zn 2+ ) were intercalated inside this “nano-cell” (interlayer of layered MnO 2 ) to discuss how they influenced the confined surrounding electrolyte environment and electron/mass transport. X-ray diffraction, Raman, and inductively coupled plasma verified the successful synthesis of layered MnO 2 with different cations intercalated. The OER results of cation-intercalated MnO 2 catalysts exhibited that intercalating the harder Lewis acid significantly influences the interlayer electrolyte environment, markedly accelerating and enhancing the reaction kinetics and OER activity. Furthermore, comparing the OER behavior of intercalated cations, free cations, and bulk metal foils, the intercalated hard Lewis acid cations showed superior reaction kinetics. This work thus provides a clear picture of the role of cations when intercalated into the MnO 2 layers during OER and highlights a novel utilization of Lewis acid cations as active sites for enhancing OER activity.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is kinetically sluggish and requires a high overpotential compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its four-electron transfer process. Herein, we have fabricated highly active Fe-substituted LiNiO 2 using the electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique as scalable electrocatalysts. With this technique, we can modify the electronic and surface structure of LiNi x Fe 1-x O 2 by controlling the amounts of Ni and Fe, where x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. This substitution can modify the electronic structure of the Ni ions to more electrophilic oxidation states, resulting in the M – O step facilitation, which is considered one of the rate-determining steps in the OER. The electronic structure modification was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface structural modulation of the electrocatalysts due to Fe substitution was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The OER half-cell electrochemical measurements were carried out using standard three- electrode configuration. These results elucidate that substitution of Ni by Fe increases the electrocatalytic activity significantly. The optimized electrocatalyst, LiNi 0.6 Fe 0.4 O 2 , exhibits an overpotential of 239 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 and a Tafel slope of 41.49 mV dec -1 . Moreover, it exhibits excellent operational durability under continuous and dynamic operating environments without any significant performance degradation.

The clean energy, namely hydrogen, has been spotted lighted as a promising means for tackling down the problem of climate change. Alkaline Water Electrolysis (AWE) is identified as the representative method for obtaining hydrogen through sustainable way, because it needs only water and electricity (supplied from renewable energy sources such as solar light and wind). Especially, cheaper electrode materials like transition metal (Nickel) could be employed for both cathode and anode, whereas the other method (PEM-WE) should use only more expensive Pt-group materials. Herein, we explored the possibility of stainless steel (SS) for anode under alkaline environment. SS based electrodes showed steady performance over the versatile range of current densities (from 10 mA/cm 2 to 100 mA/cm 2 ). These novel results would provide subsequent research with how to design for alternative electrode materials. Figure 1

In the past few decades, tremendous attention has been devoted to enhancing the activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for hydrogen generation, while the cost and long-term stability of OER catalysts, which can play an even more important role in large-scale electrolysis industrialization, have been much less emphasized. Herein, we engineered an OER electrode from cheap and abundant stainless steel (SS) via facile approaches. An outstanding activity is observed with a low overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 and a small Tafel slope, which is among the best performances in the published literature. Additionally, a self-repairing catalyst concept on the electrode is proposed in which the Ni-rich catalyst layer can regenerate from the metallic substrate under the OER induction due to the different diffusion and dissolution rates of metal oxides/hydroxides. The facile engineering of OER electrodes from SS combined with the self-repairing catalyst can potentially address the cost and long-term stability barriers for OER catalysts in alkaline electrolysis.

Abstract Despite significant research efforts, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) on Pt in alkaline solutions remain poorly understood. The role of interfacial water molecules has been investigated in recent years, yet several questions persist. These include a clear definition of interfacial water molecules, their distinction from bulk or hydrated water, and their specific mechanism of action in HER/HOR processes. Addressing these questions is critical for unraveling the HER/HOR interface and will inform the development of next-generation catalysts for green hydrogen. Herein, we explore the HER/HOR kinetics of various catalysts, including monometallic (Pt, Ru, Pd) and bimetallic (Pt-Ru) systems, in alkaline electrolytes (AMOH, where AM represents alkali metal cations) at different pH levels. Our findings indicate that HER/HOR kinetics are consistently slower in 0.01M AMOH (pH 12) than in 0.1M AMOH (pH 13), a trend that current pH-based theories do not explain. Using high energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS) and attenuated total reflectance-surface enhanced infrared adsorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), we identified two distinct behaviors of interfacial water across the catalysts. In dilute electrolytes (0.01M), the interfacial water demonstrates reduced flexibility, hindering the transport of HER/HOR intermediates. Conversely, in concentrated electrolytes (0.1M), interfacial water supports the HER/HOR process via a bifunctional pathway and obey the hard-soft acid-base (HASB) interaction. Slow-growth sampling coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics (SG-AIMD) simulations corroborate that the hydrogen bonding network in 0.01M electrolyte is less conducive to reactivity compared to that in 0.1M electrolyte. Our results aid existing theories and provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of alkaline HER/HOR catalysis.

As a generation process of hydrogen fuel, an alkaline water electrolysis is considered as one of the most promising pathway. The water electrolysis is able to divide into two half-cell reaction: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in anode. However, high activation energy of OER is regarded as a major bottleneck for utilization of water electrolysis, therefore it is necessary to use an electrocatalyst to improve the reaction rate. Currently, commercially used electrocatalysts of OER is precious metal such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and iridium (Ir) based compound which have critical drawback for high cost and low stability in alkaline electrolyte. As a substitute of platinum group materials for electrocatalyst of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the development of cost-effective and high-active nickel oxide catalyst has attracted intense research interest. Alkaline OER is composed by five states: M, M-OH, M-O, M-OOH, and M + O 2 , and the gibbs free energy of final state is 4.92 eV higher than the first state. Thus, the free energy difference between each states equally becomes 1.23 eV to minimize the activation energy of rate determining step (RDS). In this point, nickel oxide shows a remarkable catalytic activity because a rapid and reversible electrochemical oxidation on the surface of nickel oxide triggers reconstructions to form hydroxide which is suitable structures for intermediate of OER. However, the nickel oxide still has high activation energy of reaction step from nickel(II) oxide to nickel(III) oxyhydroxide (3 rd step of OER, Ni-O à Ni-OOH), which becomes RDS of OER. Because the catalytic activity seriously reduces without the balanced rate between each step of reaction, it is necessary to control the electric structure of nickel oxide to optimize adsorption energy of intermediates. In this context, bismuth doped nickel oxide is synthesized for electrocatalyst of OER. Because bismuth has higher electronegativity than nickel, the adsorption energy of positively charged nickel with proton decreases and the adsorption energy of positively charged nickel oxide with hydroxide ion increases. Therefore, the activation energy of RDS of OER is expected to reduce than the pristine nickel oxide. In practice, the bismuth doped nickel oxide is synthesized by hydrothermal process and the composition of bismuth is controlled by the concentration of precursors. The crystal structure of nickel oxide is maintained after the addition of bismuth, but the inter-planar spacing of overall plane of nickel oxide structure decreases according to selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In this context, the bismuth additive does not form the bi-metal oxide with nickel, but it substitutes the nickel site of nickel oxide structure. According to the nickel 2p3/2 spectra of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a binding energy of nickel oxide peak positively shifts when the composition of bismuth additive increased due to the shifted electron from nickel to bismuth atom. As electrochemical measurement for evaluation of catalytic activity, the bismuth doped nickel oxide shows 59 mV lower overpotential at 20 mA cm -2 in alkaline OER, respectively, than the nickel oxide. In particular, the addition of bismuth is especially influenced to intrinsic activity, the bismuth doped nickel oxide catalyst shows higher turnover frequency than the pristine nickel oxide although it has similar active surface area.

Electrochemical water splitting is a promising technology to produce green hydrogen. Industrial water electrolysis occurs in proton exchange membrane electrolyzer but the technology faces limitation which reduces its industrial adoption and market competitiveness. The utilization of precious and rare materials like platinum, iridium or ruthenium as HER and OER electrodes is one of the main challenges plaguing the development of this technology. Unfortunately, nature presents us with an irony: most efficient electrocatalysts are the rarest of element. Hence an efficient strategy is to reduce their mass loading without compromising on its catalytic efficiency. Electrochemistry gives us the flexibility to deposit a “net” desired amount of catalytic material without wastage. In this study we present an electrochemical technique to fabricate a dimensionally stable iridium-based oxygen evolution catalyst with significantly less mass loading (~0.3mg/cm 2 ) which exhibits comparable activity (overpotential of ~320 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 ) and stability (>150 hrs) in contrast to commercially available catalyst in acidic media.

With the current push for an alternative to traditional fuel-based transportation, hydrogen has the potential to be a viable replacement. Hydrogen has been proposed as a fuel replacement in internal combustion engines, or as fuel in a fuel cell powered automotive vehicle. Before hydrogen can be used in any type of transportation, it must first be produced. Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers (PEMWE) produce hydrogen through an oxygen evolution reaction. A key component to PEMWE operation is the porous transport layer (PTL). Specifically, the PTL on the anode side must provide transport pathways for water to access the catalyst layer, while simultaneously removing oxygen. In this work, a multiscale modeling approach is used to study the effect of a bilayer PTL, which is a PTL with an added mesoporous layer (MPL), on oxygen evolution and PEMWE performance. A previously developed image processing technique was expanded to generate bilayer PTLs from Xray Tomography scans. This process generates each sample a one combined geometry, which removes the need for interface communication. Due to the improvements in imaging techniques, the ability to mesh complex structures with this technique is possible. Each sample was generated with a 2:1 PTL to MPL ratio, with the total thickness around 400 ums. Porosity and pore size distributions were calculated during the image processing step. First a micro scale model that uses the Finite Volume Method, accompanied with a volume of fluid model, was used to predict permeability and simulate simultaneous two-phase flow of liquid water and oxygen gas. Oxygen evolution, growth, and structure interaction were observed. Results showed that the bilayer structure removes oxygen faster than single layer PTLs. Physical properties calculated using the micro scale model were used to inform a macro scale model of a PEMWE using the Finite Volume Method. The macro scale model predicted performance curves for each bilayer sample. Results showed that the bilayer samples exhibited improved performance as high current densities. Findings from this work show that a bilayer PTL geometry has potential to improve PEMWE performance.

Ni-rich layered cathode active materials (CAMs) are promising candidates for application in lithium-ion batteries due to their high reversible capacity. To further improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries, changing the transition metal composition in CAMs is a good approach to gain a higher capacity, better capacity retention as well as higher rate capability and safety. The oxygen lattice has been considered and widely accepted to be electrochemically inactive, even though it plays a key role in the phase transformations that occur at high degrees of delithiation, as oxygen is released during these high delithiation states. In addition, released oxygen can cause thermal runaway, by exothermic reaction with electrolyte 1,2 . However, the effect of oxygen defects and vacancies on the electrochemical performance of cathode active materials in lithium-ion batteries has been scarcely investigated. Research has mainly focused on lithium-rich layered materials, where oxygen vacancies have led to improved battery performance in terms of rate capability, higher discharge capacity and reduced oxygen evolution 3 . However, many of these publications suffer from an unprecise content of oxygen deficiencies within the cathode active material with large errors. In this work, a solid-state reactor for electrochemical extraction of oxygen is used to obtain an accurate oxygen deficiency with low error for Ni-rich layered NCM 811 4 . Using this process, 1 mol%, 2 mol% and 5 mol% oxygen deficient NCM 811 are produced and (electro)chemically characterized. The effect of oxygen defect concentration on discharge capacity, capacity retention, rate capability and structural stability is investigated in liquid cells. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to reveal changes in electrode resistances. To obtain the cathode impedance only, a three-electrode setup is used, which utilizes a μ-reference electrode made of gold wire. References 1 R. Jung, M. Metzger, F. Maglia, C. Stinner and H. A.

As the concerns about energy and environmental issues rapidly increase, the requirements for developing renewable energy sources are highly demanded to achieve the carbon-neutrality by 2050. Among the suggested strategies for carbon neutrality, green hydrogen production via water electrolysis is treated as a promising breakthrough to alternate the currently used fossil fuel-based energy production since it utilizes clean and eco-friendly resources of water and electricity. However, there still remains a limitation of which mostly used noble metal-based catalyst materials such as iridium, and platinum result in severe carbon dioxide emission during production and recycling processes in addition to the extremely high cost and scarcity. Therefore, it is mandatory to minimize the noble metal contents in catalyst electrodes to ultimately reach carbon neutrality. Diverse approaches have been suggested to reduce the amount of noble metal contents such as developing non-noble metal catalysts and single-atom catalysts as well as designing electrode architecture for low loading on the support materials. Nonetheless, limited catalytic performances or increased process cost from suggested strategies still hinders the development of large-scale water electrolyzer. Herein, we suggest a novel concept of organic catalysis promotor as a strategy for minimizing noble metal contents in catalysts. Organic catalysis promotor as an additive in an electrolyte can enhance the hydrogen production efficiency with the spontaneous chemical interaction with the intermediate state of a catalyst during water electrolysis reaction, which can further result in reducing the required amount of noble metals for green hydrogen production. We developed the model organic catalysis promotor for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline water electrolysis, and it successfully reduced overpotential of 70 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm -2 with only adding a slight amount of 1 mM organic catalysis promotor in KOH electrolyte. This catalysis promoting capability could be maintained even over a week, and the possibilities of further expansion of organic catalysis promotor material group and general applicability to representative oxygen evolution reaction catalysts were also proved. This novel concept of organic catalysis promotor has a great potential to be further expanded toward hydrogen evolution reaction promotion and acidic water electrolyzer. Furthermore, it can suggest a new breakthrough for the development of large-scale water electrolyzer with minimizing the noble metal contents in a sustainable and economical way.

The orbital hybridization between metal and oxygen of perovskite catalysts can lower the overpotential and enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. This study combines density functional theory with experiments to clarify how Sr/Fe codoping modulates orbital hybridization and enhances OER catalytic activity of LaCoO3. The as-prepared La0.50Sr0.50Co0.75Fe0.25O3 shows remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm–2 current density and a 107.03 mV dec–1 Tafel slope, outperforming most state-of-the-art perovskite-based OER electrocatalysts. The experimental results confirm that Sr/Fe codoping enhances the expansion of Co–O–Co bond angles and strengthens the covalency of the Co–O bond in LaCoO3, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, increasing Sr doping reduces the distance between the Co 3d/O 2p center and the Fermi level, decreasing the energy difference between them and enhancing the degree of orbital hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p. As the degree of Co 3d/O 2p orbital hybridization increases, a higher charge transfer was found between the active center and intermediate product, OOH, reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step while lowering the overpotential. This study provides thorough insight into the rational design of OER catalysts based on orbital hybridization.

Designing an affordable catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media remains a major challenge. In this study, we synthesized a Ru-CoMoO4–x/NF catalyst modified with ruthenium nanoclusters (Ru NCs) and oxygen vacancies (Ovs), using nickel foam (NF) as the substrate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that introducing Ru nanoclusters effectively modified the catalyst's electronic structure. A carefully controlled concentration of oxygen vacancies enhanced the catalyst's stability, reduced electrochemical impedance, and promoted hydrogen evolution kinetics, thereby improving the intrinsic activity of Ru-CoMoO4–x/NF. In an alkaline freshwater medium, Ru-CoMoO4–x/NF displayed a low overpotential of 20 mV to achieve a current density of −10 mA cm–2, with a Tafel slope of 41.54 mV dec–1. The catalyst maintained stable performance with minimal degradation after 100 h in constant voltage tests and 180 h in multistep constant current tests. Moreover, in an overall water-splitting system, Ru-CoMoO4–x/NF∥Ru-CoMoO4–x/NF required only 1.606 V to drive −50 mA cm–2. This work presents a viable approach to enhancing the HER electrocatalytic performance of nonprecious metal oxides through the synergistic effects of Ru NCs and Ovs.

To enable a future society based on sun and wind energy, the transformation of electricity into chemical energy in form of fuels is crucial. Electrolysis offers a promising solution, achieving this transformation by splitting water. At the anode, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) produces protons and electrons that are used at the cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to generate hydrogen fuel. While hydrogen is the desired product, oxygen has limited economic value. From a techno-economic standpoint, a more attractive approach is hybrid water electrolysis, which replaces the OER with value-added oxidation reactions of abundant organic feedstocks. However, significant challenges stand in the way of widespread adoption of hybrid water electrolysis for large-scale industrial applications. This work provides a critical analysis of these hurdles, delving deeper into each aspect: Higher Kinetic Overpotentials for Organic Oxidation Reactions: Compared to the well-established OER, organic oxidation reactions generally have a lower energy consumption, but generally necessitate greater overpotentials to overcome kinetic limitations. Addressing this challenge requires the development of novel electrocatalysts that can significantly reduce the activation energy for organic oxidation reactions, bringing their kinetic performance closer to that of the OER. Limited Availability and Product Demand of Feedstocks and Products: The organic feedstocks suitable for these reactions may be less abundant or have a lower market demand compared to hydrogen (or even CO2 reduction). This scarcity or limited economic value of the organic substrates and products can potentially hinder the overall economic viability of hybrid water electrolysis. Extensive research into utilizing readily available and sustainable organic feedstocks is crucial. Additionally, exploring and developing markets for the products generated from these oxidation reactions would be necessary for widespread adoption. Additional Purification Needs: The products formed during organic oxidation reactions might require further purification steps to meet the specifications required for downstream applications. These additional purification processes add complexity and increase the cost associated with hybrid water electrolysis. Developing selective electrocatalysts that generate the desired products in high purity could significantly alleviate this challenge. High Activity: The catalysts should possess a high intrinsic activity for the target organic oxidation reactions, ensuring fast reaction rates and maximizing product yield. Selectivity for the Desired Products: Indiscriminate oxidation of the organic feedstock can lead to the formation of undesired byproducts, reducing the efficiency and necessitating complex downstream separations. Therefore, catalysts with high selectivity for the targeted products are essential. Long-Term Stability: Electrocatalysts must maintain their activity and selectivity over extended periods under operating conditions. Degradation of the catalysts can occur due to various factors, including chemical and structural transformations during operation. Developing electrocatalysts with exceptional long-term stability is paramount for the practical application of hybrid water electrolysis. By outlining these challenges, we aim to stimulate discussion and guide research efforts within the academic community. Addressing these critical aspects is essential to pave the way for the successful implementation of hybrid water electrolysis at an industrial scale, ultimately enabling a sustainable energy future.

Enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is essential for efficient hydrogen production from water using renewable electricity sources. In this study, we report the controlled synthesis of NiFe oxalate nanorods, facilitated by addition of potassium fluoride (KF) in the synthetic process. KF plays a crucial role, notably increasing the surface distribution of Fe (>80 at*) compared to syntheses conducted without KF. The optimal synthesis conditions, determined by OER activity, involved using 10 mM KF in an oxalic acid solution. This led to iron-rich NiFe oxalate-derived oxyhydroxides, which exhibited an overpotential of 226 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 . Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis was employed to probe the nature of active phases and reveal the origin of the improved OER activity.

Despite the potential to increase the energy limit of Li-rich cathodes by using oxygen redox, its practicality has been limited by the accompanying structural changes and voltage hysteresis. While voltage hysteresis is commonly associated with transition metal (TM) migration and oxygen dimerization, the specific contribution of each is unclear. We provide a mechanistic insight into how each of these changes induces hysteresis in a representative Li-rich disordered rocksalt cathode, Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2. We reveal that the formation and cleavage of oxygen dimers can occur exceptionally rapidly during the electrochemical process, suggesting that the dimerization process is not directly the cause of voltage hysteresis, contrary to prevailing arguments. Instead, oxygen dimers are found to indirectly exacerbate hysteresis by instigating TM migration, which leads to the evolution of dimer-rich and TM-rich regions within the structure. We demonstrate that TM migration is relatively slower than dimerization and as such contributes to hysteresis by dissipating internal energy during the relaxation of charged electrodes and by inducing cation rearrangement with each cycle.

Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one method for mass hydrogen production. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the PEMWE anode has a high overpotential, which is the main factor in increasing electricity requirements. Therefore, it is desired to decrease the overpotential of OER. RuO 2 is known as the most active OER catalyst, but its stability in the high-potential regions is poor. For this reason, IrO 2 , with relatively high stability, is generally used as the anode catalyst despite its OER activity being lower than that of RuO 2 . The most significant problem with the IrO 2 catalyst is its cost, which is attributed to the rarest element. There are many reports about the Ir-Ru binary oxide catalyst proposed to improve stability in RuO 2 and increase OER activity in IrO 2 . Their Ir/Ru ratio is generally about one, and the Ir content should be reduced as much as possible to suppress the cost. Recently, it was reported that the combination of only 6% of Ir with a Ru catalyst demonstrated high OER activity and stability [1]. The other research groups haven’t followed the low rate of Ir in the Ir-Ru binary catalyst, although it is very advantageous in terms of commercialization. Therefore, it is hard to judge the true effect of a tiny quantity of Ir to OER activity and stability in Ru-based catalysts. In the practical catalyst, many factors, such as the diffusivity of the O 2 bubble, proton and electron conductivities, and so on, influence the OER activity. Herein, we employed the model electrode method to investigate the essential effect of a small number of Ir for the OER activity of the Ru-based catalyst. The model electrode doesn’t have to consider proton and electron conductivity and O 2 bubble diffusivity. Therefore, it can focus on the difference in electron structure, OER activity, and stability in the model electrode with several Ir content rates. In this study, the additive effect of a tiny quantity of Ir on the Ru-based model electrodes on OER activity and stability was investigated. The model electrode was composed of a glassy carbon substrate, the Ru nanosheet stacking layer of about 1 – 3 nm, and a few nanometer-sized Ir nanoparticles at the top layer. The amount of the Ir on a model electrode was controlled by a number of pulses in the arc plasma deposition method. The electrochemical measurements were conducted by a three-electrode cell, which is composed of a working electrode, a carbon counter electrode, a reversible hydrogen electrode, and 0.1 M HClO 4 (room temp.). All of the model electrodes were subjected to electrooxidation by potential sweeping before their OER activity and stability were evaluated. Furthermore, before and after the electrochemical measurements, the electron structure of the model electrodes was confirmed by XPS analysis. All model electrodes showed redox peaks at around 0.6 V and 1.0 V, which are attributed to RuO 2 and IrO 2 , respectively. Adding a tiny quantity of Ir seemed to improve the OER activity. In contrast, the stability of RuO 2 depended on the amount of Ir. Surprisingly, the dissolution rate of Ru increased with the increase of Ir contents in the model electrode. These results suggested the possibility that a few amounts of Ir contents in RuO 2 could improve the OER activity but have a negative effect on its stability. [1] D. Wu, et al.Nature Communication, 12 , (2021) 1145-9.

Introduction Zinc-air secondary batteries are expected to have high energy density because oxygen in ambient air can be used as the active material. They are also expected to satisfy high safety standards owing to the aqueous electrolyte solutions and open structure. In addition, low cost is expected since zinc is a relatively cheap metal compared to lithium. Because of these features, Zinc-air secondary batteries are attracting attention as a next-generation large-scale energy storage device. One of the challenges for commercializing this battery system is the low energy conversion efficiency caused by the large overvoltage of the air electrode. To solve this problem, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have been intensively researched, and Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3-δ (BSCF) and Ca 2 FeCoO 5 (CFCO) have been developed as OER catalysts having higher activity than conventional noble metal oxide catalysts. Since the active sites of BSCF and CFCO are reported as partially Fe-substituted CoOOH phases 1,2 , it is essential to understand OER characteristics of partially Fe-substituted CoOOH phases. However, the effects of the crystallinity and Fe-substitution ratio on OER activity have not been clarified. This is mainly because metastable hydrated CoOOH is conventionally synthesized at relatively low temperatures. On the other hand, we have successfully synthesized highly crystalline hydrated Ni x Fe 1–x OOH using soft chemistry and clarified the effect of crystallinity and Fe-substitution ratio on the OER activity 3 . In this study, we synthesized highly crystalline hydrated CoOOH using soft chemistry and evaluate its OER activity to elucidate factors controlling it. Experimental Hydrated CoOOH was synthesized with two-step soft chemistry following the report by Sakurai et al. 4 . First, Na 0.74 CoO 2 was obtained by calcination of Co 3 O 4 :Na 2 CO 3 =40:60 mol% at 900 °C for 12 h. Then, synthesized Na 0.74 CoO 2 was stirred in 7.8 mmol dm –3 Br 2 / CH 3 CN to obtain Na 0.358 CoO 2 by extracting Na. Finally, Na 0.358 CoO 2 was hydrated by refluxing with ultra-pure water at 100 °C for 24 h. The synthesized samples were characterized with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results and discussion Figure 1 shows a XRD pattern of the synthesized sample. Though relatively broad unidentified peak is observed at around 8 °, the diffraction pattern of hydrated CoOOH is observed as a main phase. Its OER performance in an aqueous solution of KOH will be presented at the site. References 1) K. J. May, C. E. Carlton, K. A. Stoerzinger, M. Risch, J. Suntivich, Y. L. Lee, A. Grimaud, Y. S.

Designing efficient and stable electrolcatalysts for the demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis is challenging and we are still lacking fundamental understanding of the underlying processes related to catalyst transformations governing their final activity and stability. Only the combination of operando spectroscopy techniques with electrochemical measurements can promote a deeper understanding on the interplay of different phenomena taking place during OER [1]. In this work, we utilize operando techniques like X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) [2], in combination with specifically designed electrochemical protocols to study i) the reconstruction/reactivation of active sites in Ir-based OER catalysts for acidic media (Fig. 1a-c) and Ni-based OER catalysts for alkaline media (Fig. 1d) and ii) the identification of the relevant OER active species which will eventually define the final electrocatalyst performance [3]. We show not only the formation of the active species for OER but also the dynamic operando transformation of the Ir- and Ni-based electrocatalysts before the onset of OER but also their structural transformation due to electro-oxidation during OER, processes that lead to the final active phase. The underlying mechanisms studied via our operando analysis provide fundamental understanding of reaction mechanism but also guidance for the design of efficient OER catalysts optimized for their operation in technical devices.

Particulate photoelectrocatalysts (PEC) have attracted substantial attention due to their potential for renewable fuel generation from sunlight and water. The characterization of reactivity at the active sites of photocatalysts with nanometer-scale spatial resolution is essential for understanding and developing more efficient energy conversion systems. In this study, we present the results of the first single-particle-on-microelectrode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity measurements assisted by in situ photoelectrochemical scanning electrochemical microscopy (photo-SECM). An individual micrometer-sized Al-doped SrTiO 3 /Rh 2–y Cr y O 3 photocatalyst crystal was immobilized on a carbon fiber microelectrode and probed using a Pt nanoelectrode at various substrate bias conditions to promote OER and HER. Local fluxes of oxygen and hydrogen generated by an individual PEC microcrystal were quantitatively evaluated with COMSOL Multiphysics finite-element simulations.

Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) for water splitting typically rely on catalysts deposited on the semiconductor due to its lack of intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. However, the placement of catalysts within the light path between the source and semiconductor in artificial leaf-based architectures can hinder the semiconductor's light absorption, diminishing photoelectrochemical activity, especially at high catalyst loading. To address this challenge, we propose a strategy involving the controlled formation of patterned catalysts on the semiconductor surface. This approach, utilizing light-guided electrodeposition facilitated by a digital micromirror device (DMD), enables the direct, localized deposition of transition metal-based catalysts. The resulting patterned catalysts correspond to the light pattern, allowing for optimized photoelectrochemical performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy on a hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3 )-based photoanode, achieving enhanced performance with grid-patterned CoPi catalysts. This approach not only facilitates high catalyst loading but also ensures sufficient light penetration through the exposed intrinsic surface of α-Fe 2 O 3 . Our findings suggest that this technique holds promise for advancing the commercialization of PECs, particularly for self-biased water splitting devices aimed at green H 2 production.

Hydrogen represents a carbon-free and sustainable energy carrier. Electrochemical water splitting via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a green approach for the hydrogen production. Nevertheless, unfavorable thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics limit the water splitting efficiency. While the benchmark catalysts such as Pt@C and RuO 2 /C catalysts display remarkable catalytic activity, the inferior durability remains a major concern. Further, scarcity and high demand result in sharp rise in cost, hindering their large-scale commercialization. Herein we report the synthesis of lithium-doped nickel iron oxyhydroxide nanosheets gown on polyaniline functionalized carbon fiber as (Li@NiFeOOH@PANi-CF) as bi-functional electrocatalyst for HER and OER. In this design, the interfacial PANi layers substantially improve the surface functionality of the CF substrate and thereby facilitates strong coupling interaction with the Li@NiFeOOH catalyst, which influences the charge transport kinetics across the catalyst/substrate interface and also maintains the structural integrity of the overall catalyst throughout the cyclic and long-term durability tests. Furthermore, the Li@NiFeOOH provide abundant active sites for the dissociation of water, while the PANi-CF facilitates the adsorption of H + ions from the intermediates and promotes its convention to hydrogen molecules, which accelerates the HER effectively. Due to these intriguing features, the Li@NiFeOOH@PANi-CF manifested remarkable HER efficiency with low overpotential (34, 42, and 53 mV mV at 10 mA cm - 2 ) in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes. Besides, the Li@NiFeOOH@PANi-CF demonstrated better OER durability even in acidic electrolyte. As a key functionality, PANi layers protected the carbon surface from corrosive reactions and suppressed the active catalyst dissolution, resulting in high tolerance for both HER and OER at all pH conditions.

Hydrogen is expected to be the next-generation energy carrier with zero CO 2 emissions. Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is one of the methods for hydrogen production; however, improving its energy efficiency is a challenge. We are currently developing a highly efficient water electrolysis using hydroxide hydrate melts at 150–200°C [1,2]. Recently, we reported that the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a Ni electrode in a NaOH–KOH hydrate melt at 200°C under atmospheric pressure was significantly reduced compared to a 30 wt% KOH aqueous solution at 80°C, which is a typical electrolyte for conventional commercial AWE [2]. In addition, the OER overpotential was found to be larger than the HER overpotential at the Ni electrode in the NaOH–KOH hydrate melt [2]. In the present study, we investigated the OER behavior of Ni-containing alloys in the NaOH–KOH hydrate melt. Linear sweep voltammetry was performed in the NaOH–KOH hydrate melt (NaOH:KOH:H 2 O = 9:61:30 mol%) at 150 and 200°C using a three-electrode cell. Several types of commercially available Ni-containing alloy plates with a flag-shaped and 3 mm diameter were used as the working electrode. A Ni rod was used as the counter electrode. A palladium hydride (Pd–H) electrode was used as the reference electrode and the potential was calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). All measured potentials were IR compensated. All measurements were performed in stationary electrolytes under Ar gas flow at atmospheric pressure. Figure 1 shows anodic polarization curves at Ni–Fe and Ni–Cu alloy electrodes in the NaOH–KOH hydrate melt at 150°C. The polarization of Ni–Fe and Ni–Cu alloy electrodes is lower than that of the Ni electrode. In this paper, we will also present the results for other Ni-containing alloys.

Electrochemical water splitting involves two heterogeneous multi-step half-reactions, which are referred to as the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It should be noted that the OER under acidic conditions has the following two advantages compared to the process in neutral and alkaline solutions. The kinetics of the OER in acidic media could be much faster due to the higher proton transfer rate between anode and cathode. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) is an acidic solid polymer electrolyte membrane characterized by good proton conductivity, excellent electrochemical durability, and high mechanical strength. Polynuclear iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II), or Prussian blue, and its analogues possess unique open framework structures with the general chemical formula of A x M y [Fe-(CN) 6 ]z·nH 2 O (where A = alkali metal cation, M = transition metal cation). The possibility to accommodate different transition metal cations within the coordination framework renders them with appealing electrochemical, ion-exchange, sensing, or photomagnetic properties, which have been the subject of intense research for decades. Despite their rigid structure, these mixed-metal coordination polymers are usually nonstoichiometric. This chemical variety makes them a versatile type of molecule-based materials. Prussian Blue type cobalt hexacyanoferrates seem to activate water molecules during photoelectrochemical oxidations. Here we report the water oxidation catalytic activity found in Prussian blue-type cobalt hexacyanoferrate modified electrodes both under conventional electrochermcal and photoelectrochemical conditions (using WO 3 n-type semiconductor) in acid medium. It is noteworthy that some of the hybrid cobalt-ruthenium hexacyanoferrate compositions showed remarkable catalytic ability towards the oxygen evolution reaction in acid electrolyte. The enhanced catalytic activities of the as-synthesized electrodes should also be attributed to such features as high population of hydroxyl groups and high Broensted acidity (due to presence of Ru or W oxo sites) and related fast electron transfers coupled to unimpeded proton displacements. The possibility of metal-metal interactions between nanosized metals (Co and Ru or Co and W) cannot be excluded For comparison, we also show that mixed-metal oxide nanocomposites combining the favorable catalytic properties of Co 3 O 4 and CeO 2 , nanocomposites (with different phase distribution and Co 3 O 4 loading) can modify the cobalt-oxo-species and enhance its intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction activity. Synthesis of Co 3 O 4 -modified CeO 2 , which was addressed through three different sol-gel based routes, each with 10.4 wt% Co 3 O 4 loading, yielded three different nanocomposite morphologies: CeO 2 -supported Co 3 O 4 layers, intermixed oxides, and homogeneously dispersed Co. It is reasonable to expect that the local bonding environment of Co 3 O 4 can be modified after the introduction of nanocrystalline CeO 2 , which allows the Co III species to be easily oxidized into catalytically active Co IV species, thus avoiding the undesirable surface reconstruction process. Here, ceria is likely to regulate the surface oxygen concentration, due to its oxygen buffer (storage/release) capacity, associated with the fast Ce IV /Ce III redox transition. Our research addresses the problems related to the fabrication of efficient earth-abundant catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction, and it provides strategies for designing more active and stable catalytic systems.

To enhance the catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at water electrolysis electrodes, it is imperative to eliminate the energy-consuming processes involved in multiple electron and proton transfer reactions. We propose employing a combination of machine-learning analysis of electrochemical activity and in-situ electrochemical Raman observation for the OER electrodes. The OER behavior can be categorized based on the contributions of Ni-OH and Ni-OOH, which serve as key OER intermediates. This information is utilized to elucidate the OER behavior through energetic and intermediate analyses. The presented study provides the direction for designing active OER catalysis in the future.

Water electrolysis emerges as a pivotal technology for hydrogen production in the quest for sustainable energy solutions, distinguished by its lack of carbon dioxide emissions. This study zeroes in on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical yet energy-intensive component of the electrolysis process. We study the effects of modulating the nickel-iron (NiFe) ratio in NiFe selenides, a leading non-precious metal catalyst for OER, on the reaction's efficiency. Our findings elucidate how variations in the NiFe ratio and electrochemical activation methods on nickel selenium (NiSe) significantly influence catalytic performance. We elucidate the performance variations in catalysts using in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These advanced analytical techniques have allowed us to uncover the pivotal role of selenium not only in increasing active surface area via its dissolution but also in enhancing the activity of catalysts for the OER.

The exact mechanism and surface coverage present on (photo)-catalysts used for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain elusive. Time-resolved in-operando spectroscopy on model single crystal surfaces has started to clarify these questions but requires strong first- principles theoretical support to facilitate the interpretation of the spectroscopic signatures. The trapping of photo-generated holes as polarons on adsorbs at the catalyst surface is a key step in the photo-driven OER. We model from first principles the optical signature of these hole polarons on OER intermediates (OH2, OH, O) on titanium-based photocatalysts (SrTiO3 and TiO2), and use our results to assign experimental absorptive peaks to hole trapping at specific adsorbates.

The development of a sustainable energy system relies on the production of green hydrogen. One of the major challenges for water splitting is the synthesis of platinum group metal-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Spinel nickel cobalt oxides (NCOs) have attracted particular interest due to their stable electrocatalytic performance. The less researched rock-salt NCOs, however, are also promising due to their ability to convert to the OER-active hydroxide phase 1 . Further development of NCO electrocatalysts requires fundamental understanding of their crystallographic structure-OER performance relationship. This work addresses ~20 nm atomic layer deposited (ALD) NCO thin film systems with a broad composition range to unravel the above-mentioned relationship. Our previously developed ALD supercycle process 2 based on Ni( Me Cp) 2 , CoCp 2 and O 2 plasma is employed to generate a full range of chemical compositions, such that the phase transition from Ni-rich rock-salt films to Co-rich films at ~55 at.% Co can be observed. Extensive material characterisation reveals that the phase transition is accompanied by an increase in the +3/+2 ratio of the oxidation state of both Ni and Co. Electrochemical analysis in 1M KOH shows an optimal performance for the 30 at.% Co rock-salt film after 500 CV cycles and a synergistic effect between cobalt and nickel such that NCO films are more OER active than Co 3 O 4 and NiO. The films show a composition-dependent activation during CV cycling, where a decrease in activation is observed for increasing Co at.%. No activation is observed for the spinel films. The activation is driven by bulk transformation to the active (oxy)hydroxide phase and is accompanied by an increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) up to a factor 8 for rock-salt films. The overpotential after cycling is corrected for the increase in ECSA using an original method, which reveals that Ni-rich spinel structure films are intrinsically more active 3 . The use of model systems in combination with extensive material characterisation and prolonged electrochemical testing allows us to distinguish two classes of NCO catalysts, the instantly active and highly stable Co-rich spinel films and the high surface area Ni-rich rock-salt phase which develops upon extensive activation . Placing these results in perspective, we conclude that application of these catalysts on high surface area 3D electrodes would benefit from the more intrinsically active spinel NCO films, whilst activated rock-salt films would be the preferred choice for thin film electrocatalysis studies. These results also show that rock-salt NCO films (<40 at.% Co) could be a more sustainable alternative to the more commonly used spinel NCO films. 1 Gebreslase et al. J.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction in several photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical reaction schemes. While iridium-based materials such as iridium dioxide are commonly used to catalyze the OER, contemporary findings indicate that iridium dioxide will undergo substantial corrosion during operation. A fundamental understanding of the degradation pathways during the OER is necessary to design materials that exhibit improved stability and enable the long-term operation of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical devices. The Moreno-Hernandez Laboratory utilizes liquid phase transmission electron microscopy techniques that enable nanoscale and near-atomic spatial resolution imaging in liquid environments during electrocatalyst operation. These techniques were used to probe the stability of iridium dioxide nanocrystals and observe electrocatalyst degradation at near-atomic resolution for individual nanocrystals, and at nanoscale resolution for nanocrystal ensembles. Our observations indicate several reaction pathways and nanocrystal properties that were previously underexplored could have a substantial impact on the macroscale performance of iridium-based materials.

Efficient seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production faces challenges like active site poisoning, chloride oxidation, and anode corrosion, necessitating the development of effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts [1] . Strategies such as enhancing OER kinetics, mitigating chloride oxidation, bolstering corrosion resistance, and integrating multifunctionality into electrocatalysts are being pursued. Researchers explore internal and external cultivation methods to optimize electrocatalyst properties while understanding structural evolution and OER mechanisms remains crucial. Seawater electrolysis, tapping into Earth's abundant seawater resources, offers a scalable solution for green hydrogen production, especially when paired with renewable energy sources [2] . It holds promise for providing energy and water to offshore areas and mobile maritime systems, crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. In this study, we have fabricated a PGM (platinum group metal) free anode that shows promising performance in alkaline seawater. The material consists of nanoclusters of FeNiS x . This study applied a polyol-assisted hydrothermal synthesis strategy to describe an advanced procedure for synthesising NiFeS x . Several physical and chemical characterisation tools are applied to investigate the anode electrode for alkaline seawater oxidation XRD, SEM, TEM and electrochemical characterisation. The outcomes of these characterisations were displayed as graphs. The catalysts reveal nanocluster morphologies. The figure below depicts the preliminary findings, illustrating the electrochemical performance and the physical characterisations. Figure 1 (a ) and (b) depict the morphological evaluation by electron microscopy revealing the nanostructure-based clusters of the produced materials with the scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. In. Polarisation curves of the oxygen evolution activity of the synthesised NiFeiS x electrocatalysts on Ni foam working electrodes, in a three-electrode configuration with Pt wire serving as the counter and Hg/HgO serving as the reference electrode in 0.1M KOH + 0.5 NaCl electrolyte. The best-performing catalysts obtained a high current exchange density close to 225 mAcm -2 shown in Figure 1(c) . In addition, we are evaluating the efficacy of this high-performance anode electrocatalyst in a single-cell electrolyser and the best and most stable catalyst will be tested in stacks we are developing with our partners in the ANEMEL project. Our research methodology encompasses a comprehensive array of ex-situ and in-situ characterization techniques to delve into the intricacies of seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production. We will utilize impedance spectroscopy to dissect electrochemical behaviour, including resistance, capacitance, and charge transfer resistance. Additionally, chronopotentiometry/chronoamperometry will assess the catalyst's long-term stability, while real-time examination of catalyst crystal structure during OER will be facilitated by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surface chemistry and elemental composition analysis will be conducted using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while in-situ Raman spectroscopy will offer insights into electronic structure changes during the reaction, shedding light on the OER mechanism. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy will unveil reaction intermediates and mechanisms, providing a detailed understanding of the reaction pathway. Post-mortem catalyst analysis post-electrochemical testing will evaluate degradation, ultimately aiding in optimizing catalyst design for long-term stability and high-performance OER.

Oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts in acid undergo structural changes that result in a loss of activity, which necessitates high catalyst loadings of precious noble metal oxides. A fundamental understanding of the structural dynamics at the electrode/electrolyte interface that occur during oxygen evolution is necessary to design the next generation of electrocatalyst materials with improved performance. The Moreno-Hernandez Laboratory utilizes liquid phase transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the stability of single-nanocrystalline and highly faceted metal oxide nanocrystals under anodic conditions in acidic electrolytes. Our studies reveal the distribution of stability relationships between different crystallographic facets for nanocrystalline materials, and enable the direct determination of nanoscale heterogeneity at the single nanocrystal level. Substantial stability differences are observed across multiple nanocrystals, which are correlated to variability in the nanoscale strain present in individual nanocrystals. These studies suggest that nanoscale heterogeneity occluded in conventional bulk-scale analysis techniques substantially influences stability under relevant operation conditions, and provide crucial information for the design of resilient electrocatalyst materials.

Carbon decomposition by molten salt electrolysis has been researched for achievement of carbon negative emissions. Carbonate ions, which are derived from carbon dioxides and oxide ion in the molten salts, are reduced into carbon and oxide ions are produced at cathodes. Oxygen gas is generated from the produced oxide ions at anodes. For realizing the electrochemical carbon decomposition process, development of inert anode is essential task. In the previous research, various materials of metal, cermet and metal oxide have been tested for inert anodes to obtain low corrosion rate and high current density in electrochemical oxygen evolution. Especially, conductive oxides are expected to have both of high electrical conductivity and high corrosion resistance to produced oxygen. In this study, we report the characteristics of Co-based oxide anodes for oxygen evolution in chloride melts. Co 3 O 4 is one of the representative conductive oxides, which have conduction characteristic. In the experiments of molten chloride containing oxide ions at a temperature over 600℃, the cyclic voltammograms with a prepared Co 3 O 4 anode were measured. The results show drastically increases of current density at 2.9 V vs Ca(Ⅱ)/Ca, which was approximately same to the oxygen evolution potential estimated from thermodynamic calculations. The corrosion behaviors of Co-based anodes will be discussed from the results of long-time electrochemical operation and chemical analysis using XRD, SEM, EDs, and ICP-AES analysis.

The advancement of water electrolysis technology has seemingly plateaued. Further advances require new strategies to address the key limitations of the oxygen evolution reaction: high overpotential and low stability of electrode materials. Herein, we designed a nanoporous Ir 3 Co-core@IrO 2 -shell electrocatalyst with 5 and 3 times higher mass activity and 6 and 2 times higher activity–stability factors than conventional IrO 2 nanoparticles and Ir nanoporous electrocatalysts, respectively. The origin of the performance enhancement in the Ir 3 Co-core@IrO 2 -shell electrocatalyst was revealed in computational density functional theory calculations. The residual Co after the dealloying process resulted in a down-shift of the d -band center position, thus weakening the −OH* adsorption energy. In addition, the electronic conductivity was enhanced by the three-dimensionally interconnected structure. Under high-current-density operating conditions, the Ohmic losses were reduced by the ultrafast charge transfer pathway provided by the metallic IrCo core.

Direct seawater electrolysis is a promising approach to producing green hydrogen in water-scarce environments using renewable energy. However, the undesirable chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and hypochlorite evolution reaction (HCER) compete with the desired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode electrocatalyst. This issue is most pronounced in unbuffered pH neutral solutions due to local acidification resulting from the OER. To overcome this challenge, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the use of silicon oxide (SiO x ) and titanium oxide (TiO x ) nanoscale overlayers coated on metallic ruthenium (Ru) and ruthenium oxide (RuO x ) thin film electrodes and their ability to block chloride ions from reaching active sites during operation in unbuffered 0.6 M NaCl electrolyte. Using a combination of (electro)analytical techniques, encapsulated RuO x anodes are shown to effectively suppress Cl - transport to buried catalyst active sites while allowing for the desired OER to occur, leading to increases in OER faradaic efficiency at moderate overpotentials. Evidence for the ability of SiO x overlayers to block Cl - ions from reaching the active buried interface was obtained by monitoring the OH stretching mode of OH adsorbates using in situ Raman spectroscopy. This study also reports trade-offs between the activity, selectivity, and stability of bare and encapsulated Ru and RuO x electrocatalysts, finding that the magnitude of these trade-offs strongly depends on the complex interplay between electrode architecture, material properties, and catalytic performance, especially in unbuffered pH neutral seawater.

A conventional performance metric for electrocatalysts that promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the current density at a given overpotential. However, the assumption that increased current density at lower overpotentials indicates superior catalyst design is precarious for OER catalysts in the working environment, as the crystalline lattice is prone to deconstruction and amorphization, thus greatly increasing the concentration of catalytic active sites. We show this to be the case for La3+ incorporation into Co3O4. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) reveal smaller domain sizes with decreased long-range order and increased amorphization for La-modified Co3O4. This lattice deconstruction is exacerbated under the conditions of OER as indicated by operando spectroscopies. The overpotential for OER decreases with increasing La3+ concentration, with maximum activity achieved at 17% La incorporation. HRTEM images and electron diffraction patterns clearly show the formation of an amorphous overlayer during OER catalysis that is accelerated with La3+ addition. O 1s XPS spectra after OER show the loss of lattice-oxide and an increase in peak intensities associated with hydroxylated or defective O-atom environments, consistent with Co(O)x(OH)y species in an amorphous overlayer. Our results suggest that improved catalytic activity of oxides incorporated with La3+ ions (and likely other metal ions) is due to an increase in the number of terminal octahedral Co(O)x(OH)y edge sites upon Co3O4 lattice deconstruction, rather than enhanced intrinsic catalysis.

Abstract The cooperation between metal single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) within an electrocatalyst has showcased enormous potential in 2e − oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production. Nevertheless, developing an SA‐AC catalyst with the synergy of optimized functional groups to afford advanced catalytic capability has been challenging. Herein, a new and highly effective catalyst with tandem cobalt SA‐AC moieties and C─O─C functional group decorations anchored over carbon nanotubes is presented, which is denoted as Co SA‐AC(C─O─C). As an electrocatalyst, Co SA‐AC(C─O─C) demonstrates favorable activity, selectivity, and stability for 2e − ORR, delivering an onset potential of 0.72 V (vs RHE) and an H 2 O 2 selectivity of 97.6% in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 . In a flow‐cell reactor, the Co SA‐AC(C─O─C) realizes an H 2 O 2 production rate of 3.88 mol g cat −1 h −1 at 300 mA cm −2 targeting on‐site pollutant treatment by integrating a Fenton‐like process. The theoretical computations guide the selection of C─O─C among the functional group decorations and reveal the actual active sites to locate at Co SAs, while the synergistic effect of Co ACs and C─O─C groups helps optimize the * OOH binding and modulate the electronic structure.

Abstract Low‐cost, high‐performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for water electrolysis. Herein, the synthesis of low‐cost Fe/P‐CoO 2 amorphous catalyst is reported, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in 1 m KOH. Assembled Pt/C||Co 0.75 Fe 0.25 P/MWCNTs system affords a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at a cell voltage of only 1.53 V, which is much better than that of the benchmark Pt/C||RuO 2 system (1.62 V). Such performance lies ointhe electronic mediation of active sites with asymmetric Co‐ and Fe‐coordination structures with different d‐band occupancy. The combination of Fe‐cationic and P‐anionic coordination effectively optimizes the adsorption of OER intermediates (OH * , O * ), promoting direct O * ─O * coupling and avoiding the formation of unstable OOH * intermediate. Benefiting from these advantages, Co 0.75 Fe 0.25 P/MWCNTs demonstrate excellent OER activity and stability, surpassing the benchmark RuO 2 . The proposed strategy presents a novel approach for the synthesis of cost‐effective, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for alkaline OER.

There is a growing evidence suggesting that design principles in various fields, particularly in electrochemistry, should encompass considerations of both activity and stability. Achieving high activity alongside stability is important, yet many studies still treat these aspects as separate objectives. To overcome this limitation, establishing functional links between activity and stability based on underlying reaction mechanisms is essential. Through in situ (operando) analysis, this study aims to elucidate the interplay between activity and stability, particularly in the context of the oxygen evolution reaction, utilizing real-time mass spectrometry. By conducting comprehensive investigations, we can unveil the intricate relationships between stability and activity in electrochemical environments, thus paving the way for the design of new materials that exhibit both heightened activity and robust stability.

Theoretical studies have revealed the kinetics of oxygen evolution are controlled by the binding energies of reaction intermediates. However, those simulations are based on idealised single crystal structures. Little is known about the catalytically active phases on high surface area catalysts. In this contribution I will show how operando optical spectroscopy of oxygen evolution catalysts can yield (i) site densities (ii) binding energies of intermediates and (iii) turnover frequencies. We reveal the role of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on state-of-the-art iridium2-4 and cobalt5 based catalysts, including molecular catalysts and oxides. I will correlate electrochemical measurements to operando optical spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry. Density functional theory measurements provide a molecular scale explanation for the observed phenomena. Man, I. C., Su, H. Y., Calle-Vallejo, F., Hansen, H. A., Martínez, J. I., Inoglu, N.

Renewable hydrogen generation using the low-temperature proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) represents a crucial technology for achieving global zero-carbon emissions. Iridium oxide (IrO x ) stands out as a primary platinum group metal catalyst for the anode in electrochemical water splitting due to a balance in activity and stability in acidic environments. 1 However, the anode catalyst performance is still predominately hampered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the Pt cathode. 2 Therefore,understanding the factors influencing the OER kinetics of Ir-based catalysts is essential for developing strategies to achieve high OER activity in the PEMWE anode electrocatalysts. This presentation will delve into our investigation of how the perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) binder affects the anode catalyst OER behaviors, specifically the corresponding kinetics and activity of two commercial Ir-based OER catalysts, IrO x from Alfa Aesar and TiO 2 -decorated IrO x (IrTiO x ) from Umicore, as a function of the PFSA ionomer-to-catalyst (I/C) ratio. We combined the cavity microelectrode (CME) technique, which offers a direct approach to study OER kinetics without the ionomer, 3 with the rotating disc electrode (RDE) technique, which allows to assess the impact of PFSA on OER kinetics and activity at varied I/C ratios in an acidic electrolyte. The study provided valuable insights into ionomer dependent OER mechanisms, elucidating the intricate interactions among the ionomer, catalyst, and reaction intermediates.

For many decades, fossil fuels, including gas, oil, and coal, have acted as the primary contributors to electricity generation [1]. Nevertheless, the combustion of carbon-based fuels causes substantial emissions of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), thereby precipitating climate change and adversely affecting human well-being and the environment [2]. Consequently, there is an endeavour to innovate and develop efficient and environmentally acceptable energy sources. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a pivotal half-reaction within diverse renewable energy technologies. Despite its significance, the OER is intrinsically sluggish and energy-intensive, necessitating the advancement of electrocatalysts that are both efficient and stable to facilitate this reaction [3]. In recent years, layered double hydroxides (LDH) have emerged as potential candidates for OERs due to their cost-effectiveness, versatile composition, and favourable electrocatalytic properties [4]. Ni-based LDHs, particularly NiFe-LDH, have been extensively investigated and proven to be effective OER electrocatalysts in alkaline environments [5]. However, its limited electrical conductivity hinders further enhancement of its OER catalytic activity. Meanwhile, Co-based LDHs, such as NiCo-LDH and CoFe-LDH have been proven to have excellent electrocatalytic activity [6]. In contrast to binary LDHs, the ternary LDHs, incorporating diverse transition elements can exhibit higher capacitance and contain more abundant active sites [7]. However, the utilization of LDH electrode materials is limited by their low conductivity and tendency for agglomeration. Graphene serves as an excellent substrate for catalyst immobilisation in electrocatalysis, owing to its superior electrical conductivity, high surface areas, and impressive stability [8]. Therefore, the combination of ternary LDHs, characterised by reversible redox activity, and conductive graphene is expected to represent an efficient approach for fabricating hybrid materials with enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, facilitated by the advantageous interplay between LDHs and graphene. Accordingly, in this study, trimetallic CoNiFe-LDHs were designed and grown on graphene (G) through a one-step hydrothermal approach to obtain a structure that promotes efficient charge transfer, optimizing the OER kinetics. A 2-level full-factorial model was used to determine the effect of Co (1.5, 3 and 4.5 mmol) and graphene (10, 30 and 50 mg) concentrations on the OER onset potential, which was the chosen response parameter. The independent and dependent variables were fitted to the linear model equation, using ANOVA analysis. The F-values, the ratio of noise to response, confirmed that the model is significant (p<0.05). The p-values less than 0.05 indicate the model terms, such as cobalt and graphene concentrations and their interaction, are significant, implying that the OER onset potential is strongly correlated to these parameters. The polarization curves of CoNiFe-LDH/G composites for OER are shown in Figure 1. The OER was run in triplicate using the Co 3 Ni 3 Fe 3 -LDH/G 30 (central point) to estimate the variability (0.58%). The comparison study showed that a low onset potential (1.54 V) and overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 (1.58 V) was achieved for Co 1.5 Ni 3 Fe 3 -LDH/G 10 , demonstrating that a low concentration of cobalt and graphene could make for an ideal electrocatalyst in practical applications.

Introduction Water splitting is a key to producing hydrogen with renewable electricity. The reaction consists of two reactions: hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the sluggish reaction kinetics of OER limits the overall energy efficiency 1) . Although the OER activity was continuously improved, mainly by optimizing the binding ability between reactants and the catalysts, the current strategy is reaching its limits. Recently, it has been reported that the hydrogen bond network of water molecules around the catalyst surface influences OER activity, and Lewis acidic metal cations in electrolytes can be used to tune its structures 2) . However, the contribution of cations to the OER activity is not noticeably manifested since the cation existence ratio is orders of magnitude lower than that of water molecules. Here, we focused on layered manganese oxide (MnO 2 ) 3) , which can trap metal complexes, water molecules, and cations within its nanolayer, as an OER catalyst. We synthesized the MnO 2 catalysts having Ni 2+ complex (for OER active site) and non-catalytic Li + , K + , and Cs + (for tuning the hydrogen bond network of confined water) co-inserted into the nanolayer. The effect of the hydrogen bond network on the OER activity was clarified by utilizing the nanosized interlayer space of layered MnO 2 as a tunable electrochemical reaction field. Methods The layered MnO 2 was electrodeposited on an FTO substrate using a solution containing manganese sulfate (MnSO 4 ) and a guest cation (TBA + Cl - ). Subsequently, the electrodeposited samples were immersed in various ion exchange solutions to synthesize target catalysts (Ni, Ni-Li, Ni-K, Ni-Cs/MnO 2 ). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to estimate the interlayer distances between the crystal phases of samples. The electronic states of Ni active sites were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed using three-electrode cells in 0.1 M TBAOH at a scan rate of 10 mV s – 1 to evaluate the OER activity. Results and discussion The XRD patterns showed the equally spaced peaks for each sample, confirming the layered structure for all synthesized catalysts (Fig.1a). Furthermore, the calculated interlayer distances matched with the hydration radius of expected interlayer cations, suggesting the successful insertion of the target cations. Ni2p peaks from XPS spectra showed the same peak positions throughout the samples, indicating a negligible change in the electronic states of Ni (Fig. 1b). The OER activity changed markedly depending on the non-catalytic alkaline cations, and the OER activity was in the order of Cs + < K + < Li + (Fig.1c). The observed trend was opposite to the activity of Ni disk electrodes in alkaline-cation electrolytes (LiOH < KOH < CsOH) (Fig.1d). The results suggest that alkaline cations differently modulate the hydrogen-bond network in the bulk electrolyte and inside the nanosized interlayer space, thus leading to different OER activity. We will also discuss the correlation between the hydrogen-bond network structure around the Ni 2+ complex and OER activity by probing the behavior of confined water within the interlayer with operando surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy (SEIRAS).

Significant progress is currently being made in understanding the behavior of copper oxide (CuO) at positive potentials, approximately 1.7 V, under electrochemical conditions. While it is assumed to be hydrated Cu 2 O 3 at this potential with ∆G = 208.5 kJ/mol, this hypothesis awaits validation. However, our calculations show that bulk CuOOH has ∆G ~209.5 kJ/mol, indicating Cu +3 possibly in the form of bulk CuOOH. To verify this, we employ a combination of density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations and simulated Raman spectra. This approach allows us to examine the electrocatalytic activity of CuOOH polymorphs, including Cmc21 (β-CuOOH), Pmn21 (γ-CuOOH), and C2/m (δ-CuOOH), for the OER at this potential. Our calculations indicate a presence of stable square planar, non-magnetic γ/δ-CuOOH phase, and the calculated volume Pourbaix diagram highlights γ/δ-CuOOH as the newly discovered active phase governing the OER in alkaline media. This finding is further supported by simulated Raman spectroscopy, revealing distinct features corresponding to Cu 3+ species at 552 and 573 cm -1 , closely matching experimental data peak at 587 cm -1 only present under highly oxidizing conditions. Next, we compare the theoretical overpotentials of all CuOOH surfaces with O and OH-vacancy at the bridge site as the active site, and the surface-adsorbed OH* on a CuO surface. We find that the (021) surface of CuOOH and the (002) surface of CuOOH are the most active, characterized by an overpotential ranging from 0.36V to 0.50 V. Lastly, we demonstrate that the overpotential of the CuOOH (021) surface can be improved further by surface substitution of Cu by Fe. This finding could explain the experimentally observed enhancement in the OER activity of Fe y Cu 1−y OOH thin films with increasing Fe content. This work expands our knowledge in understanding the active phases governing OER in alkaline media but also paves the way for the development of more efficient electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.

Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is a semiconductor that has been extensively studied for its thermo and photo catalytic properties due to its high stability, abundant oxygen vacancies and low price. In electrochemistry, titanium dioxide has been used as support for anode catalysts in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE). The electrolysis of water into oxygen and hydrogen is kinetically limited by the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) occurring at the positive electrode with a four-electron transfer. The noble metal oxides of Ruthenium and Iridium are currently considered the best electrocatalysts for OER due to their high activity and relatively high IrO 2 stability [1]. The high price and scarcity of these precious catalysts prompt a strong interest in minimizing their loading [2]. The use of an electronically conductive support allows to decrease the loading by increasing the surface to volume ratio of precious metal particles. Titania is highly stable at the high potentials used during the OER and can be made conductive using some transition metals as dopants [3]. TiO 2 exists in nature in three crystalline forms: rutile, anatase, and brookite but because iridium oxide is used for OER in its rutile phase, and to promote epitaxial growth, this work uses the doped-TiO 2 rutile phase as a support for Iridium oxide catalysts. New synthetic routes based on sol-gel process are used to form (Ru, Nb, Ta)-TiO 2 nanoparticles. The size, shape and crystalline structure of the support was controlled by tuning calcination temperature and the Ti precursor. The doped rutile TiO 2 particles synthesized consist of an ideal support for iridium oxide nanoparticles deposited by wet impregnation in different loading and phase. The epitaxial growth from rutile TiO 2 to rutile IrO x promotes the catalyst support interaction and electrical conductivity. All the catalysts were characterized by their physico-chemical and electrochemical properties towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The surface morphology and crystallinity of these materials was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The activity toward oxygen evolution reaction was investigated in liquid electrolyte in a 3-electrode set-up. [1] Alia, S. M.; Rasimick, B.; Ngo, C.; Neyerlin, K. C.; Kocha, S.

Exploring efficient nonpyrolysis conductive metal organic frameworks with high intrinsic reactivity is critical for their application in the electrocatalytic field. Herein, we present electronically conductive π-d-conjugated Co and Fe bimetallic MOF-CoFe-hexahydroxytriphenylene (CoFe-HHTP) nanorods with atomically dispersed Co–O6 and Fe–O6 sites for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The introduction of Fe not only increases the electronic conductivity of Co-HHTP with an order of magnitude favoring the electronic transfer during OER catalysis but also tailors the electronic structure of Co, leading to a downshift of Co d-band center that weakens the adsorption of oxygen intermediates on Co sites. As a result, the as-prepared CoFe-HHTP exhibits a significantly improved OER activity showing a lower overpotential (316 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 in an alkaline electrolyte compared with pure Co-HHTP (370 mV), outperforming commercial RuO2 (329 mV). CoFe-HHTP also displays a superior electrochemical durability with only a slight change of potential after a 200 h test at 10 mA cm–2, outperforming pure Co-HHTP (140 h). The improved durability was due to the hindered dissolution of Co by suppressing structural transformation in the presence of Fe in the alkaline electrolyte. When CoFe-HHTP was used as the anode catalyst, a superior alkaline electrolyzer performance was obtained with a cell voltage of 1.821 V at 500 mA cm–2 and a stable operation of 50 h. This methodology offers insights into the design and synthesis of conductive MOF-based catalysts for efficient OER catalysis.

The technology of seawater splitting driven by renewable energy potentially produces green and inexpensive hydrogen by simplifying the complex process lines and saves scarce sources of safe and fresh water. Chloride ions (Cl − ), a dominant impurity in seawater, is reported to corrode the earth-abundant Ni-based oxygen evolution anode materials in both non-extreme and alkaline pH mediums, resulting in the short operation time. [1,2] Thus, engineering of the reaction field mainly consisting of the electrodes and electrolytes is a recent issue to achieve the prolonged operation time. In this study, we used one of the most active electrodes of NiFeO x /Ni foam (NF) and newly introduced the phosphate ions into the potassium borate electrolyte (K-borate) at pH 9.2. Added phosphate dynamically and selectively formed passivation layer with Ni, preventing corrosion from Cl − and leaching of Ni, which led to longer operation time. [3] Firstly, the redox behavior of NiFe hydroxides (NiFeO x )/NF was investigated using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1.0 mol kg −1 K-borate buffer solution with 0.5 mol kg −1 KCl at pH 9.2 ( Figure 1 ). The electrode was corroded with the formation of green solid Ni(OH) x . In contrast, when the phosphate at 1.0 mol kg −1 was added to the system, the corrosion current was not observed. In addition, the chronopotentiometry testing was conducted at the commercially relevant current density of 500 mA cm −2 at 353 K in K-borate and K-borate/phosphate electrolytes, both of which contained KCl. The rapid corrosion within 10 min happened only in K-borate electrolytes. However, the potential was stable at 1.68 V vs. RHE in phosphate-containing electrolytes for 10 h. These results highlight the advantages of mixing the phosphate into the borate electrolytes. A previous study proposed that the adsorbed phosphate works as a charge repulsion layer in alkaline mediums [2] In the following sections, the role of phosphate is clarified by using spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis. CVs were recorded in both K-borate and K-borate/phosphate electrolytes. In the latter electrolyte, the reduction peak of Ni shifted to more positive than that in pure K-borate. This potential shift was also observed in a single K-phosphate electrolyte. Ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) testing over the sample tested in phosphate-containing electrolyte shows a lower area ratio of Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ than that tested in K-borate. In addition, operando X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra depict the lower Ni absorption edge in the presence of phosphate additive than that in the K-borate electrolyte. In contrast, the spectra of Fe K-edge did not shift under various conditions. These electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis insist on the selective interaction between Ni 2+ and phosphate additive. The stability testing was conducted at 50 mA cm −2 and 298 K. The potential increased as time passed in 24 h in K-borate electrolyte, but it was not the case for the phosphate-containing electrolyte. The dissolution amount of Ni in K-borate was 3 times higher than that in the presence of phosphate after the testing, suggesting that the stabilization of Ni 2+ by phosphate led to a longer operation. The potential profile and dissolution amount of Ni in the presence of Cl − was similar to without Cl − condition in K-borate/phosphate electrolyte, highlighting that the stabilized Ni was highly tolerant toward the Cl − . The charge repulsion effect is discussed by using the redox probes of other halide ions (Br − and I − ). The CVs were recorded in K-borate and K-borate/phosphate with 0.5 mol kg −1 KBr and KI. In K-borate electrolyte, the corrosion current was observed, which disappears by phosphate addition. In contrast, the Faradaic efficiency of O 2 (FEO 2 ) at 50 mA cm −2 was close to zero in the presence of both Br − and I − . The two oxidation potentials are 1.31 and 1.59 V RHE which are lower than the onset potential of OER, which would trigger the halide ion oxidation. Given that halide ions were found to react on the surface, the charge repulsion layer did not form on the surface at the present pH level. This is contrary to the previous reports in alkaline mediums, highlighting the uniqueness of non-extreme pH conditions where the phosphate works as a stabilizer toward NiFeO x /NF. This study shows that a concerted design of the electrocatalyst and electrolyte can introduce unique functions. Reference [1] H. Komiya, T. Shinagawa, K. Takanabe, ChemSusChem 2022 , 15 , e202201088.

Abstract In the pursuit of sustainable energy, the efficient production of green hydrogen through electrochemical water splitting has emerged as a promising strategy. 1 Central to this process is the optimization of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), where the necessity for a high overpotential at the anodic electrode poses a significant barrier. Among the myriad of catalysts studied, iridium oxides (IrOx) have garnered attention for their superior catalytic activity and stability in acidic environments. 2 Yet, the quest for unlocking the full potential of IrOx catalysts necessitates a deeper dive into their operational mechanisms under OER conditions, a challenge that traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methodologies have struggled to meet due to their limited representation of the dynamic electrochemical environment intrinsic to OER catalysis. 3 Addressing these challenges, our research introduces a novel approach by integrating constant Fermi-level ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with slow-growth kinetic analysis. This methodological innovation captures the complex electrochemical environment of OER catalysis, unveiling reaction pathways and energy barriers with close to actual electrochemical reaction. Through this approach, we explore the impact of the oxygen 2p orbital, Ir–O bond strength, and proton affinity on the Lattice Oxygen Mechanism (LOM) and Adsorbate Evolution Mechanism (AEM), establishing new paradigms for catalyst evaluation and design. A focal point of our study is the detailed analysis of the elemental phases of LOM and AEM, which provides a granular understanding of the catalytic actions within these mechanisms. In the case of LOM, our focus is on the dynamics and electronic state of lattice oxygen, which play pivotal roles in defining the energy barriers distinct to each elemental phase. This analysis identifies the electronic structure of lattice oxygen and the robustness of Ir–O bonds as key determinants of LOM activity. Similarly, the phase of AEM process is characterized by the sequential proton transfer of water molecules and surface proton, highlighting the importance of the structural arrangement of surface hydrogen and the proton affinity of lattice oxygen in determining AEM activation stages. Subsequent to the mechanism phase analysis, we present the validation of our theoretical insights through the suggestion and evaluation of E–IrTaO 2 , a lattice-elongated Ir-Ta bimetallic oxide catalyst designed to enhance LOM selectivity. The design of E–IrTaO 2 is informed by kinetic analysis, with its activity evaluation underpinned by kinetic results that consider the thermodynamic energy diagram, including pathways through metastable states. This departure from conventional DFT methodologies signals a paradigm shift towards a kinetic-driven approach, crucial for unraveling the intricate behaviors of IrOx in OER processes and laying the groundwork for the development of sophisticated catalysts. This study not only provides an in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanisms in OER processes but also introduces a programmable strategy for catalyst design, paving the way for the rational development of high-performance OER catalysts.

Copper is presently the material of choice for hydrogenation reactions converting CO 2 or CO to hydrocarbons and oxygenates although the identity and role of adsorbed reaction intermediates remains unresolved and understudied. Accordingly, the interactions between C, O, H, and molecules comprised thereof, with different Cu surfaces, defects and applied potentials are of substantial interest. This talk will focus on the dynamic interplay between surface hydride formation, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Cu(111) in perchloric acid electrolyte using electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS). Voltammetric EC-MS unveils a two-stage process for surface hydride formation, with recombination to H 2 occurring at specific potentials. Controlled introduction of O 2 into the cell does not disrupt hydride coverage, while its recombination potential correlates with the transition from mass-transport-limited ORR kinetics to mixed control ORR kinetics. Concurrent ORR accelerates steady-state HER onset, with a sharp increase in transient H 2 production upon potential stepping. Furthermore, convolved voltammetric waves suggest surface restructuring due to O 2 exposure post-ORR. These findings elucidate the complex interactions between surface species and electrochemical behavior, shedding light on Cu's catalytic selectivity and the impact of O 2 on its electrochemical properties.

Porphyry-skarn deposits contain significant copper (Cu)-gold (Au) resources that combine the characteristics of both porphyry and skarn systems. The connections between porphyry-type and skarn-type ore in intracontinental porphyry-skarn Cu-Au systems, and whether meteoric water influences porphyry and skarn alteration and ore formation, are not well understood. Dongguashan, eastern China, was selected as a representative porphyry-skarn Cu-Au deposit for this study. We present in situ textural, compositional, and oxygen isotope variations of magmatic and hydrothermal apatite to elucidate the ore-forming processes and to establish a comprehensive ore system for porphyry-skarn Cu mineralization. Magmatic apatite is common in intrusions, and hydrothermal apatite is widespread in porphyry and skarn alteration zones. Hydrothermal apatite can be recognized by its distinctive internal cathodoluminescence texture and its association with hydrothermal minerals (K-feldspar, biotite, muscovite, epidote, skarn minerals, and sulfide), and all apatites studied at Dongguashan are fluorapatite. The in situ oxygen isotopes of hydrothermal apatite indicate that the ore-forming fluids involved in both porphyry and skarn mineralization were dominantly magmatic in origin, with only minor amounts of meteoric water (∼14% ± 10%) present during propylitic alteration (δ18O of 3.85‰−8.19‰). Similar apatite compositions present in the potassic alteration and prograde skarn suggest that the early magmatic-hydrothermal fluid was enriched in volatile (F, Cl, and S) and metallic (rare earth elements, Mn, Fe, and Na) elements. The Cl contents in the parental fluids show a systematic decrease from the early exsolved magmatic-hydrothermal fluid (0.83−4.18 wt%) to the later hydrothermal fluids (0.06 ± 0.03 wt%) associated with potassic alteration and prograde skarn, which suggests the occurrence of early-phase separation. The negative Eu anomaly of apatite from the porphyry alteration zone indicates oxidized conditions, but changes in the Eu anomaly in apatite from the prograde skarn (negative) to the early skarn sulfide stage (positive) reflect a shift to increasingly reducing conditions. The elevated S, REE, Mn, Fe, and Na concentrations in apatite in the late skarn sulfide stage probably resulted from the injection of a late magmatic-hydrothermal pulse, and the presence of oscillatory cathodoluminescence rims reflects fluctuating fluid compositions. Our results indicate that prograde skarn can be formed contemporaneously with potassic alteration, whereas the late phyllic stage does not correspond to the retrograde skarn stage. The ore-forming process in the skarn was more complex than in the porphyry stage, and developed from multiple magmatic-hydrothermal pulses. We emphasize that meteoric water was not a significant component of the porphyry-skarn Cu system, with pulses of magmatic fluids being the dominant contributors to both porphyry ore and hydrous skarn ore formation. Detailed textural observations, combined with in situ isotope and chemical analyses of apatite, can provide high-resolution data about multiple hydrothermal overprinting processes in porphyry-skarn Cu systems worldwide. The occurrences of stratabound, skarn, and porphyry ore in eastern China highlight the potential for porphyry Cu exploration beneath stratabound skarn or skarn Cu deposits globally.

The lattice oxygen involvement in the oxygen evolution reaction provides an efficient reaction pathway. However, the structural and electrochemical stabilities are crucial to activate lattice oxygen while minimizing material deformations and ion elution. Herein, a heterostructure Bi/BiCeOOH containing abundant under-coordinated oxygen atoms is prepared by an electrochemical deposition method. The reduction potential difference between Bi and Ce generates partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under-coordinated oxygen atoms in BiCeOOH. The lattice oxygen is activated and stabilized when the metal–oxygen covalency increases, and the oxophilic Ce maintains the Bi nanoparticles with surrounding under-coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over-oxidation of Bi during the oxygen evolution reaction. Bi/BiCeOOH-based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V and long-term stability with only a 2.2% voltage increase for 100 h at a high practical current density of 1.0 A cm −2 .

To achieve Net-Zero Emissions by 2050, hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells will play a significant role in powering vehicles. In this talk, I will show, through first-principles-based modeling, how to achieve rigorous modeling and a fundamental understanding of the solid-solid interface for the oxygen reduction reaction in hydrogen fuel cells and the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in water electrolysis. I will further show how the fundamental understanding paves the way toward developing both model and industrial electrocatalysts with significantly improved performance. Specifically, I will introduce the following three topics.

Unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) offer a cost-effective solution for energy conversion by functioning as both fuel cells and electrolyzers. Anion-exchange membrane-based URFCs (AEM-URFCs) require bifunctional electrocatalysts, such as Pt–Ir alloys, for the oxygen evolution reaction (water electrolysis mode) and oxygen reduction reaction (fuel cell mode). However, the low stability of Pt in alkaline media and high cost of Ir remain challenges for the widespread application of these URFCs. In this study, a Pt–Ni octahedral alloy is synthesized to replace Ir with Ni as the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst. The alloying effect of Pt–Ni inhibited the dissolution of Pt and transformed PtO x to metallic Pt via a recovery process, thereby providing a new operational strategy for improving the durability of AEM-URFCs. Remarkably, the performance of the AEM-URFC single cell is maintained over 10 cycles after the recovery process, demonstrating the viability of this approach for long-term operations. These findings will pave the way for broader applications and advancements of AEM-URFCs. Figure 1

Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier that holds the potential to power future transportation. 1 One way to generate green hydrogen is proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis with renewable electricity, but this process is limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). 2, 3 Iridium (Ir) catalysts have balanced activity and durability for OER. 4, 5 However, due to the scarcity and high cost, the structures of the Ir catalysts must be properly controlled to improve the catalyst performance and reduce Ir loading. 6, 7 Currently, most Ir catalysts are nanoparticles without well-defined crystal facets, and it remains largely unknown what Ir surface structure is the most effective for OER. 4 Here, we present the facet-selective growth of Ir catalysts by using various shape-controlled seeds. These shape-controlled Ir catalysts exhibit high Ir atom usage efficiency due to the formation of only a few atomic layers of Ir shells. The activity and durability of these shape-controlled Ir catalysts towards OER are evaluated by rotating disk electrode measurements and tested in a PEM electrolyzer. This work demonstrates the possibility to further improve Ir catalyst performance by precise control over the arrangements of catalyst surface atoms.

The electrocatalysts were synthesized by using co-precipitation technique, further synthesized electrocatalysts were in-situ characterized in X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transition electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and ex-situ characterized in linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), chronopotentiometry, and impedance studies. Further, Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) was fabricated, assembled, and tested in a single-cell anion exchange membrane saline water electrolyzer.

Acid-stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst is paramount for practical proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. Owing to the sluggish diffusion kinetics, the nonprecious high entropy materials that comprise more than five principle elements are considered promising candidates to alternate the noble metals by overcoming oxidative elution in acidic media. Herein, nonprecious high entropy material consisting of Co, Fe, Ni, Mo, and W has been prepared by electrochemical deposition and following Te-mediated glassification for acidic oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. The hybrid approach of electrochemical deposition combined with glassification enables porous nanosheet morphology with expanded surface area and increased valence states of metal cations, outperforming the non-glassified high entropy material (CoFeNiMoW). The glassified CoFeNiMoWTe exhibits a lower cell voltage of 1.81 mV than the CoFeNiMoW (1.87 V) and a low voltage increase of 30 mV for 100 h at the current density of 1 A cm -2 in the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.

In our pursuit of carbon neutrality, we have focused on advancing the efficiency of green hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting. This process typically necessitates lowering the activation energy of the evolution reaction to optimize energy conversion. To enhance this, we have innovatively utilized two-dimensional (2D) materials to construct heterojunction structures that effectively facilitate charge transfer, a key aspect often overlooked in catalyst development. Specifically, we have synthesized a novel heterogeneous thin-film electrode by depositing p-type black phosphorus and n-type molybdenum disulfide nanosheets in a layered arrangement, thereby forming a large-area p-n junction directly within the film. This structure not only significantly reduces the overpotential but also achieves a higher reaction rate and superior stability in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The strategic configuration of the 2D nanosheets in a film format ensures an efficient charge pathway, markedly enhancing the long-term stability of the catalytic process, even when combined with commercial catalysts such as Pt for hydrogen evolution and Ir for oxygen evolution. Through this method, we demonstrate a robust, scalable approach to improving catalytic performance and energy efficiency in hydrogen production systems.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves a four-electron transfer and slow kinetics, requires an efficient catalyst to overcome the high energy barrier for high-performance water electrolysis. In this paper, a novel Ni3S2@V-NiFe(III) LDH/NF catalyst was prepared via a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The constructed heterostructure of Ni3S2@V-NiFe(III) LDH increases the specific surface area and regulates the electronic structure. Furthermore, the introduction of the V element forms an electron transport chain of Ni-O-Fe-O-V-O-Ni, which optimizes the binding energy between metal active sites and oxygen evolution reaction intermediates, accelerates electron transfer, and improves self-reconstruction. With this dual regulation strategy, Ni3S2@V-NiFe(III) LDH/NF exhibits exceptional OER performance with an overpotential of 280 mV at 100 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 45.4 mV/dec. This work develops a dual regulation strategy combining heterostructure formation and the doping effect, which are beneficial in the design of efficient OER catalysts.

Based on the observation of bubble generation induced by hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, the catalytic activity of the structured electrodes was characterized, suggesting the contribution of molecule polaritons to enhancing water reduction and oxidation, respectively. The potential application of this approach is discussed for photoelectrochemistry under dark conditions.

Photoelectrochemistry is used to develop solar energy technologies for fuel production and chemical transformations. Semiconductor materials such as TiO 2 , WO 3 , BiVO 4 , Fe 2 O 3 , and Cu 2 O are often investigated in devices designed to convert light energy into chemical energy, including for the production of hydrogen by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The oxide electrodes are of significant interest due to their potential for efficient PEC reactions with high durability and their relatively low costs compared to other semiconductor materials. This presentation provides an overview of recent advancements in gas-fed PEC systems specifically designed for utilizing water vapor as a hydrogen resource. The gas-fed PEC system utilizes a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as a solid polymer electrolyte. Additionally, it utilizes gas-diffusion photoelectrodes composed of a fibrous conductive substrate with macroporous structures and semiconductor oxide particles. Herein, the porous photoelectrodes are composed of n-type oxides for oxygen evolution reactions and used with a Pt electrocatalyst cathode for hydrogen evolution reactions. The topics covered include the conceptual framework of vapor-fed PEC hydrogen production, the strategic design of gas-phase PEC reaction interfaces, and the development of porous photoanodes for an oxygen evolution reaction. A significant enhancement in the PEC efficiency was achieved through the application of a thin proton-conducting ionomer film on these porous photoelectrodes for surface functionalization. The rational design of proton exchange membrane-based PEC cells will play a pivotal role in realizing renewable-energy-driven hydrogen production from atmospheric humidity in the air.

To align with the 2050 carbon neutralization policy and escalate towards net-zero carbon emissions, electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) are increasingly relying on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, LIBs often utilize flammable organic liquid electrolytes, posing significant fire risks. All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are expected to address the thermal instability of conventional rechargeable batteries, given nonflammable inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs). Our study introduces an enhanced thermal stability in ASSBs by employing halide solid electrolyte (Li 3 InCl 6 , LIC) in charged cathode materials (Li 1–x Ni 0.6 Co 0.2 Mn 0.2 O 2 , x ≈ 0.5), significantly mitigating the risks associated with oxygen evolution and thermal decomposition. Unlike sulfide SEs that interact exothermically with cathode materials leading to explosive decompositions, interfacial interplay with the LIC and cathode not only delay decomposition but also capture evolved oxygen through an endothermic reaction, converting it into less reactive metal oxides or oxychlorides (e.g., In 2 O 3 , InOCl) phases. Further investigations reveal that other halide SEs such as Li 3 YCl 6 and Li 2 ZrCl 6 also exhibit these oxygen-capturing and heat release-mitigating properties, broadening the potential for developing safer solid-state batteries. These findings underscore the importance of selecting SEs that not only prevent oxygen evolution but also chemically interact with the cathode to reduce the state-of-charge (SOC), thereby enhancing overall battery safety and stability. This study lays foundational criteria for SE design aimed at maximizing thermal safety in ASSBs, thereby supporting the broader adoption of EVs and ESSs in pursuit of global carbon neutrality.

Building a hydrogen society to replace the current carbon energy systems is one of humanity's most pressing challenges. Green hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is thus a promising technology. However, the strong acid environment at high voltage leads to the corrosion of non-noble metal components, driving PEMWE demand towards expensive materials such as titanium and noble metal catalysts like Ir to drive the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEMWE. Decreasing Ir loading in an effort to decrease costs while maintaining efficient and stable PEMWE is challenging due to Ir dissolution [1]. Reversible deactivation of iridium, along with irreversible degradation like agglomeration and dissolution, is of great interest [2], due to lifespan extension and reduced hydrogen production costs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of OER deactivation and reactivation of Ir, which can be accomplished by operando studies, is crucial. However, only limited operando studies provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of OER de-/re-activation of Ir [3]. In this research, we study the correlation between consumption and production of μ-oxo species in Ir catalysts to explain the de-/re-activation of Ir through specially designed electrochemical protocols coupled with operando techniques such as X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (eQCM) connected with Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES), and Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), including the application of the reactivation protocol in a single cell mode of operation. Surface-terminated electrophilic μ-oxo species on Ir oxide promote intermediate formation and lower the energy barrier of OER [4-8]. Operando XAS elucidates the potential-dependent formation of a thin oxide layer, including μ-oxo species, on the Ir surface while maintaining the Ir core. However, consumption of μ-oxo species and detachment of adsorbates during OER result in a reversible mass reduction of catalysts. The relationship between dissolved Ir and replenished μ-oxo species is demonstrated by ICP-OES. Although the dissolutions of Ir catalysts increase after applying certain reactivation potentials, the average OER currents are enhanced, further indicating the presence of an additional primary factor for the activity of the catalysts, apart from the amount of present catalysts. Operando SERS further clarifies the direct correlation between the generation of μ-oxo species on the catalyst surface during catalyst reactivation and the degree of the recovered catalyst activity. Further, we implemented the reactivation protocol in a PEM single-cell and revealed the effectiveness of catalyst reactivation in PEMWE. Our findings not only contributed to an enhanced understanding of the observed phenomena on the catalyst surface during de-/re-activation but also to the development of a protocol for stable water electrolysis in a single-cell mode of operation.

Due to the consumption of primary energy, the demand for renewable energy is increasing. Because of its high energy density and zero carbon emissions, water electrolysis to produce hydrogen is an ideal and clean energy choice. However, fresh water is a high demand resource for people's livelihood which only takes less 3 percent in the full water resource. Therefore, exploring the use of seawater, which accounts for over 70% of the earth, as a source for seawater splitting is worthwhile. We need to find a more efficient and long-last catalyst to avoid the chorine evolution, a competition reaction during oxygen evolution (OER), causing the corrosion process to suppress the life span of catalyst for usage of the seawater to produce hydrogen. High entropy materials, a potential promising catalyst candidate, due to their tunable electronic structures leading to a much lower OER overpotential and corrosion resistance. In this work. we use a pulsed laser irradiation scanning on mixed salt solutions (PLMS) method to produce a six elements high entropy ceramic nanoparticles as OER catalyst for efficient and stable work in seawater environments. The (AlCoCrFeMnNi)O high-entropy ceramic (HEC) we proposed demonstrate a great performance in the seawater environment. The onset voltage of oxygen-evolution can low down to 1.47V vs. RHE, and in terms of stability our catalyst is capable to operate for 1000 hours under 100mA/cm 2 . Furthermore, to understand the mechanism behind our (AlCoCrFeMnNi)O HEC, the in-situ XAS (X-ray absorption spectroscopy) measurement and In-situ EXAFS are carried out in this work under different OER voltage applied. Co, Mn, and Ni identified as the active sites of OER and these three elements work intimately together with each different reaction routes, including the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen-participated mechanism (LOM). While Al, Cr, and Fe are not directly contributed to the catalytic activity but they play important roles to stabilize the high entropy structure during the whole reaction. Figure 1

A strategic approach has been proposed for designing robust, high-performing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts tailored for saline/sea water splitting. By employing a density functional theory (DFT)-based computational screening process, a set of promising dopants were identified from a range of twenty-six 3d to 5d transition metals, with the aim of enhancing the activity and saline water resilience of the catalysts. The screening methodology was threefold, encompassing evaluations of OER / HER energetics, chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) energetics, and chloride-corrosion energetics. The screening led to the promising dopants, which substantially elevated the performance of each of the host catalysts. This study contributes to the understanding of alkaline ClER and chloride-corrosion mechanisms, providing insights into catalyst behavior in saline/sea conditions.

Iridium oxide nanoparticles as self-supported catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) have been used for a decade because of their stability in acidic environments. The community has in general accepted that the amorphous and rutile structures of this oxide have distinct intrinsic activity, both in the liquid-electrolyte model system and in membrane electrode assemblies. However, the surface properties that contribute to the higher recorded activity of amorphous iridium oxides are not yet defined. The spectroscopic features of iridium atoms are not very sensitive to changes in the chemical environment, making structural properties difficult to elucidate. The oxygen spectrum, however, provides distinct footprints for amorphous and rutile iridium oxide materials and its features are sensitive to the surface and near-surface environment changes. In this work, oxygen features are used to identify the surface composition of five commercially available materials consisting of amorphous, rutile, or mixed phases. The spectra of the amorphous (IrO x ) and rutile (IrO 2 ) structures present distinct features that are associated with chemical moieties identified using soft X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (1). A peak-fitting model is developed to analyze the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the oxygen 1s orbitals. This model is used in this work to characterize and understand the modifications of the iridium oxide surfaces upon surface activation. During the electrochemical activation of these catalysts, different surface modifications occur depending on the structure of the pristine material. Such surface evolution, which can occur during the first cycles of polarization, renders the rational design of highly active/durable materials difficult. The analysis of the superfine O1s XPS spectra at different stages of activation allows us to understand the structural evolutions leading to activity differences. This work intends to provide sufficient insights for the identification of the intermediate structures responsible for the reactivity and stability of OER catalysts. (1) Mom, R. V.; Falling, L.

Electrochemical water splitting is critical to produce green hydrogen without greenhouse gas emissions. Iridium-based catalysts are important for increasing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency of water splitting, but their high cost and scarcity require the development of new electrodematerial structure. Alloyed nanoparticles have modified electrochemical structure for improved OER activity andstable support such as perovskite oxide can be applied due to its high oxygen transfer rate. This research focuses on developing iridium-transition metal alloy nanoparticles on a stable perovskite support to improve OER performance and durability. The changes in particle size, composition, and temperature-controlled structure are the main research topics, highlighting balancing activity and economics to produce hydrogen in an environmentally friendly way.

Introduction In a hydrogen-centric society, hydrogen production via water electrolysis plays a crucial role 1 . Conventional water electrolysis generates hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously, necessitating a separation mechanism to prevent purity reduction and explosion risks induced by gas mixing. This study aims to selectively generate hydrogen and oxygen sequentially in two steps by utilizing the redox reaction between iodide and iodate ions. Specifically, exploiting the lower oxidation potential of iodide ions compared to the oxygen evolution potential, hydrogen is generated during the first step alongside the oxidation of iodide ions. Utilizing the lower reduction potential of iodate ions compared to the hydrogen evolution potential, oxygen is generated during the second step alongside the reduction of iodate ions. This presentation reports the results of investigating the feasibility of generating hydrogen and oxygen based on this principle. Experimental A two-compartment cell separated by a Nafion membrane was employed as the electrolysis cell. Platinum electrodes were used as the working and counter electrodes, and Ag/AgCl served as the reference electrode. Potentials were expressed relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) which was converted from the measured potential ( vs. Ag/AgCl) by the following equation: E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.198 + 0.059 pH (V) 2 . Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted at each step to observe the current-potential characteristics and to determine at which potential only iodide ions and iodate ions react. In the first step, the anode was filled with 10 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM KI aqueous solutions (in 100 mM KOH), while the cathode was filled with 100 mM KOH aqueous solution. In the second step, the cathode was filled with 10 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM KIO 3 aqueous solutions (in 100 mM KOH), while the anode was filled with 100 mM KOH aqueous solution. Control experiments using 100 mM KOH aqueous solution in both compartments were conducted for comparison with two-step water electrolysis. Constant potential electrolysis was performed at the potentials determined from LSV measurements, and the reactants and products were analyzed using a gas chromatography and a high-performance liquid chromatography to examine current efficiency. All electrochemical experiments were conducted at room temperature. Results and Discussion LSV measurements in the first step revealed a peak of oxidation current between +1.4 V and +2.0 V, increasing with the initial concentration of iodide ions. Comparison with control experiments indicated that this oxidation potential was lower than that of oxygen evolution reaction. Hence, under conditions where iodide ions are contained in the anolyte, oxidation of iodide ions occur at a lower potential than oxygen evolution reaction. In the second step, a peak of reduction current appeared between +0.2 V and –0.6 V, increasing with the initial concentration of iodate ions. Comparison with control experiments suggested that the reduction reaction of iodate ions occurred at a lower potential than hydrogen evolution reaction. Utilizing the identified potentials which iodine redox reactions selectively occur, constant potential electrolysis revealed iodate ions being generated at the anode in the first step and iodide ions being generated at the cathode in the second step. It was found that the maximum current efficiency for the oxidation reaction of iodide ions was 98% at +1.9 V in the first step, while the maximum current efficiency for the reduction reaction of iodate ions was almost 100% at +0.1 V in the second step. These results confirmed the feasibility of water electrolysis using iodine redox reactions, with desired reactions occurring efficiently.

In this talk we discuss activities leveraging electrodeposition to enhance batteries and electrocatalysis. In the area of batteries, we discuss how different electrolytes can enhance the electrodeposition of cations such as Mg2+. Ca2+, and Zn2+. A particular focus is the use of high concentration or solvate electrolytes, the structure of which can control the discharge process at the solid liquid interface. We show how different characterization techniques provide unique insight to battery-relevant electrodeposition properties. In the area of electrocatalysis, we discuss how electrodeposition can alter properties of different catalysts, yielding materials with enhanced activity. Examples from ammonia oxidation, oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution will be presented. The work shows that beyond increasing active surface areas, electrodeposition can yield materials with properties such as altered d-band centers, and enhanced stability particularly with regard to oxidation.

It is widely recognized that hydrogen is an appropriate fuel for the sustainable energy system because it can be utilized as an energy storage material of intermittent renewable energy sources, and it generate no environmentally harmful products after combustion. However, in region where green hydrogen production cannot follow the need, import is necessary. In this case, transportation and storage of pure hydrogen can be a problem because of the high cost of maintaining liquefied state and low amount of hydrogen in compressed gas. In this regard, ammonia has received much attention as a hydrogen carrier with advantageous properties of relatively mild condition for liquefaction, high volumetric density of hydrogen, and no carbon content. Electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) to extract the hydrogen has been researched as much less energy is required for electrolysis when replacing oxygen evolution reaction to the AOR in aqueous alkaline condition. But high overpotential even when the most active electrocatalyst, platinum, is used and rapid poisoning by strongly adsorbed N species inhibit the practical application. To deal with these problems, there are a lot of on-going researches with various methods and perspectives. In this study, we investigated the effect of alkali metal cations on electrochemical AOR on polycrystalline platinum electrode. With same concentration but different alkali metal cations, measured the activity of platinum was different for the AOR peak (K + > Na + > Li + ≈ Cs + ). The reaction kinetics were also affected, supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel slope. Also, we checked that the alkali metal cation promotes the AOR by comparing the cyclic voltammetry results with and without the cation in ammonia solution. These kinds of cation effects are also demonstrated in other electrochemical reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Mainly, there are two explanations i) the degree of interaction between cations and water structure and reaction intermediates at the interface, ii) the local electric field between electrode and hydrated cation in electric double layer. We will present and discuss the effect of alkali metal cations on the AOR in this point of view and competitive adsorption of water, proton, hydroxide and ammonia on the platinum surface in aqueous alkaline electrolyte.

PEM water electrolysis has advantages such as high current density operation and quick response to input power.From these advantages, PEM water electrolysis is adequate to the hydrogen mass production system adopted the renewable energy.Iridium oxide shows good oxygen evolution reaction(OER) activity and durability for PEM water electrolysis anode catalyst, but there are material supply and cost issues as it is precious metal.To solve these issues, several studies have been conducted to improve OER activity of Iridium oxide. Last year, we reported on highly active crystalline iridium oxide catalysts.In this work, we performed accelerated durability tests in single cell on crystalline and amorphous iridium oxide.After the durability test, the CCM was analyzed to investigate degradation factors.The results will be discussed on the day of the meeting.

Solid Oxide Cells, SOFC and SOEC, are attracting attention in energy conversion and storage systems due to their high efficiency and flexibility in various fuels. However, their performance is decreased by the limited reversibility of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air electrode, particularly at intermediate temperatures because of high overpotential from large activation energy. Therefore, developing an active and reversible air electrode for fast oxygen dissociation/association processes is crucially required. Conventional air electrodes often utilize Co-based perovskites (such as La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3−δ and Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3−δ ) due to their high ionic and electronic conductivity, along with good catalytic activity. However, it has been observed that the presence of A-site oxide on the perovskite surface leads to lower catalytic activity. Recent approaches have explored surface modification through infiltration to enhance catalytic activity and stability [1-3]. This study focuses on investigating the cathodic performance of surface-modified B-site oxide, specifically Co 3 O 4 spinel-type oxide, as a model catalyst with SrO modification. Figure 1 illustrates the image of the air electrode aimed in this study. It was found that the power density of the cells in SOFC condition increased after Sr infiltration, which is almost the same performance with SrCoO 3 reference cell. Additionally, overpotential was significantly decreased due to the formation of active sites for ORR. For SOEC condition, Sr infiltrated cell reached a reasonable current density compared with bare Co 3 O 4 . Also, ohmic and polarization resistances decreased because of better oxygen evolution on the surface. It is found that interface between SrO and Co 3 O 4 is active site for air electrode of solid oxide reversible cell, which is demonstrated by using diffusion of oxygen tracer, 18 O. References [1] A.

Recent experimental studies suggest mixed oxides of Ni, Co, and Fe operated in basic media may be the strongest alternative to iridium. 1, 2 However, the efficiency of these catalysts is strongly synthesis-dependent and there is no established understanding of the role of the different metals in operation with ionomers. Notably, Trotochaud, et al. observed catalyst efficiency in the order Ni 0.9 Fe 0.1 O x > NiO x > Ni y Co 1-y, whereas Morales-Guio, et. al. ranked FeNiO x , CoFeNiO x > CoNiO x > NiO x . 1, 2 Anderson et al. found in their RDE studies of commercial catalysts that NiFe 2 O 4 outperformed NiO, Co 3 O 4 by 7 times kinetically. In low concentrations, these mixed-oxide materials may behave more closely to doped-catalysts, where dopants can increase activity, change selectivity, and even improve resistance to poisoning of active sites. 3-6 Understanding how and why these catalysts work, and do not work, is critical to enabling these materials to achieve the Hydrogen Shot goal of $1/kg H 2 in 1 decade. For our theoretical model, we limited our mixed material model to a single dopant to fully examine the geometric and electronic effects of a nearby transition metal e.g., Fe and Co dopants. Plane-wave density functional theory calculations elucidated the dopant-effects on both activity (the oxygen evolution reaction) and stability in anion exchange membrane electrolysis in the presence of experimentally-relevant ionomers (Georgia Tech, Nafion, Versogen, and Sustainion).

A bright future for electrochemistry is anticipated due to its crucial role in the decarbonization of our industry and energy economy. In this regard, the number of electrochemists, their publications, the taxpayers' funding, and the number of applied materials has grown substantially in the last decade. This growth in interest has also led to an increase in the complexity of the reported systems, e.g., heterostructures with multiple interfaces. [1] However, studies attempting to reproduce known literature procedures often find different values for activity metrics, such as overpotentials, capacities, or long-term stabilities. [2] Furthermore, in my personal experience, I have not met an electrochemist who would be surprised when a student reports that he could not reproduce the outstanding performance of a recent report. Non-reproducibility is a substantial problem and threatens the foundation of science. [3] We have performed a study among more than ten different groups across the globe. In this study, three electrode fabrication procedures (electrodeposition, precipitation followed by Nafion-binder-based powder deposition, hydrothermal modification of a metal foam) have been performed three times by all these groups using the same chemicals. A strict and uniform test protocol is applied to obtain activity metrics (overpotential, Tafel slope, charge transfer resistance...) of these electrodes for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. Based on this tremendous set of data (>100 electrodes tested under the same conditions), we discuss the following questions: How reproducible are our current electrochemical methods? Which factors influence reproducibility? How can we improve reproducibility? Literature: [1] Hausmann, J. N. & Menezes, P. W.

Green hydrogen is becoming a hot commodity in the light of escalating oil and gas prices and their uncertain future availability. Among various electrolysis technologies, PEM water electrolysis (WE) is favorable for its portability, modularity, and the ability to integrate with intermittent, renewable energy sources. However, the upscaling of PEMWE is not feasible yet due to the need for rare and expensive metals as electrocatalysts. Specifically, iridium oxide is used as state-of-the art anodic electrocatalyst. Ruthenium oxide also has an excellent activity towards the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but is highly unstable. To address this limitation, this study investigates ruthenate pyrochlores as alternative anodic electrocatalysts. The pyrochlore structure may stabilize ruthenium. The pyrochlores in this study have been synthesized using a traditional citrate sol-gel method, 1 as well as a novel combustion synthesis route. Physical characterization of the electrocatalysts has been conducted using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning (transmission) electron spectroscopy (S(T)EM) and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, ex-situ electrochemical characterization has been performed in a three-electrode setup. Linear-sweep voltammetry results of Y 2 Ru 2 O 7 synthesised via the citrate sol-gel route indicate an overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 . This result agrees well with what has previously been reported for this electrocatalyst. 2 Y 2 Ru 2 O 7 synthesised via the novel combustion route performs better than the aforementioned due to increased surface area. Various A-site dopants have also been introduced into the pyrochlore structure to generate oxygen vacancies, modify the electronic structure and increase the stability. These materials have also been tested in a full-cell setup to gauge their performance for practical applications compared to state-of-the-art IrO 2 and RuO 2 .

The development of a bifunctional catalyst for reversible oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) is an important challenge to promote the performance of lithium-oxygen (Li-O 2 ) batteries. Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) complex has been considered a promising candidate for a bifunctional O 2 catalyst in Li-O 2 batteries due to its high catalytic activities and easy preparation. Herein, a dual mediator scheme is proposed to achieve an efficient and durable O 2 electrocatalyst by coupling well-design solid and electrolyte-soluble FePc-based redox mediators (RMs). Two modes of pyridine-functional carbon support in solid/soluble FePc-based RMs including carbon multi-walled carbon nanotube (Py-MWCNT) and graphene (Py-GR) are investigated to evaluate the influences of different dual RMs on their catalytic activity and kinetics. Among the as-prepared samples, the dual solid FePc-Py-MWCNT/soluble FePc-based RM reveals the best bifunctional catalytic performance, which can be attributed to the highly efficient solid/liquid interface between Li 2 O 2 and solution phase FePc.

The search of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes is the key to enable the commercialization of alkaline electrolyzers and lower hydrogen production price. However, there is a trade-off relation between the activity and stability of electrocatalysts due to the highly oxidative condition of OER, which induces the surface restructuring for electrocatalysts. Our recent work show that by modulating the composition of electrocatalysts for (Co, Ni)S y anchored on carbon nanofibers, we can control the stability of electrocatalysts and optimize their activity in alkaline OER. Using electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy characterizations including X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we reveal the restructuring mechanism, which can help us break down the activity-stability trade-off relation to design and scale up such electrocatalysts for commercial applications.

Hydrogen production through anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) presents cost advantages compared to proton-exchange membrane equivalents, thanks to the heightened oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency of platinum-group-metal-free catalysts in alkaline environments. However, the electrochemical oxidation of ionomers at the OER catalyst interface leads to a decrease in local electrode pH, which hampers AEMWE performance. Various strategies at the single-cell level have been explored to tackle this challenge. This article delves into the current understanding of electrochemical ionomer oxidation and its alleviation methods, offering our perspective on each approach. Our analysis emphasizes the efficacy of the competitive adsorption strategy in mitigating ionomer oxidation. This perspective piece also outlines future pathways for advancing high-performance alkaline AEMWEs and other energy devices utilizing hydrocarbon ionomers.

The interaction between interfacial water and metal oxides represents an important first step in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). RuO 2 is a well-known OER electrocatalyst; however, its active state remains elusive. We will discuss an atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigation on the RuO 2 (110) surface held at various potentials. We use this result to study how RuO 2 surfaces change during OER. We further image water dissociation into OH* (* denotes adsorbed species) and O* species. Starting from surface-bound water, which manifests as a row of surface-bound molecules, increasing the oxidative potential transforms these adsorbates into OH* and O*. This oxidative step also changes the pattern of the surface-bound molecules. We use these results to map the surface phase diagram of RuO 2 (110) and provide an interpretation of its cyclic voltammetry.

Producing hydrogen through water splitting often faces challenges of overpotential, stability, and expensive catalysts, which limit its efficiency and hinder the advancement of hydrogen production technologies. Nickel foam and nickel meshes have emerged as promising materials for electrolyzer electrodes due to their high surface area and the ability to produce electrolyzers with a very small gap between the anode and cathode. This study presents a simple method for coating Ni-based electrodes with a chiral Ni–Au film, using electroplating, thus enhancing its efficiency dramatically. We introduce chirality to the electroplating layer by incorporating an enantiopure chiral reagent into the electroplating solution. The chiral layer enhances the oxygen evolution reaction due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect. By optimizing the chiral electroplating process, we demonstrate the reduction of the overpotential and an increase in the reaction efficiency by 95% at 1 M KOH at room temperature.

The ever-increasing global energy demand together with the environmental issue originated from the use of fossil fuel, has triggered an intense search for sustainable and clean energy alternatives, such us hydrogen energy, biomass and solar energy among others. In this context, a pivotal key to deliver sustainable and superior energy systems lies on the rational design and development of high-quality and cost-effective catalyst offering enhanced stability, activity and selectivity. Consequently, intense efforts have been devoted in the search and synthesis of new catalyst materials to replace the scarce and expensive traditional noble metals (e.g. Pt, Pd, Au and Ru) for energy conversion and energy storage applications. Among the recently explored novel catalyst materials, metal phosphides (MPs) have emerged in recent years, attracting significant attention thanks to their intriguing properties [1]. In particular transition metal phosphides (TMPs) exhibit striking properties. The moderately strong M−P bonds lend outstanding mechanical properties, high thermal stability and outstanding chemical resistance to chemical attack and oxidation in acidic and alkaline solutions. Additionally, Co, Ni, Mo-based phosphides demonstrated excellent catalytic and bifunctional properties, in particular towards water splitting as both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [2,3]. Herein, we present the synthesis of TMPs by thermal Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) based on the use of different transition metal precursors and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. The physical and chemical properties of the resulting TMPs thin films were extensively characterized by different methods, including atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. The presentation will introduce and describe the synthesis of the TMPs and the corresponding physical and electrochemical characterization toward electrocatalytic application. [1] Z. Pu, T. Liu, I.

In the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, seawater splitting has emerged as a promising approach to meet the increasing global demand for clean hydrogen fuel. Unlike freshwater resources, which are limited and face competition for various essential purposes such as drinking, agriculture, and industry, seawater offers a vast and readily available source for hydrogen production. However, a significant challenge in seawater splitting arises from the competition between Chlorine Evolution Reaction (ClER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), which can impede hydrogen production and compromise catalyst stability. In this study, we developed an efficient NiFeMn LDH material as an anode catalyst for seawater splitting. Our findings demonstrate that the LDH catalyst exhibits robust electrochemical performance in seawater, comparable to its performance in freshwater systems. Furthermore, we utilized in-situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate the real-time electronic structure variations of the Ni, Fe, and Mn elements in both seawater and freshwater environments. Notably, the incorporation of Mn dopants was found to play a crucial role in enhancing the stability and performance of the NiFeMn LDH catalyst.

A reversible fuel cell (rFC) integrates a fuel cell (FC) and a water electrolyser (WE) into a single energy conversion device. One potential implementation of an rFC involves operating each electrode with a fixed gas. Specifically, the oxygen electrode would carry out the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) depending on the operation mode. However, a major challenge is the development of a bifunctional catalyst for the oxygen electrode, since the faster hydrogen electrode can be operated with Pt as catalyst for both, hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction (HER/HOR). State-of-the-art catalyst materials in acidic media, such as Pt and Ir for the ORR and OER, respectively, face challenges due to oxidative and reductive potentials during FC and WE mode operation. Ir undergoes multiple oxidation state changes during the transient between FC and WE operation mode, resulting in dissolution of the material [1]. Pt faces similar oxidation mechanisms and possible dissolution in WE mode [2]. To address these challenges, we propose a Pt@Ir bifunctional catalyst for rFC applications, where Ir is deposited in a non-continuous monolayer shell on Pt particles to maintain active surface area for both reactions. However, in order to control the synthesis of such a composite catalyst, a basic understanding of Pt-Ir interactions has to be established, which is also of interest to cell reversal mitigation catalysts commonly employed in PEM FC. Herein, we present investigations on Ir deposition on Pt nanoparticles, which builds the foundation for a simple and scalable synthesis method for the proposed Pt@Ir catalyst. We start with investigations on potential-driven deposition of Ir on Pt nanoparticles to study how Ir deposition evolves with applied potential and compare the characteristics with Ir deposition on Ir and Au nanoparticles as reference. We show that Ir deposition on Pt happens at lower cathodic polarization hinting toward a preferential Ir ion reduction on Pt. Further we investigate the hydrogen gas driven deposition of Ir on Pt before transferring the knowledge from a three-electrode set up into a bulk synthesis. The high activity of adsorbed hydrogen gas on Pt surface allows a reduction of metal ions exclusively on Pt surface [3], which seems to be also possible for Ir ions. We present the successful gas-promoted deposition of Ir on Pt black nanoparticles as bifunctional catalyst for OER/ORR in acidic media. Additionally, we demonstrate the full cell performance of this catalyst in PEM WE and PEM FC operation.

The global push towards cleaner energy sources has heightened the demand for high-performing, durable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) electrocatalysts. Green hydrogen, generated through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy, stands as a prominent solution in this endeavor to transition away from fossil fuels. Among various electrolyzer technologies, PEMWE systems currently offer the most competitive pathway for green hydrogen production. These systems typically employ a platinum on carbon supported (Pt/C) cathodic electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an iridium oxide (IrOx) anodic electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Efforts to enhance PEMWE performance primarily focus on improving the kinetics of the OER process, which accounts for the majority of activation overpotential during operation. To address cost concerns associated with IrOx, researchers are exploring alternative formulations, including doping with materials like niobium (Nb), aiming for comparable performance at reduced Ir loading [1], [2], [3]. It is argued that higher surface area and lower crystalline IrOx catalysts lead to lower activation overpotentials and enhanced durability, respectively. In this study, we investigate the performance of high-surface-area IrOx electrocatalysts (>200 m 2 /g) and Nb-doped IrOx variants, comparing them with commercially available benchmarks. Through rigorous examination utilizing Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE), Gas Diffusion Electrode (GDE) half-cell, and Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs), we report on the performance and stability of our in-house prepared materials. Preliminary results examining various loadings of IrOx suggest that lower loadings lead to durable and active electrocatalyst layers. Our findings underscore the potential of Nb-doped IrOx as a cost-effective alternative for PEMWE electrocatalysts, offering promising advancements in the pursuit of efficient and sustainable hydrogen production.

To achieve carbon neutrality, extensive research is ongoing to produce green hydrogen via water electrolysis combined with renewable energy sources. Understanding and developing catalysts for membrane electrode assembly (MEA) type water electrolysis systems, such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), are critical steps toward this goal. Therefore, this presentation will focus on catalyst development for PEMWE and AEMWE, with emphasis on cost-effective catalysts. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis in PEMWE, the primary challenge is to minimize iridium (Ir) usage for sustainable green hydrogen production. Layered monoclinic iridium nickel oxide (IrNiO x ) platelets were synthesized using a molten salt method and employed for the OER. These platelets exhibited high OER activity with reduced Ni dissolution in acidic conditions. When applied in MEA, they demonstrated enhanced interconnectivity within the catalyst layer, promoting electron transfer. Even at low Ir loading (0.2 mg Ir cm -2 ), the platelets showed good performance with an initial cell voltage of 1.70 V at 1 A cm -2 and minimal degradation over 100 hours. This highlights the effectiveness of incorporating transition metals into Ir oxide to reduce Ir usage in PEMWE. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis in AEMWE, attention is focused on nickel iron (NiFe) hydroxide catalysts for their high activity and stability in alkaline conditions. However, the lack of initial electrical conductivity of as-prepared NiFe LDH limits its potential as an electrocatalyst. To address this issue, a monolayer structuring approach was proposed. This method improved mass transport to allow a high energy conversion efficiency of 72.6% with exceptional stability over 50 hours at 1 A cm -2 . Additionally, lack of initial electrical conductivity hinders determination of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of NiFe LDH using conventional double layer capacitance method. Use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at reactive OER potentials to extract the capacitance that is hypothesized to arise due to reactive OER intermediates (O*, OH*, OOH*) adsorbed on the catalyst surface was thus investigated. This allowed the estimation of ECSA and intrinsic activity of NiFe LDH, validating the methodology through rigorous catalyst loading and support studies. For hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysis in AEMWE, replacing platinum (Pt) with Ni-based alloys containing molybdenum (Mo) species has shown promise. Dynamic active sites of Ni catalysts with Mo species require innovative approaches to maintain initial performance, warranting material innovation or careful manipulation of operating protocol. The approaches in which this is made possible is shortly presented, together with the innovations that allows probing of such phenomenon.

Using organic oxidation reactions to replace the oxygen evolution reaction is a promising approach for producing high-value organic products and hydrogen. Here, we report a photoelectrochemical benzyl alcohol oxidation system based on an α-Fe2O3 photoanode coated with a NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) cocatalyst. By adjustment of the relative content of Ni and Co in the NiCo-LDH, the optimized photoanode achieved a benzyl alcohol conversion efficiency of 99.1% and benzoic acid selectivity of 90.9%. Experimental studies revealed that the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction proceeds via an indirect catalytic mechanism involving high-valence species of the NiCo-LDH cocatalyst. Co in NiCo-LDH reduced the formation energy barrier and oxidative capability of the high-valence species, thereby influencing the performance of the photoanode. This work provides insights into the crucial role of cocatalyst composition in organic reaction oxidation and contributes to developing various photoelectrochemical organic oxidation systems.

Unitized Reversible Fuel Cells (URFCs) combines the functionality of hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolyzers into a single device, offering high energy density for energy conversion and storage. However, their commercial viability is deterred by the high precious group metal (PGM) loadings. Conventional URFCs utilize 1 mg/cm 2 of Pt and 1 mg/cm 2 of IrO 2 in the oxygen electrode, posing economic and sustainability challenges. This study investigates the performance and durability implications of minimizing PGM loadings in oxygen electrode which utilizes a mixture of IrO 2 and Pt black to facilitate oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction respectively. We also examine the effect of the porous transport layer (PTL) morphology and wettability on the URFC performance and durability. Accelerated stress test (AST) protocol was developed to evaluate the performance loss across both fuel cell and water electrolyzer mode of URFC operation. Additionally, this research provides a detailed characterization of loss in active area, change in catalyst layer structural, and PTL wettability offering insights into the degradation mechanism in URFCs. This study not only establishes a foundational benchmark for understanding the URFC performance and durability at low catalyst loadings but also highlights the critical need for strategic component selection and activation methods to enhance the system's overall efficiency and durability, marking a significant step towards the realization of more sustainable energy solutions.

Chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a crucial anodic reaction in the chlor–alkali process. For 50 years, dimensionally stable anode (DSA) has been extensively used for CER. However, the DSA requires about 30 at% of precious metals, such as iridium and ruthenium, and also catalyzes oxygen evolution reaction as a parasitic reaction, invoking the cost and selectivity issues, respectively. In this work, we have synthesized atomically dispersed non-precious metal (M; M = Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu)-based CER catalysts to unravel their CER catalytic trends. The catalysts were synthesized by coating carbon nanotube (CNT) with polyaniline layers, adsorption of a metal precursor, silica layer overcoating, thermal annealing, followed by silica layer etching. The resulting M 1 /aniCNT catalysts showed over 90% CER selectivity. Among the catalysts, Ni 1 /aniCNT exhibited the best CER activity, surpassing that of DSA. The high CER activity of Ni 1 /aniCNT is attributed to the asymmetric Ni–N 3 structure with Ni 1+ oxidation state. This work highlights the dependency of activity on the structure of atomically dispersed catalysts and broadens the range of CER catalysts.

3d transitional metal oxyhydroxides, such as Ni and Co oxyhydroxides with Fe doping, are among the most active and most studied OER catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. They are also the catalysts of choice for industrial alkaline water electrolysis. Despite decades of research, the atomic-scale structures of these materials, particularly key Ni (oxy)hydroxide hosts, remain elusive. This presentation aims to fill this critical knowledge gap by combining rigorous Density Functional Theory calculations with in situ Wide Angle X-ray Scattering techniques under quasi-steady state electrochemical cycling conditions. This unique combination has enabled us to unveil the in-situ structures and (ir)reversible transformations of pure undoped Ni (oxy)hydroxides. Such an advance consequently allows us to transcend the limitations of previous modeling based on approximated structures. Specifically, based on the newly identified actual in-situ structures, we discover the existence of a previously unknown synergy at the reaction centers, coupled with the polaron effects, in promoting the oxygen evolution reaction. Such a finding sheds light on the catalytic active sites and oxygen evolution reaction pathways, particularly the exceptional activity of multiple Fe reaction centers on Ni oxyhydroxides. In addition, we found that such a phenomenon is general and also exists on NiM and CoM layered double hydroxides, 1, 2 A2B2O7 pyrochlores, 3 layered Co oxyhydroxides intercalated with phenanthroline through non-covalent ligand-oxide interaction. 4 References: Dionigi, F.; Zeng, Z.; Sinev, I., et al.

Electrocatalysts for several reactions and processes are actively developed and under development by multiple research groups around the globe. These materials include catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction [1], carbon dioxide reduction [2], hydrogen oxidation [3], oxygen evolution [4] and many other classes. While there is a significant interest to these materials both from scientific and industrial point of view a serious question of their scalability and manufacturability had arisen. In this work aspects of materials scale-up through careful design of reactors, mixing conditions, reaction conditions monitoring and CFD modelling will be reported. A case study on the model system of unsupported silver nanoparticles will be discussed. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized on scale with variation of reagents concentration, different types of impellers and RPM. Materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and BET and the data were correlated to the scaleup variables. A CFD model was developed to model nanoparticles formation and was used to guid experimental scaleup effort. Acknowledgements and Statements.

Raman spectroscopy has been applied as a vibrational spectroscopic technique in the field of chemical, materials, and life sciences. Recently, the operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy has received more research attention for the characterizations of working electrodes in (photo)electrochemical catalysis. This technique allows for the characterization of the fate of electrocatalysts on the surface of the working electrodes under electrochemical reaction conditions, which is crucial to determine the chemical identify of the electrocatalysts. We apply the operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy to study the anodes and cathodes in the (photo)electrocatalytic water splitting process, which is an important process to generate the clean energy hydrogen (H 2 ) gas from water using solar energy and electricity. Specifically, we study the stability of the electrocatalyst molybdenum sulfide (MoS 2 ) on silicon (Si) photocathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the electrochemical transformation of the electrocatalyst cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH) 2 ) on nanostructured gold (Au) photoanode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We have identified the correlation between the morphological changes and vibrational features of the MoS 2 layer and detected the potential-dependent vibrational features of the Co(OH) 2 film.

We are developing materials to enable the direct capture of sunlight and electrochemical production of chemical fuels such as hydrogen, inspired by the Fujishima-Honda effect. To extend the response into the visible region of the solar spectrum, we are designing photoelectrodes consisting of 3D, mesostructured semiconductor components decorated with heterogeneous catalysts to drive fuel-forming electrochemical reactions at low overpotentials. High aspect-ratio semiconductor rods enable the use of low cost, earth-abundant semiconductor photoelectrodes without sacrificing energy conversion efficiency, due to orthogonalization of light absorption and charge-carrier collection. Inorganic phototropic growth due to light-directed electrodeposition of p-type semiconductors yields tunable anisotropic wetting of surfaces in accord with the Lotus leaf effect, also as pioneered by Prof. Fujishima. A series of phosphide and antimonate materials provides alternatives to traditional catalysts based on platinum-group for catalysis of the hydrogen-evolution and oxygen-evolution reactions. Additionally, thick, uniform TiO 2 coatings similar to those used by Fujishima for self-cleaning coatings can chemically protect semiconductor photoelectrodes without compromising light collection or electrical conduction.

Abstract Spinel oxides still exhibit unsatisfactory electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) given their low intrinsic activity, poor electronic conductivity, and limited exposure of reaction sites. Defect engineering has garnered intensive attention and become a promising strategy to enhance the reaction kinetics. In this work, spinel NiFe 2 O 4 nanospheres with rich nickel vacancies are prepared via simple one‐pot hydrothermal synthesis. Combined electrochemical measurements and in situ Raman characterization prove that a relatively higher degree of electrochemical surface reconstruction is realized after the introduction of nickel vacancies in NiFe 2 O 4 , in addition to boosted OER electrocatalytic performance. Further theoretical calculations also reveal that the cation‐vacancy‐induced effect can reduce the difficulty for surface reconstruction by increasing the octahedral nickel‐oxygen covalency in nickel ferrite. Contributed to the great structural flexibility and optimized electronic structure of the pre‐catalyst, the reconstructed electrocatalyst presents desirable OER performance, accompanied by long durability in alkaline solution. This work provides a sound strategy to intensify surface reconstruction on spinel oxides and design electrocatalysts with high efficiency toward water oxidation.

Abstract Photoelectrocatalysis has the capability to utilize solar energy to produce hydrogen and valuable chemicals; however, their conversion efficiency remains to reach practical thresholds. Here, a rapid‐ramping annealing strategy is reported to synthesize nanoporous Mo‐doped bismuth vanadate (MBVO) photoanodes with (001)‐preferred orientation. This approach leverages the enhanced carrier transport along the crystallographic [001] direction, optimizing the bulk photoelectrical properties of the MBVO photoanodes. By substituting the surface oxygen evolution reaction with the glycerol oxidation reaction, the photoconversion efficiency is significantly boosted, reaching a photocurrent density of 7.45 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus RHE and an incident photon‐to‐current conversion efficiency of ≈100% for hydrogen generation, accompanied by the production of value‐added products in a high rate (≈1700 mmol m −2 h −1 in total) with a total Faradaic efficiency up to 96%. These results shed light on the construction of practical photoelectrocatalysis systems by demonstrating the potential of bulk‐phase engineering coupled with surface reaction design.

High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) constitute a novel class of materials characterized by the homogeneous integration of five or more metallic elements. They have grabbed the attention due to their unique properties and the multi-dimensional compositional space that can be tuned in many ways. However, the interaction between each of the metals in these HEAs hasn’t been studied sufficiently, impeding a comprehensive understanding of their roles and potential applications. In this work we studied the electrocatalytic activity and mechanism of HEA for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Our results demonstrate that these alloys outperform conventional catalysts, exhibiting lower overpotentials and higher current densities than standard materials such as RuO 2 for OER. To understand the mechanism and electrochemical behavior of HEAs of these materials, we analyze the materials before and after electrochemical studies by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transition Electron Microscopy (TEM), and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are provided to elucidate the contributions of constituent metals to the electrochemical processes. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding and potential applications of HEAs as efficient electrocatalysts, thus facilitating their utilization in diverse energy conversion and storage technologies.

The modular photoelectrochemical (PEC) reactor accommodating eight photoelectrodes with a total active area of up to 46 cm2 has been designed and manufactured using the fused deposition modeling method. The device was equipped with an electrolyte flow system, a relay module for the photoelectrode connection, and a feedback-loop module for switching between counter electrodes. The performance and durability of the system were tested within three case study experiments. The water splitting process was successfully combined with an in situ hydrogen storage in the form of metal hydride phases (confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction) using Fe2O3- or WO3-based photoanodes and LaNi5-based cathodes. The PEC water oxidation at the anodes was realized either in a strongly alkaline electrolyte (pH > 13.5) or in acidified synthetic seawater (pH < 2) for Fe2O3 and WO3 electrodes, respectively. In the latter case, the photoresponse of the anodes decreased the cell charging voltage by 1.7 V at the current density of 60 mA∙g−1. When the seawater was used as an anolyte, the oxygen evolution reaction was accompanied by the chlorine evolution reaction. The manufactured PEC-metal hydride reactor revealed mechanical and chemical stability during a prolonged operation over 300 h and in the broad range of pH values.

Proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysers (PEMWEs) can directly produce hydrogen gas under pressurised conditions, which provides an attractive means to reduce post-electrolysis compression costs. Experimental studies have shown a lower-than-expected increase in PEMWE operation voltage under elevated pressure, but existing modelling approaches have difficulties to adequately explain these observations. Herein, a combined theoretical–experimental approach is presented to elucidate the effect of pressure on water electrolysis kinetics in a PEMWE. Experiments, performed under differential and balanced pressure changes, clearly demonstrate a sub-Nernstian response of the PEMWE polarisation curve to pressure increase at both the hydrogen and oxygen electrodes. The kinetic origin of the effect was revealed by a novel modelling strategy accounting for the distinct contributions of the oxygen evolution (OER), hydrogen evolution (HER), and hydrogen oxidation (HOR) reactions to the activation losses, which are defined on a fixed reference potential scale. By simultaneously fitting the experimental data at multiple operating pressures, the sub-Nernstian voltage response is accurately reproduced and shown to arise from the superimposed kinetics of the OER, HER, and HOR. Effectively, increasing the operating pressure thereby transforms part of the irreversible activation losses into useful compression energy, thus enhancing the energy efficiency of the process. The model further demonstrates that deviations from Tafel-line behaviour observed at intermediate current densities are due to a decreased influence of the HOR reverse reaction at the hydrogen electrode. This work is expected to give direction to future developments in high-pressure PEMWE modelling and performance analysis.

Lanthanum strontium cobalt iron oxide (LSCF) is considered as a superior state-of-the-art oxygen electrode material for SOEC because of its high mixed ionic and electronic conductivity, superior oxygen evolution activity, compatible thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) to ceria compatible, lower reaction activation energy, and suitable sintering temperature (1000). However, LSCF suffers in performance during the long-term SOEC operation due to issues related to undesired reactivity and Sr migration. Such issues are detrimental to the electrochemical performance as they trigger the formation of multiple oxide phases, including insulating phases and electrode or barrier layer delamination. Therefore, stabilization of LSCF phase via adjustment in stoichiometry is one of the crucial strategies to develop highly stable electrodes. In this work, several LSCF-based compositions have been synthesized by doping with size matching cation in A-site (La/Ca/Sr ratio adjustment), and doping B-site with larger cations such as Nb 5+ , Zr 4+ , and Ga 3 , attempting to enhance the chemical stability of LSCF and stabilize the perovskite structure. Electrical and chemical properties of these electrodes were studied using multiple characterization techniques. Electrocatalytic activity of these electrodes was evaluated in symmetric cells and in Ni-YSZ electrode-supported button cells. Structural and performance trends will be discussed in details.

One critical aspect in enhancing the performance and longevity of anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE) is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In our study, we present a novel three-dimensional unified electrode architecture, where nickel and iron are integrated within a gas diffusion layer (GDL) in oxyhydroxide form, serving as the anode in AEMWE. Traditional electrodes in water electrolysis typically consist of separate catalyst and GDL layers, whereas our unified electrode combines these elements into a single layer. Compared to a conventional electrode utilizing IrO 2 , our unified electrode demonstrates superior catalytic activity and maintains stability for over 500 hours. Electrochemical analysis of the AEMWE employing the unified electrode reveals a performance of 3600 mA cm -2 at 1.9 V, surpassing many other AEMWE studies. Furthermore, our unified AEMWE exhibits excellent performance even at ultra-high current densities. Thus, the unified electrode design represents a promising advancement in enhancing AEMWE performance and reducing hydrogen production costs.

Green hydrogen production through proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) offers the advantages of high current density and high H 2 purity with low footprint. At present, the platinum group metal (PGM) such as Ir are the catalysts of choice for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at PEMWE anode. The high cost and limited reserve of Ir add a significant cost to broad implementation of PEM electrolyzer. Replacing Ir with earth-abundant transition metals could help to reduce the electrolyzer system cost. For PEMWE application, a PGM-free anodic catalyst must be highly active to match the performance of Ir. Furthermore, it must be stable against oxidative acid corrosion. At Argonne, we recently developed a nanofibrous cobalt spinel OER catalyst prepared from cobalt zeolitic methyl-imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF) doped with manganese and lanthanum. [1] A PEMWE containing this catalyst with the anodic loading of ~2.0 mg/cm 2 demonstrated a current density of 2A/cm 2 at 2.47 volts or 4A/cm 2 at 3.00 volts. The catalyst also showed a promising stability under accelerated-stress-test (AST) through voltage cycling as well as galvanostatic tests at different current densities. To better understand the structure-function relationship, we conducted extensive structural characterizations and computational modeling. For example, our high-resolution electron microscopy study showed a catalyst morphology mimicking that of ZIF precursor but composed of cobalt spinel crystallites with an average size of 3.5 nm. The oxygen atoms on the top layer of the spinel surface are in the relaxed mode. X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed strong oxygen deficiencies around cobalt compared to standard spinel reference. Such deficiency became more predominant at higher cell voltage. Contrary to general perception, the cobalt oxidation state actually decreased instead of increasing at the escalating OER potential and fast turnover rate. Accompanying the change of oxidation state, reduction of oxygen coordination number surrounding Co and growth of Debby-Weller factor of Co-O shell were observed, indicating rapid exchange of the lattice oxygen in spinel during OER. On the other hand, no such changes were observed for the atomically dispersed Mn ion in the spinel as the dopant. In this presentation, we will discuss in our detailed findings and offer our perspective on the future research direction for PGM-free OER catalyst for PEM water electrolyzer application.

Lithium-oxygen batteries have attracted significant attention recently due to their high theoretical energy densities. As an open system, the battery breathes oxygen from the air to complete the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and release oxygen to the environment during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, the saturation of liquid electrolytes in the positive electrode, where ORR and OER occur, can strongly affect the Li-O 2 battery performance. However, it has not been clear to what extent saturation reduction can impact battery capacity. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the influence of electrolyte saturation and distribution on deep discharge/charge capacity and cycling stability. The study used both models and experiments to investigate the electrolyte distribution, double-layer capacitance, and electrolyte resistance within the porous cathode at different saturation levels. Results revealed that electrodes with 60% electrolyte saturation could achieve almost the same maximum deep discharge (5.6% lower) and charge (2.3% lower) capacities with fully saturated electrodes. Electrodes with 60% saturation had the highest energy density, 247.13 Wh/kg. Partially wet cathodes with 60% and 40% saturations could obtain similar numbers of cycles or even more cycles than those with 100% saturation. However, fully wet cathodes had the most stable cycling regarding charging efficiency and the lowest overpotential between discharge and charge (1.31V-1.39V). The measured electrochemically active surface areas showed that even 40% saturation could sufficiently wet the cathode surface and obtain a double layer capacity (14.86 mF/cm 2 ) similar to 100% saturation (15.64 mF/cm 2 ).

Abstract Acidic overall water‐splitting driven by consistent electricity is an efficient and economical method for producing green hydrogen. However, developing highly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in acidic conditions remains a challenge. Here, single‐atom Mn sites are introduced into Ru/RuO₂ heterostructures (Mn(SAs)‐Ru/RuO 2 ) as bifunctional electrocatalysts, achieving low overpotentials of 39 and 158 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for HER and OER, respectively, while maintaining long‐term durability for overall water‐splitting over 500 h at 1.47 V in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 . It outperforms most previously reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations show that the charge redistribution caused by single‐site Mn dopants optimizes the adsorption of OOH * and H * at Ru sites, significantly boosting electrochemical kinetics for both OER and HER. This work presents an effective single‐site metal doping strategy to optimize the charge distribution of bifunctional electrocatalysts for acidic overall water‐splitting.

The synthesis of spinel oxide nanocrystals is gaining momentum due to their broad applicability in energy storage and conversion technologies, including supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The performance of these spinel nanomaterials depends on their intrinsic physical properties, such as electronic conductivity and the interaction with reaction intermediates, which are, in turn, influenced by particle size and morphology. These dependencies arise from effects such as quantum confinement and surface or lattice strain, highlighting the importance of producing nanocrystals with controlled size and low dispersity for precise property-application correlations. Achieving such control is crucial for tailoring material properties to specific applications. Colloidal synthesis emerges as a promising method, offering the precision to generate small, monodisperse nanocrystals in a scalable manner. The complexity of colloidal synthesis, dictated by factors such as precursor species, ligands, temperature and solvents, makes synthetic optimization of nanocrystals with precise crystallographic phase and composition both time-consuming and labor-intensive. This leads us to integrate machine learning to efficiently explore and optimize this vast parameter space. By leveraging historical data and employing iterative learning, we aim to automate reaction route optimization in colloidal synthesis. This approach not only enhances synthesis efficiency and material performance for energy applications but also enables the tailored development of nanomaterials through data-driven predictions and streamlined processes.

Multifunctional electrocatalyst-enabled electrochemical hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and reduction reactions play pivotal roles in various energy conversion and storage devices and their integrated systems. The most difficult challenge in developing multifunctional electrocatalysts is effectively incorporating multiple active sites into one material. Herein, we have crafted the Co-MnO@C through the in-situ integration of elemental cobalt on manganese oxide@ carbon in a hydrothermal process and studied the critical role of elemental Co in a zinc-air-driven water splitting system. The Co-MnO@C was prepared on raising the temperature till 1000C in tube furnace and achieved the unique corona-like morphology that allowed the uniform distribution of the elemental Co on the MnO microstructures. The Lewis acidic and Lewis basic active sites, Co and MnO being the electrocatalytically active centers, initiate the activity. The designed heterostructure modulates the electronic structure and improves the conductivity by incorporating carbon in the structure. The crystal structure, composition, and morphology were inspected as a function of the electrocatalytic activity. Benefitting from the integrated effects of all the above factors, Co-MnO@C was successfully demonstrated in the zinc-air battery-powered electrochemical water splitting. Thus, this work offers a novel approach to designing multifunctional electrocatalysts and exploring their efficiency in integrated green energy devices. Figure 1

Water electrolysis, utilizing renewable energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, stands out as a promising avenue for generating and storing clean energy from sustainable sources. This study focuses on creating pore-filling anion exchange membranes (PFAEMs) employing an electrolyte monomer incorporating a quaternary ammonium group. Various cross-linker groups of different chain lengths were introduced, while porous polyethylene substrates were treated with surfactants to transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Evaluation of the anion exchange membrane conductivity was conducted in both in-plane and through-plane configurations at room temperature and 60 ℃. Additionally, comprehensive characterizations of the anion exchange membranes encompassing water uptake, swelling ratio, mechanical strength, contact angle, FTIR, SAXs, WAXs, DSC, and TGA analyses were carried out. Consequently, the PFAEM demonstrated notably high ion conductivity with minimal areal swelling ratio and exceptional chemical stability in a KOH solution for 500 hours. As a crucial component of AEMWE, the catalyst layer was prepared using catalyst inks, namely XB-7 ionomer-based and Nafion ionomer-based inks for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst layers, to assess impedance and I-V polarization curves.

Gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor photoanode has been the subject of extensive research due to its promising potential for photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, GaAs photoanodes have been severely limited by stability issues, including photocorrosion, light-induced degradation, and oxidation. The oxidation of GaAs can lead to the formation of surface defects, which reduce the photocurrent generation. Herein, we investigate the effects of surface modification of GaAs photoanodes with electrocatalysts consisting small amount of Pt@NiOOH and their mixture, on the PEC oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Among the pristine samples, Pt@NiOOH-modified GaAs photoanodes showed the lowest onset potential for PEC water oxidation. Here, we demonstrate Pt@NiOOH/GaAs photoanodes can exhibit an ultrahigh stability of 200 h at a large photocurrent density (>25 mA cm -2 ) in 3-electrode configuration under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination and further provide extremely robust protection for the GaAs surface for over time without any performance degradation, i.e., without any loss of photocurrent, onset potential, or efficiency.

Abstract As the energy industries, such as secondary batteries and fuel cells, expand rapidly, the demand for transition metals used as electrode materials is increasing, which has led to a rise in their prices. One promising strategy to address these challenges is upcycling, which involves recycling transition metal‐based waste from various industries. In this study, a heterostructure electrocatalyst for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is developed by upcycling iron‐based waste from the automotive industry. The iron‐based swarf is converted into single‐phase Fe 2 O 3 by removing surface impurities through calcination in air. Subsequently, NiFe‐LDH is formed via sequential hydrothermal synthesis, resulting in NiFe‐LDH/Fe 2 O 3 heterostructured electrocatalysts. The hetero‐interface between NiFe‐LDH and Fe 2 O 3 significantly reduced the electrochemical activation barrier, enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and, furthermore, achieving high‐performance AEMWE. This approach not only reduces waste but also provides a cost‐effective alternative to traditional materials, highlighting the potential for sustainable and efficient energy solutions.

Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts are pivotal for enhancing the performance of rechargeable zinc-air batteries, particularly in facilitating the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recent strides in electrostatic spinning technology have yielded notable progress in polymer-zinc-air battery systems. This study introduces two innovative methodologies for synthesizing self-supporting flexible bifunctional electrocatalysts featuring hierarchical structures and high catalytic activity through meticulous adjustment of electrostatic spinning parameters. The first approach integrates metal-organic frameworks with electrospinning technology to fabricate FeCoNi nanoparticle-decorated N-doped carbon hierarchical networks. These nanoparticles, originating from Fe 3+ /Co 2+ /Ni 2+ ions within the electrospun fibers, catalyze the pyrolysis of ZIF-67 on the fiber surface, thereby generating reticulated carbon microfibers. The second approach capitalizes on the characteristics of organic salts in polymer solutions via electrospinning to produce FeCoNi flexible carbon nanofibers. These catalysts undergo secondary growth of FeCoNi- and N-doped carbon nanotubes on fiber surfaces, yielding numerous metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) ORR active sites and FeCoNi alloy-based OER active sites. Both methodologies yield bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibiting outstanding ORR and OER activity, surpassing conventional Pt/C and RuO 2 catalysts. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries employing these catalysts demonstrate high peak power density and remarkable cycling stability, positioning them as promising contenders for next-generation energy storage solutions.

Abstract Mechanistic understanding of how electrode–electrolyte interfaces evolve dynamically is crucial for advancing water‐electrolysis technology, especially the restructuring of catalyst surface during complex electrocatalytic reactions. However, for perovskite fluorides, the mechanistic exploration for the influence of the dynamic restructuring on their chemical property and catalytic mechanism is unclear due to their poor conductivity that makes the definition of electrocatalyst structure difficult. Herein, for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), various operando characterizations are employed to investigate the structure‐activity relationships of the KNi x Fe 1‐ x F 3 @NF. Adding iron to the KNi x Fe 1‐ x F 3 structure increases metal vacancies, enhancing electrochemical reconstruction. For reconstructed KNi x Fe 1‐ x F 3 structure, the results from operando Raman, operando X‐ray diffraction, operando UV–vis spectroscopy, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry reveal that the surface Ni sites act as catalytic centers within the amorphous Ni(Fe)OOH active layer, and the incorporation of Fe activates oxidized oxygen ions during water oxidation. Theoretical calculations support this by demonstrating the optimized adsorption‐free energy of oxygenated intermediates. Consequently, the KNi 0.5 Fe 0.5 F 3 @NF achieves an overpotential of 281 mV to reach OER current of 150 mA·cm −2 and maintains stable operation for 200 h. These results highlight a promising pathway to tuning OER mechanisms in perovskite fluorides and offer a new perspective for developing high‐efficiency and durable OER catalysts.

・ Introduction Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is expected to reduce the production cost by using base metals for the electrocatalysts and to have high electrolytic efficiency due to its membrane electrode assembly (MEA) structure. The improvement of electrochemical activity and durability of the catalysts remains one of the essential issues for practical application. At present, Ni based oxide is one of the essentially candidate catalysts for both the anode and cathode of AEMWE. Ni is easily oxidized and formed the oxygen-containing adsorbates. The formation of Ni surface oxides depends strongly on the synthesis condition, dopant elements, and the applied potentials. Their peak assignment in the potential-dependent spectra are only possible with well-controlled surfaces. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the surface states and the catalytic reaction process on Ni oxide surface requires the Ni catalyst with well-controlled surface and a highly sensitive analytic technique. Herein, we introduced the inorganic shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) to confirm the surface states and surface reaction precisely. The SHINERS is the advanced mode of the surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and can detect the Raman signals enhanced by the local electromagnetic field generated on the surface of the nano-amplifier by an applied laser. The SERS has some priorities to detect the signals non-destructively at in situ/operando conditions from extremely small amount of samples at the molecular level, such as self-assembled monolayers and partial surface adsorbates. Introduction of the inorganic shell on the surface of nano-amplifier prevents direct contact and interaction between the sample and the nano-amplifier, selectively detecting intrinsic surface information of samples. In this experiment, the SHINERS technique can provide spectral features of the thin layers of the Ni oxide with high sensitivity and surface selectivity to detect the surface adsorbates in detail. ・ Experiment In situ SHINERS measurements were performed in 0.1 mol L -1 KOH aqueous electrolyte (Ar-saturated) at room temperature, using a homemade in situ Raman cell equipped with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode, while all potentials were quoted vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In the Raman measurements, Au nanoparticles coated with an alkaline-resistant zirconia shell were introduced as an optical nano-amplifier at the surface coverage of ca. 20%. Raman spectra were acquired using the Confocal Microscope Laser Raman Spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR Evolution). The excitation laser source was 632.8 nm He-Ne laser with the typical power of max. 0.1 mW on the surface. The spectrometer was equipped with an 800 mm focal length monochrometer with a long working distance objective lens (50× magnification, OLYMPUS). ・ Results and discussion Electrochemical measurements and in situ SHINERS have captured a detail surface features at different potential range, including the redox profile between metallic Ni and α-Ni(OH) 2 , the phase transition from α-Ni(OH) 2 to β-Ni(OH) 2 , as well as the oxidation process from β-Ni(OH) 2 to β-Ni(O)OH on a flat Ni electrode in alkaline condition, together with the formation of the γ-Ni(O)OH and the precursor species of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the Ni electrode. Weak bands of each oxygen-containing adsorbate in the few layers of surface oxide film were assigned in the function of applied potential, revealing difference with those in literatures observed on the thick layers of Ni oxides. In situ SHINERS studies, incorporated with the electrochemical studies, on a flat Ni electrode allow us to propose a general scheme presenting relationships between the metallic Ni and various oxygen-containing adsorbates formed during the potential scan in the range between hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction. In addition, the potential-dependent catalytic activity of Ni surface and nano-catalysts with be discussed at the conference. Figure 1

Lithium-air batteries (LABs) represent a promising future battery technology due to their high energy density, although several challenges hinder them from achieving their theoretical performance. However, aprotic electrolyte-based LABs face several operational challenges, perhaps with the most severe being the instability of aprotic electrolytes towards reactive O 2 species, nucleophilic attack, and auto-oxidation. 1,2 Compared with aprotic electrolyte-based LABs, organic-free molten salt LABs showed improved oxygen efficiency but required high temperatures to operate the system. 3 Alternatively, inorganic solid state electrolytes could not only enable room temperature and stable performance, but also protect Li metal electrodes from reaction with common air components, such as nitrogen, oxygen, CO 2 , and H 2 O. Recently, a solid state Li-O 2 battery was found to form LiOH as the major discharge product when humidity was introduced into the oxygen feed stream. 4 Our aim is to understand the influence of humidity on the discharge product composition, as well as the reversibility of the full discharge-charge cycle. To do so, we developed a controlled-humidity Differential Electrochemical gas monitoring system, which controls and monitors humidity in the cell headspace while also tracing overall gas consumption and evolution. We will report on solid-state batteries that employ NASICON-type and garnet-phase ion conductors paired with either carbon or MnO 2 cathodes. Our initial results suggest that the discharge product formed is a combination of Li 2 O 2 and LiOH depending on the humidity and cathode composition used. On charge, while oxygen evolution is observed whenever Li 2 O 2 is formed, little O 2 evolution is observed from LiOH, suggesting a parasitic reaction involving LiOH and cell components.

The use of water-in-salt electrolytes has been a transformational advancement in electrochemistry. Water-in-salt electrolytes rely on a super high concentration of salts in aqueous electrolytes to lower the activity of water. The water is occupied in the solvation of the salts, leaving minimal ‘free water’ in the system. In the context of electrodeposition, this results in a widened cathodic window as the limited quantity of protons suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Seldom discussed is the impact on anodic reactions that are also limited by the transport of water for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Lithium chloride (LiCl) has been used as a cost effective and readily available support salt in water-in-salt electrolytes. However, in this system OER competes with chlorine evolution. At low pH chlorine evolution is more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. This reaction depletes the system of chlorine atoms required to solvate excess water and saturates the electrolyte with dissolved chlorine. As a result, the electrolyte has a limited lifetime. One solution to this problem is the use of proton exchange membranes to separate the anode from the cathode. The use of these membranes will be discussed focused on our interest in rhenium (Re) electrodeposition. Rhenium has traditionally been difficult to deposit by electrolysis from aqueous solutions due to the over potential for hydrogen evolution and complex electrochemical reactions. Further, many intermediate rhenium oxides catalyze HER, so maintaining a stable water-in-salt electrolyte is crucial. Herein, we present systematic studies investigating various proton exchange membranes in an H-cell confirmation on the electrodeposition of rhenium. Perfluorosulfonic acid and hydrocarbon polymer backbones are explored, both with sulfonic acid functional groups. As these membranes are semipermeable, membrane thickness is also explored. Both volume changes in the two H-cell components and pH are monitored as a function of time. The impact on the morphology and electrodeposition kinetics of rhenium will be presented as a function of membrane properties.

Understanding the intricate pathways of ethylene carbonate (EC) decomposition is pivotal for enhancing the stability and efficiency of electrolytes in various electrochemical applications. In this study, we delve into the decomposition mechanisms of EC in the presence of superoxide and peroxide species. The decomposition of EC-based electrolytes causes gas (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen) evolution. Since this gas evolution is observed at potentials much lower than the oxidation potential of EC, it has been suggested that the mechanisms leading to decomposition are primarily chemical in nature (i.e., not related to the electrochemical oxidation of EC) and related to the reaction of reactive oxygen [singlet, superoxide, peroxide] with EC. [1,2,3]. Utilizing high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we meticulously explored the reaction networks of EC with superoxide and peroxide species across different cathode voltages. Our findings unveil compelling insights into the primary pathways dictating EC decomposition, which notably occur at potentials significantly lower than the oxidation potential of EC. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to understand the major products of the reaction network. Carbon dioxide is one of the major products in the reaction networks. Other major products include mono-carbonate, formaldehyde and organic products containing O-O in the fragments. We find that the products with O-O bond in the organic chain were also previously observed through mass spectroscopy experiments in [4]. Thus, using high-throughput data-driven approach, we are able to identify novel decomposition pathways of ethylene carbonate near the cathode.

Chemical reforming by electrochemical reaction has attracted great attention due to mild reaction condition and ease of control. As the raw materials for electrochemical reforming, ethylene glycol (EG) is advantageous for its large-scale production and cheap market price. Various organic acids such as glycolic acid (GCA), oxalic acid (OXA) and formic acid (FA) can be produced with simultaneous production of high purity of dihydrogen gas during ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). In particular, EG selective oxidation targeted at the production of GCA, which has broad applications in skin care, textile industry and adhesives. Herein, a noble catalyst material of Pt nanoparticles supported on Se-doped porous carbon (Pt/SePC) is prepared and investigated for the selective EGOR to GCA. The Pt/SePC achieved a maximum EG conversion of 94.6% and GCA selectivity of 84.4%, and maintained this high performance with a negligible degradation during durability tests. The effect of Se doping was investigated through the experimental analyses and theoretical DFT calculations, that lattice deformation and defects introduction caused by Se led to electronic localization in Pt nanoparticle, thus the adsorption energy of intermediate reactants on Pt surface were modified. Furthermore, EGOR required low overpotential compared with oxygen evolution reaction, thus coupling EGOR and hydrogen evolution reaction required potential of 0.60 V while 1.58 V is necessary for water electrolysis. Our study could highlight favorable strategy of catalyst design with heteroatom doping for catalyst stabilization and promoting ethylene glycol conversion to value-added glycolic acid.

Photoelectrochemistry holds the promise of directly converting sunlight to valuable chemical products since its birth over 50 years ago. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods, however, lag behind their electrochemical (EC) counterparts (which can be powered by a solar photovoltaic (PV) power source) in terms of current density, by orders of magnitude. In this work, we demonstrate that by integrating the recent achievements of the PV and EC communities (in terms of using concentrated sunlight and gas diffusion electrodes, respectively), we can achieve current densities similar to EC methods, but with lower energy input. Specifically, in this proof-of-concept study, we combined the direct PEC oxidation of glycerol (on a NiOOH co-catalyst-coated n-Si photoanode) with the dark hydrogen evolution (HER) or CO2 reduction (CO2R) in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) separated continuous-flow PEC cell. We achieved over 110 mA cm–2 photocurrent density under 10 Sun irradiation, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than those typically reported in the literature, for any of these PEC half reactions. We demonstrated that the product distribution of glycerol oxidation is notably different in PEC and EC scenarios at the same current density, and the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be suppressed in the PEC case. This approach raises new opportunities to drive electrochemical reactions with complex reaction pathways in a more selective manner even at high current densities. In the second part of my talk I will demonstrate the effect of the co-catalyst properties in tailoring the product distribution.

Ammonia (NH₃) holds significant importance across various human activities, finding applications in fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and carbon-free energy fuel. Traditionally, NH₃ production relies on the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, leading to substantial CO₂ emissions. As an alternative, there's growing interest in electrochemical NH₃ production. The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO₃RR) is particularly promising due to its low energy barrier, high nitrogen source solubility, and high activity. Molybdenum dichalcogenides (Mo-based TMDs) have emerged as catalysts for electrochemical NH₃ production, leveraging their 2D structure, large surface area, and tunable electrical properties. However, Mo-based TMDs having 2H crystal structure face challenges like low electrical conductivity and high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, which competes with NH₃ production. To address this, we developed various 1T-MoS x Se 2-x /rGO electrocatalysts. These catalysts exhibited a yield rate exceeding 3511.9 μg h -1 cm -2 (at -0.6 V vs. RHE) and a 70 % faradaic efficiency (at -0.2 V vs. RHE) in a 1 M KOH and 0.1 M NaNO₃ solution. And their bifunctional properties (Oxygen evolution reaction, OER) show a low overpotential of 338.8 mV at 10 mA. Our research aims to enhance NO 3 RR under ambient conditions and investigate the potential of bifunctional properties (OER) for the commercialization of electrochemical NH₃ production.

Formate (HCOO − ) production by electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has been paid much attention. To mitigate the energy loss associated with the purification and compression of CO 2 gas, electrochemical conversion of in-situ generated CO 2 from liquid bicarbonate (HCO 3 − ) feedstock has been developed instead of supplying CO 2 gas. However, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate production was low, necessitating the suppression of competing hydrogen evolution reactions. In this study, the configuration of the electrolyzer was optimized for highly efficient formate synthesis by bicarbonate electrolysis. We used electrodeposited bismuth crystallites as a cathode catalyst for CO 2 RR. FE was improved by using a hydrophilic membrane filter to reduce the H + concentration on the cathode catalyst surface, thereby decreasing hydrogen evolution capability. Increasing the flow rate of 3 M KHCO 3 solution further enhanced the FE by promoting efficient H + consumption with bicarbonate to generate CO 2 . At a high flow rate condition (32 mL/min), the FE was over 90% at 100 mA/cm 2 at 1.60 V (vs. RHE), comparable to conventional gas-fed CO 2 electrolyzer performance. High selectivity at 100 mA/cm 2 with low cell voltage (3.1 V without iR compensation) was achieved over 30 hours when using an IrO 2 anode catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. This work presents a simple and effective approach for highly selective formate synthesis at a high current density by improving the efficiency of H + consumption and CO 2 generation inside the bicarbonate electrolyzer.

INTRODUCTION The quest for sustainable and efficient hydrogen production has led to the exploration of various catalyst materials for seawater electrolysis, a promising avenue for renewable energy generation. Seawater, abundant and accessible, offers a compelling resource for electrolytic hydrogen production, but its high salinity and corrosive nature pose challenges for catalyst stability and performance. The development of efficient catalysts capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of seawater while achieving high oxygen evolution efficiency (OEE) has captured the attention of researchers in this field. The development of high activity/high stability/low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for large-scale production is an important issue for academia and the industry today [1]. Although RuO 2 and IrO 2 noble metal oxides are considered the most efficient OER electrocatalysts, their high costs, apparent scarcity, and low stability have greatly impeded their large-scale application as OER electrocatalysts [2]. In recent years, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum and other transition metals have emerged as promising candidates for catalyzing the OER in seawater electrolysis applications. Cobalt oxide electrodes are well-known for their catalytic activity towards the OER and stability in alkaline medium specially when it modified with other transition metals such as Mo [3]. Some researchers use manganese as anodic catalysts for oxygen evolution from seawater or MnO 2 decorated with Co 3 O 4 yields the best performances in alkaline seawater splitting [4]. Also, these electrodes were applied on FTO surface in acid medium [5]. We consider testing cobalt (Co) and Co mixed with molybdenum are important challenge in acidic medium under high current density. The present work aimed to (i) determine the optimum conditions for production of durable Co/Ti and Co-Mo/Ti anodes using a fast and easy fabricated method. (ii) focus on durability test of these electrodes under high current density without using intermediate conductive layer (iii) comparative analysis involves evaluating various aspects including catalytic activity, stability, structural properties, and OEE. EXPERIMENTAL First, the titanium substrate underwent a treatment for surface roughening. Subsequently, the treated titanium substrate was coated with cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) through the calcination of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O) dissolved in a butanol solution, which was then brushed onto the substrate. Using the same method, a Co-Mo oxide was also prepared by calcinating butanol solutions of Co(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O and molybdenum chloride (MoCl 5 ) at 450°C. The fabricated electrodes were characterized by XRD and EPMA to examine the structural and elemental properties of these electrodes. Moreover, electrochemical testing was conducted to evaluate the catalytic activity and stability of the electrodes during seawater electrolysis. The performance of the electrode was examined by electrolysis of 0.5 M NaCl solution at 1000Am -2 . The OEE was estimated by the difference between the total charge passed during electrolysis and the formation charge of chlorine analyzed by iodometric titration. Polarization curves were measured using multi electrochemical measurement system. Correction for iR drop was made with a current-interruption technique. Durability test was measured using DC power supply 30V/5A. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This study compares the performance of cobalt oxide electrodes, a well-established material for seawater electrolysis, with cobalt-molybdenum oxide composite electrodes. SEM images show the mesoporous structure for Ti/Co-Mo electrodes which is suitable for various applications (Fig. 1). X-ray diffraction clarified that all fabricated electrode consisted of free Co 3 O 4 on Ti plate and cobalt molybdenum oxide composite on Ti plate. EPMA indicate that the samples contain Co, Ti, O and/or Mo for the modified electrode. Polarization curves and OEE analysis indicate that incorporating Mo to Co electrode enhances efficiency and reduces resistance. Additionally, the resulting electrode composition exhibits a porous structure expecting high performance in electrolysis. Mo addition led to a decrease in polarization potential, and the analysis of polarization curves showed that Mo addition increased the specific conductivity of the oxide. The value of the OEE is 18.98% for Co-Mo electrode compared to 13.15% for only Co electrode. Durability tests were conducted to evaluate the stability of both electrodes at a current density of 1000 A/m² over an extended period. The results indicate that the Co-Mo electrode exhibits inferior stability for two weeks and higher OEE compared to Co electrode under the same operating conditions.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a promising technology for green hydrogen production to reduce carbon emissions in industrial and heavy-duty transportation sectors. AEMWE has the advantage of using nonplatinum group metal oxides for the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and therefore lower the capital expenditure comparing to proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). However, the commercialization and deployment of AEMWE in large scale is still limited by its durability. Herein, we study how electrode structure and the cell operating conditions affect the cell stability and performance. Catalyst layer structures, including porosity and tortuosity, were investigated and correlated with cell performance for better understanding and designing AEMWE. Durability of different catalyst layers were investigated and correlated with catalyst layer structure and ionomer stability. Electrode fabrication methods were found to have significant impact on the catalyst layer structure and therefore catalyst utilization. With a doctor blading method to fabricate the catalyst layer, electrodes were scaled up from 5 cm -2 to >25cm -2 with negligible voltage loss. With these findings, cell performance was improved towards <1.8V at 2A cm -2 and durability of >500h was achieved at 2A cm -2 for a 25 cm -2 cell in 0.5M KOH.

Metal oxides such as TiO 2 are widely used as electrocatalysts and photo-responsive electrodes in various electrochemical devices, and many researchers have studied them. However, the reaction processes at their interfaces are generally complex, and there are many aspects that remain to be elucidated. Even for TiO 2 electrodes, which have been the most widely studied, the mechanism of interfacial reactions still remains unclear, especially the effects of crystal faces and atomic- to nano-level surface structures on electrode reactions. Our group has been investigated how the atomic- to nano-level structure of the TiO2 electrode surface affects the reaction at the TiO 2 electrode interface. In our previous study, we revealed that the water photooxidation reaction (i.e. oxygen evolution reaction) on TiO 2 surface accompanies with other three kinds of side reactions (photoluminescence (PL), surface roughening and non-radiative recombination) [1]. These reactions are competitive with each other and the ratio of their quantum efficiencies strongly depends on the atomic-scale surface local structure. Thus, we investigated the surface local structure dependence of those competitive reactions on TiO 2 surface using atomically flat TiO 2 (rutile) single crystal electrode those step-terrace structure was strictly controlled. It was revealed that the ratio of the quantum efficiency of four kinds of reactions strongly depends on the surface local structure such as step-terrace structure. On the other hand, the surface roughening process, which is one of the four competitive reactions, induced the drastic change of the surface local structure and also induced the change in the ratio of quantum efficiency of four kinds of competitive reactions, leading to the increase of the photocatalytic activity for oxygen photoevolution [2]. Such an investigation would be very important because some recent studies indicate that the surface local structure changes during the photooxidation process even in the case of practical catalyst. We also investigated the influence of nanostructure formed on the TiO 2 electrode on the branch ratio of 4 competitive photooxidation reactions. We found that the overvoltage for O 2 evolution on nanostructured electrode was decreased comparing with that on atomically flat (100) surface. We can explain these results by the spatial configuration of edge and facet sites which depends on the surface nanostructure. The organic synthesis by using of photooxidation reaction on photocatalysis has been investigated by many researchers. Although the formation of phenol from benzene on TiO 2 surface by photo-induced oxidation reaction is one of the representative reactions, its molecular mechanism is still unclear. We can assumed that the quantum efficiencies of phenol generation depends on the atomic-scale surface local structure. We investigated the atomic leveled surface local structure dependence of the efficiency of photooxidation reaction of benzene (in HClO 4aq solution) on Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (110) single crystal electrode. It was found that the efficiency of the photooxidation reaction of benzene is largely affected by the step structure on the TiO 2 surface [3]. Detailed analysis of the dependence on surface structure revealed that the photooxidation reaction of benzene and the photoinduced decomposition of water (Oxygen evolution reaction) proceed competitively via the same intermediate, and that the ratio of their efficiencies is strongly affected by the step direction and step density.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a pivotal role in various electrochemical processes, from water splitting to CO 2 electroreduction and metal-air batteries. However, the sluggish kinetics of OER, involving multi-electron transfer, necessitate the development of catalysts with high activity and stability. While platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts like IrO 2 and RuO 2 exhibit high OER activity in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis, their cost hinders widespread adoption. Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (AEMWE) emerges as a promising technology with the potential to be both cost-effective and sustainable for hydrogen production. It relies on PGM-free OER catalysts, bridging the gap and merging the strengths of PEM and traditional alkaline electrolysis systems Transition metal (TM) oxides, layered double hydroxides, and oxyphosphides, particularly those incorporating Ni, Fe, and Co, emerge as promising OER catalysts for alkaline water electrolysis. Yet, comparing different catalysts remains challenging due to varied testing protocols that influence reported performances, often referenced to geometric surface area. Herein, we address this challenge by evaluating the intrinsic activity and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of PGM-free OER catalysts. Employing a colloidal synthesis approach, TM catalysts were synthesized and tested for OER activity and durability in 1 M KOH. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging revealed a unique porous structure surrounding a metallic core. To estimate the ECSA, cyclic voltammograms were recorded at various scan rates in a non-Faradaic region. The double layer capacitance (C dl ) was evaluated from the slope of current versus scan rate, and a specific capacitance of 40 μF cm -2 was used to calculate the ECSA. [1-4] Preliminary results demonstrate a direct correlation between OER activity and ECSA. The correlation between the BET surface and OER activity was also studied.

Low-price, high-performance, and long-term stability electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly significant in the application of rechargeable zinc air batteries. In this study, we report a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for flexible Zn air batteries featuring pyridinic-N exclusively enriched carbon-nanotube-encased nickel-iron (NiFe) interfacial alloy nanoparticles derived from an LDH template on knitted carbon fiber cloth. NiFe nanoparticles are catalytically released from the NiFe-MOF to form CNT tentacles when pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere. XPS and XAS studies revealed the dominating presence of pyridinic-N, which reduces electron localization around NiFe centers and improves the interaction with oxygenated species. As a result, the NiFe-N-CNT-KCC catalysts exhibited a low operating overpotential (η 10 ) of 173 mV for the OER and a half-wave potential (E 1/2 ) of 0.87 V for the ORR, superior to benchmark electrocatalysts. As an air cathode for zinc-air batteries, the NiFe-N-CNT-KCC-based battery showed excellent electrochemical performance, with an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.55 V, high power density (153 mW cm -2 ), excellent specific capacity of 793.2 mA h g -1 , and long-term stability. Most impressively, the solid-state flexible zinc-air battery with the NiFe-N-CNT-KCC cathode showed admirable rate performance and exceptional mechanical stability under arbitrary bending and twisting conditions, holding great potential in practical implementation in next-generation high-power and high-energy-density batteries, even with the potential for wearable applications.

The production of hydrogen has been extensively studied since hydrogen is an ideal energy, high quality and clean energy carrier. Currently, the hydrogen is mainly produced by the fossil fuels or other carbon-based fuels. However, the production technology of hydrogen via the fossil fuels causes global warming by emitting environmental pollutions such as CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 . Thus, a lot of efforts have been dedicated to the production of hydrogen through the clean renewable energy sources such as water, biomass. Among these technologies, an alkaline water electrolysis has been considered as the promising candidate for the green hydrogen technology. The high catalytic activity and durability of the electrodes should be guaranteed for commercialization of alkaline water electrolysis. Platinum group metals are renowned for their exceptional catalytic activity in alkaline water electrolysis. However, their widespread commercial adoption is hindered by the substantial costs involved and their tendency to dissolve during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For this reason, catalysts from the hydroxide family, such as NiFe LDH, currently dominate the field of OER catalysis. This paper introduces a novel technique: hydrating metal substrates to significantly enhance OER efficiency. Utilizing a straightforward hydration, the hydroxide layer with a thickness of only a few nanometers can be developed on the Ni surface.The ability to significantly enhance OER performance through the simple hydration of metals suggests a promising strategy for the development of new electrocatalysts.

Abstract Iridium (Ir)‐based electrocatalysts have long been employed as the benchmark for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, but further to improve their catalytic activity still facing great challenges. Herein, alkali metal K is incorporated to induce the in situ construction of a core‐shell hybrid of K‐IrO x thin skin‐wrapped metallic Ir (K‐IrO x /Ir) to boost the acidic OER. The K‐IrO x /Ir exhibits exceptional catalytic performance with a long lasting stability of 3000 h operation and a low overpotential of 199 mV to reach the 10 mA cm −2 . Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies revealed that the enrichment of K in the low‐coordination IrO x shell induces a significant compressive strain, which regulates the Ir─O bond properties and further optimizes the adsorption energy of rate‐limiting intermediates, favoring of the enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, the surface IrO x active layer is well maintained during the OER process thanks to the mixed‐valence state and intensified electronic interaction in core‐shell hybrid that inhibit the overoxidation and dissolution of Ir, responsible for the outstanding stability. This work offers a novel strategy for developing high performance acidic OER catalysts by the design of favorable mesostructured architectures with mixed metal states to enable the intensified electronic interaction and strain effect.

Metal-air batteries as alternatives to the existing lithium-ion battery are becoming increasingly attractive sources of power due to their high energy-cost competitiveness and inherent safety; however, their low oxygen evolution and reduction reaction (OER/ORR) performance and poor operational stability must be overcome prior to commercialization. Herein, it is demonstrated that a novel class of hydrothermally grown dual-phase heterogeneous electrocatalysts, in which silver-manganese (AgMn) heterometal nanoparticles are anchored on top of 2D nanosheet-like nickel vanadium oxide (NiV 2 O 6 ), allows an enlarged surface area and efficient charge transfer/redistribution, resulting in a bifunctional OER/ORR superior to those of conventional Pt/C or RuO 2 . The dual-phase NiV 2 O 6 /AgMn catalysts on the air cathode of a zinc-air battery lead to a stable discharge–charge voltage gap of 0.83 V at 50 mA cm −2 , with a specific capacity of 660 mAh g −1 and life cycle stabilities of more than 146 h at 10 mA cm −2 and 11 h at 50 mA cm −2 . The proposed new class of dual-phase NiV 2 O 6 /AgMn catalysts are successfully applied as pouch-type zinc-air batteries with long-term stability over 33.9 h at 10 mA cm −2 . Figure 1

Electrochemical alcohol oxidation (AOR) is an attractive replacement for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in hydrogen production. Compared to OER, AOR has a lower thermodynamic potential and produces higher value products. Nickel-mediated AOR has been proposed to proceed through a chemical, redox pathway preferred by aldehydes (geminal diols in alkaline electrolyte), and a potential dependent pathway preferred by alcohols. The precise mechanism of these reactions and their effects on the material are not well understood. Using furfural and furfuryl alcohol as model molecules, we elucidate the mechanism of nickel-mediated AOR. In-situ tracking of the Ni K edge using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals nickel is at a more reduced state during AOR compared to when no organic reactant is present. The nickel oxidation state profile, however, varies depending on the reactant present (furfural vs. furfuryl alcohol). Product analysis shows that competition for catalytic sites with OER at high potential could contribute to these differences. Microkinetic modeling explores the potential dependence of the Ni K edge position by studying the interplay between the rate of electrochemical nickel oxidation and its chemical reduction through reaction with alcohol. Understanding this relationship will identify rate-limiting steps and active (and inactive) phases for AOR. Insights from this model system will motivate novel guidelines for AOR catalyst design.

Abstract To address the urgent need for sustainable energy processes, there is a growing demand for multifunctional materials that mimic natural photosynthetic enzyme functions, specifically light‐harvesting, efficient photoinduced charge separation, and integration of molecularly defined catalysts, synergistically interacting within these structures. Herein, the successful synthesis of an innovative Covalent Organic Framework ( COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ ) constructed from optically active triazine (TFPT) and isoquinoline units (IsoQ) as building blocks is reported. Post‐synthetic incorporation of a Ru(bda)‐based water oxidation catalyst (WOC) is achieved through the IsoQ moieties acting as coordinating sites. Leveraging the synthetic flexibility of the designed COF architecture featuring binding sites on its pore walls, various Ru@COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ systems at different Ru:COF ratios are synthesized and tested in the photoinduced (λ > 400 nm) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under sacrificial conditions. All synthesized Ru@COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ systems demonstrate efficiency in the photocatalytic OER, with the highest turnover number (TON) of 9.1 observed for the system where the Ru‐based WOC is incorporated every fourth COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ unit cell. This work provides valuable insights into the structural integration and catalytic behavior of Ru‐based complexes within COF architectures, highlighting the potential of Ru@COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ as a robust, efficient, and synthetically flexible multifunctional material for light‐induced water oxidation catalysis.

Anion exchange membrane electrolysis enables the use of earth abundant metals for the catalyst and other components of the membrane electrode assembly. However, earth abundant metal catalysts may be sensitive to poisoning and degradation due to the extreme pH of the electrolyte or interactions with the ionomer. Plane-wave density functional theory calculations probed the binding strength of different functional groups from popular ionomers (Nafion, Sustainion, tetramethylammonium-based ETFE/Gen 2/Georgia Tech, Versogen) on model catalysts such as Platinum Group Metal IrO 2 and earth abundant NiO. 1 We evaluated the stability of these various ionomers on these model catalysts, whether they remain intact or degrade, as well as their catalytic effects on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) e.g. in the presence of OH*. These calculations allowed us to understand the poisoning of active sites: 1) if the functional group bound more strongly than key reaction intermediates, then the ionomer effectively blocked activity by displacing the reaction intermediate; 2) if the functional group introduced competing reactions, then the ionomer was consuming the O x H y * intermediates necessary for OER. Ideally, ionomers remain stable in contact with the catalyst and shuttle hydroxide ions from the cathode to the anode. 1. S. Ghoshal, B. S. Pivovar and S. M. Alia, J.

Clean hydrogen, produced through water electrolysis using renewables, is a promising means of decarbonization for hard-to-abate sectors, including transportation, industry, and chemical sectors. Proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers are one of the leading electrolysis technologies amongst other types of electrolyzers available today with their compact design and rapid response time, which align well with the requirements of renewable energy integration. However, cost remains a major challenge in further adoption of this technology. Specifically, the high cost and limited availability of iridium catalysts used in the anode for oxygen evolution reaction are predicted to become the bottleneck at the gaga-watt (GW) scale, necessitating catalyst loading reduction and recycling processes. In this work, we present the ionomer-free nano-channeled porous transport electrodes (PTEs) aimed at reducing the cost of PEM water electrolyzers. The nano-channeled PTEs demonstrate superior current density (> 9 A/cm 2 below 3 V) and reduces overpotential by 190 mV compared to baseline ionomer-free PTEs. In addition, nano-channeled electrodes show minimal degradation after 100k cycles of accelerated stress tests. Decay rate of 11.66 µV/h was achieved over 2000 h operation at 1.8 A/cm 2 . These results highlight the significance of the localized transport dynamics at the electrode interface in PEM water electrolyzers.

CO 2 reduction is an important step in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The utilization of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) realizes high current density CO 2 reduction. However, most of the developed CO 2 reduction catalysts suffer from low Faradaic efficiency when using a proton exchange membrane MEA, due to low local pH surrounding catalysts. Alternatively, with an anion exchange membrane MEA, CO 2 reduction suffers from low conversion efficiency due to carbonate-bicarbonate crossover through the membrane to the anode. For continuously-running CO 2 electrolyzers, the crossover of acids and cations results in low reduction efficiency and flooding of the GDE. We have designed and characterized an asymmetric membrane that prohibits carbonate-bicarbonate crossover, yet can maintain a high local pH surrounding the catalyst. The resulting MEA can achieve high Faradaic efficiency toward CO 2 reduction using developed catalysts with near-zero CO 2 crossover. When using oxygen evolution in the anode, we further developed an ion-blockage strategy to diminish the crossover of acids or cations during long-term operation, maintaining a relatively stable and suitable environment for CO 2 reduction on GDE. The crossover management of carbonate, bicarbonate, protons and cations can lead to a long lifetime high-efficiency CO 2 electrolyzer.

Tungsten trioxide (WO 3 ) and titanium oxide are known as photocatalysts that oxidize and decompose organic compounds. Hydroxyl radicals (•OH) generated during water oxidation not only decompose organic substances but also cause other selective oxidation reactions. However, the behavior of •OH production under different reaction conditions is not completely understood. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively analyze the •OH generated during the photoanodic reaction on photocatalyst electrodes. Herein, we developed a novel electrolyte flow-type electron spin resonance (ESR) method using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N -oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping agent to analyze the Faraday efficiency of •OH production in near real-time response. The WO 3 photoanode was prepared by a dip coating method using Ti felt as the conductive substrate. When the WO 3 electrode was irradiated with ultraviolet light at 1.2 V vs. RHE, four ESR signals were observed, and the formation of •OH (•DMPO-OH) was confirmed from the g value and hyperfine coupling constant. The amount of •OH produced was quantified every minute by comparing the double-integrated intensity of this signal with that of a standard sample. The results showed that the Faraday efficiency of the total amount of •OH in WO 3 was low, less than 1%, and most of the photocurrent was used for oxygen evolution reaction. In the presentation, we will also report on the dependence of •OH formation on applied potential and incident light intensity. Figure 1

Abstract Seawater electrolysis is an effective way for large‐scale green hydrogen. Nevertheless, the anode suffers from the severe corrosion of Cl − and Br − during oxygen evolution, which gives rise to the issues of narrow‐deep pits and shallow‐wide pits, respectively. Herein, an anti‐corrosion strategy is presented by self‐adapting oxyanion armor to prevent the high valence active sites from Cl − and Br − corrosion. The core–shell FeNi 2 Se 4 @NiFe‐Phy is reconstructed to active species NiFeOOH covered by an oxyanion layer composed of phosphoric and carbonate. The aimed anode exhibits remarkable efficiency, achieving current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm −2 at overpotentials of merely 220 and 277 mV, respectively. Notably, it shows unparalleled durability, enduring without any discernible degradation following rigorous testing for 400 h at 400–1000 mA cm −2 in alkaline simulated seawater, as well as natural seawater. A combination of density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations further confirms the bifunctional enhancement of oxyanion armor on NiFeOOH surface. At a current density of 200 mA cm −2 , the alkaline seawater electrolyzer has significant energy efficiency, consuming merely 4.61 and 4.27 kWh Nm −3 H 2 at room temperature and 80 °C, respectively. This work offers an efficacious surface corrosion resistance strategy for anode protection during seawater electrolysis.

Abstract Water oxidation, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is the anodic process in electrocatalytic production of hydrogen and further green fuels. Transition‐metal oxyhydroxides with bulk‐phase OER activity of the complete material or amorphized near‐surface regions are of prime application interest, but their basic electrochemical properties are insufficiently understood. Here the timescale of functional processes is clarified by time‐resolved X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for a thickness‐series of cobalt oxyhydroxides films (about 35–550 nm). At the outer material surface, an electric double‐layer is formed in microseconds followed by clearly cobalt‐centered redox‐state changes of the bulk material in the low millisecond domain and a slow chemical step of O 2 ‐formation, within hundreds of milliseconds. Conceptually interesting, the electrode potential likely controls the OER rate indirectly by driving the catalyst material to an increasingly oxidized state which promotes the rate‐limiting chemical step. Rate constants are derived for redox chemistry and catalysis from EIS data of low‐thickness catalyst films; at higher thicknesses, catalyst‐internal charge transport limitations become increasingly relevant. Relations between electrochemically active surface area, double‐layer capacitance, and redox (pseudo‐)capacitance are discussed. These results can increase the power of EIS analyses and support knowledge‐guided optimization of a broader class of OER catalyst materials.

To meet increasing demands for carbon-reduction, renewable and low-emission fuel alternatives have been proposed as a replacement for carbon-intense natural gas and coal. Specifically, hydrogen and oxygen evolution have been demonstrated at the lab-scale through a room temperature water-splitting process using only water, sunlight, and suspended semiconductor nanoparticles as inputs. Recent advancements in improving the efficiency of this water-splitting process focus on methods to boost charge separation, chemical selectivity, and optical band-engineering. However, there is a growing need for demonstrations at scale that also consider nano-particle interactions as an ensemble. Additionally, Z-scheme reactor designs have motivated the study of oxidation and reduction half-reactions using charge-carrying ions as an intermediary. This work studies how photocatalytic rates of half-reactions driven by semiconductor nano-particle suspension are affected by the inevitable presence of aggregation and agglomeration. The effects of solution pH, Fe(III) concentration, input light intensity, reaction temperature, stirring and sonication, nanoparticle concentration and size, and material quality are experimentally characterized by the desired ion evolution reaction rates and external quantum yield. Additionally, the effects of these variables on the zeta potential, optical scattering, particle aggregation, and mass transport are also experimentally measured to probe ensemble behavior and nano-particle interactions. Results indicate the importance of balancing ion concentration and pH to reduce aggregation via enhanced zeta potential nanoparticle repulsion, while also avoiding competitive absorption from suspended intermediary ions and their respective pH-dependent hydrolysis states. Reaction modeling further motivates investigation into charge-transfer limitations and enhancements due to aggregation states that cannot be explained by optical effects alone.

Water splitting holds significant promise for sustainable hydrogen production without carbon emissions. To develop electrodes suitable for large-scale hydrogen generation, characteristics such as large surface area, low electrical resistance, high electrocatalytic activity, and enduring operational stability are paramount. In our investigation, we've engineered high-performance water-splitting electrodes (WSEs) with exceptionally low overpotentials and robust stability through a process integrating carbonization and interfacial assembly-induced electrodeposition. These electrodes feature high-quality electrocatalytic structures based on transition metals (Ni, Fe, and Co), facilitated by strong electronic interactions. They exhibit low sheet resistance akin to bulk metals, a porous 3D architecture with ample specific surface area, and robust interfacial adhesion between the textile-based support and electrocatalysts. Our methodology begins with textiles, transformed into hydrophilic conductive substrates via carbonization and acid treatment, with additional amine molecule incorporation to enhance support-electrocatalyst interactions. Notably, our hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes demonstrate extremely low overpotentials (12 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for HER, 186 mV at 50 mA cm −2 for OER) under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, our full-cell electrodes exhibit sustained water-splitting activity at diverse current density from 10 to 2000 mA cm −2 for at least 2100 hours in 1 M KOH solution. We anticipate that our methodology lays a foundational framework for the development of commercially viable, high-performance WSEs.

Considering energy-related technologies including rechargeable batteries and water electrolysis, effective catalytic materials play a crucial role in the rise and unceasing development. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn attention due to their abundant and identical catalytic sites along the periodic network with tunable catalytic functionality and stability. Herein, structural information, catalytic sites, and their corresponding mechanistic pathways have been investigated by employing synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The framework stability, the accessible active sites related to pre-designed metal clusters, the alteration of oxidation state of, and the coordination geometry around the active metal centers evolving along the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are thoroughly revealed. In addition, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising energy storage systems due to their cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness. However, there are some limitations restricting their practical utilizations such as the high activity of water leading to Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution, along with the formation of dendrites on the Zn surface during repeated charge–discharge cycles. To limit parasitic side reactions, an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) protective layer made of a covalent organic framework (COFs) is an effective strategy. Herein, grazing-incidence XAS was employed to specifically characterize the Zn speciation on the electrode surface. According to XAS results, the protective COF-ASEI layer can retard the coordination of water at the electrolyte–Zn interface, improve Zn plating/stripping kinetics, and increase the stability of the Zn anode. This presentation highlights the significance of synchrotron characterizations in energy-related technologies.

Developing durable catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for advancing the hydrogen economy. Here, we reported OER catalyst based on cobalt spinel oxide with ultrahigh activity and remarkable durability for the acidic OER. Specifically, the as-prepared NiCo 2 O 4 displayed a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 , respectively. More importantly, at a high current density of 100 mA/cm 2 , NiCo 2 O 4 also delivered a low overpotential of 395 mV and a high mass stability of 384 h/mg, demonstrating its exceptional durability. Furthermore, as X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies revealed that Ni mainly occupied the octahedral site in the NiCo 2 O 4 spinel structure. With Ni in the lattice, the structural integrity was maintained during the OER, which led to its outstanding durability. Density functional theory calculations showed that the acidic OER on the NiCo 2 O 4 spinel structure underwent a direct O-O coupling mechanism on the (001) facet rather than the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. Our calculation demonstrated that the metal vacancy formation is significantly suppressed with Ni in the structure. Ni can also prevent surface electronic relaxation during the OER cycles, consistent with the superior durability provided by NiCo 2 O 4 . This study demonstrated a promising and cost-effective approach to producing nickel cobalt spinel oxides with outstanding acidic OER performance. The markedly improved OER activity and durability in acidic media promise an attractive catalyst material for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers and renewable chemical fuel generation.

Numerous electrochemical catalysts have been manufactured through various combiantions since the past, and they have been used in various fields. Among them, perovskite-based electrochemcial catalysts have high durability and electrochemical properties since they are composed of inorganic oxides. In addition, the electrochemical perovskite catalyst based on the transition metals shows comparable performance with high economic feasibility compared to the precious metal-based catalysts. In this study, double perovskite with a structure of A 2 BB’O 6 containing the existing transition metal in the b-site are utilized to carefully modify the electrochemical properties. In order to utilize tungsten that has excellent electrochemical property, double perovskite structure was used because it is difficult to dope tungsten in a general single perovskite with stable structure. Tungsten is normally equilibrium in the metallic phase, but the oxidation state changes from 4 + to 6 + in the oxide phase when electrons start to move rapidly, consequently boosting the electrochemical property. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a tungsten-based double perovskite catalyst by a solid-state method with calcium(Ca) doped into the b-site to stabilize the perovskite structure. An exsolution method is also applied to form a myriad of metals on the catalyst surface by breaking the meta-oxide bond in the perovskite structure. These metal nanoparticles formed on the surface can promote the activity of the electro chemical catalysts with improved electrochemical properties in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism. To analyze the physical and chemical characteristics, X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rietveld refinement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are carried out. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) system is utilized to confirm the electrochemical performance of the prepared samples. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements, oxygen involved reactions are performed to prove the possibility on the W-based double perovskite materials as an oxygen electrocatalyst for water electrolysis with low-price.

Recently, we introduced respirometric methods for real-time monitoring of corrosion, both for atmospheric corrosion [1] and immersion conditions [2]. The approach is based on monitoring the rate of the cathodic reactions with help of different types of sensors; this enables to track the O 2 reduction reaction and the H 2 evolution reaction simultaneously. The set-ups have been used to study different corrosion scenarios under free corrosion conditions. Even more recently, the respirometric setups were coupled with electrochemistry [3, 4], enabling the corrosion cases to be studied not only at open-circuit conditions but also for potential-controlled systems. With this, it is possible for instance to de-convolute the sum current measured by potentiodynamic polarization curves into different cathodic and anodic partial reaction rates. For passive metal and alloys, transpassive dissolution is being explored, by quantification of the amount of oxygen evolving during transpassive dissolution that typically occurs at potentials above the water stability region (i.e., the net anodic electrical current/charge is a sum of partial currents for oxygen evolution reaction, OER, and for metal oxidation/dissolution). Therefore, a true metal oxidation rate can be determined that is not directly assessable from the electrochemical measurement. Examples will be presented, to illustrate the potential of these techniques to reveal insights into corrosion mechanisms of active and passive metals and alloys. References M. Strebl, M. Bruns, S.

Hypochlorite (OCl - ) has various uses such as wastewater treatment, sterilization, and bleaching. Generally, OCl - (in basic condition, NaOCl) is produced by dissolving Cl 2 gas into aqueous NaOH. Cl 2 gas has intrinsic problems of carry, storage, and safety use because of its toxicity, and it is desirable to avoid using Cl 2 gas. Electrolysis of a NaCl aqueous solution is one of the methods to produce OCl - from the oxidation of the chloride ion without using Cl 2 gas. However, there is a problem of selectivity because the reaction potentials between O 2 evolution and OCl - production are close. Also, Cl - can cause electrodes corrosion. To overcome these problems encountered in the ClO - production, we focus our attention on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes which have low electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation to O 2 , combined with high physical and chemical stability. BDD electrodes are prepared by microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), introducing H 2 gas for the plasma, in combination with CH 3 COCH 3 and B(OCH 3 ) 3 as source of carbon and boron, respectively. The electrolytic solutions were 0.5 M NaCl at pH 11 (in mixed 0.1 M Na 3 PO 4 and Na 2 HPO 4 ) and at pH 14 (in 1 M NaOH). Electrolysis was performed for 1 hour by chronoamperometry (CA) using 1% BDD as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) as the reference electrode. To optimize the conditions, electrolysis of NaCl solution was performed in various conditions, such as pH, applied potentials, and electrolyte salts. The solutions at each pH were prepared with phosphate buffer and NaOH. To detect and quantify the produced OCl - , UV-vis spectra were measured, which show a peak at 292 nm for OCl - . The amount of OCl - produced after the electrolysis was quantified according to the calibration curve of absorption vs OCl - concentration, furthermore the faradaic efficiency was calculated. To compare the efficiency, selectivity, and stability with other standard electrodes, grassy carbon electrode was also used for the electrolysis. After 1 hour electrolysis of NaCl solution at pH 14, no absorbance peak was observed at 292 nm and OCl - was not detected. On the other hand, after 1 hour electrolysis of NaCl solution at pH 11, OCl - was detected within all the potential range. Also, after the electrolysis of the solution at pH 9, OCl - was detected. These results showed that NaCl solutions at lower pH were beneficial to produce OCl - . Fig.1 shows the OCl - production and faradaic efficiency for each electrolysis potential at pH11. As the applied potential was increased, the OCl - production increased accordingly. The faradaic efficiency also increased with the potential reaching around 70% with the electrolysis at 6.0 V for 1 hour. Reasonably, the remaining 30% of the current is used in the competing reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction. In line with this hypothesis, at pH 14 only oxygen evolution reaction occurred without OCl - production, because water oxidation is favored at high pH. Though OCl - production occurred with the glassy carbon electrodes, the faradaic efficiency was lower than that with BDD electrodes. When the applied potential was the same 3.0 V, the faradaic efficiency with BDD was higher than that with GC (BDD:28.9%, GC:18.9%), though OCl - production was similar (BDD: 130μmol cm -2 , GC: 134μmol cm -2 ). The surface condition of GC changed from smooth to rough, while BDD showed negligible modifications. Therefore, BDD electrode is better for OCl - production in selectivity and stability than glassy carbon electrode. Figure 1

Biomass holds promise as a substitute for carbon sources derived from fossil fuels, which are known for their production of CO 2 emissions and contribution to microplastic pollution. 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has emerged as a green plastic because it is a monomer of poly(ethylene furoate), poised as a viable alternative to poly(ethylene terephthalate) due to its robust mechanical properties and environmentally sustainable production. An electrochemical oxidation reaction of HMF to FDCA (HMFOR) has been studied actively due to the high performance and cost-effectiveness of transition metal catalysts. Furthermore, it demonstrates a lower overpotential for water splitting by substituting the anodic reaction from oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to HMFOR with value-added FDCA production than oxygen. The majority of HMFOR research has been carried out in highly alkaline media (1 M KOH) because the OH - serves as a reactant and accelerates the HMFOR. Nevertheless, this approach is not conducive to scaling up concentrated HMFOR processes due to the risk of high OH - concentrations, which leads to the instability of HMF through polymerization into humin. Herein, we investigate the HMFOR under mild alkaline media, ensuring the preservation of HMF, facilitated by a Cu-Ni based catalyst. In contrast to the conditions at high pH, the oxidation of aldehyde groups was inhibited due to the lack of sufficient OH - , which hindered the OH - mediated formation of germinal diols. Through several in situ studies, we proposed that Cu induces the adsorption of OH - and HMF, promoting the geminal diol formation, and Ni acts as the most active site of HMFOR. This research would be expected to provide strategies for achieving highly efficient HMFOR while maintaining the stability of HMF via suppression of the OH - mediated humin polymerization.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in ambient electrolyzers consumes a significant amount of energy and yields oxygen, an inherently low-value product. Therefore, it is imperative to choose anodic reactions that can make efficient use of the supplied energy to the electrolyzer when paired with a desired cathodic reaction such as CO 2 reduction into value-added commodities. Utilizing biomass oxidation offers a promising avenue to reduce the overall energy input by >50% while producing high-value chemicals, and address the critical requirements for biomass conversion, a crucial 21st-century non-fossil carbon resource. In this work, we demonstrate the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as an alternative to OER. This reaction not only reduces the theoretical overall energy input into the electrolyzer but also generates FDCA, a significant building block for the sustainable polyester PEF, which has a global market size of more than 30 Mt/yr. We present an experimental and computational approach to understand HMF oxidation on Ni-based catalysts. Our experimental investigation involves evaluating the effect of microenvironment on thin-film (5nm) Ni-catalyst in a pH range of 11-13 to understand the intrinsic kinetics of HMF oxidation. In addition, we compare the reaction energetics of OER and the hydride transfer reaction of the HMF oxidation using density functional theory to understand the competing reaction pathways on the anode. Using the experimental data, we also develop a Multiphysics model to evaluate the electrode kinetics and species concentration distribution near the catalyst surface to understand the implications of mass transport limitations in this electrochemical system. This comprehensive analysis could potentially provide new guidelines to design more energy-efficient anodes for upgrading sustainable alcohols. This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

Proton-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are the state-of-the-art water electrolyzer technology; however, they suffer from high overpotential losses due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction on the anode. There have been significant efforts devoted to catalyst engineering to improve the kinetics of OER, often focused on iridium-based materials in acidic environments. Prior work demonstrates the oxide form of iridium significantly affects its activity. Despite this, catalyst-activity benchmarking is often conducted ex situ. Understanding how the ionomer reaction environment in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) influences catalyst performance is urgently needed. Here, we investigate the fundamental interactions between ionomer and iridium, how this interaction influences the ionomer structure and behavior, and how this ionomer/catalyst interface mediates MEA performance. We use Nafion as our ionomer, and consider three types of iridium: iridium metal, iridium oxy hydroxide, and iridium oxide. We first conduct investigations into model ink (catalyst and ionomer dispersed in solution) systems using dynamic light scattering and calorimetry. We then fabricate model thin-film systems of ionomer on planar catalysts and measure swelling behavior and structural information via x-ray scattering. We also gain chemical insights into the surface speciation as a function of water content via ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These fundamental efforts inform MEA overpotential analysis as a function of the three forms of Ir and highlight the intricacies of the ionomer/Ir interface.

Advances in the theoretical understanding of electrochemical systems have, over the past decade, led to growing use of periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies to treat a surprisingly large ensemble of electrocatalytic reactions, ranging from carbon dioxide electroreduction to oxygen evolution. Many such studies have employed simplified models of the electrochemical environment to determine reactivity trends across a broad space of catalytic materials, while other efforts have focused on developing detailed descriptions of electrochemical phenomena, such as the structure of electrochemical double layers, on model catalyst structures. An emerging challenge is to combine these approaches to ultimately enable theoretical design of electrocatalysts for reactions of significantly expanded chemical and materials complexity. In this talk, we begin by discussing how we develop and apply DFT-based methods to study the electrooxidation of ethanol and related oxygenated species on Pt surfaces. We show how explicit double layer models and ab initio molecular dynamics provide exciting insights beyond the traditional computational hydrogen electrode treatments, leading to improved descriptions of elementary reaction steps involving adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates and proton-coupled electron transfer processes. By combining the aggregate results with detailed microkinetic models and explicit descriptions of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, we further demonstrate how these effects can influence both the predicted overpotentials and the selectivities to acetic acid, acetaldehyde, and carbon dioxide. We conclude with some perspectives on how these insights may be used to enhance the search for improved oxygenate electrooxidation catalysts.

Constructing transition metal multiphase composites can improve the electrocatalytic efficiency of (sea)water splitting via interfacial interaction between adjacent active sites. Herein, the self-supporting NimSn-FeOx heterostructure is in situ grown on nickel foam (NF) through a corrosion engineering approach, which displays abundant dendritic array structures, endowing the material with abundant active sites and high electrocatalytic active area. The control of introducing Fe3+ and sulfur precursors can effectively trigger the phase transiting from Ni3S2 to Ni9S8, generating more S vacancies, which could reduce the reaction energy barrier and improve the electrocatalytic performance. Simultaneously, the presence of Fe–S bonding at the sulfide/oxide interface brings a strong electronic interaction, which enables the tuning of the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates and accelerates the catalytic reaction kinetics. As a result, the Ni9S8–FeOx/NF-Fe8.0 catalyst presents low overpotentials of 159 mV and 190 mV for oxygen evolution reaction at 100 mA cm–2 under 1 M KOH solution and simulated seawater conditions, respectively. The overall water splitting incorporating the Ni9S8–FeOx/NF-Fe8.0 as both anode and cathode provides the potential of 1.707 V in 1 M KOH and 1.794 V in simulated seawater at 100 mA cm–2. This research furnishes an efficient strategy toward the design of advanced transition metal heterogeneous composites with strong interfacial interaction for (sea)water splitting.

Abstract The robust immobilization and activity regulation of molecular catalysts on solid electrodes have remained persistent challenges in catalysis. Herein, cucurbituril (CB[7]) acts is first demonstrated as a bifunctional medium to firmly immobilize molecular catalyst CoTMPyP onto various metal oxide electrodes, including TiO 2 , BiVO 4 , α‐Fe 2 O 3 , and WO 3 , through host‐guest and electrostatic interactions. This approach not only secures stable attachment of the catalyst but also optimizes its electronic structure and catalytic activity. The CB[7]‐mediated supramolecular electrodes exhibit exceptional performance in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), ethanol oxidation reaction, hydrazine oxidation reaction, and photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. For instance, TiO 2 ‐CB[7]‐CoTMPyP electrode achieves a turnover frequency (TOF) of 5.30 s −1 at an overpotential of 600 mV for OER, and BiVO 4 ‐CB[7]‐CoTMPyP photoanode delivers a water oxidation photocurrent density of 6.00 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus RHE under simulated solar irradiation. Mechanistic studies reveal CB[7] plays a critical role beyond merely serving as a linker: it enhances charge accumulation around the cobalt sites, promotes reactants adsorption at these sites, reduces reaction energy barrier, and accelerates charge transfer rate, thereby significantly boosting catalytic activity. This work provides a groundbreaking pathway for the design and fabrication of cost‐effective, high‐performance molecular‐based electrodes for (photo)electrocatalytic reactions.

In recent years, the importance of sustainable energy has rapidly escalated due to increasingly severe environmental concerns and the exhaustion of fossil fuels. Among these, renewable energy sources such as hydrogen, solar, and wind energy have garnered growing attention and research interest as crucial pathways to achieving zero carbon emissions. Hydrogen, being the most plentiful element in the universe, boasts rich resources and widespread sources. Hydrogen gas is also one of the highest energy density fuels and, upon combustion, produces only water, making it clean and non-polluting 1 . Among the methods for hydrogen production, water electrolysis stands out as the most efficient and cleanest approach, representing a promising direction for breakthroughs in energy technology. In the water electrolysis reaction, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs at the anode while hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) takes place at the cathode. However, due to their involvement in multi-electron transfer processes, both reactions exhibit sluggish kinetics, requiring substantial overpotentials to drive them forward. This necessity has prompted the development of efficient electrocatalysts to expedite the reactions. Catalysts based on Ru and Ir are considered benchmark catalysts for water electrolysis due to their excellent OER activity and long-term stability 2 . Among them, Ru-based catalysts offer significant advantages in resource abundance and cost, with catalytic activity higher than Ir-based catalysts. Nonetheless, the poor stability and corrosion resistance hinder the development of this type of material. Recent studies have indicated that introducing transition metal elements into conventional Ru-based oxide catalysts can alter the catalyst's electronic structure and bonding situations to some extent, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity and long-term stability of Ru-based water electrolysis catalysts 3 . Furthermore, Ru-based catalysts can exhibit excellent HER catalytic performance through appropriate modifications, making them potential bifunctional water electrolysis catalysts. In this study, we synthesized a series of RuCoO x catalysts using a simple glucose-blowing method at different temperatures and heating times (heating for 5 hours at 350 °C, heating for 5 hours at 500 °C, heating for 7 hours at 350 °C, and heating for 7 hours at 500 °C), and focused on investigating the catalytic performance of these catalysts for OER and HER (Figure 1.) in an alkaline environment (1.0 mol·L -1 KOH solution). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate the coexistence of RuO 2 and Co 3 O 4 in the catalyst samples describing the successful synthesis (Figure 2.). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results demonstrated the relationship between the catalytic performance of the RuCoO x series catalysts and the heating temperature and duration during synthesis. The electrocatalytic performance of the RuCoO x series catalysts generally exhibited a negative correlation with the calcination time. Among them, the sample heated at 500 °C for 5 hours achieved overpotentials of 268 mV for OER and 92 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA·cm -2 . Additionally, we analyzed the changes in the electronic structure of the catalysts during the water electrolysis reaction using in situ or operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to track active structures for understanding catalytic mechanisms.

In aqueous alkaline electrolyte, why use platinum in the air cathode to electrocatalyze oxygen reduction (ORR) when the 2×2 tunnel polymorph of MnO 2 (cryptomelane) is effective, more sustainable, and a lower cost catalyst? A polymorphic cousin, lamellar birnessite MnO 2 , also catalyzes ORR and is the morphology attained by sacrificially oxidizing the walls of carbon nanofoam papers (CNFPs) with permanganate thereby creating an architected catalyzed air cathode. Birnessite-painted CNFP (MnO x @CNFP) brings high areal capacity for pulse power through Mn 4+/3+ redox-based capacitance, even while catalyzing ORR in primary zinc–air cells. The oxide spontaneously recovers the +4 charged state as residual molecular in the meso/macroporous electrode re-oxidizes the discharged +3 state. In powder-composite air cathodes, cryptomelane expressed as an ultraporous, covalently networked aerogel architecture sustains continuous high load demands in a primary zinc–air cell that the denser xerogel form of cryptomelane cannot. But in rechargeable zinc–air cells, manganese oxides are less effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution (OER), requiring high charging voltage that degrades the oxide coupled with parasitic oxidation reactions of electrolyte and carbon that limit cycle life. Formulating powder-composite air cathodes with cryptomelane aerogel and an OER electrocatalyst, such as Ni ferrite expressed as an aerogel, keeps charging voltage < 2 V while cryptomelane still dominates ORR catalysis for a higher discharge cell voltage. Versus a dendrite-suppressing zinc sponge anode, the cell using an air electrode formulated with two architected oxygen electrocatalysts delivers state-of-the-art low voltage hysteresis and power performance. The interdependent role catalytic activity and carbon stability play on cycle life point to the importance of cell metrics to rethink catalyst and electrode design. Preventing carbon corrosion, whether by replacing carbon with other electronic conduits or improving electrocatalyst activity, needs greater emphasis as a strategy for rechargeable zinc–air cells to achieve high total areal energy density.

Rechargeable zinc-air battery (ReZAB) has emerged as a viable alternative to Li-ion battery. It is safe, environmentally friendly, low-cost, and possesses high theoretical specific energy density (1086 Wh/kg) which is about five times than the Li-ion battery. Non-rechargeable zinc-air battery has been around for almost two centuries, but its rechargeable counterpart (ReZAB) is almost non-existent. One of the key frustrations for the development of the ReZAB is the poor electrochemical kinetics of the two oxygen reactions, i.e., oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Of the two oxygen reactions, OER is the limiting reaction for ReZAB because of its extreme high overpotential [1,2]. High-entropy spinel oxides (HESOx) are one of the emerging high-entropy materials as electrocatalysts for a plethora of electrocatalytic applications. HESOx exhibit excellent physical and chemical properties that allow them to be used in electrocatalysis, including as bifunctional catalysts for OER/ORR. This presentation will describe our successful synthesis of defective single nanocrystalline HESOx materials and their application as bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER/ORR and in ReZAB. Importantly, we will show that these defective HESOx electrocatalysts meet the minimum standard for the development of technologically relevant ReZABs that can compete with Li-ion battery pack [3,4].

As the issue of climate change worsens due to carbon emissions, extensive research has been conducted on sustainable energy sources to replace fossil fuels. Among them, hydrogen production through water electrolysis has garnered attention as a future energy source because it allows electricity generated from renewable sources to be stored in the form of chemical energy without emitting carbon dioxide. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode during electrolysis has been identified as a bottleneck due to its inherently high activation energy required for four-electron transfer, prompting discussions on catalyst development based on electronic and crystal structures to improve hydrogen production efficiency. While reducing overpotential to achieve high catalytic activity has been a primary concern in electrolysis over the past decade, recent emphasis has shifted towards the durability and structural stability of catalysts for prolonged reactions. As either a strong alkaline electrolyte or an acidic membrane is adopted under a highly oxidizing environment, understandings of corrosion resistance, lattice oxygen participation, elemental leaching, and subsequent amorphization at the catalyst surfaces in harsh pH conditions have been major research directions. In other words, to design high-durability catalysts, systematic investigation of surface changes in OER catalysts as a function of overpotential is essential. For atomic-scale tracking of the catalyst surface varying with overpotential, both the selection of a model catalyst material and the specific form of the material are important. First, for crystallographically identical surface analysis, a (001) heteroepitaxial thin film of perovskite oxide catalyst was adopted. The thin film model system enables systematic observation of surface changes during electrochemical reactions, allowing easy tracking of structural changes at the atomic level during the OER reaction in perovskites utilizing catalytically inactive A-site and active B-site transition metals, which can be readily traced via STEM. Second, based on the pourbaix diagram, intentional selection of A-site and B-site elements was performed. Alkali and alkaline-earth metals (Li, Na, K, Ca, Sr, and Ba), which represent A-site cations, have the characteristic of easily dissolving in ionic form in a wide pH range under anodic potential. Therefore, chemically stable La, without dissolution, was chosen as the A-site element. For the B-site, Co was selected as an OER active element, excluding elements that are either catalytically inactive (Ti, Mn, and Fe) or prone to leaching (V, Cr, and Ni) in the electrolyte. Thus, in this study, LaCoO 3 was adopted as the thin film model system. Using heteroepitaxial (001) LaCoO 3 thin films (thickness: 20nm) in this work, we demonstrate the structural and compositional changes of the film surface as a function of the anodic overpotential at an atomic level. In particular, through a combination of direct STEM imaging, image simulations, and surface analyses together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we clarify that the surface degradation behavior varies, strongly depending on the applied overpotential during the OER. When conducting the electrochemical reaction through a 2-hour chronoamperometry (CA) at 1.65V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), IR-corrected), the current tends to degrade continuously. Through BF-STEM imaging, a significant weakening of contrast at the topmost surface was observed at 1.65V, with simulations revealing that atomic displacements on the angstrom scale are the cause. The atomic displacements at the surface subsequently lead to a reduced density of the Co 3d states near the Fermi level (E F ), which are the major origins of catalytic degradation without notable surface restructuring. In contrast, at potentials higher than 1.67V, a rapid degradation occurs within 30 minutes to 1 hour, followed by a stabilization or even an increase in current. At the same time, substantial surface amorphization occurred at 1.67V. Despite claims that lattice oxygen in LaCoO 3 does not contribute to OER catalysis, SIMS analysis confirmed significant lattice oxygen exchange (isotope 18 oxygen-water signal) at higher overpotential conditions (≥1.67V), leading to the formation of amorphous hydroxide on the film surface. The presence of an OH peak in XPS and changes in the O K-edge in EELS analysis supported this. In this process, despite the thermodynamic stability of Co, the oxygen octahedral structure surrounding Co collapses due to lattice oxygen evolution, leading to Co dissolution into the electrolyte and exhibiting Co-deficient features on the surface. Ultimately, this study demonstrated through various STEM images and surface analyses that the catalytic reaction mechanism differs significantly depending on the overpotential. By successfully visualizing the surface changes of oxide catalysts at the atomic level, our research highlights the importance of overpotential as a critical factor in determining the stability of catalysts during OER.

Catalysis has been crucial in advancing and commercializing energy conversion technologies. It is essential to identify abundant, active, and stable materials to enable the reliable and cost-efficient use of catalysts in renewable technologies, such as fuel cells (FCs) and electrolyzers. Suitable candidates, such as nonprecious metals, can be found in first-row transition metals, where materials such as bimetallics, metal oxides, and metal nitrides can be readily synthesized. Recently, these materials have exhibited high activity toward the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in alkaline media, which, in turn, were related to promising performance in FCs and electrolyzers. However, most of these studies have not gone beyond half-cell reactions. In this study, we explored the synthesis of a metal nitride, Ni3FeN, and its application as an electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. We developed procedures for the synthesis of Ni3FeN nanocrystals with different carbon loadings using a one-step ammonolysis route. We show that the pristine structure of the material encompasses a nitride core and an oxide shell with a thickness of a few nanometers. However, the bulk electronic structure is mainly dominated by the Ni3FeN phase. The nitride exhibited an impressive and stable ORR performance in 1 M KOH favoring the 4 e– pathway. The material exhibited a slight decrease in E1/2 of 10 mV (from 0.85 to 0.84 V vs RHE) during a prolonged (100 K) accelerated stress test (AST). The AST degradation at ORR potentials indicates that the catalyst aggregates into larger nanoparticles, forming a Ni@NiFeOx structure. After tests at OER potentials, the catalyst breaks into smaller nanoparticles and mainly favors the NiFeOx structure. MEA testing of the Ni3FeN ORR catalyst in a hydrogen-fueled alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) yielded a peak power density of ca. 700 mW/cm2; among the highest reported for nitride and NiFe-based materials. We believe that this work could enable the use of NiFe-based materials as viable, inexpensive alternatives for fuel cell applications.

Advancements in anode development substantially reduce the cost and enhance the performance of water electrolysis. The strategic configuration of nano-sized catalyst materials on anode supports is a pivotal factor in the expansion of the production of catalyst layers and has a significant influence on their electrochemical performance [1–3]. Therefore, it is essential to understand the structure formation mechanisms during electrode fabrication. This contribution aims to explore the inherent drying mechanisms in the coating process and their subsequent influence on the morphological evolution of anodes, ultimately establishing a linkage between these morphological changes and electrochemical performance and stability metrics. The initial phase of the study involved a detailed characterization of commercial nickel cobalt oxide nanoparticles via advanced analytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy [4]. Subsequently, a stable ink was formulated by dispersing the catalyst alongside a binder in a solvent, which was then uniformly applied to a conductive nickel plate utilizing an ultrasonic spray coater. Prior to application, the catalyst inks underwent optimization based on the Hansen solubility parameters of catalyst materials [5, 6] and subsequent visualization of their stability and dispersibility characteristics through transmittogram analysis [7]. The drying process of the coating was conducted at two distinct temperatures, 50 °C and 150 °C, to investigate the effect of temperature on solvent evaporation. Morphological and structural analyses of the anodes were subsequently performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser scanning microscopy (LSM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), providing insight into the alterations induced by the drying process. The analyses conducted in this study elucidate significant modifications in the morphology of the layer structures attributable to variations in drying temperatures as illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, lower temperature resulted in reduced evaporation rates that facilitated the formation of larger, isolated regions/islands on the anode support. These are indicative of a non-uniform coating distribution. In contrast, a higher temperature promoted rapid evaporation, resulting in a quite homogeneous distribution of smaller islands accompanied by the emergence of voids within the anode layer. Electrochemical analysis revealed that these morphological changes are of vital importance: they govern the wetting behaviour and the dynamics of bubble formation which are important for the electrochemical performance and durability of the catalyst layers. Moreover, the insights gleaned from this study are instrumental in identifying optimal configurations of catalyst layer structures, i.e., features that should be maintained during scale-up. In conclusion, this study significantly advances the field by revealing novel principles governing the design and optimization of electrode structures for the oxygen evolution reaction. In particular, the complicated relationship between drying temperatures and morphological evolution, which significantly influences electrochemical performance is explained. References [1] V.

The rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) holds promise as an energy storage system for the next generation due to its high theoretical energy density, safe aqueous electrolyte, environmental friendliness, and cost-effectiveness of zinc. However, the efficiency of ZABs is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Noble metals such as platinum (Pt), iridium dioxide (IrO 2 ), and ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) are commonly used as advanced electrocatalyst materials. Nonetheless, their scarcity, high cost, unstable catalytic properties, and susceptibility to carbon monoxide poisoning limit the large-scale applications of ZABs. Therefore, exploring non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs is crucial, with transition metals being viable alternatives. Recently, bimetallic transition metal layered double hydroxide (LDH) has emerged as a promising candidate for OER catalysts due to its high specific surface area, abundant active sites, and synergistic effects between two transition metals. However, LDH still faces challenges such as poor electrical conductivity and self-aggregation during fabrication. In this work, we developed a three-dimensional core-shell structure, enabling the growth of LDH on nitrogen-doped porous carbon framework (N-C) materials to address these challenges. The N-C material, derived from zeolitic-imidazole framework (ZIF) material after pyrolysis, shows promise as an ORR catalyst. ZIF, a subclass of metal-organic framework (MOF), boasts high nitrogen content and inherits MOF advantages such as a high surface area, abundant active sites, and chemical stability. Furthermore, utilizing mesoporous silica as a hard template allows us to maintain the dodecahedral structure of ZIF and create mesoporous structures after annealing. The core-shell structure developed in this study demonstrates superior OER and ORR catalytic activity, offering a promising direction for the design of bifunctional catalysts for high-performance ZABs.

Hydrogen (H 2 ) is considered a clean and sustainable alternative energy carrier to fossil fuels for meeting future energy demands. 1 Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach to producing eco-friendly H 2 involving a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. 2 However, during these electrochemical gas evolution reactions, gas bubbles evolving at the surface of the electrocatalyst may result in undesired blockage of active sites and can influence the performance of the electrocatalytic process. 3 In this study, we optimized the direct growth of single-phase nickel sulfide and nitride (Ni 3 S 2 @NF and Ni 3 N@NF) on metallic nickel foil (NF) and investigated the influence of surface hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity on electrochemical HER through in situ hydrogen bubble dynamics. Contact angle measurements revealed that metallic NF, Ni 3 S 2 @NF, and Ni 3 N@NF electrodes followed a trend of decreasing contact angle in an alkaline solution, indicating that Ni 3 N@NF exhibited the highest hydrophilicity/aerophobicity. 4 In situ bubble visualization demonstrated that hydrophilic/aerophobic Ni 3 N@NF led to smaller and faster bubble departure, offering more active sites and a lower overpotential. Conversely, decreasing hydrophilicity or aerophobicity resulted in larger bubbles and longer retention times, leading to the unwanted blockage of the active sites and requiring high overpotential for HER. This highlights the significant impact of surface-wetting properties and hydrophilicity on electron and mass transfer during hydrogen generation, particularly at higher current densities.

Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer(AEMWE) requires fewer electrons compared to the oxygen evolution reaction, which is why research on it started later. However, when using an anion exchange membrane, the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs in multiple steps, and the dissociation of water is requisite first. The water splitting is challenging, hence catalysts that enhance water decomposition are essential. Currently, Platinum supported by carbon is used as the most stable and efficient material for HER. However, due to Platinum is rare and expensive, leading to significant research into alternative materials. Among various non-precious metal candidates, Nickel is known for its superior hydrogen evolution performance. Yet, the performance of Nickel alone is inferior to that of Platinum. Nickel exhibits enhanced performance and durability when combined with other metals due to a synergistic effect. The second metal, such as Copper, Cobalt, Iron, or Molybdenum, shows improved performance when alloyed with Nickel . Amon them Ni–Mo catalyst has shown high activity for HER in AEMWE. Among various Ni/Mo molar ratios, the catalyst showed the highest activity when it was 3. With Ni 3 Mo as the cathode, a single cell was fabricated using non-noble metal catalysts exclusively. Interestingly, the activation procedure significantly affected the cell performance. The single cell performed better than that with the Pt/C catalyst when the Ni 3 Mo catalyst was activated at 50 mA/cm 2 . Molybdenum tends to dissolve once the reaction begins the distribution of Mo in electrodes, membrane, and electrolytes was estimated, confirming Mo dissolution from the cathode. Once the cell was activated, the cell performance was stable without degradation in long-term chronopotentiometry operation, but the performance was degraded by sudden voltage change such as imposing open circuit voltage . The surface structure and reaction mechanism were studied with density functional theory: the Mo-dissolved Ni 3 Mo(101) surface could promote H 2 O dissociation, while MoO 3 stably adsorbed on the surface weakened H* adsorption, promoting HER. This study provides important insights into the development of efficient catalysts for large-scale hydrogen production.

Understanding how electrocatalysts evolve during operation is critical to optimizing their performance. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exposes electrocatalytic materials to harsh conditions that lead to significant transformations. A discovery that revolutionized OER catalysis was the dramatic improvement in activity due to the intentional, or incidental, in situ incorporation of Fe into Ni and Co oxyhydroxides. This finding raised questions about the true active phase in OER catalysts. While Fe incorporation is now widely acknowledged, there is still significant room for improvement in comprehending the in situ incorporation of trace metals and its effects on the electrochemical and structural properties of transition metal oxyhydroxides. We report a comprehensive investigation of in situ metal incorporation on nickel oxyhydroxide OER electrocatalysts encompassing four multivalent cations: Fe, Co, Mn, and Cu. We found that adding trace amounts of these to alkaline electrolytes alters the electrocatalytic and energy storage properties of NiO x H y films. As opposed to the well-known increase in OER activity induced by Fe incorporation ( Figure 1a ), in situ incorporation of trace Co and Mn increases the redox capacitance ( Figure 1b ), while Cu incorporation does not proceed. Depth profiling measurements reveal that metal incorporation is confined to the film's surface ( Figure 1c-d ), resulting in an interstratified structure that partially retains the more active, disordered phase. We describe four factors determining the occurrence of in situ metal incorporation, underscoring its nature as a cation exchange reaction. Finally, Fe and Co cation exchange processes are manipulated by shifting the solubility equilibrium and through ion complexation. By providing a better understanding of in situ metal incorporation processes, our results underscore its potential as a strategy for manipulating the surface chemical composition. Figure 1

Iridium (Ir)-based catalysts have been considered as the most promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). The scarce supply of Ir potentially restricts the development of the PEMWE technology. Reducing the use of Ir catalysts has become one of the most critical tasks. The activity and durability of PEMWE depend heavily on the catalyst loading. [1] Poor in-plane electric conductivity due to catalyst layer not being continuous at ultra-low loadings (~0.1-0.2 mg Ir /cm 2 ) catalyst, results in loss of electronic connection of some portions of catalyst layer. Several studies have proposed various strategies to lower the loading of Ir catalysts,such as altering catalyst morphology, [2] introducing a microporous layer (MPL) between the catalyst layer and PTL to improve electron transport in disconnected catalyst layers, [3] or doping Ir-based catalysts with support materials. [4-5] These approaches enhance both in-plane and through-plane electric conductivity, thereby increasing catalyst utilization. In this work, heteroatoms were used as supports or dopants to enhance Ir catalyst utilization and enhance the structural and interfacial stability of the catalyst layer. The microstructure of the metallic oxide support allows IrO 2 particles to disperse uniformly, thus enhancing the in-plane conductivity of the catalysts layer. Both commercial metallic oxides supported IrO 2 catalysts [6] and laboratory-synthesized catalysts were employed in PEMWE. Different catalyst loadings were investigated, including the ultra-low loading (0.11-0.13 mg Ir /cm 2 ) catalysts in this study. We conducted several electrochemical characterization experiments to confirm the improvement of the durability and activity for the IrO 2 /TiOx and IrO 2 /NbOx, comparing to the unsupported IrOx catalysts with the identical low Ir loading. A 2V-hold for 100-hour of the accelerated stress testing (AST) indicates the more moderate decay in the current density for supported IrO 2 catalysts. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) allows us to monitor the changes of surface oxidation state and the morphology of the Ir-based catalysts during the different operating conditions. Finally, the cell performance of various catalysts on the anode in PEMWE were also evaluated and compared. This study is expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of ultra-low Ir loading in PEMWE. References [1] C. Rozain, E. Mayousse, N. Guillet, P.

Introduction Organic chemical hydrides have been attracted as an energy carrier for mass storage and transportation of renewable energy. In particular, a toluene (TOL) / methylcyclohexane (MCH) system has advantages in terms of using conventional petroleum infrastructure and relatively low toxic properties. A TOL direct electro-hydrogenation cell has a cathode catalyst layer and electrolyte which are similar to proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Anode reaction is oxygen evolution. An issue of the cell is the electro-osmosis of water through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode catalyst layer. It inhibits the diffusion of TOL into the catalyst layer and promotes H 2 evolution as a side reaction. 1 Therefore, it is important for a cathode porous flow field that not only the flow of TOL and MCH but also the enhancement of water and H 2 discharge. In this study, we focused on the hydrophilicity of the cathode porous flow field and investigated the relationship between current efficiency and hydrophilicity of the porous flow field. Experiments Nafion115 ® (DuPont Inc.) was used as the electrolyte membrane. A DSE ® for oxygen evolution (De Nora Permelec Ltd.) was used as an anode and 1 mol dm -3 H 2 SO 4 was circulated as anolyte at 10 ml min -1 . As a cathode, 1 mg -PtRu cm -2 of PtRu/C (TEC61E54, TKK) with 0.8 of ionomer/carbon weight ratio, was coated on the membrane. 10 vol. %TOL - MCH was circulated at 10 ml min -1 . As the cathode porous flow field, carbon papers with various contact angles and thicknesses were used as shown in Table 1. The substrates were named "c"-contact angle-(thickness). Here, the C0(660), C0(320), and C145(280) had the same pore structure with various wettability and thickness. The C138MPL(280) is a commercially available carbon diffusion layer (39BB, SGL carbon Ltd.), which had a contact angle of 138° on both with and without a microporous layer (MPL). The internal resistance was measured by the high-frequency intercept of the Nyquist plot of impedance measurements after 3 minutes of constant current electrolysis. IR -free cell voltage was determined by subtraction of multiplied by the resistance and the current value from the measured cell voltage. Current efficiency was calculated with Faraday's law from the volume ratio of TOL/MCH solution to H 2 gas after 3 minutes of constant current electrolysis. Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the dependence of cell voltages (open plots) and current efficiencies (close plots) on current density for TOL direct electro-hydrogenation cells with various cathode porous carbon flow fields. There were no significant differences in cell voltages for the cells. On the other hand, current efficiencies were significantly affected by the property of the porous carbon flow field. The C0(320), which was hydrophilic, had the highest current efficiency. Following the C0(320), the C69(220) and the C145(280) were high in this order. So, the more hydrophilic carbon papers showed the higher current efficiency. This implies that the use of a hydrophilic porous flow field promotes water removal in the cathode catalyst layer. As the effect of thickness in the same contact angle, the thinner cathode porous flow field of the C0(320) was higher than thicker that of the C0(660). This implies that a thin flow field would enhance TOL supply, and this means the flow velocity in line also affects current efficiency. C138MPL(280) was the lowest current efficiency. This may be due to the pore size of the MPL on the porous flow field in contact with the catalyst layer. The pores in the porous carbon flow field between the fibers and the MPL were fine nanocarbon particles with Teflon bonding; therefore, the pore size and the porosity of MPL are much smaller than those of the flow field. Then The lowest current efficiency of the C138MPL(280) would be affected by slow transport of TOL supply with slow discharge of MCH and water. In conclusion, it was suggested that the use of hydrophilic, thin, and large pore size cathode porous flow field facilitated the mass transportation of TOL into the catalyst layer and the emission of water and MCH from the catalyst layer and suppressed side reactions.

Developing many sustainable energy technologies (e.g., H 2 O and CO 2 splitting) warrants accelerating the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiently and economically. However, designing noble-metal-free electrocatalysts (NMFEs) to replace noble-metal-based OER electrocatalysts is tremendously challenging in acidic electrolytes where chemical corrosion is conventionally regarded as a bottleneck factor. So far, few NMFEs reported can be an alternative to Ru-/Ir-based catalysts for acidic OER. Differernt from conventional wisdom, through monitoring the dynamics of the catalytic process during water electrolysis, we unambiguously demonstrated that electrochemical reconstruction instead of chemical corrosion dominantly degraded the OER performance of typical Mn and Co oxides as resentative NMFEs. Based on the uncovered degradation mechanism, we further developed a novel and rational method to overcome the problem of activity-stability trade-off faced by various OER electrocatalysts. Correlative operando characterizations found that our modulation method successfully suppressed the undesired surface reconstructions by mitigating the cationic/anionic redox and catalyst leaching, and meanwhile atomistic calculations revealed that the synergy of dual sites generated more favorable catalytically-active species. The resultant noble-metal-free oxide yielded a record performance among reported NMFEs, and its superior performance was also validated by the PEM water electrolyzer. This work will provide a critical reference for designing NMFEs for PEM water electrolysis. Reference: 1.

Hydrogen is gaining acceptance as a viable energy vector for renewable energy and as a green molecule for chemical synthesis, but its production in a sustainable, efficient, and affordable manner requires further optimization. Proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMELs) can be efficient for hydrogen production. Within the PEMEL stack, the repeating unit cell consists of a bipolar plate, two porous transport layers (PTLs), two catalyst layers, and one proton exchange membrane (PEM). The oxygen evolution reaction at the anode creates a corrosive environment, therefore, titanium is used as the anode bipolar plate material. The anode bipolar plate is typically machined from a block of titanium for small volume production or stamped for large volume production, which is time-consuming and challenging due to frequent tool breakage resulting in high cost. Furthermore, ineffective in-plane water transport within the anode PTL can cause inadequate water supply to the catalyst layer resulting in unutilized catalyst. To alleviate these problems, we have designed a novel PEMEL cell containing channeled titanium foam enclosed within a PTFE frame that functions both as the bipolar plate and the PTL, termed channeled porous transport layer (CPTL). In our design, the channels face the current collector such that the water flows through the channels and the pores of the foam in both the through-plane and in-plane directions, thereby maximizing catalyst coverage and utilization. Similarly, the pores and channels of the CPTL provide an effective pathway for the evacuation of oxygen gas evolved at the anode catalyst layer. Most importantly, the channels in the titanium foam can be formed as part of the PTL production process which could greatly reduce PEMWE manufacturing costs and lower the cost of hydrogen. The same CPTL design can also be employed in anion exchange membrane electrolyzers (AEMELs) whose anode environment permits the use of nickel foam which further reduces material costs. We will present experimental results for PEMELs and AEMELs performance with this new design and compare them with those obtained with conventional bipolar plates.

Water electrolysis has been considered a green process for hydrogen production. Conventional electrolysis is limited by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to high energy input. In addition, the temporal spatial coupling of the production of H 2 and O 2 can cause issues associated with safety, economic feasibility, and system flexibility. Herein, we reported our work on replacing OER with an electrocatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (EOD) of biomass-derived furfural for bipolar H 2 production (from both cathode and anode) at low electrolytic cell voltages and high current densities. Experimental and DFT studies suggested a reasonable barrier for C-H dissociation on Cu surface, mainly through the diol intermediate, with the potential-dependent competition with Cannizzaro reaction. We revealed that EOD on metallic Cu surface was linked to an autocatalytic Cu oxides reduction by aldehydes along with H 2 evolution. The EOD kinetics and durability was further enhanced by a porous CuAg catalyst prepared by a galvanic replacement method. We engineered a bipolar H 2 production system using membrane-electrode assembly-based flow cells to facilitate mass transport, achieving a combined faradaic efficiency (FE) of ~200% to H 2 and the maximum H 2 partial current density of 248 and 390 mA/cm 2 at cell voltages of 0.4 V and 0.6 V, respectively. We further studied other CuM (M= Pt, Pd, Au) bimetallic catalysts for EOD reaction, and found that dispersing Pt into Cu (CuPt) exhibited a unique synergistic effect for furfural EOD possibly via efficient C-H cleavage on Cu and favorable furfural binding on Pt. The CuPt anode-based flow electrolyzer has achieved a higher current density of 498 mA/cm 2 at a low cell voltage of 0.6 V and FE of >80% to H 2 . Inexpensive dialysis membranes and non-noble metal HER catalysts are possibly used for bipolar H 2 production, which provides an alternative approach for distributed manufacturing of green hydrogen and carbon chemicals in the future.

Electrochemical water splitting is a promising pathway for the production of green hydrogen as an alternative fuel, chemical feedstock and storage medium for renewables. Yet, the process is hindered by slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Also, large scale implementation will require reduced loadings of expensive and rare platinum group metals and development of new materials. Making progress on rational design for OER catalysts requires effective characterization of the electrode-electrolyte interface where the chemistry takes place. Synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) offers a versatile way to obtain surface chemical and elemental characterization of such materials. The use of X-rays in the tender regime (~2-6 keV) allows for deeper probing than the conventional soft X-ray (< 2 keV) energies that are common for this technique. The photoelectrons generated from tender x-rays have enough energy to penetrate tens of nanometers through low-density components such as a layer of liquid or polymeric electrolyte, allowing access to interfaces in operando conditions. At Beamline 9.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source, we have developed a fully operational two-electrode system to study these membrane electrode assemblies under active water-splitting conditions. Accurate and representative data collection can involve a series of considerations and tests during acquisition. In this talk, I will explain our specific approach, which combines conventional and sub-second snapshot acquisition modes to minimize beam effects and test for phenomena that can contribute to erroneous interpretation of data. I will demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with results on a series of iridium-based polymer electrolyte membranes. With the application of elevated potential, we can correlate the iridium valency and surface species with the appearance of product traces in a mass spectrum.

Seawater and the oceans are the most abundant sources of water on Earth and represent a major reservoir for the production of electrolytic molecular hydrogen (H 2 ), which is the critical clean energy carrier necessary for achieving sustainable social development. However, the high salt content and presence of organic matter in seawater interfere via the water (H 2 O) electrolysis reaction (2H 2 O →O 2 + 2H 2 ); thus, complicates the direct utilization of seawater. This challenge is particularly relevant for islands in Micronesia, where their remote locations and accessibility to seawater make the delocalized production of H 2 and other possible energy carriers a promising strategy for energy independence and regional self-sufficiency. Driving this strategy, the University of Guam (UOG) has partnered with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to upskill UOG faculty and students on the use of electrochemical equipment through activities aimed at building the foundation for fundamental research in carbon neutral H 2 generation. The activities focus on developing an understanding of the reaction complexity of the electrode/liquid interface with the goal of controlling reaction pathways for the electrochemical production of H 2 via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER: 4H + + 4e - →2 H 2 ) at the cathode and molecular oxygen (O 2 ) via the oxygen evolution reaction (OER: 2H 2 O →O 2 + 4H + + 4e - ) at the anode during the electrolysis of seawater. A fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and influence of the complex environments and the simultaneous transformations that are occurring during the HER and OER is necessary in the realization of technologies that efficiently perform direct seawater electrolysis, while avoiding the pretreatments required for current electrolyzer technologies. This collaboration represents an important partnership between the island of Guam and broader Micronesia and PNNL to train future workers for the Blue Economy. In addition to training future workers for the Blue Economy, the partnership is laying the foundation for UOG to become a major clean energy research center in Micronesia, providing the facilities and expertise to engage researchers in the region. The Micronesian region in the Western Pacific Ocean is a vast and culturally diverse region that includes four main archipelagos comprising of over six hundred islands encompassing 6.7 million square kilometers. The four main island groups in Micronesia include the Caroline Islands, Gilbert Islands, Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands. The University of Guam is the only four-year post-secondary educational institution located in Micronesia and establishing itself as the flagship research and partnership institution for all of Micronesia.

The development of efficient and durable catalysts for the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for advancing various electrochemical processes including water splitting, CO 2 electroreduction, and metal air batteries. In this presentation, the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical evaluation of monometallic, bimetallic, and trimetallic transition metal OER catalysts will be discussed. We employed a colloidal synthesis approach to fabricate mesoporous oxyphosphide catalysts with varying compositions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization revealed the formation of a distinct core@shell structure comprising a zero-valent metallic core enveloped by a porous oxygen-rich shell. An OER potential of <1.5 V versus RHE at 10 mA cm -2 and a low Tafel slope of 32 mV decade -1 were measured, surpassing other catalyst configurations including commercial platinum-group-metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts in alkaline media. Furthermore, excellent OER durability at 10 mA cm -2 was demonstrated, with a potential increase of <0.5 mV/h after 100 hours of testing. These findings underscore the potential of TM oxyphosphide catalysts as promising candidates for efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts, paving the way for sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies.

The development of highly active and durable electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for efficient hydrogen production by polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Ir oxide is currently used as OER catalysts, while their extreme scarcity and high cost hinder the widespread adoption of PEMWE. Recently, Ru oxide has attracted attention as a non-iridium OER catalyst with high electronic conductivity. However, since its electrochemical stability under acidic environment is quite low compared to Ir oxide, significant stability improvement is needed for practical applications of Ru-oxide catalysts. In this talk, I will present our recent work on surface and interface control to improve the performance of Ru oxide using single crystal thin film electrodes prepared by arc-plasma deposition. First, I will introduce the beneficial role of Ti doping on RuO 2 ( hkl ) surfaces ( hkl = 110, 001, 100). The OER activity, stability, and corrosion resistance were enhanced by a small amount of Ti doping on all the hkl surfaces. Second, the importance of structural control of noble metal oxide catalyst/transition metal oxide support interface will be discussed. The SnO 2 interlayer effectively improved not only the electronic resistance, but also the structural stability at the catalyst/support interface [1]. These studies demonstrate that metal oxide thin film model electrodes are powerful platforms to elucidate the role of surface and interfacial structure on the water electrolysis electrodes.

Platinum-based catalysts are widely utilized in various electrochemical reactions such as oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen evolution reaction. However, the high cost of Pt necessitates research on alloys with various transition metals to enhance catalyst activity while reducing expenses. Unfortunately, conventional alloy catalysts often suffer from decreased stability as transition metal elements dissolve, leading to catalyst degradation [1]. Various modifications such as core-shell structures or ordered structures are being introduced to enhance durability. Despite the exceptional catalytic activity demonstrated by many newly developed catalysts, durability often remains a concern [2]. Prolonged operation can lead to nanoparticle agglomeration, resulting in reduced surface area and active sites. In this study, boron is introduced to enhance durability by preventing particle agglomeration. Previous research has explored materials doped with boron or intermetallic structures as catalysts for various electrochemical reactions such as oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, and alcohol oxidation [3]. Boron has smaller electronegativity than metal elements and can expand the lattice of the metal via institutional doping. Consequently, the d-band center of the boron-introduced catalyst may downshift, weakening its bonding with oxygen or hydrogen and potentially improving activity. Unlike many studies utilizing boric acid, sodium borohydride, diethylamine borane as boron sources, this study employs borophene, a 2D structure of boron sheet. Chemically synthesized hydrogenated borophene (HB) serves as both a reducing agent and a boron source, incorporating boron into Pt-based catalyst [4]. A combination of various physicochemical analyses and computational approaches is employed to investigate the structure of the borophene-assisted catalyst. The introduction of boron in the form of borophene inhibits the nanoparticle agglomeration and particle size increase. Firstly, introducing borophene into Pt-metal alloy can suppress the unexpected growth of nanoparticle during constructing ordered structure. Intermetallic structure is usually formed through a few hours of heat treatment with high temperature. Typically, heat treatment leads to particle agglomeration, causing an increase in particle size. Compared with commercial Pt catalyst, Pt-metal alloy catalyst, and borophene-assisted Pt-metal catalyst, the introduction of boron in the form of borophene can reduce particle agglomeration during heat treatment. Additionally, the borophene-assisted Pt-based catalyst is employed in electrocatalytic reactions. Through durability tests lasting over 100 hours, borophene-assisted Pt-based catalyst exhibits superior durability in various electrochemical environments compared to conventional Pt catalysts and Pt-based catalyst without boron. Borophene-assisted catalyst holds promise for convenient application in synthesizing various metal nanoparticles, playing a crucial role in preventing agglomeration and maintaining high performance over an extended period. This study will significantly contribute to research on catalysts with excellent durability.

Nitrogenous compounds, such as NH 4 + /NH 3 and NO 3 - , are significant contaminants in water resources. An excess of NH 3 leads to eutrophication which poses a threat to aquatic organisms. Electrochemical oxidation has emerged as a promising water treatment technology, offering advantages such as simplicity, small-scale operation, and minimal reliance on additional chemicals. In this study, a nickel-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) was synthesized using 2-aminoterephthalic acid (BDC-NH 2 ) and nickel nitrate. The Ni-MOF was further carbonized to produce nickel oxide and nitrogen-enriched carbon composite, NiO x @NC. Ni ions recrystallized as core-shell nickel oxide/nickel within the 2D mesoporous carbon texture, which served as active sites for ammonia oxidation. Results of characterization showed that the Ni-MOF exhibited a hexagonal and flaky nanoparticle morphology. With increasing pyrolysis temperature, the electrochemical surface area of NiO x @NC significantly increased as to improve the rate of ammonia oxidation. The primary mediator of Ni(OH) 2 ⇌NiOOH phase transition occurred at +1.2 V, compared to oxygen evolution at +1.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO), thereby enhancing the Faradaic efficiency. Batch electrolysis was conducted under parameters, including pyrolysis temperatures, pH, current density, initial concentration, and electrode potential. Among these, NiO x @NC(700), treated at 700 °C, was the best electrode for decomposing ammonium nitrogen of 50 mg-N/L to below 1 ppm within 4 hours at 3 mA/cm 2 and pH 10. Oxygenated species, such as nitrate and nitrite, negligibly formed, with N 2 nitrogen selectivity surpassing 90% in a paired electrochemical cell assisted with a Cu/Ni cathode. Figure 1

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) faces a fundamental challenge in reducing the use of expensive and rare catalysts such as iridium and platinum. The necessary scale-up of the technology will not be possible with current catalyst loadings [1]. In recent years, the community has focused on investigating catalyst degradation and its underlying mechanisms. Kasian et al. [2] identified the significance of the electrochemical dissolution of iridium catalyst and proposed potential pathways for the dissolution. Geiger et al. [3] developed a metric known as the stability number (S-number) to compare various catalysts. The S-number correlates the amount of produced oxygen with the quantity of dissolved catalyst. Inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) is widely used in catalyst research to measure dissolved metals [4]. One common method for investigating catalyst dissolution in an aqueous model system is the direct connection of the ICP-MS to a flow cell [5]. Nevertheless, Knöppel et al. [6] found a difference of several orders of magnitude in S-number between aqueous model systems and single-cell PEMWE setups. Therefore, the authors conducted experiments using a flow cell setup and a special single-cell setup from which they collected water samples at the cell outlet over time. They concluded that results from aqueous systems should be cautiously treated due to the specific conditions in a flow cell that could accelerate catalyst degradation. The authors also suggest that more focus should be placed on investigating catalyst degradation in real-cell setups. Our approach allows for a close to real-time measurement of catalyst concentrations, collected in sample flows directly from the interface of the bipolar plate and the porous transport layer or at the exit on both electrodes of a PEMWE full cell assembly. The method is capable of measuring the concentration of catalyst in the usual parts per trillion (ppt) range of a standard ICP-MS measurement. This makes it possible to investigate catalyst degradation in a PEMWE single-cell with high voltage and current resolution under different operating points. For example, the presence of iridium and platinum can be detected in the process water during the initial seconds of cell operation at conditioning. Another instance of elevated platinum and iridium concentration is observed during the transition from cell operation to an open circuit voltage (OCV) state. Figure 1 shows the amount of Iridium in the process water when switching from 3 A/cm² to OCV. This change in operating condition resulted in a distinct peak of iridium, indicating degradation. Detecting system contaminations and their influences on the single-cell setup could be another potential application in addition to investigating catalyst dissolution. In our talk, we present the detailed operation and the setup of our new measurement method and influences of different cell operations on the catalyst dissolution in a PEMWE cell.

Electrochemical stripping is an attractive alternative to converting NH 4 + to NH 3(g) via the OH − produced by the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode. However, conventional electrochemical systems suffer from relatively low ammonia recovery (<80%) and need of external acid solution to absorb ammonia. To address the limitations, this work has developed a novel stacked system that uses anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to in−situ produce acid and achieve chemical free ammonia recovery. To solve the issue of ammonia escape caused by constant current charging in conventional electrochemical systems, pulsed electric field (PEF) has been applied to regulate side reactions and interfacial mass transfer, weakening the sweeping effect of hydrogen gas produced by the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction on ammonia gas. With an ammonia removal rate of 35.1 g−N m −2 h −1 and an electrical energy consumption of 28.9 kWh kg−N −1 , our chemical−free system in PEF mode has achieved significantly higher ammonia recovery (>90%) from high-strength streams. With regard to a high concentration of chloride, high potentials during electrolysis may lead to the generation of strong active chlorine. The non−specific oxidation of ammonia by active chlorine results in lower ammonia recovery. This study therefore combined in−situ Raman spectroscopy to explore the effects of chloride ion concentration and pH on ammonia speciation and recovery. Under strong acidic conditions, active chlorine mainly escaped in the form of Cl 2(g) , thus having a negligible effect on ammonia recovery. The proposed system maintained good stability after 390 h continuous operation. While the effect of active chlorine on ammonia oxidation was negligible, the reaction of chlorine with dissolved organic matter (DOM) can form more toxic by-products. This work further realized the effective control of by-products through the integration with activated carbon adsorption process. Overall, the total cost to recover 1 kg of NH 3 –N using the electrochemical system from real waste stream is $15.9, which includes $11.1 for capital expenses (CapEx) and $4.8 for operating expenses (OpEx). This highlights the great potential for realizing high ammonia recovery in practical applications, and provides insights to innovations in treatment and resource recovery.

Three VO 2 polymorphic cathodes, namely monoclinic VO 2 (B), monoclinic VO 2 (M), and tetragonal VO 2 (A), are synthesized and their morphologies and electrochemical performances are examined for Zn-ion battery (ZIB) applications. It is found that VO 2 (B) outperforms VO 2 (M) and VO 2 (A) in terms of the specific capacity and rate capability due to its relatively large number of charge storage sites, high electronic conductivity, and wide structural tunnels that can facilitate Zn 2+ transport. Further, a cost-effective ZnSO 4 -based aqueous electrolyte with various LiTFSI concentrations (3−7 m) is formulated. To obtain superior Zn//VO 2 battery performance, the optimal ZnSO 4 /LiTFSI ratio in the electrolyte is explored. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) is used to examine the solvation structures of various electrolytes to find the correlation between the solution coordination status and electrolyte properties (such as the electrochemical potential window, ionic conductivity, and Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )· x H 2 O byproduct formation tendency). According to the WAXS data, the incorporation of LiTFSI greatly alters the solution structures and 1 m ZnSO 4 /5 m LiTFSI electrolyte has reduced water activity. Thus, the anodic limit (that related to oxygen evolution from the decomposition of water) of the electrolyte is extended, and the Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )· x H 2 O byproduct formation tendency is suppressed. The thinner byproduct layer, which reduces the blocking of ion/proton intercalation reactions, is responsible for the superior charge-discharge properties of the VO 2 (B) electrode obtained in the 1 m ZnSO 4 /5 m LiTFSI dual-salt electrolyte. The unique solution structure of this electrolyte also alleviates the hydrogen evolution side reaction, leads to the flat and compact Zn deposits, and reduces the amount of dead Zn on the electrode after cycling. The VO 2 (B) electrode has great dimensional reversibility and stability during cycling in the 1 m ZnSO 4 /5 m LiTFSI electrolyte, as verified via operando transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM). The proposed electrode/electrolyte design strategies are expected to be applicable for further development of ZIBs.

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that governs electrolytic water splitting are of interest as a way to store energy from renewable sources. However, replacing noble metal electrocatalyst with those comprised of lower cost, earth abundant elements remains a challenge as these materials impart a higher overpotential, and hence energy requirement, to both reactions. Guided by the recognized enhanced activity of Ni-based hydroxides in alkaline media, 1 and known enhancements of TiO 2 in Co-Mo alloys for HER, the examination of Ni-Fe-TiO 2 alloy composite electrocatalysts are explored. 2 Nano-scale TiO 2 particles were embedded into Ni-Fe alloys by using galvanic and pulse-reverse electrodeposition, onto rotating cylinder electrodes. Pulse-reverse electrodeposition considerably increased the concentration of the particles incorporated into the alloy. The composition and morphology was characterized by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The addition of particles to the electrolyte affected both the deposit composition and morphology. The alloy composites were then used as electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH to characterize HER and OER via linear sweep voltammetry on the resulting hydroxide surface. The surface area was examined in a ferri/ferrocyanide electrolyte. The polarization data in 1 M KOH shows a significant reduction in the HER overpotential when TiO 2 particles are present in the Ni-Fe deposit. The surface analysis of Ni-Fe and Ni-Fe-TiO 2 confirmed that the improvement in HER activity is not due to surface roughness but an intrinsic one. The OER rate was not significantly altered by the included TiO 2 particles in the deposit. Stability of the electrocatalysts under an electrolysis for HER and an independent electrolysis for OER was examined. References M. I. Jamesh . J. Power Sources 333 , 213 (2016); A. Eftekhari. Int.

Environmental and energy shortage issues arise due to the excess consumption of fossil fuels, which requires immediate attention to realize the dream of an energy society with virtually zero carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, H 2 generated by the water electrolysis technology is considered as a possible substitute for fossil fuels due to its prominent features, such as high gravimetric energy density and zero carbon emission. 1 In water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a multielectron transfer reaction that makes overall water electrolysis kinetically sluggish and dominated by noble metal oxides such as IrO 2 and RuO 2 . 2 However, their high prices and poor stability under strongly acidic or basic conditions hindered their practical applicability. Therefore, to fulfill this goal, it is necessary to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency and durability of water electrolysis by developing alternative OER electrocatalysts with earth abundant elements. Among various transition metal oxides, Perovskite oxides emerged as a potential OER catalyst due to their low cost, flexibility, and tailorable properties. However, the poor stability of typical BSCF during OER remains a significant issue that hindered its widespread application. Meanwhile, recent reports show that the complex oxide hex-BSCF exhibits superior OER performance than 3C-BSCF. 3 However, the detailed information about the intermediates generated during the OER process and the relationship between OER activity and electronic changes of hex-BSCF remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we synthesized several types of composite oxide, water electrocatalysts Ba 4 Sr 4 (Co 1-x Fe x ) 4 O 15 (x = 0 to 1.0), and clarified the relationship between the OER activity and the amount of Fe added. The electrochemical investigations showed a volcanic relationship between the OER activity and the amount of Fe added, and the catalyst with an added Fe amount of 0.2 (x=0.2) showed the highest OER activity (Figure 1a). To eliminate the effect of oxygen bubbles attached to the catalyst surface, a forced-flow cell was developed to determine the actual OER activity. The electronic structure change of the catalyst/electrolyte interface during water electrolysis, was analyzed in detail by operando soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) by measuring oxygen K - edge. The characteristic peaks originated in the range of 531eV to 532eV, corresponding to the intermediate region between CoOOH and FeOOH. 2 The intensity of this characteristic peak is strongly correlated with its OER activity. Further, the ex-situ hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) shown in Figure 1b revealed that the valence state of Co decreases when a small amount of Fe is added, and hex-BSCF82 has the lowest metal-oxygen coordination number and minimum octahedral sites occupation. Hence, the doped Fe pre-occupies the octahedral sites, and the Co is forced to the tetrahedral sites, consequently enhancing the OER activity. Figure 1

Melamine Formaldehyde resin (MF), one of the thermoset plastic frequently used for cook wares, adhesive, insulator and coatings because of its thermostability, mechanical strength, electronic insulation and ease of manufacture. However, because of above properties of MF resin, it is hard to recycle after used, which causes serious environmental contamination. To overcome this drawback of after-used MF resin, we introduce a method on utilizing after-used MF resin for an enhancer of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, inspired by pristine methodologies to synthesize g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst. The pristine g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst is synthesized by heat polymerization of urea, dicyandiamide(DCDA) and melamine and it utilize widely as a photocatalytst because it has a suitable band gap for visible light absorption, high chemical stability, and high thermal stability. However, high electron-hole recombination rate of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst regarded as the reason decreases photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst. Therefore, in this study, after-used MF resin as an enhancer during g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst syntehsis process, to improve photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . The pure g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was synthesized by heat polyemrization of urea and MF resin added g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst (MR X, X is the amount of added MF resin) was synthesized by adding certain amount of MF resin during g-C 3 N 4 synthesis process. Comparing photocatalytic activity between pure g-C 3 N 4 and MR photocatalyst was carried out by Methyl Orange (MO) degradation under 1 sun illumination. Finally, pure g-C 3 N 4 and MR photocatalyst was fabricated as an photoelectrode and their oxygen evolution reaction(OER) activity was analyzed by electrochemical analysis techniques.

Research on CO 2 conversion into valuable materials has attracted much attention, aiming to realize carbon neutrality and carbon-negative emission technology. It has been reported that the unique physicochemical properties of high-temperature molten salt, such as high conductivity and wide electrochemical window, make it possible to obtain solid carbon directly from CO 2 and metal carbides. In this study, we focused on the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 in high-temperature chloride melt. CaC 2 is the raw material for acetylene, the starting material for various chemical products. This study demonstrated the selective formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 by an electrochemical process in NaCl-KCl-CaCl 2 -CaO melt at 823 K to produce C 2 H 2 with high current efficiency. When the inert material for oxygen evolution in the high-temperature melts was used as the anode, the formation of acetylene and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water can be realized as the total reaction. 2CO 2 + H 2 O → C 2 H 2 + 5/2O 2 On the metal cathode, the CaC 2 was formed through two reactions: the carbon electrodeposition from CO 2 -derived CO 3 2− (Step 1) and the electrochemical reduction of Ca(II) ion on the carbon (Step 2). These two reactions could be controlled by conducting potentiostatic electrolysis under CO 2 and Ar atmospheres, resulting in acetylene synthesis with a maximum current efficiency of 92%. The electrolysis on carbon electrodes revealed that the higher the crystallinity of carbon, the more selectively CaC 2 was formed. The CaC 2 formation was induced by the reduction of Ca(II) ions on the basal plane of the graphite layer rather than the edge plane. The unique interfacial phenomenon between high-temperature melt and a carbon electrode surface will contribute to realizing a highly efficient CO 2 conversion process to acetylene. It was found that the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 tends to proceed at the basal plane of the graphite layer. This reaction mechanism is entirely different from the interlayer reactions that tend to occur in LIBs and is unique to this electrolytic system at the carbon/molten salt interface. The obtained data will provide a highly efficient process for CO 2 resource conversion and physicochemical insights into new carbon surface reactions.

Introduction The capital expenditure of electrolyzers significantly impacts the cost of green hydrogen. Regarding polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis, platinum group metal (PGM) loading is the major factor in increasing the electrolyzer cost. In particular, anode components have to use a large amount of PGM materials for their severe acidic and high potential condition. Iridium catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and platinum coatings to prevent Ti oxidation of the porous transport layer (PTL) should be reduced to meet the future PGM loading requirements 1 . Our research group has developed the Ir catalyst deposited PTL 2–4 . In this electrode, Ir protects the porous transport layer from Ti oxidation and acts as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, leading to Pt loading reduction on PTL. However, Ir loading reduction is also certainly important due to their high material cost. Here, we develop a Ru-core Ir-shell catalyst deposited PTL to enhance the OER activity of the catalyst deposited on the PTL. Applying binary catalysts 5 on PTLs has a potential to reduce Ir loading by improving catalytic activity 3 . Experimental Titanium microfiber sheets with a nominal porosity of ca. 70% (Nikko Techno, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were used as the substrates acting as catalyst supports and PTLs. Chemical etching with NaOH solution was performed to increase the surface area of the titanium PTL. First, titanium sheets were etched in an aqueous 1 M NaOH solution at 60 °C for 1 h. After that, the etched titanium sheets were washed under ultra-sonication in 0.01M HNO 3 solution for 30 min and then washed in deionized water at room temperature for 10 min. Heat treatment was then performed at 400 °C in 5% H 2 -N 2 gas for 30 min. The catalyst-deposited PTL was prepared by depositing the catalyst onto the NaOH-etched titanium sheets via arc plasma deposition. Iridium and ruthenium were deposited onto the NaOH-etched titanium sheets at room temperature via arc plasma deposition (APD-S, Advanced RIKO, Inc., Yokohama, Japan). The Ru-core Ir-shell catalyst structure was prepared by Ru deposition followed by Ir deposition. The total PGM loading was fixed at 0.17 mg cm -2 , and the Ru/Ir ratio was varied to evaluate the effect of their ratio. The PTEs deposited with the Ru-core Ir-shell catalysts were applied as PEMWE anodes. MEAs were prepared by hot-pressing the PTLs with the cathode catalyst-coated electrolyte membranes at 140 °C and 0.3 MPa for 180 s. Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the Ru-core Ir-shell catalyst deposited on the surface-modified PTL 3 . The core-shell catalysts with Ru/Ir ratios of (a) 3:1 and (b) 1:1 have Ir shell thicknesses of 3-4 nm and 4-6 nm, respectively. Therefore, it is found that the thickness of the Ir shell can be controlled by varying the loading ratio of Ir and Ru in the physical vapor deposition method. The cell with the Ru-core Ir-shell catalyst deposited on PTL exhibited higher mass activity for the Ir amount and higher electrolysis performance than the cell with only Ir deposited PTL. However, the cell durability decreased while thinner Ir shells had higher activity. Therefore, it is necessary to use more stable oxide core materials to improve durability.

Iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) stands out as the most effective catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a pivotal component of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Despite its exceptional catalytic prowess, the kinetics of this reaction still impose limitations on the efficient production of green H 2 , thereby inflating costs and impeding broader commercialization. The catalytic activity of IrO 2 for OER is influenced by its local chemical and atomic environment, wherein distinct crystallographic facets with unique atomic arrangements can induce significant variations even with the same bulk composition. In this study, we examine the OER performance across five distinct rutile IrO 2 facets. Through DFT calculations, we predict cyclic voltammetry (under the water oxidation potential) and compare directly to the results to experiments conducted on IrO 2 thin films for validation. Unlike pure metallic systems characterized by degenerate active sites resulting in broad single redox peaks, or homogeneous systems where redox reactions occur at metallic centers, active sites on metal oxide surfaces exhibit localization yet remain interconnected via various types of oxygen bonds. This unique attribute introduces additional considerations that must be included to interpret redox behavior, because interactions between adjacent intermediates alter their identities differently for different applied potentials. We find that multiple redox features can overlap while a single type of redox couple can be associated with multiple redox features. To elucidate the OER activity under operational conditions (> 1.23 V RHE ), we conducted grand canonical calculations to explicitly capture the dependence of reactions on the applied potential, with particular emphasis on non-electrochemical steps such as O-O coupling. Through the construction of various possible OER pathways and amalgamating their energy landscapes into a unified microkinetic scheme under steady-state assumptions, we successfully replicate the experimental OER current density for each of the five facets. Our analysis unveils mechanistic disparities between nucleophilic attack and direct oxo coupling across facets, predicting rates as a function of applied potential and identifying the rate-limiting steps. Our approach provides a thorough comprehension of the OER mechanism at the atomic level, offering valuable insights into the structural characteristics that enhance or inhibit the OER activity of IrO 2 . We expect these insights to have implications for understanding the structural effects on other heterogeneous catalysts which should aid the development of more efficient electrocatalysts.

Co-electrolysis of H 2 O and CO 2 in protonic ceramic membrane reactors (PCMRs) is considered a promising approach to convert CO 2 into value-added products, but also a way to in-situ store green hydrogen from intermediate temperature (400-600 o C) H 2 O electrolysis in the form of chemicals or fuels. 1 In such PCMRs, steam is split (oxygen evolution reaction-OER) over the anodic electrode (positrode) while the protons created are subsequently transported through the ceramic electrolyte to the cathodic electrode (negatrode) where they react with CO 2 . This system exhibits significant challenges regarding the choice of the electrocatalysts’ components at both sides of the ceramic membrane. For instance, the highly oxidizing environment of the anodic steam electrolysis rules out the state-of-art Ni-based ceramometallic (cermet) electrodes, whereas the CO 2 electrocatalyst environment should be appropriately tuned to achieve high selectivity to the desired products. 2 Herein, we have synthesized, characterized and evaluated the performance of promising mixed ionic-(protons, oxygen ions) electronic conducting oxides (perovskites and misfit layered oxides) for use as anodes for OER. The as synthesized electrode systems were firstly characterized with several physicochemical methods (XRD, TPR, TGA, XPS) and then deposited on Ni-cermet supported half-cells for the electrocatalytic studies (EIS, LSV, CP). The results have shown that several candidate materials could allow > 80% faradaic efficiencies, while a significant number of protons reacted with CO 2 towards primarily CO and less towards CH 4 . Interestingly, the distribution of the products showed a strong dependence on the operation temperature and current density with methane selectivity to be improved at lower operation temperatures and high current densities. The latter is practically results in higher ratios of H2/CO2 which is expected to enhance methane yields. References Vøllestad, R. Strandbakke, M. Tarach, D. Catalán-Martínez, M.-L. Fontaine, D.

Optimizing hydrogen and oxygen transport within porous electrodes is essential for improving the efficiency of industrial alkaline electrolyzers. Current commercial electrodes, such as nickel foam, are limited by insufficient gas management. Research suggests that at least 5% efficiency improvements can be obtained by enhancing bubble removal in electrolyzers 1,2 . This challenge is particularly pronounced in large-scale industrial alkaline electrolyzers, with electrode diameters upwards of two meters 3 . In this study, we present quasi-dynamic operando neutron radiographic measurements conducted on an alkaline electrolysis cell equipped with commercial nickel foam electrodes. The imaging measurements involved a parametric study examining the impact of various operational parameters including pore density, current density, flow rate, and electrolyzer configuration (comparing zero gap versus non-zero gap assembly). All imaging experiments were conducted at NEUTRA at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Operando neutron imaging offers a unique approach for direct monitoring of the spatial distribution of hydrogen and oxygen gases inside the nickel foam during electrolysis. Utilizing the high contrast in attenuation between the electrolyte and gas, it is possible to identify transport-related bottlenecks, active regions of the electrodes during operation, and immobilized bubbles. Our findings suggest that the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions primarily occur near the electrode-membrane interface. Specifically, imaging of the bottom part of the electrolysis cell indicates that approximately 50% of hydrogen and oxygen is produced in the innermost quarters of both the cathode and anode. Additionally, stroboscopic operando neutron imaging reveals that 5 - 10% of the volume within the electrode compartments remains occupied by trapped gas bubbles even after system flush-out, underscoring the critical need for enhanced gas management within electrolyzers. In this talk, we will present the experimental method applied in our study, discuss our findings, and detail how these results can lead to further optimization of electrolyzers. We will also demonstrate how the experimental results can be used as input for numerical modelling, and thus providing a practical framework for improving electrolyzer design and operation. Through this work, we aim to contribute to the development of more efficient and effective electrolyzer technologies by combining neutron imaging with numerical modelling.

To mitigate global warming, the integration of renewable energy sources into energy conversion/generation systems is fundamental. Currently the dominant alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) technology suffers from challenges including the crossover of product gases, high ohmic resistance, limited current density and low operating pressure, mainly because of utilization of a diaphragm and a liquid electrolyte in the AWE device. Using a polymer-based proton exchange membrane (PEM) for efficient proton transfers, PEM water electrolysis (PEM–WE) technology can effectively tackle the above challenges with markedly enhanced performance, and is thus attracting broad research interest, 1 but relies on scarce iridium oxide at the anode. In the quest for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, iridium-based perovskite oxides have attracted attention due to their unique A x Ir y O 3 structures and cost-effectiveness, with the diversity of these structures determining their catalytic activity. 2 The geometric arrangement of [IrO 6 ] octahedra and their interaction with A-site cations influence their OER performance, particularly those with distorted [IrO 6 ] octahedra showing higher activity due to the proximity of π- and π* orbital structures to the Fermi level. 3 Furthermore, these materials undergo surface reconstruction and metal ion dissolution under electrochemical conditions, indicating a close connection between structural evolution and catalytic activity. 4 This dynamic evolution process reflects changes on the catalyst surface under various external conditions, emphasizing the importance of utilizing in-situ or operando analytical techniques to track active structures for understanding catalytic mechanisms and guiding the design of new catalysts. In this research, four iridium-based perovskite oxides with distinct crystal structures (9R-BaIrO 3 , 6H-SrIrO 3 , 3C-SrIrO 3 , and BCC-SrIrO 3 ) were synthesized through the solution calcination method, aimed to act as catalysts for the OER in PEM–WE. The material characteristics and electrocatalytic performances of the surface IrO x layers post-acid treatment was rigorously analyzed utilizing ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical measurement. Among these catalysts, 9R-BaIrO 3 demonstrated superior OER activity and durability, attributed to its exclusive face-shared [IrO 6 ] octahedral trimer structure alongside extensive surface hydroxylation. The operando Ir L 3 -edge XAS and high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detected XAS (HERFD-XAS) measurement revealed changes in the oxidation state of the Ir (3+ to 4+σ) with increasing potentials, highlighting a lower Ir-O coordination environment and longer bond length as crucial factors for enhanced OER activity. Moreover, operando O K-edge XAS analysis provided in Figure 1 provides further insight into the selective oxygen binding sites during the OER, which are influenced by the degree of distortion in the [IrO 6 ] octahedra. Specifically, oxygen species showed a preference for binding to the μ 1 sites in catalysts with less symmetrical monoclinic structures, whereas, in more symmetrical tetragonal/cubic structured catalysts, oxygen species predominantly bonded to μ 2 sites. Moreover, in perovskite-structured catalysts, activation at the μ 3 sites leads to lattice oxygen involvement, resulting in a disordered surface structure. This disorder surpasses that observed in conventional amorphous IrO x catalysts, thereby enhancing the catalyst's efficiency in OER by promoting more dynamic and effective surface interactions. By deepening our comprehension of the operational dynamics of iridium-based perovskite oxides in OER, this research not only enriches the fundamental knowledge base but also forges a path toward the creation of more efficient and stable catalysts.

Anion-exchange-membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is a nascent green hydrogen production technology. Its main advantage lies in its ability to utilize non-platinum group metals (PGMs) as catalysts and PFSA-free polymer as a membrane, unlike proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). It is well-known that, unlike PEMWE, AEMWE suffers greatly from substituting the electrolytic feed solution with a solution of a lower pH ( e.g. , pure water). Literature has attributed the loss of performance to the lower reaction kinetics of both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the drastic loss of electrolyte conductivity, which is further exacerbated at higher current density [1]. Notably, it is shown that addition of salt to improve the conductivity of electrolyte does not always equate to a better performance over time, depending on the feed configuration, highlighting the importance of understanding mass transport during cell operation [2]. Therefore, to decouple the causes of the drastic losses of performance in-situ , we have developed a system capable of feeding vapor and liquid into AEMWE asymmetrically. The cell is constructed using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabricated by the catalyst coated membrane (CCM) method, where platinum on carbon (Pt/C) and iridium oxide (IrO x ) are coated directly on PiperION ® anion exchange membranes. Moreover, we have studied hydroxide crossover both statically using an h-cell test and dynamically in an AEMWE cell. We have shown that, by utilizing various combinations of feeds, including humidified gas, pure water, or KOH, through both cathode and anode, it is possible to study cell performance and hydroxide transport under different conditions. Through which, we have elucidated the performance loss, the importance of hydroxide transport, and a strategy to overcome such losses, thus showing the possibility of advancing toward pure water and low-temperature vapor electrolysis.

The article titled "Dynamics of anion exchange membrane electrolysis: Unravelling loss mechanisms with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reference electrodes and distribution of relaxation times" explores the challenges and mechanisms in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM-WE). The study by Matthias Ranz and colleagues employs electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), half-cell measurements using a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis to delve into the dynamics of AEM-WE cells. AEM-WE is gaining attention as a promising technology for hydrogen production due to its potential cost benefits over conventional electrolysis systems. However, its adoption faces obstacles such as efficiency issues and high degradation rates. To address these challenges, the research employs detailed electrochemical characterization techniques, providing new insights into the operational dynamics of AEM-WE cells. The study reveals five major loss mechanisms within AEM-WE systems: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and ion transport losses, among others, occurring mostly within the catalyst layers. The findings also discuss the influence of various operating parameters on these loss mechanisms and how they can be systematically tracked and analyzed through EIS. A significant aspect of the research is the application of DRT analysis, a method not previously used in AEM-WE studies. This analysis method helps in identifying and quantifying the different electrochemical phenomena contributing to cell losses. By correlating these phenomena with their physicochemical origins, the study enhances understanding of the underlying processes within AEM-WE cells. Moreover, the use of equivalent circuit models in conjunction with EIS data provides a deeper understanding of the electrochemical behavior of the system. This combined approach allows for a more precise characterization of the impedance features and the differentiation of processes such as ion transport and electrochemical reactions. Ultimately, the research highlights the complexity of the AEM-WE process and emphasizes the need for advanced diagnostic tools to optimize performance and stability. By pinpointing the specific causes of efficiency losses and identifying opportunities for material and process improvements, the study contributes significantly to the development of more robust and efficient AEM-WE systems. In conclusion, the research not only elucidates the various loss mechanisms in AEM-WE but also showcases the potential of advanced electrochemical techniques like EIS and DRT in enhancing the understanding and optimization of this promising hydrogen production technology. This work sets a foundation for future studies aimed at overcoming the limitations of AEM-WE and advancing towards its commercial viability.

With the growing attention on renewable energy, hydrogen is receiving attention as an energy carrier to resolve the temporal and spatial constraints of renewable energy. Electrical energy generated from renewable energy can be efficiently stored and transported in the form of hydrogen. Here, water electrolysis consists of two reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the high activation energy of OER is the main bottleneck of water electrolysis. Consequently, highly active catalysts are indispensable. Currently, the Pt- and Ir-based noble metal catalysts boast the highest performance for OER, but face significant commercialization hurdles due to their high cost. Transition metal-based compounds are promising as substitutes of Platinum group materials for OER catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and earth-abundant properties. In particular, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) such as Ni-P are receiving much attention due to its remarkable catalytic performance approaching that of Pt-based one. In Ni-P, electrons are transferred from Ni to P due to the difference in electronegativity, allowing the energy of the HER and OER intermediate to be controlled for optimal activity. Furthermore, the Ni-P synthesized through electrodeposition has high potential as a promising substitute because they can have a variety of P ratios on the N-P surface, that can significantly affect catalytic activity and improve it more. Unfortunately, however, the electrodeposited Ni-P mostly has a flat and aggregated morphology, resulting in a low surface area and hence low catalytic performance. Therefore, to maximize the catalytic performance of the electroplated Ni-P. it is necessary to increase in surface area and number of active sites as well as the optimization of surficial P ratio. In this context, we propose a morphology control method using electrochemical dealloying, which can greatly increase the surface area of the electroplated Ni-P. Specifically, under acidic conditions, a potential higher than the reduction potential of Ni causes partial dealloying of Ni on the Ni-P catalyst. Then, the partial dealloyed Ni creates defects between grains and forms a porous structure. As a result, the surface of the dealloyed Ni-P catalyst was exposed along the grain boundaries through SEM, and a quantitative increase in surface area was confirmed through cyclic voltammetry (CV). In addition, it was confirmed through XPS analysis that the bond between Ni and P became stronger, and based on this, it was confirmed that the tafel slope and TOF of the catalyst increased. The increase in overall performance of the catalyst was confirmed through the polarization curve as surface area and intrinsic activity increased. Figure 1

Water (H 2 O) electrolysis represents a sustainable approach to produce green hydrogen (H 2 ); however, the high energy cost (2H 2 O → 4H 2 + O 2 , ∆H° = 286 kJ/mol H 2 , E° = −1.23 V) associated with water electrolysis and electricity cost (>$50/MWh) results in a minimum H 2 selling price ≈$4/kg H 2 . Therefore, we need to find an alternative process to generate H 2 to meet the current U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Energy Earthshots of $1/kg H 2 in one decade. Seawater represents an earth abundant natural H 2 O source for H 2 generation in island and coastal communities. However, there are several technical challenges hindering its widespread implementation such as the corrosive nature of seawater and the production of poisonous chlorine gas (Cl 2 ) via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER: 4Cl - → Cl 2 + 4e - , E° = 1.36 V vs. RHE). The CER competes against the oxygen evolution reaction (OER: 2H 2 O → 4H + + 4e - + O 2 , E° = 1.23 V vs. RHE), thus inhibiting the production of e - and H + needed for the H 2 production via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER: 4H + + 4e - → 2H 2 , E° = 0.0 V vs RHE). Instead, we propose to use the full electrocatalytic oxidation (FECO) of naturally-occurring and artificially-made organic molecules to generate H 2 (e.g., CH 3 COOH + 2H 2 O → 2CO 2 + 8e - + 8H + , E° = −0.02 V vs RHE) which occurs at >1 V lower potential than CER and OER. As opposed to traditional H 2 O electrolysis that requires clean water streams, the proposed electrolysis technology can use readily available H 2 O streams containing organic molecules (e.g., municipal wastewater) combined with seawater to generate H 2 while removing the undesirable organic contaminants. In this work, we compare the performance of heterogeneous electrocatalysts for the FECO of organic molecules present in wastewater in a model seawater electrolyte (0.1−0.6 M NaCl) at room temperature. PECO electrocatalysts were developed and tested using real wastewaters derived from several sources including the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of food waste. We synthesized the PECO electrocatalysts using both platinum-group metals (PGM) as well as base-group metals (BGM) and tested them as a function of half-cell potential. Our results show that both PGM- and BGM-based bimetallics improve the activity and stability compared to the baseline RuO 2 -based catalysts. Figure 1

Hydrogen is a multifaceted tool that is prospected to be a key alternative energy source in the fight against climate change as it is energy dense, can be used directly as a fuel source in hydrogen fuel cells, and its storage & energy capacity are seasonally/temperature independent. Grey hydrogen is the predominant H 2 manufacturing process—producing over 10x more CO 2, eq than H 2 . Only about 5% of H 2 is made by green hydrogen, or electrolysis, which produces up to 10x less CO 2,eq than its counterpart 1 . The Hydroxide Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer (HEMEL) is a contemporary green hydrogen device. Other green hydrogen devices exist, such as the alkaline electrolyzer—which is inefficient due to its high resistance liquid electrolyte—and the proton exchange membrane electrolyzer—which is costly and requires the use of platinum group metal catalysts. The HEMEL uses a highly efficient solid electrolyte but does not depend on the use of rare metal catalysts, instead allowing abundant metals, such as nickel, to be utilized. HEMELs function with a coupled set of reactions—the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)—that, together, produce hydrogen and oxygen gas through electrolysis. At the cathode, H 2 O splits at HER active sites to form H 2 and OH - . The H 2 bubbles out of the system and is collected. The OH - is shuttled across an anion-selective membrane made of poly(aryl piperidinium) ionomer. After crossing the membrane, the OH - meets FeNiOOH-F active sites on the OER anode side to satisfy the full-cell reaction. Industrial-scale manufacturing is the ultimate goal of HEMELs. Since the technology is maturing, production research must be closely studied to prepare for the transition from lab-scale research to large-scale processing. This study will focus on the ionomer deposition of the anode and how the relative humidity (RH) of that environment impacts HEMEL performance. The catalyst-covered anode is dip-coated in an ionomer solution and let to dry at room temperature and varying RHs, between 9% and 92%. Nickel felt and nickel foam anode porous transport layers are tested as well as three ionomer types. Through full-cell polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, RH at the time of anode-ionomer dip-coating is found to be a substantial factor in HEMEL performance. Up to a 30% increase in HEMEL performance could be attributed to lowering the RH of the environment that the anode is prepared in. Through analysis, it is suggested that the higher RH environments do not allow the ionomer to fully dry and form a strong, interlocked resin film. Thus, when the ionomer comes into contact with water flowing through the HEMEL, it swells substantially and obstructs the substrate’s pores. In turn, this hinders gas, water, and hydroxide transport—leading to high mass transport overpotentials.

Solar-driven seawater splitting is a promising approach for sustainable green hydrogen generation. Chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) can provide much faster kinetics than oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due to lower number of electrons involved in the interfacial charge transfer. Designing stable and efficient photoelectrodes for a photoelectrochemical (PEC) seawater splitting presents challenges due to the corrosive nature of seawater. BiVO 4 has been a promising photoanode for solar energy conversion to molecular hydrogen (H 2 ), due to desirable bandgap (2.4 eV), favorable band position and chemical stability. Nevertheless, BiVO 4 has been mostly employed for OER, and shows limitation of poor charge transport and insufficient active sites for interfacial charge transfer. This study proposed a composite photoanode comprising MoO x hole transfer layer and iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) electrocatalysts on BiVO 4 , to enhance photocurrent and stability in the PEC seawater splitting. The MoO x layer, containing Mo 6+ as electron donors, was deposited on BiVO 4 using a simple drop-casting method. A simple reductive electrodeposition introduced the FeOOH electrocatalysts, while simultaneously forming MoO x with surface defect states (FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 ) to facilitate the facilitating hole transfer through the segregated MoO x layer. The surface structure of FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode was investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed successful synthesis of MoO x and FeOOH layers on BiVO 4 . The charge separation efficiency was four times higher on the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode (78%) compared to the intact BiVO 4 photoanode (18%). Additionally, the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode exhibited improved photocurrent density for OER and ClER under simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight, reaching 3.3 mA cm -2 at 1.23 V RHE in circum-neutral pH, which is approximately three times higher than that of the intact BiVO 4 . The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode reached 0.9% at 1.23 V RHE , five times higher than that of intact BiVO 4 . Such excellent PEC activity can be ascribed to introduced surface defects (such as oxygen vacancy) on MoO x /BiVO 4 and alleviated kinetic barrier by FeOOH. Moreover, the photocurrent density of the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode in a 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte (for ClER) was 0.5 mA cm -2 higher than that in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte (for OER). Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) confirmed the improved charge transport behavior of the modified BiVO 4 for OER or ClER. The generation of reactive chlorine species could compromise the stability of FeOOH, which could be mitigated by an added aqueous pollutants. For instance, in the PEC chlorine evolution reaction system, ammonia or 4-chlorophenol as model pollutant enhanced the stability. Notably, the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 exhibited a 10-fold higher rate for ammonia oxidation compared to the intact BiVO 4 . A moderated concentration of bromide ion could further elevate the photocurrent density. The increased photocurrent activity of the modified FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode in PEC splitting of blended seawater and wastewater can serve multifaceted purposes, enhancing the efficiency of pollutants degradation (or chemical upgrading) and H 2 evolution.

In recent decades, the imperative for clean energy generation has grown significantly. Water electrolysis stands out as a sustainable method for hydrogen production due to its zero carbon emissions. However, high energy requirements and costs hinder its widespread adoption for large-scale applications [1]. Non-noble metal-based materials have emerged as cost-effective and efficient anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the stability and performance of these materials heavily rely on the integration of ionomers or binders into the electrode coatings. For example, Nafion, renowned for its high ionic conductivity and ability to stabilize coating structures [2], has been a preferred choice [3]. Yet, their high cost and impending regulations concerning per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances (PFAS) by European agencies necessitate the exploration of alternative approaches. Here, we propose a solution involving binder-free anode coatings, achieved through mechano-chemical activation via planetary ball milling of commercially available catalyst materials. This innovative method offers a promising avenue for developing environmentally sustainable anodes with effective performance, circumventing the limitations associated with conventional binder materials. In this study, nickel oxide (NiO, Merck group) was processed without binders through a modification of the powder material via planetary ball milling where parameters as bead size, rotation speed, and process time were varied. The initial visual contrast transformation from the green hue of the NiO feed to a dark grey or black shade appearance after ball milling which might indicate the presence of Ni 2 O 3 . Additionally, certain samples exhibited a needle-like morphology, with particle enlargement occurring selectively in instances involving larger beads during the milling process. These samples were discarded due to missing processability. Powder characterizations were conducted on both the as-purchased NiO feed (as reference) and the ball milled samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed reduced primary particle size across all ball milled samples as shown in the inset of Figure 1a-b. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis indicated a decrease in the Ni metal content with a simultaneous increase in the oxygen content, while – in line with our expectations [4] – the reduced crystallinity of all NiO phases after ball milling was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. With regard to the surface species, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy evidenced a significant increase of hydroxide (OH) in the ball milled samples. At the same time X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data revealed an increase in the Ni 3+ content, followed by a decrease in Ni 2+ as analyzed from the Ni 2p spectrum. Combining both findings, we expect an improved anode performance due to the formation of Ni(OH) 2 or NiOOH species [5]. Preliminary dispersion experiments were realized in different probe liquids [6] and subsequently the Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) were determined to achieve high-quality dispersions efficiently [7]. Because of the large particle size, all dispersions based on commercial NiO sedimented quickly, whereas the ball milled samples with significantly reduced primary particle size were stable in liquids like ethanol and isopropanol.This finding was quantified by transmittograms, where the sedimentation time, radial position and transmission are plotted together as shown in Figure 1a-b. Due to the inadequate dispersion stability of commercial NiO and thus missing processability, no electrodes were realized with this material. Finally, the ball milled samples were spray-coated onto Ni plate substrates without using binders. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images displayed diverse distributions of catalyst particles implying different coating structures and a range of morphologies. Electrochemical measurements at 100 mA cm -2 evidenced an improved activity of ~100 mV for the electrodes that were fabricated from the ball milled samples (Sample 1: 400 rpm, 4 h, Sample 2: 250 rpm, 2 h, constant bead size of 0.3 mm) during oxygen evolution compared to the bare Ni plate substrate as shown in Figure 1c. Within 2 h of testing, no delamination of the material was monitored evidencing its chemical and mechanical stability as a binder-free catalyst layer. In conclusion, this study presents a promising approach to achieve binder-free anodes enabled by mechanochemical activation. The versatility of this method offers opportunities to optimize non-noble metal-based materials for enhanced OER performance, thereby advancing the prospects of sustainable energy generation.

Rechargeable zinc-air batteries, typically composed of a zinc metal negative and an air positive electrode are promising candidate for next-generation energy-storage devices owing to its high theoretical energy density, abundant raw materials and safe non-flammable electrolytes. Nevertheless, the primary challenges encountered by air electrode are the high overpotential and limited cycling durability due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring in the discharging and charge processes. It has been demonstrated that ORR and OER take place at three-phase boundaries and effective reaction fields are different between ORR and OER, leading to varying rate-limiting factors for each reaction, thus they require different chemical environment [1-3] . Therefore, constructing a bifunctional air electrode with highly active catalysts and optimized configuration for both ORR and OER is crucial for addressing mentioned issues in air cathodes. Herein, a strategy of bilayer air electrode fabrication is proposed for high-performance and long-term durability zinc−air batteries. Concretely, ORR catalyst layer and OER catalyst layer were combined with gas diffusion layer (carbon paper) to fabricate gas diffusion electrode, where ORR catalyst layer was concentrated on gas diffusion layer side for promoting oxygen diffusion in electrolyte, while OER catalyst layer was concentrated on electrolyte side for facilitating hydroxide ions transfer [3] . In this study, the LaMnO 3 (LMO) synthesized by the traditional polymerized complex method and the partially Fe-substituted Ni oxyhydroxide (Ni 0.7 Fe 0.3 OOH) prepared by a soft chemical method [4] were applied as OER catalyst and ORR catalyst, respectively. Through optimization of bilayer fabrication process and parameters of catalyst layer, we’ve successfully fabricated a firmly bound bilayer electrode. It exhibits desirable high ORR and OER activities in alkaline electrolytes, coupled with long-term durability, rendering it highly promising for practical application in Zinc-air batteries. In addition, the EDS mapping characterization (Figure 1) of the cross-section of CP/LMO/Ni 0.7 Fe 0.3 OOH bilayer gas diffusion electrode reveals a desirable bilayer structure, which LMO and Ni 0.7 Fe 0.3 OOH catalyst layers exhibit even distribution throughout the lower and upper layer, respectively, as well as displaying uniform morphology and similar microstructures. This strategy of designing bilayer electrodes relying on different reactions provides a feasible avenue for bifunctional electrode design and further motivates exploration of electrode configuration involving multiphase electrochemical reactions.

Nanoscale Platinum group metals (PGMs) over conductive supports with large specific area have been widely used as highly efficient catalysts for various reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (for fuel cells) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) (for water electrolyers). However, these PGM nanoparticles (NPs) usually suffer from significant performance degradation over prolonged operation, primarily attributed to catalyst degradation, which remains a long-standing challenge. Two principal mechanisms, Ostwald ripening and particle migration, contribute to this degradation. Ostwald ripening is a process involves the first dissolution of smaller PGM NPs into PGM ions, followed by their diffusion and redeposition onto the surfaces of larger NP, where the driven force is surface energy. Particle migration, on the other hand, is a process of movement of PGM NPs leading to the formation of large agglomerates due to the weak interactions between NPs and supports. In general, both processes occurred simultaneously during catalyst degradation in the fuel cell/electrolyzer operation. However, addressing the PGM catalyst degradations caused by these mechanisms requires completely different strategies: enhancing intrinsic catalyst stability for overcoming Ostwald ripening and improving interactions between PGM NPs and supports for reducing particle migration. Hence, it is critically required to quantitatively differentiate between these two mechanisms during catalyst degradation. Here, we propose an innovative approach to distinguish the two mechanisms utilizing Identical Location Transmission Electron Microscope (IL-TEM) coupled with carefully designed experiments. Specifically, the IL-TEM grids with dispersed PGM catalysts, such as TKK 46%Pt/Kejten Black EC-300, would be imaged to characterized the particle geometry, size and interparticle distance of PGM NPs on before and after accelerated stress test (AST) for various cycles (i.e. 0, 5000, 10,000, 30,000 cycles, etc.) within an electrochemical cell. These PGM catalysts will undergo AST cycling among two potential regions: (1) 0.2 ~ 0.6V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) and (2) 0.6 ~ 0.95V (vs. SHE). PGM particles cycled within the potential region (1) should exhibit only particle migration, since potential below 0.6 V do not cause any oxidation of PGM, while those cycled within potential region (2) would experience both Ostwald ripening and particle migration. By comparing changes in particle geometry, size and interparticle distance for PGM NPs subjected to cycling within different potential regions, we could quantitively determine the contributive effect of each mechanism on the catalyst degradation. This study will shed the light on differentiation of these two different mechanisms and provide guidance for the design of highly active and stable PGM catalysts.

The aim of this presentation is to address three fundamental questions related to solid oxide cells: Are the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) indeed the rate-limiting steps in the high-performance of solid oxide cells, and how can we accurately quantify the area specific resistance of the oxygen electrode? What causes the phenomenon known as “electrochemically driven phase transformation,” and how can our understanding of this process be applied to create electrodes that are both high-performing and durable? How can we develop reliable accelerated testing protocols for both solid oxide fuel cells and solid oxide electrolysis cells, and which physical processes are being accelerated through these tests? The accurate quantification of electrode polarization in fuel cells and electrolyzers holds critical importance but presents a significant challenge due to the extensive overlap in polarizations from both the anode and cathode, whether in DC or AC measurements. This overlap creates a notable gap in our understanding of electrode behavior and in the development of electrochemical devices that are both high-performing and durable. In this presentation, I will introduce a reliable method for measuring the polarization of individual electrodes within a solid oxide cell. This technique is versatile and can be easily adapted for use in various types of electrochemical cells. Additionally, we will explore the limitations associated with using the distribution of relaxation times analysis for determining the polarization of individual electrodes. We will then address the origin for the phase transformation observed in an oxygen electrode during operation, as opposed to what is seen with thermally annealed materials. By integrating electronic conduction at the interface layer, we can significantly reduce the occurrence of phase transformation. This understanding of “electrochemically driven phase change” is crucial for the development of reliable accelerated testing protocols. Such protocols are essential in solid oxide fuel cell research to speed up the investigation of durability issues, quickly identify potential failure mechanisms, and ultimately estimate the lifespan of electrochemical cells. In our study, we compared solid oxide fuel cells operated at constant current density with those subjected to accelerated testing methods, which involve intermittent current injections. We have formulated a general accelerated testing framework, which will be presented in detail. Finally, we will present a theoretical model that underlies those three questions and can be used to address stability and durability issues in solid oxide cells.

Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are the favored technology driving the market toward sustainable energy sources and electrified transportation. However, cathode materials in LIBs pose a key challenge, limiting both energy storage capacity and cost-effectiveness. Among the different classes of cathode materials, transition metal oxides are most utilized due to their ability to provide high voltage and the reversible Li-ion intercalation during battery operation. Specifically, manganese (Mn)-based oxide cathodes are quite attractive due to their low toxicity and cost 1 . However, in promising cathodes such as LiMn 2 O 3 , Mn 3+ ions are Jahn-Teller (J-T) active, making them prone to leaching out in the electrolyte during LIB operation 2 . The dissolved Mn not only leads to the loss of cathode active material but also gets subsequently deposited on the anodes, leading to gradual capacity fading of the LIB. Therefore, elucidating and addressing this issue continues to be an ongoing endeavor with practical implications. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are the two most widely used techniques to study the Mn-dissolution phenomenon from LIB cathodes. However, these techniques are typically ex-situ in nature and have low temporal resolution. Furthermore, they offer no spatial information on the heterogeneity of the Mn dissolution from cathode materials, and their limited sensitivity makes it challenging to quantitatively investigate Mn dissolution within a reasonable time frame. This work introduces scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) as an in-situ tool to tackle this challenge and enable real-time quantitative investigation of Mn dissolution from LIB cathodes. We utilize LiMn 2 O 3 as a model system to develop the SECM-based method to study Mn dissolution. Mercury (Hg)-based SECM probes allow selective investigation of the Mn dissolving from the cathode with exceptional sensitivity using anodic stripping voltammetry. The close proximity of the SECM probe to the cathode surface (<15 μm) offers high temporal resolution of ~300 ms. Correlating SECM experimental results with COMSOL Multiphysics simulations helps in the quantification of the Mn lost from the cathodes as a function of different cathode operating conditions. In addition, rastering the SECM tip across the cathodes provides the opportunity to study spatial heterogeneity in the Mn dissolution behavior. Furthermore, this work correlates the lattice oxygen loss from LiMn 2 O 3 with Mn dissolution by detecting both oxygen and Mn within the SECM experimental setup, utilizing our previously developed method to investigate lattice oxygen loss from oxide cathodes in LIB 3 . In summary, this work provides insight into the degradation process of transition-metal oxide-based LIB cathodes involving both lattice oxygen loss and transition metal dissolution.

In the quest for sustainable energy solutions, our recent submission targets a critical challenge in the realm of hydrogen energy production, specifically within Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) systems. The overarching goal is to reduce the reliance on iridium (Ir), a scarce and expensive material, thereby enhancing the economic feasibility and sustainability of hydrogen production. To achieve this, we have refined our synthesis approach, focusing on the dispersion of Ir within tungsten oxide supported Ir nanoparticles (NPs). A comparative analysis of different solvents (organic versus aqueous) and concentrations revealed that aqueous solutions at lower concentrations offer superior catalyst dispersion and a higher loading of iridium. This outcome is pivotal for creating a continuous conductive layer essential for PEMWE applications, where the efficiency of water electrolysis can be significantly impacted by the catalyst's performance. Our innovations have led to a substantial increase in activity under acidic conditions, as evidenced by Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) testing. Here, we achieved a performance enhancement of 3.2 times at 1.55V compared to Iridium Black, and remarkably, over 30 times when juxtaposed with crystalline Iridium Oxide. Such advancements underscore the potential for considerable efficiency improvements in hydrogen production. Our prior investigations, through Synchrotron-based X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) has provided insights into the electron donation capabilities of Tungsten Oxide during the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) process. This electron donation boosts the electron density on iridium, thereby amplifying its catalytic activity and mitigating over-oxidation risks. Our investigation also extended to operando-Synchrotron-based XPS analyses of in-situ acidic electrolysis reactions under catalyst-coated membranes. Notably, at low iridium loadings, we observed that Iridium Black is prone to over-oxidation and activity loss at voltages exceeding 1.7 V (vs. RHE), a challenge not faced by tungsten oxide supported Ir, which demonstrated stable performance signals and avoided current density degradation at higher voltages. By successfully implementing this advanced material in PEMWE applications, we have made significant strides towards achieving high efficiency with low Ir loading. This breakthrough not only enhances the economic viability of hydrogen energy production but also contributes to the broader adoption of green energy solutions, marking a significant advancement in the pursuit of sustainable and efficient membrane electrode assemblies for hydrogen production.

Lithium (Li) metal batteries have attracted world-wide attention due to its low density (0.534 g/cm 3 ), high theoretical capacity (3,860 mAh/g), and low electrochemical potential (-3.04 V vs. SHE), enabling their potential to double the cell-level energy of the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. However, there are still key materials issues that inhibit lithium metal and high-voltage cathodes from being commercialized as the anode and cathode, respectively, for rechargeable battery applications. For Li metal anode, the chemical and morphological (e.g., grain distribution, surface roughness, etc.) non-uniformity, coupled with the high reactivity of lithium drive heterogeneous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, poor ionic flux distribution, active material consumption, and rapid dendrite growth. Currently, there are ex-situ and in-situ approaches to address the above issues. For example, one of approaches is to coat artificial SEI layers on Li metal anode surfaces. The component, distribution and structures of SEI layers should be designed and well controlled. The other approach is to exploit advanced electrolyte to in-situ form high-performance SEI layers. At the cathode side, due to instable cathode structure, oxygen evolution and side reaction between electrolyte and cathode materials at high voltage (> 4.3V vs. Li/Li+), the robust and Li ion conductive cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers are required to stabilize the cathode at high voltage. In this talk, we will present our recent work from the three aspects: a) novel closed-host bi-layer porous/dense artificial SEI layers were designed [1] ; b) the microstructures of localized high-concentration electrolyte were deeply understood and thus new electrolytes with high-performance SEI layers being formed were discovered; [2] (c) a novel artificial CEI coating was proposed to stabilize the cathode at the high voltage.

Solutions for effective energy conversion and storage are needed for the shift from fossil fuel-based, CO 2 -intensive energy production to a future sustainable energy-based economy. This way green energy from renewable sources, such as solar or wind power, may later be re-electrified. One option is to use water electrolysis to transform energy from renewable sources into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis is a potent, cutting-edge technique that leverages rare iridium-based catalysts to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to solve this issue. Reducing the total density of iridium-based catalysts for the OER requires minimizing the usage of rare and valuable iridium, which will enhance the PEM process's sustainability and economics. Here we present an investigation aimed to further reduce the iridium usage for proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis. First, SnO 2 nanofibers are produced utilizing a water-free alkoxide route. A wet-chemical method is then used to deposit nanoparticulate IrO(OH) x on the filaments. After subsequent oxidation at various temperatures, the final OER active catalyst is obtained. With the emphasis on reaching high activity, stability, and conductivity at the laboratory level, ultra-small interconnected IrO x /IrO 2 nanoparticles anchored to electrospun SnO 2 nanofibers (IrO x /IrO 2 @SnO 2 ) and associated percolation pathways are investigated. The utilization of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in scanning mode (STEM) before and after electrocatalytic reactions provides insights into the oxidation and crystallization state of iridium oxide nanoparticles dependent on temperature and upon catalytic use. This enables an understanding of further possible reduction of iridium content by optimizing synthesis parameters. The data indicate that the optimal iridium utilization is achieved at 375°C oxidation temperature, with the highest resulting conductivity and electrochemical activity. Furthermore, TEM data reveal initiation of crystallization of IrO 2 in the temperature window between 365 and 375°C. The pivotal role of conductivity in electron transport to active sites is underscored by cyclic voltammetry (CVA) measurements, which provide further insight regarding performance and stability with a view on future PEM electrolysis applications. These findings not only enhance our fundamental understanding but also offer practical strategies for advancing cost-effective and efficient electrolysis technologies.

The current commercial loading of Platinum grade materials (PGMs) per membrane electrode assembly (MEA) stands at 2 mg/cm2, necessitating significant efforts to redesign electrocatalyst materials through a nano-architecture approach, requiring a thousandfold increase in surface area (from µm to nm scale) and a tenfold reduction in mass loading (from mg to µg). This objective can be realized through innovative surface engineering and manufacturing techniques as traditional wet synthesis methods pose several steps leading to spot errors (during ink formulation and coating) and high manufacturing costs (during drying steps) hampering scale-up efforts especially for low PGM loading < 0.5 mg/cm 2 in PEM-WE. VSPARTICLE developed a nano-printing technology utilizing spark ablation. This dry-synthesis method generates nanoparticle films only by using metal rods and electricity, and immobilize nano-porous electrocatalyst thin films on any substrate. In this presentation, we will unveil the latest findings concerning oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes employing Ir-based and Ni-based catalysts produced through the innovative VSP-P1 nano-printing technology. The MEAs prepared using spark ablation had significantly lower loading (e.g., 0.1 and 0.4 mg/cm2) than the commercial state-of-the-art without compromising performance. The study integrates comprehensive flow-cell experiments, meticulous control tests, and characterization techniques on proxy samples, leveraging the versatility of VSP-P1 to create identical nano-porous films on various substrates. The scalability of this dry manufacturing process, coupled with rapid iteration capability for tuning material parameters and test-beds, promises a tenfold acceleration in electrocatalyst utilization. In conclusion, this presentation unveils an efficient strategy for catalyst utilization through nano-printed layers, significantly reducing the time required to bring novel materials to market. The methodology outlined herein holds great promise for advancing hydrogen deployment and sustainable transitions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is an established technology to produce green hydrogen. Further improvements in terms of material (cost) reduction, performance, and durability are required to meet the ramp-up targets of a large-scale production of PEMWE stacks and to reduce the levelized costs of hydrogen production. It is key to maintain or even increase the durability of the iridium-based anodic catalyst layer while further reducing its raw metal demand. Usually, the development of novel materials used as anode catalysts is progressing faster than the evaluation under PEMWE conditions in cell and stack tests. Therefore, accelerated stress tests (ASTs) have to be developed. 1, 2 ASTs are degradation mechanism-specific protocols that have a targeted and accelerated effect, and significantly reduce the required test time. In this work, several voltage-controlled AST protocols and their application in PEMWE cell tests with various anode catalyst types and iridium loadings are analyzed. The AST protocols consist of rapid changes in the voltage between 1.9 V and either 1.25 V, open circuit voltage or 0 V. For reference the voltage is kept constant at 1.9 V. The effects of these protocols on the kinetic parameters of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), e.g. the apparent exchange current density and the Tafel slope, are evaluated using three different methods. As state of the art, the voltage breakdown analysis (VBA) method is used and directly compared to two other methods, i.e. the constant Tafel slope (CT-VBA) 3 method and the OER mass activity method. Furthermore, the influence of dynamic potential profiles on the kinetic overpotential is analyzed with an overpotential difference approach. Depending on the method used, the resulting trends for the OER kinetic parameters diverge. In doing so, we want to raise awareness about the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of each method and their impact of the respective interpretation. 4 References S. M. Alia, S. Stariha and R. L.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are a promising technology to achieve green hydrogen. Currently, PEMWE cost is dominated by the high loadings of ultra-scarce Ir-based catalysts, which remains the only metal that demonstrates a promising balance of activity and durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the limiting reaction of PEMWEs. 1 Aimed at improving the activity and durability, current PEMWEs use high Ir loadings up to several mg Ir cm -2 . The high Ir loadings provide a pathway for electronic transport through particle-particle contacts, while yielding a thicker catalyst layer to maintain electronic conductivity as the nanoparticles degrade through operation. The DOE Hydrogen Earthshot aims to reduce the cost of green hydrogen by 80%. To realize this ambitious goal, Ir loadings must be significantly reduced, while maintaining conductivity and durability, which remains a major challenge. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of stable, conductive, Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (Nb-TiO 2 ) nanowires as supports, for durable PEMWEs at low Ir loadings. The Nb-TiO 2 nanowires provide an enhanced electron transport pathway through a 1-D morphology, reducing particle-particle contact resistances. Through a photodeposition-based approach 2 , a continuous layer of IrO x nanoparticles is formed on the surface of the Nb-TiO 2 nanowire. The activity of the IrO x /Nb-TiO 2 nanowire is evaluated in both a rotating disk electrode and PEMWE configuration, outperforming an unsupported commercial IrO x catalyst. Accelerated stress tests cycling between 2.0 V and 1.45 V holds over 300 hours, show the superior durability of the IrO x /Nb-TiO 2 nanowire catalyst at a low Ir loading of 0.12 mg Ir cm -2 , compared to the commercial IrO x catalyst. Our results demonstrate a promising platform to achieve highly active and durable Ir-based catalysts in practical PEMWEs at low Ir loadings.

Anthropogenic climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-based processes highlights the importance for alternative synthesis pathways for platform chemicals. Electrochemical CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution offer sustainable options for platform chemical synthesis. However, pairing of the reduction reactions is often done with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which consumes a major share of the total energy demand without contributing to value creation. In contrast, the partial methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is an energy-efficient alternative to OER, yielding formate as a valuable product. While MOR is often studied in terms of high Faraday efficiencies, little attention is paid to conversion and yield regarding paired processes. In this work, we investigate the oxidation of methanol to formate and examine the influence of different reaction parameters including current density, temperature, flow rate, and electrolyte to increase the yield and conversion towards industrially relevant levels. Hierarchically structured CuO foam electrodes (5x5cm²) were employed as the MOR anode. To this end, electrochemically deposited dendrites on a fine-pored copper foam were subsequently oxidized to provide a large surface area for the MOR. The electrode was positioned within an electrochemical cell to ensure continuous flow through the foam, thereby utilizing the high electrode surface area. A defined electrolyte volume was recirculated through the cell and product analysis was conducted via Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for calculation of methanol conversion and Faradaic efficiency (FE) to formate. Increasing the current density from 50 to 200 mA/cm² led to a decrease in the initial FE and final conversion from 92% to 76% and 88% to 85%, respectively. Conversely, elevating temperature from 25 °C to 55 °C increased FE from 83% to 93% and conversion from 74% to 83%. A raise of the electrolyte flow rate from 25 to 100 mL/min showed no impact on FE and conversion. Change in electrolyte composition revealed a negative correlation between KOH concentration and FE, decreasing from 91% to 64% with a rise from 1 M to 4 M KOH. Conversely, increasing MeOH concentration from 0.5 M to 2 M enhanced FE from 71% to 92%. Finally, MOR was paired with alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using two different membrane types, either a bipolar membrane (BPM) or an anion exchange membrane (AEM). Operating at optimized conditions resulting from the previous investigations (100 mA/cm², 55 °C, 50 mL/min, 2 M KOH, and 1 M MeOH), both setups achieved over 90% methanol conversion before the FE dropped to zero. The BPM approach exhibited slightly higher initial FE (over 95%) compared to the AEM approach (over 86%), with respective yields of 70% and 68% at anodic potentials of 1.49 V and 1.33 V. This study provides valuable insights into the influence of reaction conditions on methanol oxidation to formate regarding industrially relevant conversions. Furthermore, the study successfully demonstrates two concepts of pairing HER as the value-adding cathode reaction with MOR as an additional value-adding anode reaction for future applications.

Although the use of fossil fuels is gradually decreasing every year, it still accounts for more than 80% of global energy consumption, and discriminatory use is causing a significant increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and global warming. In order to control the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels that cause environmental problems, establishing an eco-friendly energy conversion system is essential. The water electrolysis using surplus power generated from renewable energy is recognized as a representative system that can produce high-purity hydrogen from water. On the other hand, CO 2 electrolysis is also a promising energy conversion technology that can reduce atmospheric CO 2 centration because it electrochemically converts CO 2 into valuable carbon products. Both of the above systems are based on electrochemical reactions, which means they can operate under moderate conditions with zero pollutant emissions. In general, the composition of conventional energy conversion system includes an electrolyte layer, which has a large ohmic resistance and limitation of CO 2 solubility, which reduces energy efficiency. To address the disadvantage of the conventional system, membrane electrode assembly (MEA)-based electrolyzer are receiving attention. The MEA consists of an electrode and a membrane with a polymer membrane capable of ion exchange between the anode and the cathode. These MEA-based electrolyzer has a zero-gap configuration, providing minimized ohmic resistance and improved energy efficiency. Among them, various studies are being actively conducted on applying an anion exchange membrane (AEM) to MEA-based electrolyzers. When using AEM, water electrolysis has the advantage of being able to use a non-noble metal catalyst, which can reduce costs, and CO 2 electrolysis has the advantage of reducing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is a competing reaction. Herein, the electrode with a structure in which electrocatalyst is loaded on a porous transport layer (PTL) is fabricated by the facile electrodeposition method. The electrodeposition is possible to fabricate self-supported electrodes by modulating catalytic properties such as morphology, composition, and crystallinity by controlling various parameters. Additionally, ionomer and binder-free electrode structure prepared through electrodeposition contributes to improving catalytic performance by promoting electron transfer to the active site. Moreover, the as-prepared porous transfer electrodes (PTE) are used as cathode and anode in anion exchange MEA-based electrolyzer and exhibit reasonable single-cell performance, suggesting that PTEs prepared via electrodeposition are suitable for energy conversion systems such as water electrolysis and CO 2 electrolysis. In the MEA configuration, three cathodes, anodes, and AEM were optimized. In the cathode part, the HER was optimized using catalysts such as NiMo, Pt, and PtRu, and the CO 2 electrolysis was optimized using Au, Ag, Cu, and Pd. In the anode part, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was optimized using catalysts such as NiFe, IrO 2 . In the membrane part, optimization was performed by comparing the commercial membrane and the fabricated fluorine-containing poly(fluorene)-based AEM.

Hydrogen holds significance as a versatile energy carrier that can be used in various sectors. Recently, hydroxide exchange membrane electrolyzers (HEMELs) towards clean hydrogen production have gained intensive attention, due to the possibility to use low-cost platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts and cheaper membranes, ionomers. 1 Although a variety of PGM-free catalysts have shown promising activities towards the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), few of them delivered sufficient stability in the pure-water-fed HEMELs. 2 In this work, metallic aerogel, featured with high porosity and amorphous metal oxide shells, was deployed as platform to study the structural-performance relationship in HEMELs. A poly(aryl piperidinium) membrane and ionomer with high hydroxide conductivity were integrated to study the evolution in the composition and structure of PGM-free anode catalysts. 3 Owing to unique properties of the 3D metallic aerogel, the optimal aerogel anode outperformed the Ir-based anode in the KOH-fed HEMELs. A transition in the HEMEL performance with different anode catalyst was observed when shifting from alkaline electrolyte to pure water, implying a steering in the rate limiting steps in the different anode feedings. The limiting factor of pure-water-fed HEMEL was probed by deconvoluting the contributions from ohmic resistance, electrode kinetic, and mass transport. The optimal metallic aerogel anode showed no performance loss during the 580-hour stability test at an industrial electrolyzer-relevant current density of 1 A cm −2 in pure water feeding. The HEMEL performance was monitored, revealing the degradations of critical components in the membrane-electrode-assembly. The structural performance relationship in HEMEL was probed by linking the physical properties of the catalysts with HEMEL performance. The gained insight will shed light on the development of highly efficient PGM-free anode catalysts for viable pure-fed HEMELs. References R. Abbasi, B. P. Setzler, S. Lin, J. Wang, Y. Zhao, H. Xu, B.

Introduction Bifunctional air electrodes using aqueous alkaline solutions have attracted increasing attention as positive electrodes for metal-air secondary batteries and alkaline regenerative fuel cells, which have the advantages of high capacity and high safety. However, the large overpotential for the reaction in bifunctional air electrodes impedes their practical application. In order to reduce the overpotential, it is necessary to design electrodes based on an understanding of the reaction field in the electrodes since the favorable reaction fields for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are different [1]. Our research group has developed an operando measurement system using confocal optical microscope to visualize the local conditions of electrodes during the battery operation [2, 3] and has succeeded in visualizing the local state of charge in a LiFePO 4 composite electrode from the brightness [2]. Though operando measurement system using a confocal microscope have the advantage of high versatility, high accessibility and sufficient time or spatial resolution, its application to bifunctional air electrode has not been reported. One of the challenges in visualizing the local conditions in bifunctional air electrodes is the absence of clear color changes corresponding to the local conditions. In this study, we searched for indicators to optically visualize local conditions in bifunctional air electrodes. The optical properties of the candidate indicators were evaluated by using a confocal microscope. Experimental Ag and Ni were selected as candidate indicators for visualizing local potential since they undergo redox reactions at around the potential for OER in alkaline electrolytes. A three-electrode cell for operando optical observation was constructed using metal foils of the candidate materials as the working electrode, Ni mesh as the counter electrode, Hg/HgO as the reference electrode, and 8 mol dm –3 KOH solution as electrolyte. Constant potential measurements were conducted at around the potential range of OER. At the same time, the optical changes of the working electrode were observed with a confocal microscope (ECCS, Lasertec) to evaluate their optical properties as potential indicators. Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the applied potentials and the normalized red and blue signal outputs of the Ag and Ni foil electrodes. The potentials are written in terms of RHE. As for the Ag foil, the red signal output decreased significantly with a potential step from 1.18 V to 1.23 V during oxidation, and the red signal output increased significantly with a potential step from 1.18 V to 1.13 V during reduction. This significant output change corresponds to the redox reaction of Ag/Ag 2 O. Regarding the Ni foil, the blue signal output decreased with a potential step from 1.38 V to 1.43 V during oxidation, and the blue signal output increased in multiple steps from 1.43 V to 1.23 V during reduction.

The quest for sustainable hydrogen production through solar energy conversion has directed attention towards photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell water splitting, a promising avenue for hydrogen (H₂) generation. Traditional metal-oxide-based photoelectrodes such as TiO2 and WO3, despite their extensive study, fail to absorb visible light effectively and exhibit poor charge transport properties. In contrast, lead halide perovskites (LHPs) emerge as a superior alternative, endowed with exceptional optoelectronic properties that enhance the solar spectrum photoresponse, critical for the efficient utilization of solar energy in hydrogen production. This study focused on optimizing the photoanode materials by improving the intrinsic properties of LHPs through bandgap tuning and enhanced charge transfer to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, the operational stability of LHPs in PEC applications poses a formidable challenge, primarily due to vulnerability to moisture-induced degradation. Addressing the stability concerns, some researches about application of ultrathin Ni surface layers and the use of low-melting-point field metals for protective encapsulation are reported. However, these methods have shown limited success in preventing moisture-induced degradation. In response, this work proposes the innovative use of conductive carbon poweder (CCP) as a superior alternative for enhancing electrical connectivity and stability between LHP solar cells and the OER catalyst. Our findings reveal that CCP's superior conductivity facilitates efficient charge transfer from LHP-based solar cells to OER catalysts, maintaining negligible current and voltage loss. To optimize the LHP photoanode's performance, we focused on enhancing the individual efficiencies and stabilities of the PSC and OER catalyst components. For the PSC, we improved stability by integrating a smaller cation (methylammonium, MA) into the FAPbI3 (formamidinium, FA) lattice, thereby stabilizing the α-phase and enhancing hydrogen bonding. This modification was substantiated through various spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, the OER catalyst's efficiency was amplified by employing a 3D-structured NiFe on an Ni foil substrate, improving catalytic activity and stability through enhanced hole mobility and increased electrochemically active surface area. The integrated LHP photoanode demonstrated a notable onset potential of 0.56 V and a peak photocurrent density of 24.26 mA/cm² at 1.23 V vs RHE, achieving a 9.16% applied bias photon-to-current efficiency and sustained performance over 48 hours in a pH 14 aqueous solution under simulated solar illumination. This performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the optimized PSC and OER catalyst, facilitated by CCP's efficient electrical connectivity.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is an electrolysis technology that combines the advantages of alkaline liquid electrolysis (ALE) and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Specifically, AEMWE may eliminate or reduce the usage of expensive platinum metal group (PGM) catalysts, like its ALE counterpart, while also able to operate at high current density, non-balanced hydrogen pressure, and under dynamic loads, like PEMWE. However, AEMWE has not gained viability in commercial applications due to multiple challenges. From the materials perspective, both electrodes and membrane need further development. Although the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for the anode have been studied at a rotating disk electrode (RDE) level for decades, seeing massive improvement in activities, their applications in the real working AEMWE still needs improvement. One challenge that has not been sufficiently addressed is poor adhesion between the substrate and the catalyst coating, which may fall off due to the force of bubbles formed on the surface of electrodes. While many different catalyst coating methodologies have been tried, the pore size and microstructure of the substrates plays an essential role for the quality of the coating and thus the electrode's stability. In addition, the membrane also has some unsolved problems like poor mechanical strength and chemical stability that compromises the longevity of the electrolyzer. It was also found that the interface between the membrane and electrode is crucial to the long durability of the AEMWE. One solution to this is the development of thermally processable AEMs, which can not only elevate the electrolyzer operating temperatures, but also form a better electrode/membrane interface. From the system point of view, the stack build needs to consider frames, sealing, pressure vessel, manifold, and shunt current, particularly when the AEMWE operates with the addition of electrolyte (e.g., KOH). Increasing the efficiency of the stack requires minimizing the shunt current, which is affected by the concentration of KOH, the manifold design, and the number of cells in a stack. Lowering electrolyte concentration is instrumental for reducing the shunt current but can be detrimental for the electrolyzer performance. Engineering solutions, such as using an extremal manifold design can tremendously reduce the shunt current, allowing for higher concentration of electrolyte and better performance. Finally, the successful non-balanced pressure operation (up to 50 bar) is not only determined by the membrane strength, but also the morphology of the supporting substrates like porous transport layers and the quality of assembly. These concepts will be validated in our 50 kW AEMWE stack and inform our 1 MW AEMWE design.

The transition from fossil fuel-based and CO 2 -intensive energy production to a future sustainable energy-based economy requires solutions for efficient energy conversion and storage for later re-electrification of green energy from a renewable source such as solar or wind power. One possibility is to convert energy from sustainable sources into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen by electrolysis of water. To meet this challenge, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis is a powerful, state-of-the-art technology that uses scarce iridium-based catalysts to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To improve the sustainability and economics of the PEM process, it is necessary to minimize the use of rare and precious iridium to reduce the overall density of iridium-based catalysts for the OER. Here, we present different strategies for the synthesis of low-total iridium OER catalysts. In addition to the choice of support material and support morphology, we also consider the coating strategy to produce highly active and durable catalysts. The coating of corrosion-resistant high surface area metal oxide supports of various morphologies with an ultrathin layer of amorphous iridium hydroxide by a simple wet chemical synthesis at low temperature and ambient pressure or by a hydrothermal approach leads to the formation of interconnected amorphous hydrous iridium oxide particles. In a subsequent step, the amorphous phase is oxidized at elevated temperatures using an Adams fusion salt melt. This process allows a controllable phase transformation and crystallization to form a layer of interconnected partially crystalline IrOx nanoparticles of ≈1.5-2 nm domain size on the surface of the supporting metal oxides, thus providing an electrical percolation path in the catalyst layer. The appropriate choice of support material in terms of crystal lattice parameters can moderate the crystal growth of the iridium oxide in terms of epitaxy and significantly increase the stability due to tight anchoring to the support. The final core-shell nanostructures comprise highly active iridium oxide with total Ir weight fractions as low as 7at% on SnO 2 nanoparticles, compared to a state-of-the-art benchmark catalyst with 56at% Ir supported on TiO 2 nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was used to elucidate the effect of different core-shell designs, particularly on iridium coating and crystallinity. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements were performed to evaluate the electrochemical properties and assess the activity of respective catalyst as well as the cycling stability. Further, membrane electrode (MEA) polarization curves suggest enhanced stability of epitaxial catalyst layers.

The development of stable air electrodes for Solid Oxide Cells operating at reduced temperatures (≤700°C) creates unique material design challenges. These electrodes must not only show excellent oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction rates, but also be able to maintain these fast rates over the 40,000hr lifetimes envisioned for solid oxide cells. One material of significant interest for this is Sr(Ti 0.3 Fe 0.7 )O 3-δ (STF), which is a mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite that has shown performance similar to that of La x Sr 1-x Co y Fe 1-y O 3-δ (LSCF) (1). Performance and stability substantially better than that of LSCF can be achieved by substitution of as little as 7% Cobalt onto the B-site of STF. (2) Reducing or eliminating the Cobalt while maintaining performance is desirable to avoid issues with its toxicity, availability, and cost. In this work, we explore Cobalt-free STF-based air electrodes; strategies explored include composites of STF and Gd 0.1 Ce 0.9 O 2-δ (GDC), PrO X infiltration, and alternative B-site substitutions of STF with Ni and Cu. One of the aims of GDC-STF composite electrodes is to improve the thermal expansion coefficient (TCE) match and adhesion with the GDC reaction barrier layer, presumably making them more robust in thermal cycling. The 50% STF – 50 % GDC composites yielded polarization resistance values similar to those of pure STF electrodes, ~ 0.2 Wcm 2 at 700C in air. Over the temperature range of 200°C-850°C, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of STF-GDC closely matches the CTE of GDC (~12×10 -6 K -1 ), representing a significant improvement compared to STF. As previously discussed by Lu et al (3), the performance of pure STF electrodes can be significantly improved by infiltration with PrO x . Here we show that infiltration of STF-GDC composites with 1, 2, or 3 PrO x infiltration steps significantly decreases initial polarization resistance, e.g., from 0.5 to < 0.2 Wcm 2 at 650C, with two infiltration steps yield the lowest polarization resistance. Furthermore, long term stability tests over >2 kh show that STF-GDC electrode degradation rates can be decreased by a factor of 4 through infiltration. Additional results for STF substituted with alternatives to Co, including Cu, Ni, and Cu-Ni, will be presented, along with the effects of exsolution induced by pre-reduction. S.-L. Zhang, D. Cox, H.

The energy production sector has faced many challenges, especially regarding the environmental impacts caused by the use of fossil fuels. Renewable hydrogen, generated via electrolysis of water, has emerged as a possible solution to reducing global reliance on fossil fuels as a source of energy. Unfortunately, the electrocatalysts used currently for water splitting are expensive and limited, therefore, development of commercially viable, new cost-effective electrocatalysts is required. Many emerging catalysts are made using hydrothermal synthesis, demonstrating good water-splitting performance. However, the methods used to make such materials can be time and energy consuming, while generating a significant quantity of chemical waste (solvent and nanoparticles), which remain in the environment for long periods. This study focuses on the development of an environmentally benign solvent-free, room temperature synthesis design taking advantage of abundant, low-cost materials. In the first phase of this study, a novel one-pot room temperature reaction was identified for the facile modification of Ni-containing substrates. This involved a simple hydrolysis method realizing NiMoO4/NiS/Ni(OH)2 complexes formed on the surface of Nickel Foam. This newly developed catalyst demonstrated impressive OER activity under alkaline conditions, showing great potential as an alternative catalyst for water splitting. The electrochemically active surface area of the modified Nickel Foam was also investigated resulting in an impressive fold increase in surface area. Nickel Foam in its own right is an effective catalyst for water splitting, making it challenging to discriminate the effectiveness of immobilised electrocatalysts. It is also a porous substrate which makes it challenging to accurately estimate its performance, and formation of oxides can result in false results and corrosion over time with nickel dissolution being of environmental concern. In order to address these issues, the second phase of the work employed carbon cloth as a substrate due to its attractive features of low cost, availability, porosity and lack of catalytic performance in the absence of modification. A number of metals including copper, were electrodeposited on the carbon cloth and further modified by this novel one-pot room-temperature hydrolysis reaction, resulting in copper molybdate coated carbon cloth which presented a significant improvement relative to the bare substrate. Performance data realized good current density, impressive onset potentials, good Tafel slopes, low impedance, and good stability. The substrate’s performance regarding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were evaluated in alkaline electrolytes with the view to develop a novel bifunctional material prepared using a novel, efficient electroless deposition method. A comparison was made with respect to commercially available electrocatalysts, and hydrothermally prepared materials used currently for OER and HER with encouraging bifunctional data realized. The new room temperature electroless deposition method represents a solvent free, low temperature, facile approach which provides excellent coverage on the Ni Foam/carbon cloth surface. The method has resulted in a suite of viable candidates that can act as bifunctional materials for water splitting based on a green synthesis approach.

To anticipate high performance in the electrocatalytic reactions, a comprehensive understanding of the electric double layer (EDL) is essential. Experimental, spectroscopic, and computational studies of the EDL have been reported for understanding the performance in electrocatalytic reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Notably, in the CO 2 RR, previous studies have revealed the accumulation of cations near the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) significantly has an impact on the reaction performance, product selectivity, and partial current density. The presence of these cations induces various effects, such as creating a strong electric field, altering local pH levels, stabilizing the intermediates, and specific adsorption. However, unraveling the sole cation effect remains challenging due to the system's complexity and hierarchical characteristics. Moreover, experiments predominantly conducted under favorable conditions for understanding the electric field and stabilization effects have left the specific adsorption effect relatively unexplored. Specific adsorption involves direct coordination with the electrode at the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), with the degree determined by catalyst type and electrolyte conditions. Previous studies have highlighted the significant impact of specific adsorption on current density and intermediate stabilization, with potassium (K + ) and cesium (Cs + ) cation exhibiting the most pronounced effect owing to their minimal hydration degree compared to the lithium (Li + ) and sodium (Na + ). Acidic CO 2 RR has recently garnered attention for its high carbon efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE). However, the abundance of hydronium ions can lead to a favorable occurrence of HER over CO 2 RR due to its facile protonation. To mitigate this challenge, excess cations have been employed to suppress the hydronium ion migration and enhance the performance of the CO 2 RR, which means accumulated cation layer at the OHP can suppress the HER and stabilize the intermediates of the CO 2 RR simultaneously. Meanwhile, in the excess cation condition, adsorbed cations can be dominant on the electrode originated from the excess cations, which is not investigated intensively. For the better performance of the electrocatalytic reactions in the acidic condition, we need to elucidate the EDL formed in the presence of the excess cations. In here, we investigated the electrode-electrolyte interface in the different cation species during the acidic CO 2 RR through the attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), which can give the local information such as the adsorbed species on the metal and free species near the electrode. We confirmed the different product distribution and interface depending on the cation species, especially in the excess cations (1 M M + , M = Li, K, Cs). Specific adsorption in the presence of the excess cations can alter the product distribution, and it differs from the low cation concentration (0.1 M M + , M = Li, K, Cs). In final, to clarify the effect originated from the excess cations, we confirmed the interface on the copper and silver, which major products are C 2+ and C 1 , respectively.

As the world strives to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and transition towards cleaner energy sources, Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) emerges as a promising solution for generating clean hydrogen with its ability to utilize renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is essential to select the appropriate materials for PEMWE for enhancing its efficiency, lifetime, and cost-effectiveness. A common PEMWE cell consists of a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA), which includes a proton exchange membrane coated with platinum (Pt) as the catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and iridium (Ir) as the catalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), along with a carbon-based material and a Porous Transport Layer (PTL) as gas diffusion layers on the cathode and anode sides, respectively. A primary challenge within this cell structure lies in minimizing the usage of the rare and precious metal, Ir. As outlined by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the target Ir content in electrodes should be reduced to less than 0.5 mg/cm 2 by 2026 [1]. Smoltek Hydrogen is committed to reducing Ir catalyst loading on the anode side by developing a unique Porous Transport Electrode (PTE) with its patented nanofiber structure [2]. By growing these nanofibers vertically on the PTLs, surface area is significantly enhanced. Through the electrodeposition method, Ir catalyst can form a thin layer along the nanostructure. This not only maximizes Ir catalyst utilization, achieving loading levels as low as 0.1 mg/cm 2 but also reduces contact resistance between the catalyst layer and PTL substrates. The performance of PEMWE depends significantly on the materials utilized in each layer and the quality of their interfaces. A key strategy to enhance cell conductivity and minimize energy loss is to reduce cell thickness while improving interfacial contact [3]. In our investigation, we explored various parameters to boost the performance of PEMWE utilizing our specialized PTE. The results demonstrate that incorporating Nafion ionomer between the OER catalyst layer and the membrane, along with assembling the PTE with the membrane using the hot-pressing method, greatly improves interfacial contact and enhances the initial performance of PEMWE. Additionally, reducing the thickness of the PTL and membrane can further optimize cell conductivity. Moreover, factors such as cell pressure, parameters of the cell pre-conditioning step, as well as testing conditions such as temperature and water flow rates in the electrolyzer test systems, significantly influence performance. This study is focused on identifying the optimal cell conditions for Smoltek Hydrogen's PTEs.

Hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier with high energy density and without harmless burning products, leading to magnificent efforts to build the hydrogen production system. Accordingly, water electrolysis is one of the promising strategies to generate hydrogen without carbon emission, requiring highly active catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its sluggish reaction kinetics than hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To reduce overpotential and increase economic feasibility, Ni and Fe based catalysts have extensively studied due to their high OER activity as well as excellent stability in alkaline media. Many studies have controlled the morphological characteristics and electronic structures of Ni-Fe based OER catalysts to enhancing electrocatalytic performances. Particularly, interface formation is considered as one of the most significant aspects to design and obtain the desirable anode material. In this study, we synthesized colloidal Ni-Fe intermediate nanoparticles (NFI NPs) with various molar ratios between Ni and Fe. Unique physical mixture phase of NFI NPs was identified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM EDS), displaying that their morphological characteristics as well as crystalline phases depending on the composition of Ni and Fe. Through washing processes, the Fe 2 O 3 NPs were mainly aggregated around the metallic Ni NPs, meaning a formation of multiple contacts between Ni metal and Fe 2 O 3 NPs. Subsequent annealing step turned the simple contacts to Ni-Fe 2 O 3 heterointerfaces. Electrochemical performances were examined, revealing significantly lower OER overpotential (199 mV) at 10 mA cm -2 (75:25 sample) than that of the previous Ni-Fe catalysts. Among the products of various Ni and Fe ratio (from 100:0 to 0:100, molar ratio of metal precursors), the 75:25 sample presented the highest OER activity than the other samples. In addition, the 75:25 sample exhibited long-term durability under alkaline OER operation for 5 days, confirmed through chronopotentiometry analysis at 10 mA cm -2 . We speculated that this outstanding OER performance of 75:25 sample was due to the electronic structure modulation through Ni-Fe 2 O 3 heterointerfaces. The sample was further investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm the chemical states of catalyst surface. XPS results confirmed that oxyhydroxides were well formed on the metallic Ni sites than NiO, meaning that the Ni-Fe 2 O 3 was more efficient catalyst than the NiO-Fe 2 O 3 . This work revealed that colloidally synthesized 75:25 sample having Ni-Fe 2 O 3 heterointerfaces showed the highest OER performance among the samples we prepared. Furthermore, these results provide the insights to design the OER catalyst possessing heterointerfaces without precious metals.

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) promise improved safety and energy density by using solid electrolytes (SEs) and high-voltage cathodes. However, the SEs are unstable at high voltages, leading to oxidative chemical decomposition at the SE/CAM (cathode active material) interface, resulting in the formation of an insulating cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI) on CAM particles [1]. The layered oxide cathodes (LiNi x Mn y Co z O 2 ; NMC), when cycled at elevated voltages (>4.3V), undergo irreversible structural and chemical deformations, including the formation of kinetically less active phases (spinel and rock-salt), oxygen evolution, and mechanical degradation (intergranular or intraparticle cracking) [2]. The instability of the SE, CAM particles, and SE/CAM interface, collectively, results in inferior electrochemical performance, including low initial Coulombic efficiency (CE), increased cell polarization and impedance, reduced rate capability, and capacity fade during extended cycling. Therefore, it is crucial to stabilize the SE/CAM interface and preserve the CAM structure in SSB cathodes, particularly during high-voltage cycling. This is primarily achieved by developing a protective coating on CAM particles. Niobium (Nb)-based coatings are promising to protect the SE/CAM interface, mostly developed by wet chemical and solid-state processing routes that involve high-temperature annealing. On the other hand, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a powerful technique for coatings, providing precise thickness and composition control [3]. Unfortunately, these coatings may have ‘hot spots’ for local current focusing (crystalline defects, i.e., grain boundaries) and oxygen release (pinholes at particle-particle contacts) [4]. In the present study, we developed an Nb-based thin conformal amorphous coating on single crystal NMC CAM particles using ALD equipped with a rotary bed attachment. Unlike traditional stationary ALD reactors, ALD with a rotary bed attachment ensures a pinhole-free continuous coating on CAM powders. The low-temperature ALD process results in an amorphous coating (chemically and structurally isotropic), which is expected to effectively withstand the volumetric changes occurring in CAM particles during repetitive charge/discharge cycling. Comparing the performance of uncoated and coated samples tested at high voltages (≥4.5V) shows that the coated cathodes display significant improvements, including high initial Coulombic efficiency (91% vs. 83%), enhanced rate capability (10x higher accessible capacity at a 2C rate), and improved capacity retention during extended cycling (99.4% after 500 cycles). These enhancements are attributed to reduced cell polarization and interfacial impedance in coated samples. Post-mortem electron microscopy and XRD analysis confirm that the coating remains intact, inhibiting oxygen release from the CAM structure and the formation of inactive phases (spinel and rock-salt), thereby preventing CAM particle cracking. These findings pave the way for stable and high-performance SSBs with high-voltage cathodes.

Metallic glasses (MGs) are a class of amorphous metal materials with remarkable properties. By leveraging an abundance of uncoordinated active sites that can serve as catalytic regions, MGs can have high catalytic activity and long-term stability as compared to their crystalline counterparts. Conventional synthesis methods cannot produce nanosized MGs with precise control over composition, phase, and morphology. This work presents flash Joule heating (FJH) as a novel one-step approach to synthesize fully amorphous MG nanoparticles while enabling unprecedented control over these critical parameters. The rapid heating (up to 2505 K/s) and ultrafast cooling rates (up to 1485 K/s) in FJH surpass the critical rates required for glass formation in metal-phosphide alloys like Pd-P, Pd-Ni-P, and Pd-Cu-P, preventing crystallization. Characterization techniques such as SAED, XRD, and XPS have confirmed the amorphous nature and metallic states of the nanoparticles. Remarkably, FJH allowed precise tuning of ternary alloy compositions spanning wide ranges from Pd-rich to Ni/Cu-rich regimes, closely matching designed precursor ratios. The technique significantly expanded the glass formation region compared to conventional methods, accessing previously unattainable compositions like binary Pd 3 P. Moreover, FJH enabled control over particle size from 2.33±0.83 nm to 36.5±10.1 nm with narrow distributions by optimizing precursors, thermal profiles, and alloy chemistries. Incorporation of multiple elements facilitated smaller nanoparticle formation due to enhanced entropy, reduced melting points, and decreased surface tension. The amorphous MG nanoparticles exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance and remarkable stability superiorities over their crystalline counterparts. For the oxygen evolution reaction, Pd-Ni-P MGs displayed ultra-low onset potentials ~300 mV below pure Pd and retained stable activity over 60 hours, contrasting rapid deactivation of crystalline samples of the same composition within 1 hour. PdCoP MGs for methanol oxidation showed high reaction rates and resilience against activity decline during accelerated durability testing, unlike rapidly decaying crystalline variants. This FJH synthesis approach unlocks new opportunities to realize the full potential of MGs by expanding the compositional space of alloy systems with precise control over MG properties, unlocking potential future transformative catalysts.

A reversible fuel cell (r-FC) is a cell that can be operated both in fuel cell (FC) and water electrolysis (WE) mode. Having both modes in a single cell offers several advantages: lower cost of the system, higher operating ratio, and smaller footprint. 1 There are two types of r-FC system. The first one is where the electrodes do not change their redox function in both modes of operation. The second one is where gases are fixed, in which one electrode is dedicated to dealing with hydrogen (H 2 -electrode), while the other electrode deals with oxygen (O 2 -electrode). 2 The latter configuration is preferred due to its simpler balance of plant design, faster mode switches, and enhanced safety by keeping hydrogen and oxygen in separate compartments. In this configuration, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) take place on the H 2 -electrode, and on the O 2 -electrode, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) take place. In this work, we start from a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and modify MEA components one by one to establish a basic MEA design for r-FC in acidic environment. The H 2 -electrode design for both PEMFC and PEM water electrolysis is the same. Therefore, it is fixed, and the Pt/C catalyst, which is a state-of-art catalyst for both HOR and HER, is used on the H 2 -electrode. On the other hand, the O 2 -electrode must fulfill both ORR and OER functionalities. Therefore, a bifunctional catalyst must be used; hence, Pt and Ir both must be present. The operation potential window for the O 2 -electrode increases to roughly 0.5V-2V vs. RHE. Therefore, Pt/C and carbon based gas diffusion layer (GDL) materials can not be used as carbon corrosion takes place at high potentials (>1.4V vs. RHE). 3 Consequently, WE based O 2 -electrode comprising of only metal based catalyst and a titanium porous transport layer (PTL) must be implemented on the O 2 -electrode. First, the Pt/C catalyst on the O 2 -electrode is replaced with a Pt black catalyst, taking a step back to the historic start of PEMFC electrode design. 4 The performance of the cell drops due to a much lower electrochemically active surface area of Pt black compared to Pt/C, which can be quantified by hydrogen under potential deposition. In the next step, the carbon-based GDL is exchanged with a titanium PTL on the O 2 - electrode. In this case, the performance drops drastically due to the utilization of the catalyst-coated substrate (CCS) method for preparing the electrode. As the sprayed catalyst penetrates deeper into the big porous structure of the Ti PTL, a significant amount of catalyst is not connected to the ionic network and therefore inactive. Hence, the catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) method is used for the next steps. Furthermore, a physical mixture of Pt black and IrO 2 is compared with a physical mixture of Pt black and Ir black for implementation on the O 2 -electrode. Accelerated stress tests 5 (1000 cycles) in single cell fuel cells are performed, and begin of test (BoT) and end of test (EoT) performances are compared. Pt black and Ir black mixture implemented O 2 -electrode show a lower Tafel slope (69 mV/dec) than Pt black and IrO 2 implemented O 2 -electrode (86 mV/dec) at BOT. At EoT, the Tafel slopes increase (20-30%) in both cases, indicating the degradation of the CL probably caused by the low voltage operation of the OER catalyst. Several crucial components, including efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts, O 2 -side GDLs, and bipolar plates suitable for both modes, need to be developed for r-FCs to compete with their single mode equivalents effectively.

Fundamental understanding of electrochemical interfaces is a prerequisite for designing well performing and economically viable electrocatalyst materials. The rapid increase in supercomputing power accompanied by methodical improvements in atomistic simulations enables an accelerated computer-aided materials design process. Our research in this context integrates theory and advanced simulation methods to decipher the relations between structure, properties and performance of electrochemical interfaces [1-4]. The presentation emphasizes the necessity of combining novel computational schemes [1,2,5,6] with knowledge from solid state chemistry and computational mineralogy in order to be able to rationalize the tremendous enhancement in the activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions that is achieved upon Fe-doping of NiOOH [4,7]. Significant research has been dedicated to understanding the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of this material with different, often contradicting mechanisms proposed [7-11]. On the computational side, we identified the severe overestimation of the occupancy of d-orbitals by the widely used DFT+U computational approach as the origin of the problem and corrected it by employing localized Wannier functions as projectors for calculating the occupations of d-orbitals [4,2]. This approach allowed us to correctly compute the band gap of NiOOH and to reveal a realistic electronic structure of Fe-doped NiOOH. It occurred that Fe exists in the low-spin state for Fe contents below the solubility limit in Fe:NiOOH solid solution. The low-spin state of Fe dopant is responsible for lowering the OER overpotential relative to the value for pure NiOOH by ~300 mV, which agrees with the measured decrease [7] . The discovered state allows for the consistent explanation of measured data on ionic and electronic structure as well as magnetic and electrochemical properties. We will show that the miscibility of Fe in NiOOH is related to the sizes of Ni 3+ and Fe 3+ cations and that it is the closely matching cation radii of Ni and Fe in the low spin state that enable the formation of a mixed phase. Our results reconcile catalyst composition and structure with the mixing behavior in solid solution and the electrocatalytic activity. [1] Tesch, Kowalski & Eikerling, J. Phys.: Condens.

In Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) systems, a notable phenomenon occurs following voltage transitions from low to high, such as after a shutdown and subsequent startup: the cell performance initially improves, higher currents are achieved, then gradually returns to baseline (s. Figure 1). This reversible performance behavior remains poorly understood despite documentation in the literature, see e.g., ref. [1, 2], and laboratory observations. However, distinguishing between reversible and irreversible performance losses is essential for accurate degradation assessments, emphasizing the need for detailed exploration of the underlying mechanisms. The activity and stability of iridium-based electrocatalysts, crucial for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within PEMWE systems, depend on their iridium oxidation state, which varies with the applied voltage. While studies typically explore these oxidation state changes in aqueous model systems such as rotating disk electrodes (RDE) and scanning flow cells (SFC), the focus is often more on stability than on activity changes [2]. However, the current understanding of the catalysts' dynamic performance in PEMWE full-cell configurations remains incomplete. In this study, a systematic experimental investigation of the reversible performance behavior of PEMWE cells was conducted. Tests were performed with single PEM water electrolysis cells with an active area of 4 cm², using a Nafion™ 115 catalyst-coated membrane. The anode and cathode loadings were 2.0 mgIr/cm² and 1.0 mgPt/cm², respectively. The voltage-driven experiments aimed to identify the voltage level that triggers performance recovery, evaluate the significance of this improvement depending on the low-voltage level, and assess how the duration of low-voltage phases affects recovery. The results demonstrated that a recovery effect occurred once the low-voltage level dropped below 1.5 V, with further enhancements in recovery observed as the voltage continued to decrease. This effect was evident even with a brief holding time of 0.1 s at the lower voltage level. The reversible recovery is primarily driven by increased kinetics, likely influenced by voltage-dependent changes in iridium oxidation states. These observations are strongly supported by a robust alignment between the experimental data and a novel dynamic 0D model, which links iridium oxidation/reduction processes to performance metrics. By investigating the dynamic behavior of iridium-based electrocatalysts in full-cell configurations, this research enriches the understanding of reversible performance phenomena in PEMWE cells. It provides an essential foundation for future studies to understand the mechanisms behind these reversible phenomena.

Bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 , BVO) with a monoclinic crystal structure has attracted significant interest in photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photocatalytic (PC) oxidation that are utmost critical processes to producing clean hydrogen fuels from solar energy. BVO has a suitable bandgap (2.4 eV), which enables it to absorb sunlight up to a wavelength of 520 nm. Furthermore, it possesses a suitable location of the valence band edge for water oxidation, decent photoelectrochemical/photochemical activity, and moderate stability in neutral electrolytes. Nevertheless, PEC performance is hindered by diverse inherent drawbacks, including inadequate conductivity and mobility, limited light absorption, and significant charge recombination at the bulk and surface 1,2 . This study demonstrates a novel one-pot solution method to synthesize high-performance BVO photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting. We designed a stepwise dual reaction (SDR) to optimize the bulk and surface characteristics via texturing and surface reconstruction. The key innovation lies in controlling precursor concentration, ethylene glycol (EG), and manipulating growth kinetics and surface reconstruction. EG plays a crucial role in achieving this texture and surface reconstruction. Compared to conventional BVO (non-textured and non-surface-reconstructed), the optimally synthesized textured and surface-reconstructed BVO (ts-BVO) exhibits significantly improved charge transport (70% vs. 8%) and surface charge transfer efficiencies (85% vs. 9%). Furthermore, by depositing the CoBi oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, the ts-BVO achieved a steady photocurrent density of 4.3 mA/cm 2 at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an almost unity Faradaic efficiency of 98% under simulated sunlight illumination (1 sun). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of solution chemistry in controlling the texture and surface characteristics of photoanode for efficient photoelectrochemical water-splitting 3,4 .

Electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) offers a sustainable approach for waste ammonia remediation, energy conversion, and valuable product production.[1] Despite the promise of transition metal oxides as effective catalysts, the AOR mechanism on their surface remains elusive, along with factors leading to deactivation, which often involve surface poisoning species formation and site corrosion. Moreover, the AOR potential overlaps with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to the formation of O 2 as a byproduct and an overall decline in energy efficiency. Therefore, it is critical to understand the molecular behavior of ammonia and other species on the oxide surface under reaction conditions. In this work, we systematically investigate the AOR mechanism on NiOOH and CuOOH, emphasizing the influence of OER and dissolved O 2 , which has been previously largely overlooked. Utilizing three in situ techniques: differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) for detecting gaseous intermediates and products, Raman spectroelectrochemistry for monitoring surface transformations, and UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry for observing species within the electrical double layer, we reveal that the formation of NiOOH/CuOOH, the AOR catalytic activity and selectivity, and the deactivation pathway are all significantly modulated by OER and the presence of O 2 . It is established that AOR on NiOOH is potential-dependent, with N 2 production being initiated at potentials coinciding with OER commencement and the generation of NO x species being favored at elevated potentials (Figure 1 left). Moreover, OER competes with the AOR to N 2 pathway but promotes the AOR to NO x (N 2 O, NO, and NO 2 ), which is further elucidated through the protective role of O 2 to remove *N poisoning species, mitigating surface deactivation and decreasing charge transfer resistance (Figure 1 right). On CuOOH, however, the O 2 can promote NO formation and Cu dissolution from the CuOOH layer, leading to complete deactivation at high potential. Our findings offer an in situ insight into the AOR mechanisms on metal oxides with co-existing OER and provide a critical direction for designing electrocatalysts for environmental applications, particularly for systems where long-term electrolysis is desired.

Hydrogen and electricity are expected to be the two major energy carriers of the future. Unfortunately, neither can be stored as an ambient-temperature liquid, which is the ideal energy-carrier medium. Electrochemically-rechargeable liquids (ERLs) are a low-maturity energy-storage paradigm that offer many compelling attributes over gases ( e.g ., H 2 ), solid materials ( e.g ., batteries), or more conventional liquid fuels [1]. ERLs can be comprised of a wide variety of active materials, which may include conventional liquid-organic hydrogen carriers ( i.e ., LOHCs, such as organics that are liquids at room temperature, like methylcyclohexane), as well as aqueous solutions ( e.g ., diluted alcohols) or dissolved solids ( e.g ., redox-flow-battery electrolytes) [2]. An ERL-based system possesses the key attractive benefits of a redox flow battery (RFB), namely: fully decoupled power and energy (lower capital costs with longer durations, especially with a single, low-cost liquid), long cycle life (due to theoretically-invariant electrodes, which do not undergo morphology changes with charge-discharge cycles), and inherently superior safety (compared to conventional batteries). And, unlike a RFB system, an ERL system only requires the storage of a single liquid, which is especially attractive for long-duration energy storage (LDES) applications ( i.e ., > 10-h discharge times at rated power). The obvious disadvantage of any rechargeable-liquid paradigm relative to conventional fuels is the need to store and transport both the “charged” and “discharged” materials, but doing so is significantly easier and less expensive than recovering CO 2 discharged into the atmosphere from conventional liquid hydrocarbons. The “charged” and “discharged” ERLs can be shipped in two parallel pipelines and the total transmission costs can still be far lower than electricity-transmission lines, since liquid-pipeline costs are an order-of-magnitude less than that of high-voltage electric lines [3], and pipelines are easier to get approved than overhead transmission lines. While ERLs are not a new concept, a primary focus of this talk will be on innovative conversion options and relevant developments since my presentation on this topic at the Fall 2021 ECS meeting[1]. The ERL conversion systems include combinations of the cell configurations shown in Fig. 1. In particular, it will be shown that ERLs that can be charged using either electrical and/or hydrogen energy, and which can also produce hydrogen or electricity on demand can enable highly flexible energy-storage systems that can potentially be used for both stationary and transportation applications, since ERL-based systems can have higher energy densities than state-of-the-art Li-ion battery packs. The goal of this short “Ideas, Interchange, and Initiative” (Triple-I) presentation will be to provide the audience with a sufficient overview of these high-level ERL concepts, such that a productive discussion can occur on additional improvements, potential end uses, and future collaborations.

Water electrolysis has emerged as a crucial electrochemical reaction on the generation of sustainable fuels, due to the ongoing climate crisis. To divert from expensive catalysts based on rare noble metals such as Ir and Ru, transition metal oxides seem to be promising candidates and several recent studies have deepened the investigation on the nickel oxide/hydroxide for water oxidation catalysis. It has been proposed that in the presence of elements such as iron and gold, a partial charge-transfer occurs between the nickel and the metal, facilitating the formation of superoxide species and nickel in higher oxidation states that enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). 1–4 Rao et al (2022) 5 developed a methodology combining UV-Vis spectroscopy and voltametric techniques to determine the number of these nickel species in higher oxidation levels during the OER for nickel oxides dopped with Zn, Fe, Co and Mn. From their results, they proposed a mechanism for the OER that involves two steps: 1) initial oxidation from Ni II to Ni III and superoxide formation, which is limited by the potential and 2) coupling and desorption of the superoxide species, which is limited by rate. Next, they demonstrated that the different dopants modulated the bond strength between the nickel and the oxygen: too weak-bonding limited the ability to oxidize nickel and too strong-bonding limited the combination and desorption of the oxygen. In this work, monolayers of nickel hydroxide were electrodeposited, in the presence and the absence of silk fibroin (SF), on top of electrodes containing gold nanoparticles and used surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)and UV-Vis spectroeletrochemical techniques to study the influence of the gold and SF on the catalytic performance of nickel hydroxide. Our previous results 6 showed that the silk protein was able to stabilize the α-Ni(OH) 2 nanoparticles and improved its electrochemical activity. Here, we followed the Rao et al’s methodology and found analogous results for the mechanisms of water oxidation. Figure 1A and B shows the number oxidized species and the calculated turnover frequency (TOF) as function of the potential for the samples with 1, 3, 6 and 9 monolayers, containing or not SF. While the number of oxidized species remains comparable across samples with the same number of monolayers, those containing fibroin generally exhibit higher TOFs. A volcano-like graph (Figure 1C) was obtained when the TOFs at an overpotential of 0.3 V is plotted against the Ni II -Ni III redox potential, indicating a transition from potential-limited to rate-limited regions as monolayer thickness increases. We propose that this behavior is caused by the charge-transfer effect between nickel and gold, which is strongest for one monolayer and decreases as the number of nickel sites on the bulk moves away the gold surface. Notably, as monolayer thickness increases, samples containing SF show less susceptibility to decrease in TOFs, implying an additional charge-transfer effect between the protein and nickel, which contributes for the balance of the nickel bond strength with oxygen and facilitates its coupling and desorption. In summary, our study advances understanding of OER mechanisms and charge-transfer processes involving nickel hydroxide electrocatalysis, suggesting that proteins like SF can actively contribute to catalytic processes. However, further investigations are needed in order to elucidate the precise role of the protein and how to use them to optimize catalytic performance. REFERENCES 1.

Photocatalytic Properties of Transparent ZnO Films Prepared by Anodization of Zinc Plate Transparent zinc oxide films were prepared by anodizing of zinc plate when the electrolyte was kept at low temperature（＜10℃）in low concentration of alkaline solution and under high bias voltage，Obtained transparent film was uniform，and it showed transparency even if it might be thick．Thus obtained transparent film is confirmed to be a pure zinc oxide，and its absorption edge is 380nm，which corresponds to the optical band gap energy of 3.2 eV，Moreover，it had high photocatalytic activity which was superior to the one prepared under no cooling. We have already reported that the photocatalytic properties were closely correlated with their orientation preference of（1010）. In this case，thus obtained transparent film also showed preferred orientation of the（1010）， Effects of Electrolytic Condition to Photocatalytic Activity for Cathodically Deposited ZnO Films. Zinc oxide film was prepared easily by cathodic deposition from zinc nitrate aqueous solutions. Deposited film was evaluated as photocatalytic film under different deposition conditions. The Photocatalytic activity was evaluated by measuring acetaldehyde gas degradation. Film prepared in dilute solutions of Zn (NO 3 ) 2 showed superior photocatalysis activity. Film prepared under high current density showed superior photocatalysis. We monitored mass changes during cathodic deposition and confirmed that ZnO was completely deposited under the above conditions and that additional reactions took place under other preparation conditions. These additional reaction deactivated photocatalytic activity. Photocatalytic Properties of Titanium Oxide Film Prepared by Electrophoretic Sol－Gel Deposition Electrophoretic Sol-Gel Deposition was introduced to immobilize the TiO 2 photocatalysis．Thus prepared coatings showed quite high－photocalytic activities without successive heat treatment．It is suggested that Non-heated coating showed high photocalytic activity because it responds effectively for light，which is attributed to the nano-structure of the deposited coating． Fabrication and Characterization of Diamond Quartz Crystal Microbalance Electrode Boron-doped diamond film on a quartz crystal electrode was prepared by a reflow technique. The mass sensitivity of this diamond-quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor was determined by performing Fe electrodeposition. This novel electrochemical QCM sensor was quite stable under several electrochemical experimental conditions. Its wide potential window and significantly low background current are just the same as the performance of a diamond electrode. We also showed that the fabricated diamond-QCM electrode worked satisfactorily as a useful tool for electrochemical microgravimetry by examining hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxidation of the diamond surface in acidic solutions. It was found that evolved H 2 inserted into the bulk of as-grown diamond with a storage volume of 0.06 mol/dm 3 in 0.5 mol/dm 3 HCl solution, after sweeping the potential from 0 to -2.3 V at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, in contrast to O-terminated diamond-QCM, which inhibited hydrogen intercalation. Oxygen reduction on Au nanoparticle deposited boron-doped diamond films Nanoparticle Au was deposited on as grown boron-doped diamond (BDD). The coverage and the morphology of the deposited Au particles were investigated by means of the linear sweep voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From SEM, the gold electrodeposited randomly as small spherical particles with an average diameter of 60nm. The applications of the as grown BDD film deposited by Au for electrocatalytic reduction of the oxygen in acidic solution were investigated. The catalytic efficiency of the Au deposited as grown BDD with the coverage of 0.06 is near 20 times larger than that of polycrystalline gold. The mechanism of the highly electrocatalytic active was investigated by ac impedance and hydrodynamic voltammetric methods. Photoelectrodeposition of Copper on Boron-Doped Diamond Films: Application of Conductive Pattern Formation on Diamond. The Photographic Diamond Surface Phenomenon The photoelectrodeposition of copper on semiconducting B-doped diamond films was investigated. There were clear morphology differences between photoelectrodeposited and electrodeposited copper. Photoelectrodeposition proceeded by a uniform two-dimensional growth process, whereas electrodeposition involved isolated random deposition. By applying this effect we have succeeded in forming a conductive copper pattern on semiconducting B-doped diamond with the aid of a photo-mask. Interestingly, it was further found that changes occurring on the diamond surface during photoelectrochemical polarization in the absence of copper in solution facilitate subsequent copper electrodeposition in the dark, possibly due to the formation of subsurface hydrogen. We refer to this as the `photographic diamond surface phenomenon'.

Net-zero emission energy technologies are urgently needed to mitigate climate change. Generation of “green” hydrogen via low-temperature water electrolysis using renewable electricity and its utilization in fuel cells for power generation when needed is a highly promising path towards achieving zero emission of greenhouse gases [1]. To guarantee the market affordability of low temperature water electrolyzers, cost and performance targets must be met [1]. The need for expensive catalysts based on platinum group metals (PGMs) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) is currently the main obstacle to their widespread deployment. At the same time, liquid alkaline water electrolyzers (LAWE) exhibit the advantage of operation using catalysts based on earth abundant-based elements [2]. The main drawback of LAWE is the use of strongly alkaline and thus corrosive electrolyte (20-40% KOH), which negatively impacts the catalyst durability. The latter limitation comes on top of low current-density operation and losses in the catalyst performance often occurring as a result of current reversal during shut down [3]. Ni-based catalysts, e.g., binary Ni-Mo based materials, display the most promising activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) among non-PGM materials [4]. However, their durability is still a major concern [5]. In one approach, tailoring the design and altering the electronic structure of the NiMo catalysts is an effective route to achieve a higher durability [6]. In this work, we designed a novel and facile synthesis approach to developing binder-free Ni-Mo- phosphide electrocatalysts (Ni-Mo-P) in two steps. In the first step, Ni and Mo were deposited on a Ni-foam substrate from a solution containing complexes of the two metals. In the second step, the deposit was phosphidated via reactive annealing in a presence of phosphorus precursor. The formation of NiMo-phosphide was confirmed by XRD. The thus-synthetized catalysts were electrochemically characterized in a three-electrode cell set-up, showing a decent HER activity. The durability of the catalyst was then assessed for 100 h in 1 M KOH solution under constant current operation, with no activity loss detected. We will compare performance of our catalysts with that of the commercially available Ni and Ni-Mo HER electrocatalysts. References: [1] A. M. Oliveira, R. R. Beswick, and Y.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important electrochemical processes in a wide variety of fields such as water electrolysis, air batteries, electroplating, electrowinning, and others, while the overpotential is known to be 300 mV or more, which results in the increase in energy consumption and the decrease in energy efficiency. One of the authors of this paper has recently found a low overpotential of oxygen nano-catalyst, that is a bismuth ruthenate-based pyrochlore oxide [1]. This novel oxide catalyst contains ca. 5 at% of sodium, which seems to strongly affect the catalytic activity and stability for OER; e.g ., the catalyst shows a Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec at 25 o C in 0.1 mol/L KOH solution, which is much lower than those of nickel-based oxide and PGMs investigated as OER catalysts for alkaline water electrolysis, although the mechanism of the fast kinetics has not been clarified. In this paper, we report the results of first-principles calculations of the electronic structure of bismuth ruthenate-based pyrochlore oxides (BRO) and discuss the effects of Na doping on the crystal structure of BRO. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) were performed using the WIEN2k package [2] for the electronic structure of bismuth ruthenate pyrochlore Bi 2 Ru 2 O 7 and its Na substituent. We substituted Na for one of the 16 Bi in the unit cell so that the Na content is close to the synthesized Na-doped BRO. Before the electronic structure calculations, structural optimization was performed within DFT with GGA using the VASP package [3-5]. We successfully optimized the structures for Bi 2 Ru 2 O 7 and its Na substituent, and by Na doping, the unit cell exhibits isotropic compression in 0.12% coincident with slight distortion along a [111] direction. While the lattice shrinkage seems inconsistent with a difference in ionic size between trivalent Bi (1.17 Å) and monovalent Na (1.18 Å) [6], the local structure around Na was found to change according to the ionic size; i.e. , the BiO 8 polyhedron expanded with Na doping, and the NaO 8 polyhedron was larger than the BiO 8 polyhedron in Bi 2 Ru 2 O 7 with Na. On the other hand, RuO 6 octahedrons shrunk due to the Na substitution, and the degree of shrinkage was higher for the octahedron closer to Na. This shrinkage of the RuO 6 octahedron may be due to the hole doping effect. The distributions of the size of the RuO6 octahedron and the electronic state of Ru are reflected in the electronic structure as complicated band dispersion. However, the energy dependence of density of states (DOS) was similar to that of Bi 2 Ru 2 O 7 , so the Na substitution may not have affected the electronic physical property. There is still a potential that some of the RuO 6 octahedrons distributed due to the Na substitution induce the enhancement of OER activity by the Na substituent.

Hydrogen is a promising alternative energy carrier to mitigate emissions arising from fossil fuel use. However, current methods of commercial hydrogen production, e.g., steam-methane reforming, are known to contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, there is substantial interest in green hydrogen production through water electrolysis. At the same time, sources of freshwater are limited and thus efforts are increasingly turning to saltwater electrolysis using renewable energy 1 . However, one of the key challenges then encountered is related to the chlorine evolution reaction (CER), which can compete with the desired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, especially as the local pH becomes more acidic, which causes the thermodynamic potentials of the OER and CER to become more similar 1,2 . Cl 2 is the primary product of CER in acidic media, whereas OCl - is the predominant species in neutral and alkaline environments 1,2 . However, the CER is an undesirable reaction during water splitting due to the toxic and corrosive nature of the OCl - and gaseous Cl 2 formed 1,2 . While there are many efforts being made to minimize the CER by the development of highly selective OER electrocatalysts and through the use of membranes to prevent acidic conditions from building up at the anode, it is still important to monitor the amount of OCl - and Cl 2 formed under a variety of conditions of potential, current, anode catalyst material, solution agitation, etc. For this reason, our goal is to continuously monitor OCl - formation at the anode to quantitatively determine the Faradaic efficiency of oxygen production. Present-day methods of OCl - and Cl 2 monitoring each have their own drawbacks. For example, standard analysis techniques, such as gas chromatography (GC), can quantify the amount of Cl 2 produced but special corrosion protection measures must be taken to protect the GC columns and detectors. Further, analytical techniques, e.g., iodometric titration, are cumbersome as they require freshly prepared titrants/solutions 2,3 . In contrast, several electrochemical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry, have been shown to quantitively detect OCl - in alkaline solutions 4–6 but have not been applied to saltwater electrolysis applications to our knowledge. In the present work, we demonstrate the in-situ quantification of the OCl - concentration during saltwater electrolysis by tracking the charge passed during what has been proposed to be OCl - reduction in a peak at ca. 1.5 vs RHE 6–8 . As our goal is to identify anode materials that are both corrosion resistant and intrinsically selective to the OER, this work also focusses on several different families of anode materials. Here, the amount of OCl - formed is determined continuously using a fourth electrode poised at a potential negative of 1.4 V vs RHE as a function of electrolysis time. The accuracy of this electrochemical method has been confirmed by iodometric titration and parallel rotating ring disc electrode analyses. Additional confirmation of the validity of this method has been obtained from the measured oxidation charge passed over various times at constant potential as compared to the amount of oxygen produced at the anode outlet as determined by gas chromatography, with the difference due to OCl - formation. This presentation will include the results of studies of the selectivity of the OER vs the CER at several new anode materials with time and as a function of current, potential, NaCl solution flow rates, and pH.

Innovative approaches are necessary for thrifting iridium (in the form of IrO 2 ) from PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) anodes without compromising catalyst utilization. Adding a microporous layer (MPL) to the anode can realize high performance with low IrO 2 loadings (<0.1 mg cm -2 ) by facilitating the efficient conduction of electrons from catalyst particles to the current collector. As an alternative to fabricating a monolithic, sintered MPL on the porous transport layer (PTL), we demonstrate how a loose-particle microporous layer (MPL) can be fabricated directly on the CCM via decal transfer with a single added step of particle ink deposition on a PTFE decal. Benchmarking tests confirm that when low-loaded IrO 2 catalyst layers (0.05-0.2 mg cm -2 ) are supported with 0.4 mg cm -2 platinum black (PtB) in a bilayer configuration, kinetic and mass transport performance at parity or better than unsupported 1.0 mg cm -2 IrO 2 anodes can be achieved for PEMWE. First, an idealized in-plane catalyst utilization model is developed to estimate the requisite sheet conductivity for the MPL to minimize electronic conduction losses assuming in-plane electronic resistance is dominant. Then, several materials were screened for sufficient conductivity as loose-particle MPLs on a fluorinated ethylene propylene sheet under realistic confinement conditions using the Van der Pauw method using a gasket with conductive edges. Due to non-ideal airbrushing and agglomerates, the actual amount of PtB required to achieve requisite conductivity is roughly four times higher than that expected assuming sheet conductivity is proportional to the areal mass loading. An initial formulation for the MPL particle ink using an ionomer binder was then reformulated to use an insulating polymer binder (PVDF) to avoid a reversible >1 Ω cm 2 contact resistance present under anodic conditions at current densities as low as 0.01 A cm -2 . Since tests used pure water and the contact resistance vanishes under cathodic conditions, it is likely that the loose PtB MPL reversibly oxidizes near the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction due to the ionically conductive binder. Then, MPL-supported CCMs (0.4 mg cm -2 PtB, PVDF binder) were benchmarked against bare CCMs operating as a PEMWE cell at 80C with pure water fed to the anode. A five-electrode method was utilized to extract informative anode electrodynamics such as catalyst layer resistance, charge transfer resistance, and conduction resistance via impedance spectroscopy to enhance the data quality of the benchmark tests. Finally, the stability and reusability of the MPL-supported CCM was checked by cycling between a galvanostatic hold at 4 A cm -2 and a short series of impedance measurements at 0.1 A cm -2 . Break-in effects were observed for the membrane and cathode (directly measured) while anode-specific hardware and MPL issues such as the passivation of the titanium endplate and MPL delamination were observed. The results of these experiments for the flexible MPL-supported CCM for PEMWE along with the generalizability of the Van der Pauw method, and five-electrode method for other membrane-based cells will be discussed.

Due to the increasing annual rise in carbon dioxide levels from burning fossil fuels for energy, which is accelerating climate change, countries are moving away from fossil fuels and turning to hydrogen as a sustainable, renewable alternative. Hydrogen offers more than twice as much energy per mass compared to other fuels and can be produced renewably through water electrolysis using wind or solar energy. Electrolysis requires electrocatalysts that control the half-reactions of water splitting at a low enough overpotential, i.e. the difference between the theoretical potential and the actual potential at which these reactions take place. Platinum group metals (PGMs) are the favored electrocatalysts due to their efficiency, but they are expensive and only available in small quantities in the earth's crust. Efforts are therefore being made to replace them with more abundant and less expensive transition metals such as nickel. Nickel is an excellent OER catalyst under alkaline conditions and has recently also shown promise as a HER catalyst. Such catalysts are used in zero-gap electrolyzers, where the separators between the anode and cathode are membranes, however, recently it has been shown that these separators can be improved to limit gas crossover and metal cross-contamination. 1 In this work we present how different types of exchange membranes affect activity and stability of nickel-based electrocatalysts. It is well known that different metals that form alloys with nickel affect its electrochemistry, such as the effect of iron on nickel that increases the activity of the OER. The experiments were conducted in a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with which we achieve higher current densities than standard laboratory scale methods mainly the rotating disc electrode. Another benefit of GDE is that it can utilize a membrane, so it closely resembles membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), which are the benchmark used for testing catalyst for industrial application. With these results we wish to stress the importance of using the right separator with respect to the activity and stability of nickel-based electrocatalysts.2,3 (1) Cohen, L. A.; Weimer, M.

Electrochemical water splitting is essential in current decarbonization efforts, requiring catalysts that combine high activity with stability. First-row transition metal oxides have been extensively studied due to their remarkable chemical and physical attributes. Their significant catalytic activity and durability in alkaline environments make them a cost-effective alternative to noble metal counterparts in acidic conditions. However, recent research indicates that catalysts composed of transition metals like Ni, Co, Fe, and Mn undergo dissolution and substantial changes in their chemical composition during operation. 1–3 Addressing these issues is vital for the progress of commercial energy conversion technologies, which frequently experience intermittent loads and reverse currents. Thus, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the reconstruction processes these materials undergo under fluctuating current conditions is key to developing more resilient and efficient electrocatalytic materials. 4 Herein, we investigate the dissolution and compositional transformations of metal (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalytic films during steady and intermittent operation. These films, tested as oxygen evolution reaction catalysts in alkaline media, consisted of nickel oxyhydroxide codeposited with cobalt, iron, and manganese on titanium substrates. Inspired by recent findings on the effect of pH swings during high current electrolysis, 5 we examined the electrode potential transients of these films under steady and intermittent current operation in a typical three-electrode configuration. We used time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to analyze compositional changes in the electrocatalytic films before and after testing. Next, we conducted ex-situ and online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements to track metal dissolution under different testing environments. To evaluate if these phenomena persist in more practical environments, we utilized an electrochemical flow electrolyzer developed by our group to examine the reconstruction of these electrocatalysts under intermittent, industry-relevant conditions. Our research highlights the influence of operational conditions on the reconstruction and dissolution of electrocatalytic materials, providing vital insights for developing more durable and efficient materials.

Hydrogen is essential for various uses in the fuel, chemical industry, and energy carriers industries. Global demand is set to double by 2030, reaching 180 Mt [1]. Currently, fossil fuels are the primary source of hydrogen production, which causes significant CO 2 emissions [2]. Therefore, producing CO 2 -free, so-called green hydrogen by electrolysis of water is promising. Effective electrocatalysts are vital for implementing this strategy. However, the high cost and rarity of commonly used noble metal-based catalysts pose significant barriers to their realization [3]. Herein, we report electrocatalysts based on Ni and Fe synthesized onto Ni-mesh. As in the case of hydrothermal synthesis [4], the purified Ni mesh was autoclaved with a mixture of precursors at 100 o C for 8 h. For comparison, a series of catalysts with different molar ratios were prepared and electrodeposited Ni x -Fe y OOH catalyst was used. The morphology and structure of the synthesized materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Figure 1 displays a SEM image illustrating a three-dimensional micro-flower formation of Ni and Fe oxides, characteristic of the hydrothermal synthesis process [4,5]. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of synthesized catalysts was measured in 1 M KOH using a standard three-electrode setup at room temperature to demonstrate the efficiency of electrocatalysts. Additionally, bare Ni-mesh was included as a control sample for comparison. However, electrode fabrication methods and techniques should be scalable and automated, allowing electrolyzer production volumes to be easily scaled to meet growing demand. Therefore, using the same methods, large surface area (20 cm 2 ) Ni-mesh-based electrodes were prepared, and their OER activity was investigated in a 6 M KOH solution in an electrolysis cell (80 °C).

The first report of the photo-induced oxygen evolution reaction on UV-irradiated TiO 2 was in 1969. 1 That year, the results were also presented at the Annual Meeting of the Electrochemical Society of Japan. At the time, many people did not believe the results. This is a testament to their revolutionary character. It was not until the results were published in the Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan two years later and in Nature three years later that the ideas began to be accepted. 2,3 The results are still recognized as being revolutionary and have been cited over 30,000 times, according to the Web of Science, and over 38,000 times, according to Google Scholar, earning it a place in the list of the 100 most highly scientific papers of all time. The results then became the subject of intense investigation in the early 1970s, with important confirmatory studies being published, for example, by Wrighton, et al. 4 It became apparent that the band-gap of TiO 2 was too large for the effective utilization of sunlight in water splitting, but, nevertheless, many researchers have been continuing to develop new types of semiconductors and compound structures. Thus, water can now be split effectively with sunlight. In the meantime, Fujishima and coworkers began to make use of the oxidative power of TiO 2 in photocatalytic self-cleaning and self-sterilization. This work has led to numerous basic studies, as well as applications, from surgical catheters to window glass, to whole buildings. 5 Notably, photocatalytic coatings have recently been intensively developed for the decomposition of viruses by many researchers. Twenty-five years after the original paper in Nature, a second ground-breaking paper appeared, this time on the phenomenon of photo-induced hydrophilicity. 6 This phenomenon has some relationship to traditional photocatalysis but is distinct from it, although some researchers have claimed that they are in fact identical. This debate has continued up to the present, with fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations being carried out, but there is increasing recognition that it is a separate phenomenon, involving the photo-induced dissociation of water molecules at the TiO 2 surface, greatly enhancing its hydrophilicity. Thus, Fujishima’s work has given major impetus to the fields of artificial photosynthesis, the production of solar fuels, and photo-induced self-cleaning and anti-fogging, as well as having a tremendous impact on the development of antibacterial and antiviral coatings.

Substantial amounts of green hydrogen will be required for the transformation of several industry sectors toward a more sustainable operation. The future chemical industry, in particular, will be in high demand since the environmental impact of processes like ammonia and methanol synthesis can be significantly reduced via the use of green hydrogen. Moreover, hydrogen is one possible option for storing surplus electrical energy, the production of which is unavoidable when switching to renewable sources of electricity [1]. Among the different available technologies, Alkaline Water Electrolysis (AEL) is the most cost-effective and developed variant [2]. However, conventional AEL encounters challenges such as a significant gas cross-contamination, especially in the part-load range [3]. A novel hybrid cell arrangement proposed by Koj et al. [3] (Fig. 1 (a)) aims for mitigation of these cross-contaminations by implementing gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs). As an additional benefit, only one instead of two electrolyte cycles is needed. This simplifies the electrolysis system noticeably. In this work, the development and employment of GDEs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the hybrid cell arrangement will be investigated. The developed electrodes are based on prior research of Kaiser et al. [4]. The GDEs are manufactured by spray-coating nickel mesh with a mixture of catalyst components dispersed in water. The catalyst is mainly composed of nickel particles, with low amounts of iron as a secondary catalyst to enhance the electrode performance [4]. PTFE acts as the binder, while methyl cellulose is used as a pore-building agent. A sintering step creates the necessary porous structure by removing the methyl cellulose and melting the PTFE. A typical GDE structure of hydrophilic and hydrophobic pores is created in the process. This study investigates the impact of each catalyst component and additional variables such as the catalyst load on the electrode performance. The main point of consideration is the mass fraction of each component, which is varied systematically. Multiple electrochemical (linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry) and physicochemical measurements (BET surface area, porosity, pore size distribution, bubble point) are conducted. Fig. 1 (b, c) illustrates the effect of methyl cellulose content and catalyst loading and their subsequent effect on the electrode performance, as shown exemplary with linear sweep voltammetry measurements. The GDEs appear to benefit from a higher methylcellulose content and a higher catalyst load. The collected data can be used to determine an optimal catalyst composition. Furthermore, the connections between physical structure, catalyst composition and electrode performance are to be unraveled. Subsequent research will focus on evaluating electrodes with optimal parameters in a full-cell setup, specifically addressing cell voltage, stability and the overall goal of reducing the gas cross-contamination.

Low-metallicity Wolf–Rayet (WR) populations, such as the one of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), are expected to be slightly influenced by metallicity-dependent effects, such as envelope inflation, which typically positions stars at cooler temperatures. Consequently, these populations should be easier to understand from a theoretical point of view. Yet, the observed bimodal temperature distribution of WR stars in the SMC cannot be explained by existing single-star or binary evolution models. To better understand the observed temperature distribution of WR stars in the SMC, the role of the evolutionary secondary and its response to mass transfer is studied here in detail. To achieve this, I calculated a small grid of binary evolution models at the SMC metallicity, that follows the evolution of both the primary and secondary stars in detail. The analysis of the new binary evolution models suggests that hot (T ≈ 100 kK), hydrogen-poor WN-type stars are the descendants of “ordinary” primary stars or secondaries that have accreted less than a few percent of their initial mass. In contrast, moderate-temperature (T ≈ 50 kK) WN stars can emerge through two channels: (i) as former accretors that underwent rejuvenation, altering their interior structure and leading to higher surface oxygen abundances (XO = 20×10−5) after mass-transfer, or (ii) as luminous stars experiencing envelope inflation, that exhibit surface oxygen abundances in accordance with the CNO-equilibrium value (XO = 2×10−5). The first observational evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from the WR star SMC AB 4, whose optical spectra can only be explained with a stellar atmosphere model having a surface oxygen abundance one order of magnitude higher than the CNO-equilibrium value. Following the binary evolution models, secondary stars that have accreted mass relatively conservatively and, thus, got rejuvenated will evolve at low metallicity into WN stars with moderate temperatures and should be accompanied by a compact object. This would imply that the WN-type star SMC AB 4 should have a so far unseen compact companion. Future spectroscopic surveys focusing on surface oxygen abundances and multiplicity among SMC WR stars are key to further understanding massive star evolution and the role of binarity in forming WR stars in low-metallicity environments.

The rapid development of portable electronics and emerging electric vehicles has created a pressing need for electrical energy storage systems. Among these systems, rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have emerged as a compelling candidate due to their high theoretical energy density of 1218 Wh k -1 , coupled with inherent safety features, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. The efficiency of ZABs is significantly boosted by alkaline electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity, which improves charging and discharging processes. However, the stability and cycle life of ZABs suffer due to issues like zinc dendrite growth and carbonate salt formation, arising from the side reaction with electrolytes. Recently, the substitution of traditional alkaline electrolytes with near-neutral electrolytes has gained attention, offering a pathway to alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks. A pivotal area of research in advancing near-neutral zinc–air batteries (ZABs) centers on the development of bi-functional catalysts. This focus stems from the significantly reduced catalytic efficiency for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in near-neutral electrolytes compared to their performance in alkaline counterparts. Notably, these electrocatalysts are typically deposited onto a gas diffusion layer (GDL) to facilitate both mass and electron transport. The characteristics of the GDL play a critical role in influencing the battery's overall efficiency due to its involvement in the three-phase reaction. Despite its importance, there has been a scarcity of research dedicated to exploring the properties and optimization strategies of the GDL, highlighting a gap in the current understanding and development of high-performance near-neutral ZABs. In this study, we introduce a straightforward two-step electrochemical pre-treatment method aimed at enhancing the functionality of both the commercial GDL and the catalyst. Initially, the commercial GDL undergoes electroactivation in an acidic environment, as evidenced by an uptick in –OH and –C=O signals in Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, indicative of a rise in oxygen-containing functional groups. This alteration significantly decreases the electrolyte's contact angle with the GDL from 130 to 60 degrees, signifying enhanced hydrophilicity. Further analysis via Raman spectroscopy reveals an augmentation in defective surface areas, advantageous for electrochemical processes. Subsequently, the bi-functional catalyst, Ru 0.7 Sn 0.3 O 2 , was drop-coating on the activated GDL and underwent a secondary electroactivation pre-treatment. The SEM results show that the modification substantially generates the porous structure of the catalyst and thus increases the electrochemically active surface area, dramatically enhancing the activity of the catalyst. To assess the impact of the electrochemical pre-treatment, we performed electrochemical evaluations on ZAB full cells, comparing air cathodes that underwent pre-treatment (activated ZAB, denoted as ac-ZAB) with those that did not (original ZAB referred to as o-ZAB), within a chloride-based near-neutral electrolyte environment. Cyclic voltammetry testing highlighted the enhanced bifunctional catalytic efficiency of Ru 0.7 Sn 0.3 O 2 , with ac-ZAB showing stronger cathodic ORR and anodic OER signals in comparison to the o-ZAB. Furthermore, the galvanodynamic discharge curve along with its power density curve (Figure a) revealed that the ac-air has a much higher power density of 38 mV cm -2 , surpassing the o-ZAB (15 mV cm -2 ). It is noteworthy that ac-ZAB exhibits much smaller activation polarization in comparison to o-ZAB, indicating the effectiveness of the pre-treatment. In long-cycle galvanodynamic charge-discharge tests (Figure b), the ac-ZAB showcased improved performance, demonstrating lower charging voltages and higher discharging voltages (1.98 V and 1.15 V, respectively), resulting in a reduced voltage gap of approximately 0.83 V. The battery incorporating ac-ZAB also exhibited remarkable stability, maintaining performance over 10 days. These outcomes underscore the pre-treatment’s ability to significantly boost bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity, surpassing untreated counterparts and setting new benchmarks in the field. To evaluate the wide application of this pre-treatment approach, we assembled a range of battery models incorporating the pre-treated cathode. Notably, the flexible near-neutral ZABs exhibited a significant enhancement in power density (25 mV cm -2 ) alongside a narrowed voltage gap (0.98 V). Additionally, its application to alkaline ZABs also significantly improves the battery performance, affirming the pre-treatment's utility across different battery chemistries. Various GDLs and catalysts were also subjected to the pre-treatment process. The subsequent material analyses and electrochemical performance assessments indicated successful activation, as evidenced by improved functional characteristics. This investigation offers a straightforward yet innovative methodology for augmenting the air electrode design, contributing to the development of high-performance ZAB. Figure 1

Within renewable energy systems, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer relies on multiple proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction on heterogeneous catalyst surface. In PEM electrolyzer, the catalytic process of hydrogen adsorption through Volmer reaction, involving the combination of a proton and an electron on surface, holds significance. Recent attention has been focused on optimizing the proton and an electron coupling by lowering the activation barrier and driving force of the hydrogen adsorption reaction. This focus is primarily on the cathodic part, involving hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and organic electro-hydrogenation systems, initiating the formation of a surface-adsorbed hydrogen atom (H * ) as first step. Among them, hydrogen spillover has emerged as a new method to reduce the activation barrier in HER and hydrogenation systems. This mechanism contains the diffusion of adsorbed H + from hydrogen-rich to deficient surface. An optimal catalyst for hydrogen spillover is characterized by strong dissociation abilities and weak binding to dissociated hydrogen atoms. Palladium (Pd) exhibits commendable equilibrium of these features, suggesting the potential for performance improvement through alloying with other metals. However, hydrogen spillover is specific to the cathodic part, where the reactant is the surface-adsorbed hydrogen atom, and do not extend to the anodic part, which involves reactants unrelated to the adsorbed hydrogen atom. Generally, in the anodic part of the electrolyzer system, water-based reactants (H 2 O in acid/ OH - in based) or organic-based reactants (such as hydrazine, ethanol, and formic acid) are utilized. Nowadays, organic-based reactants are preferred in low-voltage electrolysis due to the sluggish kinetics of electro-decomposition in water-based reactants. Among them, formic acid emerges as a promising organic molecule for achieving high efficiency. Formic acid electrooxidation reaction (FAOR) theoretically exhibits a negative oxidation potential compared to both hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER): E o = -0.17 V SHE for HCOOH/CO 2 < +0 V SHE for H 2 /H + < +1.23 V SHE for H 2 O/O 2 . Platinum (Pt)-based catalysts are utilized in FAOR. Unfortunately, since HCOOH oxidation occurs under more positive potential than H * desorption (0.05 V < E < 0.35 V RHE ), the FAOR encounters a limitation of overpotential that exceeds the potential of H * desorption. In other words, acceleration of H * desorption on active site could be necessary for the anodic reaction. To facilitate the movement of H * in both anodic and cathodic reactions, it is essential to consider accelerating both H * adsorption and desorption on the active site to ensure the efficiency. Despite the emphasis on activating the target reaction by controlling PCET, there are limited studies on dual mechanisms of H * adsorption and desorption in catalytic system. Biological energy conversion involves a diverse array of ion-coupled electron transfer reaction. Many organisms in electron transport chain facilitate the movement of electrons from electron donors to acceptors through redox reactions, linking this electron transfer with H + ions. Here, we report Amphi-functional mediator (AFM) molecules, as a hydrogen atom modulator. Through the electrodeposition method onto Pt and Pd, we facilitate distinct movements of H * , resulting in low overpotential and enhanced catalytic efficiency. Depending on the migration energy of H * , AFM can function as both an acceptor and donor of H * to Pt and Pd, respectively. In a hydrogen-producing electrolyzer employing FAOR as the anodic process (FAOR||HER), AFC reduced the cell potential by 1.15 V at 10 mA cm -2 , improving the faradaic efficiency from 87% to 100%. In an electrochemical hydrogen-carrier-producing reactor to hydrogenate toluene to methylcyclohexane (MCH), AFM successfully generated MCH, which cannot be produced without AFM.

Introduction Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising technology for hydrogen production. However, the local environment of the anode in PEMWE systems is highly acidic, primarily due to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER; 2H 2 O → O 2 + 4H + + 4e − ). Furthermore, the available anode materials are limited to Ir-based materials. Current technology necessitates a high Ir loading of 1−2 mg/cm 2 to achieve activity and durability. Nevertheless, the future demand for hydrogen is anticipated to increase to the GW scale, posing challenges in meeting this demand with existing Ir resources (5~7 tons/year) when the Ir loading is 2 mg/cm 2 (0.5 mgIr/W). Meanwhile, Tosoh has been actively involved in the electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) industry. EMD is synthesized through the anodic oxidation of Mn 2+ ions (Mn 2+ + 2H 2 O → MnO 2 + 4H + + 2e − ) under acidic conditions, making it potentially suitable for PEMWE. In this study, a very small amount of Ir (<0.1 mg/cm 2 ) was composited with EMD to reduce the Ir content. The resulting composite exhibited high activity, achieving a current density of 3.2 A/cm 2 at 2 V. Furthermore, the composite demonstrated stable operation for over 3800 h at 2 A/cm 2 . Experiments EMD was electrodeposited onto Pt-coated Ti (Pt/Ti) fibers by electrolyzing a Mn 2+ -containing electrolyte. Subsequently, the EMD-coated Pt/Ti was immersed in an Ir-containing solution, followed by annealing to obtain Ir-containing EMD, referred to as "IrMnOx." In general, Pt/Ti fibers are used as a porous transport layer (PTL) in PEMWE systems, and our developed material serves dual roles as an OER catalyst and a PTL. Furthermore, the OER characteristic was evaluated using a PEMWE cell operating at 80℃ in a two-electrode system. Pt-supported carbon served as the cathode catalyst, with Nafion®-115 as the PEM. Results and discussion Using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), the Ir content in IrMnOx was determined to be 0.1 mg/cm 2 . The OER activity of IrMnOx was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). For comparison, commercial Ir oxide with an Ir content of 0.1 mg/cm 2 was evaluated using the same method. As depicted in Figure 1, IrMnOx demonstrated superior OER activity compared to Ir oxides with similar Ir content. Notably, the OER activity of IrMnOx reached 3.2 A/cm 2 at 2 V. This could be attributed to EMD serving as a high specific surface area support and the highly dispersed Ir, thereby augmenting the catalytic sites for the OER. Additionally, the constant current durability of IrMnOx and Ir oxide was tested at a current density of 2 A/cm 2 (Fig. 2). Ir oxide became deactivated within 200 h, whereas IrMnOx remained stable for over 3800 h without degradation. Essentially, IrMnOx exhibited practical OER activity and durability while reducing the required Ir amount by over tenfold compared to current technologies.

Electrocatalytic Oxygen Atom Transfer (E-OAT) reactions are vital in chemical manufacturing, notably in fields such as pharmaceuticals. Inspired by the efficiency of Molybdoenzymes in oxygen atom transfer within biological systems, various Molybdenum compounds have been synthesized to understand chemical oxygen atom transfer. This study employed a bio-inspired Molybdenum(IV) oxo benzene 1,2 dithiolate [Mo IV O(bdt) 2 ] 2- catalyst for E-OAT, utilizing Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) as the substrate and water as the oxygen donor. Notably, a significant enhancement was achieved, with a 46% conversion of triphenylphosphine into triphenylphosphine oxide over 4 hours at ambient temperature, surpassing traditional methods. To further optimize processes, such as epoxide formation, a deeper understanding of catalytically active species at low overpotential is essential. Operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) investigations at Mo K-edge and S K-edge provided insights into electronic structure changes during homogeneous catalysis of Phosphine oxidation and catalyst stability. The challenge posed by the limited concentration of active metal, which results in low X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy signals, was addressed by employing Operando Grazing Incidence XAS. Through this approach, the evolution of pre-edge features was observed, indicating the formation of Mo-O binding in the active states. Moreover, Operando S K-edge analysis revealed the catalyst's chemical and structural evolution mediated by electrochemically induced sulfur vacancies, elucidating the active state.

Despite the high-energy density of lithium- and manganese-rich layered oxides (LRLOs) provided through the high-voltage anionic redox chemistry, critical issues such as capacity fading and voltage decay have limited their real-world applications. As an elegant solution, O2-type LRLOs were recently reported to mitigate these voltage issues via reversible transition-metal (TM) migration during the successive charging and discharging; however, these materials still suffer from capacity degradation during long-term cycling. Repetitive mechanical stress and failure has also been proposed as the origin of the capacity fading even in LRLOs. Nevertheless, in-depth studies on the mechanical behavior in LRLOs, particularly with respect to the extent of high-voltage oxygen redox, remain elusive. Herein, a series of O2-type LRLOs were designed and synthesized to investigate the evolution of the bulk structures as a function of varying oxygen-redox capabilities and to examine their effects on persistent electrochemical degradation. We demonstrate that the generation of bulk microcracks in the particles is strongly coupled with repeated lattice evolution and structural distortions during the high-voltage oxygen redox. These internal cracks lead to the formation of an electrochemically inactive phase near the cracks, which is followed by capacity fading as extended cycling occurs. These findings clarify how the oxygen redox in LRLOs is highly correlated to the mechanical degradation (and consequently capacity fading) and provide a general design principle towards genuine high-energy cathode materials.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE) have gained recent attention as a promising low temperature H 2 O electrolysis technology that combines the benefits of commercial liquid alkaline and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), while alleviating concerns over capital cost and materials criticality associated with these existing technologies. 1,2 While AEMWEs have achieved significant performance advances in recent decades, overpotentials remain high relative to PEMWE counterparts, 2 requiring AEMWE-specific catalyst layer design strategies to further advance this technology. Catalyst layers conventionally consist of catalyst particles which are co-deposited with an ion-conducting polymer or ionomer that is of the same chemistry as the ion-exchange polyelectrolyte phase. 3 In PEMWEs, which are operated in pure water, this ionomer serves as the sole ion (H + ) transport network through the catalyst layer. The ionomer further serves roles as a binding agent, adhering catalyst particles to the electrode, as well as an ink rheology agent. 4 In contrast, AEMWEs often operate in dilute supporting electrolyte, raising questions about the role of the ionomer in AEMWE systems. In this work, we assess the specific roles of ionomers in supporting electrolyte fed AEMWEs using NiFe 2 O 4 , identified in our previous work as a strong candidate for a commercial alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and PiperION TP85 from Versogen, a common commercially available AEM. Catalyst layers were constructed at variable ionomer contents (0 – 30 wt%) to investigate the role of the ionomer phase in supporting electrolyte-fed AEMWEs. Specifically, the role of the ionomer in catalyst structure and quality, catalyst adhesion, and ion transport were investigated via electrochemical and physical characterization of pristine and tested catalyst layers. Ex-situ scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were employed to provide insights into catalyst and ionomer loss mechanisms over 200 h durability tests at different ionomer contents. Voltage breakdown analyses were used to further investigate the effects of ionomer content on cell overpotentials. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel analyses were utilized to decouple thermodynamic, Ohmic, kinetic, and catalyst layer resistance contributions to overpotentials for each ionomer content. The results show that intermediate ionomer contents (5-10 wt%) provide the highest cell current densities. Intermediate ionomer contents were found to a achieve a balance of catalyst adhesion, catalyst layer porosity, and catalyst layer homogeneity, leading to improved site accessibility and decreased cell overpotentials. Testing with Nafion (a non-anion conducting polymer) further demonstrated that the ionomer is not required for ion conduction in AEMWE catalyst layers under supporting-electrolyte operation and therefore that ionomers do not need to match the chemistry of the anion exchange membrane. Instead, we find that, for initial performance, the ionomer is crucial for catalyst layer structure and quality, and for long-term stability, the ionomer is crucial to provide catalyst adhesion for long-term durability.

Electrocatalysis is projected to play a key role in building a sustainable world based on renewable energy. Electrochemical water splitting produces H 2 on the cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER), which can be used as a fuel and reactant in diverse industries. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) producing O 2 at the anode is a complex reaction that limits the overall efficiency of water electrolyzers. Active, stable, and affordable catalysts are required for both reactions. The range of potential catalysts has expanded from metals and oxides to others, sulfides having become one of the most actively studied material groups. Our work focuses on understanding inherent activity and structural changes under HER and OER conditions. Different water electrolyzer technologies subject the catalysts to different operating conditions, which limits the available catalyst materials. For proton exchange membrane electrolyzers featuring an acidic environment, platinum group metals are currently used. However, several earth abundant catalysts have been identified for HER in acid. Among these, molybdenum sulfides in both amorphous (a-MoS x ) and crystalline (c-MoS 2 ) forms have attracted attention. 1 We developed a plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) process that can deposit both amorphous MoS x with adjustable S/Mo ratio (2.8–4.7) and crystalline MoS 2 with different crystallinity, morphology, and electrical properties. 2 Electrochemical measurements in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 combined with ex situ and quasi in situ XPS revealed a-MoS x films to transform into highly active a-MoS 2 . C-MoS 2 films were less active and did not show structural changes under HER conditions. 3 Alkaline electrolyzers and anion exchange membrane electrolyzers operate under alkaline conditions and use earth abundant Fe/Co/Ni based catalysts. Most if not all materials based on these metals convert to oxyhydroxides under the highly oxidizing OER conditions and readily incorporate iron present in electrolytes. 4,5 Thus, the as-deposited OER catalysts are best described as precatalysts. We developed new ALD processes to deposit NiS x and Co 9 S 8 , 6,7 while oxide, metal, and hydroxide thin films were deposited for comparison using different methods. Extensive electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with controlled Fe impurities combined with ex situ XPS revealed that in absence of iron all the Ni-based precatalysts convert to an OER-active oxyhydroxide, yet at substantially different rates (NiS x ≈ Ni(OH) 2 >> Ni > NiO). 8 However, good OER activity and stability was only achieved in the presence of Fe impurities. The highest amount of iron incorporation and the best OER performance was found for the NiS x and Ni(OH) 2 precatalysts, which convert the fastest into the active oxyhydroxide form. Studies on Co-based OER precatalysts are currently ongoing, including use of operando characterization methods. Our studies on ALD sulfides as both HER and OER catalysts showcase the importance of understanding catalyst structure and its changes under catalytic conditions. Armed with this knowledge and unique capabilities of ALD, catalysts with higher performance in electrolyzer applications can be designed and engineered. References [1] Mattinen, Leskelä, Ritala, Adv.

Photo-electrochemical (PEC) seawater splitting using semiconductors is a promising means of directly producing hydrogen from seawater occupying approximately 97% of Earth’s water. The n-type perovskite oxynitride semiconductors with a general formula AB(O,N) 3 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba or La; B=Ti, Nb or Ta) are capable of absorbing intensive visible light up to 750 nm wavelength, thermodynamically leading to high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 10% or above. 1 Also, their band positions straddle various oxidation and reduction potentials including the water redox potential to produce value-added energy resources such as H 2 , HCOOH, and NH 3 . 2 Based on the favorable optical properties, the water splitting activity using the oxynitrides has been significantly increased in strong alkaline electrolytes, although it is still low in neutral electrolytes. 2-3 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is driven via four-electron oxidation. Its kinetics is commonly very sluggish in neutral aqueous solutions, which the significant overpotential is required to catalyze it. Thus, applying alternative oxidations to OER, such as chlorine evolution reaction (CER), may be a feasible approach to efficient hydrogen production in neutral seawater electrolytes. 4 In terms of thermodynamic potential, OER ( E 0 = 1.23 V NHE ) is more oxidative than CER ( E 0 = 1.36 V NHE ). However, CER driven via two-electron oxidation can be catalyzed faster than OER kinetically in neutral electrolytes. Herein we first present sunlight-driven seawater splitting activity of perovskite AB(O,N) 3 largely improved in neutral environments and also discuss CER activity depending on various pH values as an alternative oxidation to OER. Highly-crystalline, porous SrNbO 2 N particles grown on Nb substrate was prepared by bottom-up fabrication including oxidation of Nb substrate and flux-assisted nitridation. 5 The advanced fabrication caused less-defective oxynitride with a large surface area. The resulting SrNbO 2 N/Nb photoanode produced significant OER photocurrent in 0.2 M NaPi electrolyte at a neutral pH 6.4, and the photocurrent was three times increased by adding 0.5 M NaCl to catalyze CER simultaneously. Moreover, the onset potential for seawater splitting including CER was shifted to a lower potential by approximately 0.1 V RHE than that for water splitting leading to OER exclusively. These results clearly demonstrate that CER was preferentially catalyzed during neutral seawater splitting compared with competitive OER. It also implies that CER kinetics over the SrNbO 2 N was faster than OER kinetics despite its unfavorable thermodynamic potential. The BaTaO 2 N/Ta photoanode, more photoactive and stable than the Nb-based oxynitrides, was synthesized in the similar manner. The seawater splitting of the oxynitride at different pH values was further investigated, and the quantitative analysis of the resulting products, namely, H 2 , O 2 , and ClO − was also performed to determine the operating conditions suitable for efficient and stable seawater splitting. Moreover, different electro-catalysts to improve the selectivity to CER were evaluated in the artificial seawater. The enhanced seawater splitting activity and selectivity to CER of the AB(O,N) 3 in artificial seawater will be discussed in detail in a presentation. References J. Seo, H. Nishiyama, T. Yamada, K.

There has been a growing interest in tandem electrocatalysts with unique interfaces and synergetic functions, which have been reported to exhibit outstanding performance in activity [1] , selectivity [2] , and stability [3] . Besides the development of monolithic tandem nanostructures, nanoparticle (NP) assembly provides a more desirable and controllable strategy to elaborately design novel nanocatalysts for various applications. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) and 3D tandem nanostructures, 1D tandem nanostructures have attracted more interest due to their high electrochemical surface areas, great atomic utilization, and outstanding structural stability, all of which are highly favored to achieve better electrocatalytic activity and stability. However, controllable 1D NP assembly is still challenging to achieve due to its relatively high surface energy and anisotropy, not to mention the creation of periodic 1D heterogeneous nanostructures with intimate interfaces and clean surfaces. In this work, we report a strategy to obtain periodic Pt-Au nanowires (NWs) by the assembly of Pt-Au Janus NPs with the assistance of peptide T7 (Ac-TLTTLTN-CONH 2 ). We further demonstrate that the Pt-Au NWs show highly improved catalytic performance in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), a 5.3 times higher specific activity and a 2.5 times higher mass activity than that of the current state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. The charge transfer at the interfaces of adjacent Pt and Au regions could weaken the binding energy between Pt and CO or CO-like intermediates, contributing to the enhancement of activities in MOR. More importantly, the periodic Pt-Au NWs exhibit outstanding stability in MOR, where the mass activity of Pt-Au NWs after 1000 cycles retains 93.9%, much higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (30.6%). We believe that this strategy to design and obtain periodic NWs by the assembly of Janus NPs is universal and transformative to diverse electrocatalytic reactions to achieve synergistic effects and intimate interfaces with high catalytic activity. [4][5] In conclusion, we have obtained periodic Pt-Au NWs by the assembly of Pt-Au Janus NPs with the assistance of peptides and demonstrated their outstanding activities and stability in MOR. This research presents a strategy to develop periodic heterogeneous nanowires with intimate interfaces and synergistic effects by the 1D assembly of Janus NPs, which offers an opportunity to design and program periodic 1D tandem catalysts.

As is well known, the global movement toward carbon neutrality became legally effective as an internationally applicable law on November 4, 2016. This encouraged countries worldwide to proactively invest in the development of environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage technologies. Among various renewable energy, hydrogen stands out as an abundant and eco-friendly energy source. Therefore, the development of water electrolyzers and fuel cells is crucial for producing and utilizing green hydrogen, a key to advancing the hydrogen economy. To improve and commercialize these two specific electrochemical applications, the development of efficient electrocatalytic materials is essential. Moreover, the rapid advancement in computer performance and software engineering since the introduction of Moore’s Law has enabled the development of effective materials by predicting catalytic activity and durability based on the unique electronic configurations of materials. It facilitates the design and validation of optimal catalysts and enables a faster and more accurate search for ideal catalytic materials. Especially, according to the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) project, it is asserted that combining computational and experimental approaches can effectively discover, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials twice as fast and at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional methods. In recent energy research fields, the development of new energy materials based on theoretical mechanism validation and materials screening through computational methods, such as DFT calculations and molecular dynamics, is essential, not optional. In this presentation, effective strategies for designing superior materials, developed through theory-guided experimental approaches, will be introduced with a focus on two specific electrochemical applications: the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and the alkaline electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). The detailed two topics of the presentation are as follows. As the first research topic, PEMFCs function by efficiently converting chemical energy into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions, producing clean byproducts such as water and heat. Their appeal lies in their high energy efficiency, environmentally friendly energy conversion, and low operating temperatures. However, the widespread adoption and commercialization of PEMFCs have been impeded by various issues related to scientific challenges, durability, and cost-effectiveness. For PEMFCs to achieve broad commercialization, enhancing the intrinsic activity and durability of electrocatalysts and catalyst layers (CLs) at high current densities is crucial. Therefore, two research strategies of nanostructure control and durable carbon materials for long-term PEMFC will be respectively introduced as follows: (1) The intrinsically superstable PtCo intermetallic nanostructure, validated by machine-learning-derived real-size simulations; and (2) The anti-carbon corrosive fluorine-doped graphene nanoribbon/carbon nanotube (F-GNR@CNT) composite as additives in the electrode. As the second research topic, AEMWE presents a promising solution by combining the advantageous features of both alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) such as using non-precious metals in alkaline media and producing high-quality hydrogen at high-pressure. Although significant attention has conventionally been focused on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its complex multi-electron transfer process, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical to the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of water electrolysis systems. This is because HER kinetics in alkaline media are approximately two to three orders of magnitude slower than in acidic media due to the Volmer step. Therefore, two research strategies for developing precious and non-precious electrocatalysts will be respectively introduced as follows: (1) The design of atomically ordered PtNi nanostructures for application in practical AEMWE systems; and (2) The introduction of a synergistic interfacial effect between Ni metal and CeO₂. In summary, we have successfully designed superior electrocatalysts and durable carbon materials for green energy applications (PEMFC, AEMWE) through the combined study of computational and experimental approaches. For long-term PEMFCs, the highly ordered PtCo intermetallic nanostructure demonstrated robust stability in acidic conditions during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Furthermore, the addition of F-GNR@CNT to the Pt/C cathode improved durability by enhancing carbon corrosion resistance and optimizing water management. For high-performance AEMWE, intermetallic PtNi nanostructures were introduced to intrinsically enhance catalytic activity and durability. Additionally, Ni/CeO₂ electrocatalysts, benefiting from a synergistic interfacial effect, were integrated into an industrial-scale durable AEMWE system with an active surface area of 64 cm². Finally, we definitely believe that the synergy between computational validation and experimental skills can be highly effective and productive in the field of energy research.

Over the past decades, the challenge of sustainable energy production at low cost has persisted. Hydrogen emerges as a viable alternative fuel for various applications, yet its utilization faces hurdles. This particularly concerns the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, necessitating higher input energy than theoretically optimal. Apart from an active electrocatalyst, the structure of the anode coating significantly influences performance [1-2-3]. Typically, fluorinated polymer compounds serve as a binder/ionomer, enhancing ionic transport during OER [4]. However, its exorbitant price and compliance with European Union regulations banning per- and polyfluoro substances (PFAS) poses challenges. One solution is to develop binder-free anodes. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of a nitrogen plasma treatment (PT) on catalyst-coated nickel plates with varying mass loadings to achieve binder-free and efficient OER performance. As a starting point, we utilized commercial nickel-cobalt-oxide (NiCoO 2 , Merck group), featuring processable primary particle sizes < 150 nm. Characterization of the powder involved various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Next, Hansen solubility parameters were recorded to select the suitable dispersant and an ink was prepared using an ethanol-water mixture. Ink stability was demonstrated through analytical centrifugation measurements analyzed by transmittograms [5]. Stable inks passing this quality gate were spray coated onto Ni metal plates with varying layer numbers of 40 (anode 40L), 80 (anode 80L), and 120 (anode 120 L), corresponding to mass loadings of 375 µg cm -2 , 750 ug cm -2 and 1125 ug cm -2 , respectively. Noteworthily, anode 40L exhibited incomplete catalyst coverage with visible substrate whereas anode 80L and anode 120L displayed a fully covered substrate. As these layers suffered from mechanical instability due to delamination, we added post-treatment by nitrogen plasma. All anodes were analyzed before and after plasma treatment in terms of their morphology, physico-chemical characteristics, and adhesion properties. The mechanical properties of these coatings were evaluated using an adhesion analyser, revealing enhanced adhesion strength for plasma treated samples compared to their as-prepared counterparts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis exhibited notable morphological alterations in the plasma-treated samples as illustrated in Figure 1a-c. Two distinct morphologies were observed. In case of anode 40L with plasma treatment (40L PT), the sample displayed incomplete coverage and exhibited spherical clusters of agglomerates. In contrast, the fully coated anodes 80L PT and 120L PT showcased enhanced coverage and distinct agglomerates. Besides these morphological observations, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showcased a notable increase in the oxygen to metal ratio in anode 40L PT compared to anodes 80L PT and 120L PT. We attribute this to the synergistic interaction between the N 2 plasma and the Ni plate substrate. This holds particularly for anode 40L PT, due to its low catalyst density and exposed Ni surface from the substrate which might have potentially induced the presence of oxygen molecules on the electrode surface. Finally, electrochemical measurements showed similar activity for the fully covered anodes 80L PT and 120L PT as shown in Figure 1d. This was expected due to very similar morphologies and surface properties evidenced by the chemical analysis. This indicates that higher mass loading does not increase the OER performance after PT. In contrast, anode 40L PT exhibited clearly superior performance with an overpotential value of 373 ± 3 mV. This can be potentially attributed to the higher abundance of oxides at the surface, which might have increased the amount of active sites in the anode. Our study highlights the potential of binder-free anodes for enhancing the efficiency of the OER in hydrogen production. By employing commercial NiCoO 2 powder as an electrocatalyst, coated on nickel substrates and finally utilizing a post-nitrogen plasma treatment, we achieved optimization of properties among the different layers, resulting in improved OER performance. These findings provide valuable insights into advancing the development of efficient and sustainable energy production technologies, thereby facilitating progress towards binder-free innovations in the field of electrocatalysis.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is a promising technology for the low-cost production of green hydrogen. However, significant improvements in components and component integration are needed to improve the efficiency and lifetime of AEMWE devices. [1] The anode catalyst layer is critical to activity due to the large overpotentials associated with the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and to durability due to the highly oxidizing environment that can lead to catalyst and polymer degradation. The anodic overpotential can be improved by increasing the number of catalyst sites that are utilized for the reaction, which requires the formation of uniform catalyst layers with good interfaces with both the membrane and the porous transport layer (PTL). [2] The PTL serves several important roles in the electrolyzer, including the transport of electrons between catalyst sites and the current collector and the transport of gaseous products out of the catalyst layer. The PTLs used for AEMWE are typically Ni-based, with no precious metal coating or microporous layer. The morphology of the PTL impacts its interface with the catalyst layer, which affects in-plane electronic resistance and the ability to utilize catalyst sites effectively. [3] The porosity and pore size of the PTL also affect bubble removal, which can contribute significantly to mass transport overpotential, particularly at high current densities. Commercially available PTLs are often not designed for the AEMWE application, meaning that their properties are not optimized for these two critical functions. In addition, in a supporting electrolyte like potassium hydroxide, hydroxide ions are not restricted to the catalyst layer-membrane interface or to the ionomer network such that the PTL also contributes to catalytic activity. Ni alloy PTLs can provide an advantage of higher initial catalytic activity compared to standard Ni, but many dopant metals (i.e., Fe, Cr, etc.) are prone to dissolution under AEMWE operating conditions, which can damage the membrane and lead to higher rates of degradation. Improved PTL designs are needed to improve electrolyzer performance and durability. In this study, we investigate the impact of PTLs with varying morphology and composition on kinetics, catalyst layer resistance, and durability. The properties of the PTLs, including composition, crystal structure, thickness, porosity, and fiber dimensions are determined using spectroscopy, diffraction, electron microscopy, and micro X-ray tomography. These material properties are then correlated with the performance of the PTL, with and without an additional catalyst layer. As shown in Figure 1 , the PTLs have a significant effect on device performance and often have significant electrochemical activity in the absence of a catalyst layer. The impact of the PTL on performance trends with catalyst conductivity and loading is also explored. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is further used to understand the effect of the PTL on interfacial charge resistance and resistances within the catalyst layer. Finally, ex situ characterization of the catalyst layer and PTL with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy, as well as analysis of dissolved species in the electrolyte using an inductively coupled-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), are used to understand the material stability of the PTL and impacts of PTL degradation on overall durability. This work provides insight into PTL design principles, which can be used to improve the performance and lifetime of AEM electrolyzers.

Iridium oxide possesses unique physicochemical properties, making it the only oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst used in modern proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). It is electronically conductive and relatively active towards the OER. Moreover, it can maintain these properties for a long time, guaranteeing the required long-term operation of PEMWE. Nevertheless, iridium oxide is not entirely immune during the OER. In the currently used PEMWE, the dissolution of Ir is masked by its high loading. This way-around solution will likely not work in low Ir loading anodes. To overcome this challenge, other material or operational solutions will be required. Both should be based on a more advanced understanding of the Ir dissolution mechanisms. In this presentation, we overview the current status of the iridium dissolution research. Aqueous and solid polymer electrolyte systems are considered as the former suits best model fundamental studies, and the latter represents real devices. As the first step in understanding Ir dissolution stability, the thermodynamics of Ir in broad potential and pH ranges, as visualized by Pourbaix diagrams, is discussed. Experimental data on Ir dissolution kinetics obtained in on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) studies is presented next. It is shown that changes in the Ir oxidation state during oxidation/reduction and OER are responsible for Ir losses. 1 The OER-triggered Ir dissolution is explained by suggesting the existence of common intermediates in water oxidation and Ir leaching. 2, 3 Besides mechanistic insights, Ir dissolution rates and amounts for different Ir oxides are quantified. Such quantification is more challenging in polymer electrolyte systems. Hence, a detailed analysis of various cell components to monitor Ir is performed. It is shown that in a full-cell setup, the main sink of Ir is the membrane and cathode catalyst layer. 4 While providing necessary information, experiments on the full-cell level are tedious and slow. We show that the same information can be obtained using half-cell gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setups. 5 The talk will be finalized by comparing and contrasting both electrolyte systems and discussing the next steps required to advance our understanding of Ir dissolution to provide mitigating strategies in stabilizing low Ir loading PEMWE anodes.

Layered transition metal hydroxides have been extensively studied as electrocatalyst for alkaline water electrolysis. 1 The morphological features such as size, aspect ratio, and exposed surface is known to strongly affect the performance of electrocatalysts, and edges are known to particularly exthibit high activity for oxygen evolution reactions. 2 Thus, controlling the crystal growth direction of layered metal hydroxides to expose more edges may be an effective method to enhance the catalytic activity of metal hydroxides. In general, layered materials, including layered metal hydroxides, grow preferentially along the lateral directions to form plate-like crystals, which means that preparation of columnar crystals with an aspect ratio of the thickness to the lateral size higher than 1 is difficult. Recently, we found the formation of columnar layered metal hydroxides with an aspect ratio exceeding 1 by utilizing metal-diamine complexes as precursors. 3 Here, we aim to control the size and aspect ratio of columnar crystals. We focused on the stability of the complexes and evaluated the anisotropic growth behavior of β-Co(OH) 2 . Columnar crystals of metal hydroxide are synthesized by mixing metal salt solution and diamine ligand solution at specific molar ratios, followed by heating under hydrothermal conditions. During hydrothermal treatment, metal ions, which can undergo condensation, are gradually released from metal-diamine complexes, leading to the formation of supersaturated solutions. When the degree of supersaturation is relatively high, anisotropic growth towards the stacking direction occurs. The stability of the complexes becomes a controlling factor for crystal shape. By using cobalt ions as the metal source and N,N' -dimethylethylenediamine ( NN' -dmeda) as the ligand, [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] ratio was varied from 3 to 30 and the morphological change of the products was evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy images show microscale hexagonal-prism shaped crystals with aspect ratios exceeding 1 at [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] ratios of 3, 5, 10, and 15. Powder X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction analysis indicate that all products were β-Co(OH) 2 and the long-axis direction of the columnar crystals corresponded to the stacking direction. Thus, the outer surfaces of these columnar crystals were enriched with edges. In the range of [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] = 3–10, the overall crystal size increased both in the stacking and lateral direction according to the increase of [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] while maintaining an average aspect ratio of approximately 2. At [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] = 15, columnar crystals with smaller aspect ratios were formed, and at [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] = 30, plate-like crystals with lateral sizes of about 20 μm were formed. Because the increase in [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] led to stabilization of metal complex and a decrease in the degree of supersaturation, the decrease in aspect ratio at [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] = 15–30 suggests that high degree of supersaturation is favable for the anisotropic growth. Therefore, controlling the degree of supersaturation by [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] enables the variation of the size and aspect ratio of columnar crystals. References (1) G. Chen, H. Wan, W. Ma, N.

Affordable and high-performance energy storage solutions are essential to meet the growing energy demands of society. Rechargeable batteries employing cost-effective and readily scalable battery materials offer promising prospects for fulfilling these needs. Mixed polyanionic insertion materials offer a rich treasure house for designing robust cathode materials for rechargeable batteries, leveraging properties such as chemical/thermal stability, tunable redox voltage, and excellent electrochemical performance. 1,2 Among these, PO 4 -based materials stand out as exceptional systems, offering scalable synthesis, safe storage/handling, and high energy density. Here, we delve into three distinct classes of mixed polyanionic materials, elucidating their electrochemical behavior and mechanism. (1) Mixed Phosphates: Nanostructured carbon-coated Na 4 Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 and Na 4 Ni 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 were explored as bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR). 3 Both materials showed bifunctional behavior, suggesting potential use in sodium-air batteries. For practical applications, nanoscale in-situ carbon-coated Na 4 Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 (NFPP) material was utilized for the fabrication of sodium ion full cells using hard carbon (HC) as the anode. 4 Reduced order modeling (ROM) was employed to accurately monitor cycling-related degradation. A stable NFPP/HC full cell exhibited a robust specific capacity for over 200 cycles with minimum degradation was achieved. (2) NASICON-type Phosphate-sulfate: Mixed polyanionic NaFe 2 PO 4 (SO 4 ) 2 was explored for Li- and Na-ion batteries, leveraging the Fe +3/+2 redox couple within a voltage range of 2.0 V to 4.5 V with excellent capacity and cycling stability. Spray-drying synthesized material with uniform spherical particles was studied using powder X-ray diffraction data followed by various physical characterizations (SEM, TEM, FTIR, Raman, UV vis and calorimetry, etc.). 5,6 A single particle-based model (SPM) was employed to analyze the system for predictions of alterations associated with different geometric and physical parameters. (3) Fluorophosphates: The electrochemical properties of Na 2 FePO 4 F fluorophosphate (3 V vs Na) were also investigated using a single particle model, validated using the half-cell data and various geometric and physical parameters. The magnetic structure and properties of fluorophosphate Na 2 MnPO 4 F sodium insertion material were explored using magnetic susceptibility measurements and neutron powder diffraction. 7 A long-range antiferromagnetic ordering was exhibited below the Néel temperature (T N ) ~10.4 K.

Hydrogen has unique advantages as an energy carrier, with a high energy density and abilities for long term storage and conversion between electricity and chemical bonds. Although hydrogen currently has a significant role in transportation and agriculture, its use in energy consumption overall has been limited. With decreasing electricity prices, electrolysis cost reductions can be achieved and allow for an opportunity for greater use. While load-following renewable power sources can reduce feedstock cost, further cost reductions can be achieved by decreasing stack and system cost. 1 Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers rely on platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts due to the high anode potentials and low pH of proton conducting systems. 2 While iridium (Ir) abundance is a potential concern for the ubiquitous deployment of PEM water electrolyzers, 3,4 thrifting Ir while improving performance and durability is critical for reaching hydrogen cost targets. Efforts are needed and underway to understand electrolyzer degradation and develop accelerated stress tests when accounting for lower PGM loadings and hydrogen cost reduction targets. 5 In this presentation, studies correlating operational and shutdown strategies to performance losses, identifying degradation mechanisms, and evaluating their impact on electrolyzer lifetime will be discussed. Depending on catalyst/interfacial properties and operational parameters, processes including catalyst/transport layer migration, and catalyst reordering, segregation, and oxidation have been observed and linked between ex situ characterization and in situ diagnostics. Through these studies, shutdown processes and catalyst redox transitions have generally been found to increase loss rates; varying catalyst types and morphologies, however, can also present significant integration challenges particularly when focusing on low PGM loading and durability testing. Mitigation options have further been explored that can address degradation processes, including catalyst development and electrode design strategies. Within catalysis, commercial screenings and development efforts have both modified materials properties and catalyst/ionomer/pore distribution throughout the catalyst layer. In some cases, electrode design efforts have also led to altered site utilization and changed the extent to which operational stressors utilize the entire catalyst layer, impacting performance losses over time. Catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction by Ir will be discussed as it relates to current status in the tradeoff between electrolyzer cost, performance, and lifetime; particular challenges in PEM durability and accelerated stress test development will be also discussed as well as it relates to other low temperature electrolysis technologies.

The electroreduction of UO 2 during pyroprocessing is counterbalanced by the oxidation of dissolved oxygen ions typically at a platinum anode in molten LiCl-Li 2 O to form oxygen gas. Platinum and previously explored alternative anodes have been found to corrode concurrently with the evolution of oxygen which poses an economic challenge for implementing pyroprocessing industrially. Ruthenium and iridium metal were investigated as potential anodes for the electroreduction step of pyroprocessing. Electrochemical data for the tested anodes will be presented. Additionally, extensive surface characterization including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy will be reported for the tested anodes.

The increasing energy demand, driven by industrialization and global population growth, has increased the focus on developing clean and sustainable energy sources [1]. Hydrogen (H 2 ) has emerged as a promising alternative to carbon-based fuels due to its low cost, higher calorific value, and absence of pollution emissions [2]. Electrochemical water splitting has recently gained prominence as a highly attractive technique for efficient hydrogen production [3]. Therefore, the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for advancing energy conversion and storage technologies [2]. The layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as promising non-noble metal catalysts for HER due to their unique composition and structural features, making them efficient and stable catalysts [4]. Indeed, copper (Cu)-based materials exhibit high electrical conductivity, the CuFe-LDH has been reported as an interesting electrocatalyst since iron (Fe) can enhance the reactivity in the HER process [5]. Likewise, cobalt (Co)-based catalysts emerge as potential alternatives to noble-metal catalysts in water-splitting applications, attributed to the high redox potential of Co species, cost-effectiveness, and stability in both acidic and basic environments [6]. Moreover, in binary LDHs, introducing a third metal ion has been shown to change the electronic structure and improve conductivity; hence, providing more active sites and facilitating a fast electron transfer process [7]. However, the LDHs as electrocatalysts are limited by their poor electronic conductivity and tendency for agglomeration. On the other hand, graphene (G), a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, serves as an excellent supporting matrix for LDHs due to its exceptional electronic conductivity and high surface area, facilitating efficient electron transfer during the water-splitting reaction [8]. Therefore, in this work, CoCuFe-LDH composites were synthesised and grown on graphene through a cost-effective and straightforward one-step hydrothermal process. Experiments were conducted to assess the electrocatalytic properties of the trimetallic CoCuFe-LDH/G and its binary counterparts to investigate how each component affected the electrochemical performance and HER activity. The onset potential and Tafel slope were selected as the basis for characterising the catalytic performance of the materials. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of CoCuFe-LDH/G composites for HER are shown in Figure 1. It can be observed that the trimetallic Co [1.5] Cu [3] Fe [3] -LDH/G [10] shows the lowest onset potential at -0.39 V with a Tafel slope of 76.58 mV dec -1 , compared to its binary counterparts. While CuFe-LDH/G shows the highest onset potential (-0.52 V) and Tafel slope (115.56 mVdec -1 ), indicating that Co plays an important role in the HER performance. Furthermore, the trimetallic composite demonstrated favourable electronic properties, with a charge transfer resistance (R CT ) of 486.6 Ω, and exhibited good stability without significant loss of catalytic activity over 24 h. Therefore, this study provides a facile and efficient strategy to design a trimetallic LDH electrocatalyst combined with graphene, demonstrating that the conductive nanoflake structure established by graphene provides a sufficient electron supply to the composite during the electrocatalytic process, enhancing the HER activity.

H2 and O2 evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost‐effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three‐component photocatalyst, Co(5%)‐HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 (Co), to achieve the decoupling of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous O2 and H2 evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.

In the context of Acute Pulmonary Edema (APE), the old school moto was LMNOP, for "Lasix-Morphine-Nitrates-Oxygen-Positive Pressure". However, this mnemonic, while not entirely inaccurate, deserves revision or at least a slight reinterpretation. APE remains a well-known condition in emergency departments, with a high mortality rate. Despite its prevalence, management recommendations have seen minimal evolution over the past four decades, with references dating back to a 1974 article in the New England Journal of Medicine that already advocated for the triplet of Lasix-Oxygen-Nitrates, a recommendation still present in the 2021 ESC guidelines. In this article, we will discuss the management and potential updates in the treatment of this common pathology.

Introduction Widespread commercialization of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers requires significant cost reduction. A large amount of platinum metal group (PGM) loading is a primary factor in increasing the electrolyzer cost 1 . In particular, Ir catalysts and Pt coating on the porous transport layer (PTL) are necessary for the anode. Our research group has developed the Ir catalyst-integrated PTL by increasing the surface area of Ti-based PTL with surface treatment and coating Ir on the PTL, as shown in Fig. 1 2–4 . Ir catalysts directly deposited on the PTL also act as a protective coating to prevent Ti oxidation of the PTL. In other words, this alternative anode design has two kinds of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites: the catalyst layer and the Ir coating layer on PTL. Suppose the total amount of iridium in this alternative anode is the same as in the conventional structure, and the electrolysis performance is sufficient. In that case, this alternative anode design can reduce the PGM loading for the conventional platinum coating on PTL. Here, we evaluate the impact of this alternative anode design on the initial cell performance and durability. Experimental Titanium microfiber sheets with a nominal porosity of ca. 70% (Nikko Techno, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were used as the substrates acting as catalyst supports and PTLs. Chemical etching with NaOH solution was performed to increase the surface area of the titanium PTL. First, titanium sheets were etched in an aqueous 1 M NaOH solution at 60 °C for 1 h. After that, the etched titanium sheets were washed under ultra-sonication in 0.01M HNO 3 solution for 30 min and then washed in deionized water at room temperature for 10 min. Heat treatment was then performed at 400 °C in 5% H 2 -N 2 gas for 30 min. The Ir catalyst-integrated PTL was prepared by depositing iridium onto the NaOH-etched titanium sheets via arc plasma deposition. Electrocatalyst paste for the PEM electrolysis cathodes was prepared by dispersing the Pt/C (Pt 46.5 wt.%, TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan), 99.5% ethanol, deionized water, and 5% Nafion solution. IrO 2 electrocatalyst paste for the PEMWE anodes was prepared by dispersing the IrO 2 catalyst (IrO 2 (IV) TYPE II, Tokuriki Honten Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 99.5% ethanol, deionized water, and 5% Nafion solution. Using a spray printing system (Nordson, USA), these anode and cathode electrocatalyst pastes were spray-printed onto the electrolyte membrane (Nafion 212, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, USA). The Ir catalyst-integrated or Pt-coated PTLs were used for the alternative or conventional anode. The durability tests were performed at 1.7 V holding for 100 h. Results and discussion Demonstrating the OER activity of Ir coating on the surface-modified PTL is essential. We compared the electrolysis cell performance using the conventional Pt-coated PTL and the Ir catalyst-integrated PTL. The cell with Ir catalyst-integrated PTL has lower activation overvoltage than conventional Pt-coated PTL. This lower activation overvoltage suggests that the Ir catalyst on the PTL can contribute to the oxygen evaluation reaction. After the durability test, the activation overvoltage of the conventional anode increased, while that of the alternative anode hardly changed. Iridium oxide has one order of magnitude higher electronic conductivity than platinum oxide 5 . Therefore, relatively high electronic conduction between the catalyst layer and the Ir catalyst-integrated PTL could maintain the cell performance.

Vascular plants and metazoans use selective proteolysis of transcription factors to control the adaptive responses to hypoxia, although through distinct biochemical mechanisms. The reason for this divergence is puzzling, especially when considering that the molecular components necessary to establish both strategies are conserved across the two kingdoms. To explore an alternative evolutionary scenario where plants sense hypoxia as animals do, we engineered a three-components system aimed to target proteins for degradation in an oxygen dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. Applying the synthetic biology framework, we produced a hypoxia-responsive switch independent of endogenous pathways. When applied to control transcription, the synthetic system partially restored hypoxia responsiveness in oxygen-insensitive mutants. Additionally, we demonstrated its potential to regulate growth under flood-induced hypoxia. Our work highlights the use of synthetic biology to reprogram signalling pathways in plants, providing insights into the evolution of oxygen sensing and offering tools for crop improvement under stress conditions.

For decades, global warming has posed a significant environmental challenge worldwide, CO 2 generated by human activities is considered to be a major cause of its escalation. Among the methods to convert CO 2 into high value-added chemicals, like carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) and ethanol(C 2 H 5 OH), electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) at a low temperature has gained considerable attention. Nevertheless, given the high reaction barrier, sluggish kinetics, and diverse pathways involved in CO 2 RR, well-designed electrocatalysts are crucial for facilitating reactions and adjusting selectivity for specific products. Copper (Cu) has garnered the most attention in recent years due to its ability to generate hydrocarbons beyond CO owing to its moderate *CO adsorption energy. However, Cu exhibits a low selectivity for specific products with wide range of hydrocarbons and undergoes the hydrogen evolution reaction which competes with CO 2 RR. Incorporation of Cu-based bimetallic alloys can enhance selectivity by regulating the intrinsic active sites of the material to control the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates. Among many secondary metals, post-transition metals such as tin (Sn), indium (In), and bismuth (Bi) have been proven to be active in CO 2 RR alone, and studies have reported that combining them with Cu selectively produces CO and HCOO - . While antimony (Sb) possessed similar properties, it went unnoticed due to its lack of CO 2 RR activity alone. However, recent studies have revealed that the addition of a small amount of Sb to Cu results in high CO activity. Electrocatalytic assessments are typically performed using a standard three-electrode H-type cell. Due to the limited accessibility of CO 2 by the catalyst, constrained by the solubility of CO 2 (approximately ~34 mM at ambient conditions), the highest achievable operating current density is capped at around ~20 mA cm −2 . In a gas diffusion electrode system, gaseous CO 2 is fed directly to the catalyst, enabling rapid mass transport of CO 2 . Among these methods, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer offers enhanced efficiencies owing to the reduced ohmic resistance inherent in their zero-gap design. In a MEA electrolyzer, the membrane is sandwiched between the cathode and anode catalyst layers on each side. During operation, the cathodic side receives humidified CO 2 but no flowing electrolyte. The anode is typically fed an alkaline electrolyte and commonly consists of a carbon gas diffusion layer with deposited IrO x nanoparticles to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction. Here in, a series of bimetallic Cu X Sb 10-X (X = 0, 2, 5, 8, 10) catalysts with adjustable compositions for CO 2 RR was prepared. Cu X Sb 10-X catalysts were synthesized via direct co-electrodeposition onto a gas diffusion layer (MPL/CP) under the room temperature. Characterization reveals that Cu X Sb 10-X catalysts have a typical morphology consisting of nano-sized particles with well-dispersed Cu and Sb. CO 2 RR tests were performed in a gas flow MEA single cell using humidified gaseous CO 2 and anion exchange membrane (AEM). Unlike Pristine Cu, Cu 5 Sb 5 and Cu 8 Sb 2 , which have major composition of Cu, show CO (72.4%) as a main product at 3.0 V cell . Meanwhile, Cu 2 Sb 8 exhibits enhanced selectivity for CH 4 (49.7%) with a partial current density of 152.1 mA cm -2 , at 3.6 V cell despite pristine Sb having an inability to produce any CO 2 RR product. We assume that Cu serves as the main active site in this catalyst. At the same time, the CO 2 RR selectivity shifts towards CH 4 when the site of Cu decreases and becomes isolated near Sb. Later, in situ Raman spectroscopy will be used to reason that the Cu-Sb interface in Cu weakens the binding energy of *CO. Also, Sb surrounding isolated Cu in Cu 2 Sb 8 promotes the CO 2 RR to CH 4 through enhancing the binding energy of *CHO which is key intermediate of CH 4 reaction pathway.

We study the energy dependence of the total and diffractive neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus cross sections at very high energies. The calculation employs the QCD dipole model and the small-$x$ nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. We show the sensitivity of the nuclear effect quantification on the nuclear setup, and predict up to $\sim 10\%$ nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-oxygen scattering stemming from the nonlinear evolution. Diffractive contribution to the total scattering is small, which is only few percentage. The $\left|q\bar{q}g\right>$ componnent of the $W^{\pm}$ boson is found to contribute significantly to the diffractive process, which reaches up to $\sim 40\%$ of the diffractive cross section.

We applied a highly accurate Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to obtain thermodynamic data for various water-nitrogen clusters. In combination with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and wavefunction analysis, we proposed a theoretical pathway for the evolution of nitrogen-water cation clusters, offering insights into the formation of oxidative environments. Our calculations reveal that nitrogen molecules can form weak bonds with certain hydrogen-oxygen cations, stabilizing key intermediates during hydroxyl radical transfer. This interaction alters the cluster’s evolution. Our findings show a clear map of how nitrogen-water cluster cations evolute and give radicals or other active redox reactants.

Hydrogen production through water electrolysis will play a central role to obtain a sustainable energy carrier. Although the community targets to operate at high current density (>1 A cm − 2 ) to reduce the production cost, the intense operation forms massive gas bubbles leading to detrimental effects on the resultant cell voltage. Gas bubbles may reduce the electrochemical active surface area leading to an increase in kinetic overpotential. The voids in the electrolyte inhibit the ion conduction and the mass transfer. Surface modifications and structuring are often performed on electrodes to control the wettability.[1] In this study, we demonstrate bubble management through electrolyte engineering. Bubble detachment diameters measured in various electrolytes were analyzed through an analytical equation and multiphase fluid dynamics simulations to clarify the major contributions from the electrolytes.[2] The knowledge was further implemented in a homemade zero-gap water electrolyzer to reduce bubble induced ohmic losses. Ni plate was employed as a model electrode to produce oxygen gas bubbles at 50 mA cm − 2 . Electrolyte solutions were various concentrations of alkaline KOH and potassium-based buffer solutions (phosphate, borate, and carbonate) at non-extreme pH levels and room temperature. Bubble detachment diameters measured by a high-speed camera were found to continuously decrease in these electrolyte solutions by increasing the molality. After quantifying the electrolyte properties (density, surface tension and viscosity), the measured bubble diameters were compared with an analytical equation, which considers the force balance between the buoyancy force and the surface tension force on a textured surface,[3] to clarify the contributions from the electrolytes and the electrode surface to determine the diameters. The density of buffer solutions significantly increases in the concentrated solutions, which helps to reduce the diameter due to the buoyancy force. The deconvoluted surface contribution was also found to help reducing the diameter in the dense solutions. The electrode surface may be reconstructed during the oxygen evolution in the concentrated conditions, which was also inferred from contact angle measurements after the reactions. The analytical bubble detachment diameter is just derived from the force balance on a bubble at static condition. To cover the viscous force, which appears during the deformation of fluids, numerical simulations using volume of fluid method were performed. In viscous solutions and at high gas inlet assuming high current density, the diameters were found to increase indicating that the viscous force is working on the bubbles towards the electrode surface. Having clarified the major roles from electrolytes in the bubble detachment diameter, ohmic resistance in a homemade zero-gap water electrolyzer was investigated (schematics in Figure 1). NiMoO x on Ni felt (0.2 mm thick), NiFeO x on Ni felt and hydrophilic polyethersulfone (PES, 0.14 mm thick, porosity of 80%) were used as a cathode, an anode, and a porous separator, respectively, in various molality of potassium carbonate solutions at pH 10.5 and 80 °C. Uncompensated resistances were obtained from high-frequency intersects in Nyquist plots obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopies at an open circuit voltage (OCV) and a potential at 800 mA cm − 2 . A volcano trend of the resistance at OCV (blue bars in Figure 1) reflects the bulk electrolyte conductivity.[4] Notably, additional resistance (red bars in Figure 1) was observed at 800 mA cm − 2 indicating the inhibition of ion conduction due to the presence of massive gas bubbles in the stacked structure. The increment of resistance at 800 mA cm − 2 also exhibited a volcano trend. The ratio of resistances between OCV and 800 mA cm − 2 reflects how the effective ion conduction path was inhibited by the void fraction due to the gas bubbles.[5] The estimated void fractions also demonstrated the volcano trend as a function of the solute molality. Its decreasing trend agreed with the detachment diameters from the Ni plate model electrode discussed above indicating that the quantitative understanding of the bubble dynamics is also effective to reduce the ohmic losses.[2] Accumulation of gas bubbles were indeed observed by the high-speed camera using a transparent dialyzer separator which was closely stacked with NiMoO x /Ni cathode. Overall, our study demonstrates the significance of the electrolyte engineering to control the gas bubbles and the resultant losses. Reference [1] R. Iwata, et al., Joule, 2021, 5, 887. [2] H.

Flow reactors are an attractive process for a variety of applications in the chemical industry. This is due to advantages over batch processes, such as good scalability and constant product quality with precisely controllable reaction conditions. [1] Regarding the industrial transition towards a climate-friendly and CO 2 -neutral economy, electrolysis and electrosynthesis processes are a focus of current research. These make it possible to use electricity from renewable energies directly and at the same time fulfil several criteria of green chemistry [2]. However, they currently often require the use of platinum group metals (PGM) and need separators that are mostly based on perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) [3]. In addition, conventional electrolysis processes used to produce green hydrogen require high overvoltage. These can be traced back to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, oxygen is not a value-added product. For these reasons, there is increasing interest in coupled systems in which the sluggish OER is replaced by a thermodynamically more efficient reaction that also generates a value-added product. One possibility for this is the electrooxidation of biobased 5-HMF to the platform chemical 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) [4]. A theoretical cell voltage of 0.3 V is required for the FDCAER/HER, whereas the OER/HER requires 1.23 V [5]. [6] The simultaneous production of platform chemicals and green H 2 by paired electrolysis is a promising approach to enable sustainable and energy-efficient systems. Currently, this technology is still in the development stage and studies have so far focused on batch cell trials. [4,5,7] However, the use of flow reactors can further reduce overvoltage’s. This is due to factors such as better mass transport, an optimized reactor-volume/electrode ratio and minimized electrode gaps. In addition, more stable process conditions and a simplified scale-up point in favor of transferring to a flow system as early as possible [8,9]. [4–14] In previous experiments H-cell experiments for electrochemical 5-HMF conversion to FDCA were carried out on nickel base materials [14]. On this foundation, a modular flow-through test cell was developed on a laboratory scale and the feasibility of coupled electrolysis in the flow reactor in recirculating operation was investigated. Particular attention was paid to mild operating conditions (e.g. mild alkaline environment, low operating pressures and low temperatures). For this purpose, polarization curves followed by bulk electrolysis were recorded and the 5-HMF conversion was monitored analytically using UV-VIS. The measurements were carried out on Ni-foam. Subsequently, experiments were carried out to switch from recirculation mode to single-pass operation. For this purpose, Ni-foam and NiOOH foam electrodes were prepared electrochemically and investigated at different flow rates, current densities, and reactant concentrations in the flow cell. The bulk electrolysis was accompanied by analysis (HPLC, UV-VIS) to quantify and classify the derivatives of the electrosynthesis process. These experiments yielded important results about the system, which enabled operational adjustments and a scale-up. In general, this research is advancing the development of efficient and sustainable energy sources and the synthesis of platform molecules using renewable raw materials in a hydrogen co-electrolysis.

Seawater batteries (SWBs) are emerging as the next generation of energy storage systems owing to their high potential energy densities. However, they suffer from low practical energy densities. Utilizing an open-structured cathode that utilizes the unlimited supply of sodium ions from seawater, SWBs are inherently limited in energy density owing to the capacity of the anode. To maximize the amount of active material in a limited anode space, efforts with highly loaded electrodes present challenges in terms of sufficient reversibility, while liquid electrodes have low capacity, requiring alternative methods. To enhance the energy density of the SWB anode, this study used the “redox targeting” method, which has been used to enhance the energy density in redox flow battery systems. Redox targeting was achieved by combining a hard carbon (HC) active material with a sodium biphenyl (Na-BP) redox mediator in a semi-liquid electrode (SLE) form. Na-BP has a potential of approximately 0.09 V compared to sodium, while hard carbon has a reaction potential ranging from 0 V to 2 V. During the manufacturing process, the sodium source and electrons of Na-BP are transferred to hard carbon spontaneously. Morphological analysis of the HC in the synthesised SLE was carried out using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy elemental mapping, which showed that the sodium is uniformly distributed throughout the HC particles. During manufacturing, sodium and electrons were transferred effectively from Na-BP to HC. Ex-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm the structure of the HC of SLE after the charging and discharging process. The d-spacing between the graphite layers in the HC of SLE as-synthesis is approximately 3.7 Å, which is similar to the d-spacing of the pristine HC. However, the d-spacing of the HC after the SLE is fully charged increases to 4.3 Å. Conversely, the d-spacing of the hard carbon in the fully discharged SLE is reduced, similar to its initial as-synthesized state. In general, HC undergoes an intercalation reaction, causing an increase in d-spacing when sodium is stored between the layers of graphite. Sodium is reversibly intercalated and extruded into the HC of the SLE system. In a seawater battery half-cell system that uses a sodium ferrocyanide aqueous solution as the cathodic redox material, the electrochemical performance of the SLE during galvanostatic charge-discharge was compared with the theoretical voltage of 3.07 V. When operated at a current density of 10 mA gHC -1 (equivalent to 0.55 mA cm -2 ), the SLE showed a charging voltage of 3.2 V and a discharging voltage of 2.9 V. The cycling performance of the SLE was evaluated under various states of charge (SOC) at a current density of 20 mA gHC -1 . The SLE demonstrated reversibility for 20 cycles with a capacity equivalent to 33.3 mAh cm -2 at an SOC of 100% and 75 cycles with a capacity equivalent to 22.2 mAh cm -2 at an SOC of 66.6%. The Coulombic efficiency was over 92.5%, and the energy efficiency was approximately 80%. Notably, the reversible capacity of 11.1 mAh cm -2 with a SOC of 33.3% was maintained for over 500 cycles, indicating the potential for over 5000 h of operation. After evaluating the electrochemical performance of the SWB half-cell system (using the sodium ferrocyanide catholyte), the SLE was applied to a full-cell system of the SWB via the oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR), which utilizes dissolved oxygen from natural seawater. At a current density of 10 mA gHC -1 , the HCBP-SLE exhibited a charging voltage ranging from 3 V to 3.6 V and a discharging voltage ranging from 3.2 V to 2.5 V. The electrochemical performance was evaluated at a capacity of 33.3 mAh cm -2 , which corresponds to an SOC of 100%, and exceeded 98.2% Coulombic efficiency and approximately 80% energy efficiency over 15 cycles. Therefore, it was confirmed that reversible operation with a high areal capacity is feasible even under natural seawater conditions. A semi-liquid electrode was produced utilizing an HC active material and an Na-BP redox mediator and then applied to seawater batteries. The semi-liquid electrode approach utilized a redox mediator to facilitate charge transfer, allowing energy storage in the active solid material. When applied to a SWB half-cell system, reversible operation for 20 cycles at an areal capacity of 33.3 mAh cm -2 and stable operation for more than 500 cycles (5000 h) at an areal capacity of 11.1 mAh cm -2 were demonstrated. These results can be employed to achieve high energy densities not only in seawater batteries but also in other battery systems, such as redox flow batteries or air batteries. Figure 1

Lanthanum strontium ferrite (La0.85–xSr0.15AgxFeO3−δ x = 0; LSFO) and its silver-doped derivative (La0.85–xSr0.15AgxFeO3−δ x = 0.05; LASFO) are synthesized using mild conditions by a sol–gel method. Both oxides present a perovskite-like structure with orthorhombic symmetry due to octahedral tilting; thus, the incorporation of silver in the A-site does not significantly modify the perovskite structure. Exsolution of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from LASFO is induced under mild conditions, resulting in Ag@LSFO samples. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveal that the mechanism of exsolution involves the reduction of Ag+ and the concomitant release of oxygen, without altering the oxidation state of Fe, inducing the formation of oxygen vacancies in the perovskite matrix. Homogeneous distribution of AgNPs on the perovskite matrix is observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The thermal evolution of Ag@LSFO proceeds through the progressive increase in oxygen vacancies that become thermally disordered. The study clarifies the mechanism of silver exsolution and the structural changes in lanthanum–strontium ferrite perovskites, providing insights into their potential use in catalytic and energy-related applications.

Low-to-intermediate temperature processing and use of mixed conducting oxides targets the following potential benefits: ultra-fine nanostructuring with avoidance of coarsening, control of surface chemistry, lower energy consumption, integration with thermally sensitive components, and slower degradation vs. conventional high temperature synthesis and use. In this lower temperature regime, we have pursued two routes for non-equilibrium control of defect chemistry and therefore properties of mixed ionic/electronic conductors (MIECs) in the ferrite perovskite family: crystallization and illumination. Room-temperature growth followed by mild anneals to induce crystallization has proven to yield superior oxygen surface exchange kinetics, attributed to development of facile charge transfer and pristine surface chemistry in our prior work. The close link between crystallinity and oxygen stoichiometry appears to play an important role in the structural evolution and electrical response. However the effect of evolving crystallinity on the ionic conductivity has not been studied in-depth. Therefore we recently pursued an approach combining in-situ synchrotron grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction with ac and dc electrical methods on thin-film blocking electrode cells to evaluate evolution of transference numbers during crystallization. In certain ferrite films we observe a ~2 orders-of-magnitude increase in ionic conductivity during crystallization, while the electronic conductivity increases much more. Through the process, we demonstrate that it is possible to turn a predominantly ionic conductor into a predominantly electronic conductor - and to access almost any ionic transference number in between - simply by controlling the degree of crystallinity. [1] Oxygen stoichiometry can alternatively be controlled at low-to-intermediate temperatures through application of low fluence above-gap illumination. We have shown in certain non-dilute ferrite films that UV light causes oxygen to enter the films from the gas phase with kinetics limited by the oxygen surface-exchange reaction, which is largely unchanged by the presence of excited carriers. We explain the response through simulations of excited state defect equilibria and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements. [2] Together these processing strategies indicate that low-temperature control of oxygen stoichiometry is feasible in mixed conductors, enabling wide tailoring of properties and potential for use in low-to-intermediate temperature solid-state ionic devices.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM-WE) stands out as a promising method for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources. Unlike proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM-WE), AEM-WE offers the advantage of nonprecious metal catalysts due to mild alkaline conditions, while still enabling a compact cell design and operation under differential pressure. Remarkable performances of AEM-electrolysis cells have been demonstrated in literature, achieving current densities of up to 7.68 A·cm −2 [1], surpassing the record current density of PEM-WE at 6 A·cm −2 [2], both measured at 80 °C and 2 V. However, challenges related to efficiency and stability persist and demand effective solutions to unlock the full potential of AEM-WE. In order to achieve this, cell components, particularly the membrane, catalysts, and electrode structure have to be improved and advanced measurement techniques have to be applied. Different measurement tools serve to characterize, separate, and quantify the dynamic processes inherent in AEM-WE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) serves as a valuable non-destructive, in-situ diagnostic tool for electrochemical cells, enabling the differentiation of various phenomena based on their respective relaxation times. Moreover, EIS enables the quantification of loss mechanisms thereby facilitating a targeted optimization of electrolysis components and the identification of weaknesses limiting long-time stability. Despite its utility, the broad use of EIS is hindered by its complex interpretation. The widely applied approach of fitting equivalent circuit models (ECMs) aims to extract quantitative data from the semi-circular shapes observed in Nyquist plots. However, the assumption of a physico-chemical meaningful ECM is challenging without prior knowledge of the number, size, and time constants of appearing loss mechanisms. Furthermore, the potential for multiple ECMs to fit one and the same experimental result introduces ambiguity, leading to potential misinterpretations of data. An alternative approach to analyse EIS spectra involves converting the measured data into the time (τ) domain and characterize the different mechanisms based on their characteristic relaxation times. The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis has already been applied across diverse electrochemical systems, spanning from solid oxide fuel cells (SO-FC) and PEM fuel cells (PEM-FC) to PEM water electrolysis and AEM fuel cells (AEM-FC). However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, DRT analysis of AEM-WE is still absent in literature. In this study we present a thorough investigation of an AEM-WE single-cell, employing a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the equivalent circuit model (ECM). Notably, we demonstrate the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis at AEM-WE cells for the first time, utilizing a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as a reference. Through half-cell EIS measurements and subsequent DRT spectra analysis, anodic and cathodic half-cell reactions are clearly identified and quantified. The DRT analysis differentiates five loss mechanisms within the AEM-WE system, encompassing the hydrogen evolution reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, and ionic transport losses within the catalyst layers. By systematically varying operating parameters, we successfully attribute DRT peaks to their respective physicochemical origins. These findings provide valuable insights into the electrochemical processes within the AEM-WE single-cell, significantly advancing our understanding of underlying mechanisms. In fig. 1, we investigate the degradation of AEM-WE single cells through long-term experiments. Periodic EIS measurements enable an in-operando analysis of catalyst degradation. The impedance data is analysed using ECM and DRT. Ohmic contributions resulting from electric and ionic charge transport are distinguished from polarisation resistances arising from electrochemical reactions. A catalyst degradation is observable in fig 1b & c, where the low frequency resistance (LFR) in the Nyquist plot and the DRT peak area increases over time. However, fig. 1b also reveals the reduction of the high frequency resistance (HFR) resulting in an overall performance increase and voltage decrease. [1] N. Chen, S. Y. Paek, J. Y. Lee, J. H.

While lifetimes of up to 100,000 h have been reported for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), the impact of dynamic operation on PEMWE lifetime requires further investigation [1]. Therefore, accelerated stress tests (ASTs) have been developed to assess degradation effects triggered by dynamic operation on a shorter time scale. Although voltage cycling can be easily employed to focus on catalyst degradation, many operation effects of a real system, such as gas crossover during idle periods, can only be simulated by such tests [2]. Weiß et al. [3] developed an AST comprised of steps at high (3 A cm -2 ) and low (0.1 A cm -2 ) current densities, followed by an idle period at open circuit voltage (OCV) in order to mimic dynamic operation and shutdown of a PEMWE. When operating the cell at differential pressure (absolute pressures of 1 bar | 10 bar in anode/cathode compartment), H 2 permeating through the membrane from the cathode into the anode compartment during the idle periods reduces the surface of the crystalline IrO 2 catalyst (the most commonly used catalyst material for PEMWEs) to metallic Ir. Upon subsequent operation at high current densities and thus potentials, Ir is re-oxidized to an amorphous, hydrous iridium oxide. This amorphous oxide is known to exhibit a higher activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but a lower stability than crystalline IrO 2 [4]. This study aims to investigate the degradation of iridium oxide- and iridium metal-based anode catalyst layers during the above described OCV-AST developed by Weiß et al. [3]. A Pt-coated Ti-PTL is used to mitigate the buildup of contact resistances at the electrode/PTL interface [5]. IrO 2 /TiO 2 - and Ir/TiO 2 -based anode electrodes (with loadings of 1.7 – 1.9 mg Ir cm -2 ) are coated onto a Nafion™ 212 membrane by using the decal transfer method, together with a Pt/C-based cathode (0.3 mg Pt cm -2 ). These membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with the different anode catalysts are tested in 5 cm 2 single-cells for approximately two weeks of intermittent operation. The Ir/TiO 2 catalyst loses its metallic character in the two-week OCV-AST, as evidenced by the loss of hydrogen underpotential deposition features in the cyclic voltammogram (see region I in Fig. 1), which are well-defined at the beginning-of-test (BoT; blue line in Fig. 1) and smeared out at end-of-test (EoT, red line) [6]. Instead, features attributed to hydrous iridium oxide appear (see region II in Fig. 1), as this oxide is grown electrochemically at high potentials [4,6]. The evolution of this redox feature has been reported to also occur with the IrO 2 /TiO 2 catalyst, indicating the transition of the less active crystalline to the amorphous iridium oxide with a higher OER activity [3]. This study aims to deepen the understanding of change in the iridium oxidation state and in its OER activity during intermittent operation as well as its implications on voltage losses. We will further investigate the impact of different operating conditions on the degradation of the two different catalysts.

The increasing urgency to address climate change has propelled the exploration of innovative technologies capable of mitigating its effects. Among these, the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 stands out as a promising solution, leveraging the conversion of CO 2 —a principal greenhouse gas—into valuable chemicals and fuels using electricity. This process is not only pivotal for reducing atmospheric CO 2 levels but also plays a crucial role in steering the global economy towards sustainability and circularity. Unfortunately, there are some critical problems due to the intrinsically produced hydroxide during electrochemical CO 2 reduction. This hydroxide reacts with the reactant CO 2 , leading to various issues. Foremost among these issues is the phenomenon known as carbonate crossover, wherein carbonate ions permeate through the anodic side. The permeated carbonates contaminate and drop the pH of the anolyte, which cause the additional electrolyte regeneration process in alkaline condition. In the neutral condition, carbonates are regenerated to CO 2 at the anodic side and then emitted with O 2 from oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which incurs an additional gas separation process. Furthermore, carbonates remaining at the cathode precipitate as salts, resulting in overall performance degradation. To overcome these issues, CO 2 reduction in acidic conditions can serve as a viable alternative. In acidic conditions, hydroxide and (bi)carbonates can revert to CO 2 , especially at cathodic side. Therefore, carbonate crossover is significantly reduced, which in turn eliminates the theoretical limitation of single-pass conversion (SPC) previously capped at 50% in alkaline and neutral conditions. While acidic conditions offer this advantage, they necessitate effective suppression of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this research, we propose a set of design principles aimed at enhancing the selective production of carbon monoxide at high current densities within acidic electrolytic environments, drawing on insights into both the mass transfer dynamics of CO 2 and H + , and the electro-kinetic interactions at the interface. Through a combination of theoretical and empirical studies, it has been determined that the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 in a gas-fed flow cell inherently favors the production of CO over H 2 , primarily due to the reduction of protons in acidic conditions. However, it has also been observed that the reduction of water (H 2 O) adversely affects the selectivity for CO, a challenge that can be substantially mitigated by employing a catalyst that possesses inherently strong activity for CO production. For this purpose, nickel single-atom catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes (Ni-SAC-CNTs) were employed as an exemplary system, demonstrating exceptional performance in CO production. These catalysts achieved a CO Faraday efficiency exceeding 90% under conditions of –100 mA cm -2 and at a pH of 2.0. Furthermore, the introduction of weakly hydrated cations into the electrolyte has been shown to enhance CO selectivity in acidic settings significantly, by facilitating CO 2 RR while concurrently inhibiting the kinetics of the HER. A detailed analysis of the carbon balance during the electrolysis process revealed that the use of Ni-SAC-CNTs not only promotes highly selective CO formation but also substantially diminishes the formation of carbonate ions. This dual effect leads to achieving the highest single-pass conversion of CO 2 to CO, which was recorded at approximately 77%. It is notable that it was achieved without the need for adjusting local reaction conditions within the electrochemical system. This study not only demonstrates the effectiveness of Ni-SAC-CNTs in improving the selectivity and efficiency of electrochemical CO 2 reduction in acidic environments but also provides a blueprint for further development of catalyst systems that could be adapted for industrial applications. The insights gained into the interaction between catalyst properties, electrolyte composition, and operational conditions open up new avenues for the deployment of CO 2 reduction technologies in sectors where acidic waste streams are prevalent. Moving forward, transitioning CO 2 reduction from merely lab-scale experiments to practical applications necessitates its implementation in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems. In MEA operations, challenges such as carbonate crossover and salt formation emerge as significant obstacles. However, by applying acidic conditions within MEA systems and employing strategic system engineering, these issues can be effectively addressed. We will also present our current research process, which has demonstrated efficiency levels that surpass those of studies published to date, showcasing the potential of our approach in real-world applications. Through this, we hope our study contributes valuable insights within MEA systems, offering a viable pathway to overcome the limitations of current technologies. By enhancing the scalability, efficiency, and stability of electrochemical CO 2 reduction, our work not only advances the field but also aligns with global efforts to combat climate change and foster a sustainable future Figure 1

Understanding deduced from multiscale simulations have benefited the advancement of materials for solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells (SOCs) over the past decades. This in particular includes ion transport and defect properties of materials. A remaining key gap is predicting the atomic structure and chemistry of the complex oxides, that is the surface phase diagrams under functional conditions of SOCs. In particular, perovskite oxides that serve as cathode and anode form complex surfaces at elevated temperatures and under varying oxygen chemical potentials. I will share perspectives and progress from the field, including our work, that integrate first principles, machine learning, thermodynamic and grand canonical Monte Carlo calculations to predict surface phases under relevant anodic and cathodic conditions. Being able to predict surface phases will allow us to also interpret and predict the performance of the material, as key reactions in SOCs (oxygen reduction/evolution, water splitting) take place at these surfaces.

From the viewpoint of energy density, Li metal-based batteries, such as Li-S batteries and Li-air batteries, are the most attractive candidates for next-generation batteries. However, as is well known, Li metal negative electrode faces critical problems for practical use. First of all, the deposition and dissolution potential of Li is the lowest and Li itself is very reactive, so it reacts immediately with substances in the electrolyte to form a surface film, so-called SEI (solid electrolyte interphase). In commercially available batteries, the decomposition of the electrolyte is self-terminating due to the SEI. However, degradation of the electrolyte will proceed if the decomposition reaction of the electrolyte is not suppressed by the SEI. Next, the Li deposition is non-uniform, resulting in dendrite formation and causing a short circuit. Furthermore, the most serious problem is that an explosion or other catastrophic incidents could occur in the event of the short circuit due to the extreme flammability of the conventional electrolyte. Therefore, it is essential to design Li metal batteries so that they do not burn even if a short circuit occurs. Various attempts are underway to increase their safety. The simplest and clearest approach toward safety is to replace the flammable electrolyte with a non-flammable electrolyte, and there has also been vigorous research into flame-retardant electrolytes or additives from this strategy. For example, ionic liquids and organophosphorus compounds are well-known. Although the applicability of various types of ionic liquids to Li metal batteries has been studied, ionic liquids still have challenges such as their high viscosity and cost. Various organophosphorus compounds have been also proposed. Among them, phosphoric esters such as trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and triethyl phosphate (TEP) well known as flame retardant additives for plastics are suitable for electrolyte solvents from viewpoints of their high dielectric constant, high salts’ solubility, relatively low viscosity and wide liquid temperature range. The problem with phosphoric ester electrolytes is essentially the low reductive electrochemical stability and resultant low reversibility of Li deposition and dissolution. Normally, favorable SEI formation is unlikely to be formed in phosphoric ester electrolytes. It is well known that anions of Li salts are involved in SEI formation. Matsuda et al. recently reported that the oxygen evolution reaction during charging occurs efficiently in TEP electrolyte with 1M or 3M LiNO 3 at the positive electrode of Li-air batteries (1). The effect of LiNO 3 on improving the reversibility of Li deposition and dissolution in phosphoric ester electrolytes is also expected. The author has previously investigated the effect of current density on the morphological variation of electrodeposited Li (2-3). However, there are few studies dealing with the effects of current density on morphological change of Li electrodeposited in phosphoric ester electrolytes in detail. In this study, Li electrodeposition was conducted in phosphoric ester electrolytes with lithium difluorophosphate (LiPO 2 F 2 ) compared to commonly used LiPF 6 or lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as a salt. The author found that LiPO 2 F 2 is relatively well soluble in phosphoric esters up to about 2 M while it has only 1% solubility in ordinary carbonate ester solvents and improves the reversibility of lithium deposition and dissolution as shown in Fig. 1. In the TEP electrolyte with LiTFSI, unlike LiPO 2 F 2 , the appearance of fibrous morphology of electrodeposited Li was observed above a certain current density, as shown in the SEM images of Fig. 2. The morphology was considered to be one reason for lowering the reversibility in the case of LiTFSI or LiPF 6 . This study presents the morphological variations of electrodeposited Li depending on current densities and Li metal battery characteristics using phosphoric ester electrolytes based on LiPO 2 F 2 /TEP with or without ethylene carbonate, LiPF 6 or LiNO 3 as film-forming agent or supplemental agent for the conductivity. In addition, the result of the flammability test of the newly developed electrolyte will be shown. References (1) S. Matsuda and H. Asahina, J. Phys. Chem. C , 124 , 25784-25789 (2020). (2) T.

Quaternary stable isotope records of marine and lacustrine carbonate deposits as well as speleothems were extensively studied to reconstruct global and regional climatic evolution. This study demonstrates how stable isotope records of travertine provide fundamental information about climate and the consequences of its evolution on groundwater level fluctuations. The deposition of the Lapis Tiburtinus travertine succession occurred during the Late Pleistocene (150–30 ka), coeval with the last activity of the Colli Albani volcanic complex. Two boreholes (Sn1 and Sn2) were drilled into the Acque Albule Basin (23 km E of Rome), crossing the entire Lapis Tiburtinus succession. The Sn1 borehole in the central part of the basin crosscuts a travertine succession of 62.1 m in thickness, while the Sn2 borehole in the southern part of the basin is characterized by a travertine succession 36.3 m in thickness. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios were analysed on 118 samples (59 samples both for Sn1 and Sn2 boreholes) representative of the entire Lapis Tiburtinus travertine succession crossed by the boreholes. Values, measured and correlated in the two drilled boreholes, permitted determination of the sensitivity of the travertine depositional system to glacial and interglacial cycles, unravelling the complex oxygen and carbon cycle dynamic recorded in such sedimentary succession. Moreover, the results obtained correlated with available pollen curves of the Mediterranean area (from the Castiglione crater, 25 km E of Rome). Regional and global oxygen isotope continental and marine curves, calibrated with the stratigraphy of the Acque Albule Basin, and available U/Th dating allow the identification of at least three phases of the last interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 5-MIS5). The carbon isotope record, compared with CO2 flux reconstructed and associated with the volcanic activity of the Colli Albani volcanic complex, instead shows an influence from groundwater level changes. In particular, positive shifts that occurred during arid phases are associated with a lower groundwater level and increased CO2 degassing, inducing a major fractionation effect on carbon isotopes. Instead, the negative shifts occurring during more humid periods indicate the inhibition of CO2 degassing and increase in pressure, attesting to a rise in groundwater level. In this view, travertine deposits, frequently studied to define the tectonic setting and activity of the area where they develop, can thus also be used as a tool to understand climate changes and groundwater variations apparent in their stable oxygen and carbon isotope signature.

Water electrolysis is the most practical and mature technique to produce green hydrogen. In addition to its efficiency, its durability also influences the production cost of hydrogen. The major concern is the durability of anodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are exposed to highly oxidative and acidic/alkaline environments at elevated temperatures. Additionally, intermittent operation is expected when coupled with renewable electricity, which leads to severe potential shifts on the electrodes during turning on and off. In this study, the stability of benchmark electrocatalysts, NiFeO x , was evaluated during on/off cycles in various electrolytes including commercially used highly alkaline solution (7 M KOH) at 80 °C. The NiFeO x showed a significant degradation particularly during on/off operation in 7 M KOH for 80 h. A protocol for on/off test was constructed based on the reported protocol, [1] which is intended to reproduce power-on and power-off conditions repeated in a short period of time. At the beginning of a unit cycle, chronopotentiometry (CP) was conducted at 600 mA cm −2 for 30 s to perform OER followed by a potential sweep to 0.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to reproduce the sudden voltage drop. The power-off condition is reproduced by chronoamperometry (CA) at 0.3 V RHE for 30 s. The degradation of the electrocatalyst was evaluated by steady state CP and cyclic voltammetry (CV) every 100 cycles. These operations are defined as one set, and continued till the catalytic performance obviously changes. The electrolyte was refreshed every 24 or 48 h before the electrolyte concentration changed due to evaporation. A benchmark NiFeO x electrocatalyst was deposited on a Ni foam by reported hydrothermal method. [2] Using the three-electrode system, NiFeO x durability tests were conducted in 1 M KOH at 298 K and 7 M KOH at 353 K. In 1 M KOH at 298 K, the potential to reach 600 mA cm −2 remained relatively constant even after 3000 on/off cycling (Figure 1). Although the initial potential in 7 M KOH was superior to that in 1 M KOH, the potential in 7 M KOH continuously increased with cycles and reached the OER potential using Ni foam substrate. We note that, during constant current operation at 600 mA cm − 2 , the potential remained stable at 1.47 V RHE for 80 h indicating that a redox reaction of material itself during the potential sweep causes the degradation of NiFeO x . The volume change between Ni(OH) 2 and NiOOH may cause a mechanical stress and promote the loss of catalyst into the electrolyte. Indeed, the Ni redox peak in CV and double layer capacitance sharply dropped within 5 h. A severe increase of the potential was observed when the electrolyte was replaced after 24 h. Fe in NiFeO x is considered to be the active site for OER. [3] The degradation in 7 M KOH may come from the formation of soluble Fe complex ions between the hydroxide and iron, [4] which is favored in the highly alkaline solution leading to the dissolution in the electrolyte. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectra (ICP-OES) measurements performed on the spent electrolytes showed that the Fe continued to dissolve in the electrolyte (purple diamond symbol in Figure 1). At the end of the test, 1.2 mg of the Fe was lost, which corresponds to 80 % of that in the original catalyst (1.4 mg). To further reveal the degradation behavior, the electrolyte was saturated with Fe(NO 3 ) 3 , and durability tests were conducted at 80 °C. It was found that the potential was maintained at around 1.53 V RHE in the solution saturated with Fe(NO 3 ) 3 , even after replacing the electrolyte (closed symbol), indicating that severe deactivation was due to the loss of Fe species. However, the initial degradation to 1.53 V RHE still occurred even in the presence of the extra ferric ions, which may come from the mechanical stress due to the potential sweeping. The present results demonstrate the importance to investigate the stability at industrially relevant harsh conditions rather than the standard laboratory condition. Step-by-step clarification of the degradation mechanism would help to reveal the limitation and to develop highly durable electrocatalysts. Figure 1

Solid acid electrolysis cells (SAECs), operating at intermediate temperatures (150-300 °C), has potentials to perform electrochemical conversions using renewable energy resources with a small cell voltage. One of the examples is a steam electrolysis to produce hydrogen and oxygen. The composite of CsH 2 PO 4 solid acid and SiP 2 O 7 matrix is a popular proton-conducting electrolyte in SAECs. The formation of CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 at the interface of CsH 2 PO 4 and SiP 2 O 7 provides high conductivity in a wide temperature range from 150 °C to 250 °C. [1] However, CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 becomes a liquid phase above 150 °C with a strong acidity, which leads to a low mechanical strength of the electrolyte and a fast cell degradation. In this study, SiO 2 precursor was explored to obtain a SiP 2 O 7 matrix, which reduced the generation of CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 in the composite and improved the stability of steam electrolysis. Additionally, the cell voltage was greatly reduced by modifying Aquivion proton conducting ionomer on a IrO 2 /Ti anode, which is likely due to the increasing OER (oxygen evolution reaction) active sites on the IrO 2 surface. Commonly used SiP 2 O 7 was prepared from a fumed silica which has a particle size of 3 nm and a surface area of 395 m 2 /g. [1] Firstly, the chronopotentiometry test was conducted using the traditional CsH 2 PO 4 /SiP 2 O 7 electrolyte (molar ratio: 1/2) at 250 °C, the cell voltage rapidly increased after operating for 3 hours (Figure 1. black curve). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed TiP 2 O 7 generated on the IrO 2 /Ti anode after the test, suggesting that the corrosion of Ti anode substrate by the strong acid of CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 might be the reason for cell degradation. The liquid CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 in the electrolyte also caused a severe deformation of the electrolyte pellet, highlighting the necessity to control the amount of CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 in the electrolyte. The SiO 2 precursor was replaced to the one with particle size of 200 nm and a surface area of 10 m 2 /g while adjusting the heating time during SiP 2 O 7 synthesis. The resultant SiP 2 O 7 matrix contained a high proportion of hexagonal crystal structure (SiP 2 O 7 -hex). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) results exhibit that the SiP 2 O 7 -hex has a larger particle size and a lower hygroscopicity compared to the traditional SiP 2 O 7 . Chronopotentiometry tests was conducted for CsH 2 PO 4 /SiP 2 O 7 -hex electrolyte with small doping (16%) of CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 on the electrolyte surface to ensure a good contact between the electrolyte and the electrode. The steam electrolysis was stably operated for more than 20 hours (red curve in Figure 1), and the electrolyte pellet maintained its original shape after the test. These results suggest that SiP 2 O 7 -hex has a low reactivity with CsH 2 PO 4 under humidified conditions, which limits the generation of liquid phase CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 , and prevents the electrolyte deformation and the cell degradation. However, as seen from Figure 1, the cell voltage increased in the initial stage and finally stabilized at 2 V under only 10 mA cm -2 . It is reported that both CsH 5 (PO 4 ) 2 and CsH 2 PO 4 solid acid migrate towards the anode side during OER. [2,3] Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed that the Cs salt almost fully covered the IrO 2 after the test, which might lead to the high cell voltage. Initially, there were abundant triple phase interfaces (gas-electrolyte-IrO 2 interface) where H 2 O and O 2 can be effectively transported. However, as the solid acid migrated on the IrO 2 surface with time, the effective gas diffusion pathway was blocked, and the cell voltage gradually increased. By modifying the IrO 2 /Ti with Aquivion, which is a popular ionomer used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) to provide proton pathways and improve water management on the electrode, the cell voltage at 10 mA cm -2 was decreased to 1.6 V. The achievable current density also increased from 30 mA cm -2 to 50 mA cm -2 . It is hypothesized that the modification of Aquivion on IrO 2 helps to maintain the active sites at the electrolyte-IrO 2 interface, thus improving the efficiency of steam electrolysis. Overall, this study highlights the significance to control the amount of conductive liquid phase in the solid acid electrolyte and to maintain the accessibility to the electrochemical active sites.

Electrodeposition is considered as a cost-effective, controllable, scalable, and facile process for material deposition[1] and has been widely used in the device fabrication[2-4]. Electrodeposition of high quality rhenium films with improved morphology is enabled in the so called water-in-salt (WIS) electrolyte, where a superhigh concentration of salt, such as LiCl, is present to deplete the free water molecules, reduce the proton diffusion, and suppress the hydrogen evolution side reactions[5]. Yet, inclusion of oxygen and chlorine is observed for the films deposited from such electrolytes. While Cl incorporation may result from high concentration of LiCl, the presence of oxygen can relate to oxide formation due to surface pH increase expected during electrodeposition. Therefore, understanding the surface pH during deposition might provide insight on the Re deposition mechanism and a guideline to further develop the chemistry and process for improved film property. This work aims to measure the electrolyte pH at the electrode surface during Re electrodeposition and to determine the effects of salt speciation and deposition potential on the hydrogen evolution. How the surface pH impacts the impurity incorporation will also be investigated. A customized rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) is utilized to perform the measurement. The Iridium Oxide pH sensing layer is fabricated using electrodeposition method on the Au ring and Re deposition is carried out on the Pt disk. The electrolyte pH during deposition is recorded as the open circuit potential (OCP) on the IrO x ring electrode. The interference of the anions or cations in the solution (other than proton or hydroxide) on the OCP reading is studied and calibrated. In-situ pH change under different solute conditions will be investigated to evaluate the efficacy of salts in suppressing hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, a correlation between surface pH and the incorporation of impurities, especially the oxides, will be studied under different solute environments.

Cell reversal events are based on the hydrogen starvation, that takes place during to fast load changes, blockage of flow field channels or catalyst layer pores by liquid water. During the hydrogen starvation, protons and electrons continue to be supplied to the cathode, which is why carbon oxidation reaction (COR) sets in at the anode. [1] To mitigate the carbon oxidation reaction (COR), various catalyst strategies have been reported in the literature. For instance, the addition of iridium-based co-catalysts such as IrOx promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) instead of the carbon oxidation reaction (COR). [1-5] Although iridium is very costly and scarce, its use can be further increased by atomically mixing it with platinum to form a Pt-Ir alloy.In this work, we have prepared atomically mixed Pt-Ir alloy catalysts that combine both functionalities (hydrogen oxidation reaction and OER) in one nanoparticle (NP) in a unique matter. A colloidal route was chosen to control the particle size and composition of Pt-Ir NPs. The adopted synthesis method is based on the “Co4Cat” concept in methanol. [6] Afterwards, the colloidal NPs with controlled size of 1 – 2 nm and atomic Pt:Ir ratio of 1:1 and 3:1 were deposited on Vulcan XC72 Carbon and characterized by TEM, XPS and XRF techniques.The electrochemical experiments were performed in a three-electrode arrangement using a thin film rotating disc electrode (TF-RDE) technique. 0.1 M HClO 4 was used as electrolyte solution. The ECSA was determined by underpotential deposited hydrogen (Hupd). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed to establish the HOR and OER activity. Thereby, the electrolyte was saturated with H 2 and Ar for HOR and OER measurements, respectively.The PtIr/V and Pt 3 Ir/V catalysts with 1 – 2 nm show values of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 70 ± 2 m 2 g -1 PtIr and 73 ± 3 m 2 g -1 PtIr . The HOR kinetics on platinum – iridium surfaces is very fast in acidic media. Therefore, we could only compare the measured HOR polarization curves with the theoretical diffusion limiting current. Since these are always on top of each other, we can conclude that the Pt-Ir catalysts are very active for HOR. In addition, the OER polarization curves were analyzed and showed an Ir-based mass activity of 70 ± 6 A g -1 Ir for PtIr/V and 104 ± 6 A g -1 Ir for Pt 3 Ir/V at iR-corrected potential of 1.50 V RHE . As a comparison, commercial IrO x shows a mass activity of 47 ± 6 A g -1 Ir at 1.50 V RHE .To investigate the electrochemical reversibility of Pt-Ir alloy catalysts, we alternated between the LSV measurements in the region of HOR and OER at least five times. One cycle includes three LSV measurements under each HOR and OER conditions. The HOR and OER activities for PtIr/V and Pt 3 Ir/V continuously decrease within the 5 cycles between HOR and OER. In other words, after the 5 th cycle the OER mass activity dropped to 28 ± 3 A g -1 Ir and 32 ± 4 A g -1 Ir for PtIr/V and Pt 3 Ir/V catalysts, respectively. However, the ECSA values mainly retain and are 68 ± 2 m 2 g -1 PtIr for PtIr/V and 70 ± 2 m 2 g -1 PtIr for Pt 3 Ir/V.We can sum up that the colloidal Pt-Ir catalysts show bifunctional properties towards HOR and OER and reversible behaviour, which can be helpful to improve the cell reversal tolerance during the H 2 starvation.

1.Introduction Alkaline water splitting, a low-cost and simple hydrogen production method, has been attracting attention to the realization of a sustainable society. However, the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode is high and the hydrogen production efficiency is low. Catalysts containing Fe, Co, and Ni are expected to be promising candidates for electrodes materials [1]. Recently, we succeeded in fabricating FeNi and FeNiCo alloy electrodes covered with a porous metal fluoride film by anodizing, which exhibited better OER activity and durability than OER catalysts [2]. We reported that the metal fluoride films synthesized by anodizing in fluoride-containing organic electrolytes converted to metal oxyhydroxide during OER in KOH aqueous solution. However, the physical properties of the films and electrode characteristics, which are the factors responsible for the high OER activity of this electrode, remain unclear. In this study, various commercial FeNiCo and FeNi alloys (Kovar: Fe-17 mass% Co-29 mass% Ni, 42-Invar: Fe-42 mass% Ni, 45-Permalloy: Fe-45 mass% Ni, 78-Permalloy: Fe-78 mass% Ni) were anodized to fabricate highly active OER electrodes and applied to in-situ Raman spectroscopic characterization to understand the activation mechanism of the anodized alloy electrodes. 2.Experimental Commercial FeCoNi and FeNi alloys were used for electrode preparation. The electrolytes used for anodizing were ethylene glycol containing 0.54 M NH 4 F and 2.5 M H 2 O for Kovar, 45-Permalloy, and 42-Invar, and ethylene glycol containing 0.08 M NH 4 F and 0.02 M H 2 O for 78-Permalloy. The anodizing process was performed at 10 V for 60 min at 293 K in an ethylene glycol-based electrolyte, and platinum was used as the counter electrode. The surface morphology and composition of the OER electrodes were measured using field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In-situ Raman measurements were conducted using laboratory-made cells. The measurement was performed using a three-electrode system with a platinum counter electrode and an Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode under a flow of 1 M KOH aqueous solution at 24.0 mL min -1 . In-situ Raman spectra were measured under potentiostatic conditions every 0.2 V from 1.13 V vs. RHE. 3.Results and discussion 【morphology and compositional characterization】 The surface morphology of the films was highly dependent on the composition of the FeCoNi and FeNi alloys. A uniform and smooth film with an average thickness of 200 nm was observed in the anodized 78-Permalloy electrode, and non-uniform films with an average thickness of 1 µm were observed in the anodized 45-Permalloy and 42-Invar electrodes. The anodized Kovar electrode exhibited a non-uniform and wide crack film with an average thickness of 2.5 µm. The cationic composition of the films was also dependent on the composition of the commercial FeCoNi and FeNi alloys. The anodized 78-Permalloy electrode showed the lowest Fe content in the film. 【Raman measurement】 The ex-situ Raman measurements revealed the presence of mixed phases of spinel oxide and metal oxyhydroxide for all electrodes after OER, indicating that the metal fluoride films were completely converted to metal oxide and metal oxyhydroxide. Then, in-situ Raman measurements were conducted under the controlled potential in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The peak intensity of spinel oxides decreased and that of metal oxyhydroxides increased with increasing applied potential. Because the spinel oxide peaks disappeared and those of metal oxyhydroxide were only observed at the OER onset potential for all electrodes, the in-situ measurements revealed that metal oxyhydroxide is an active phase for OER in the electrolysis system. Interestingly, when the electrode potential was returned to negative, the film structure reverted to the mixed phases of spinel oxide and metal oxyhydroxide. Therefore, we confirmed that the anodized electrodes possess structural reversibility. However, since no trend was observed in the correlation between structural change behaviors and the order of OER activities of the electrodes, other factors would also contribute to OER activities in addition to the formation of the metal-oxyhydroxide structure.

Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is an important chemical in synthetic chemistry with huge demands. Photocatalytic synthesis of H 2 O 2 via oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions (ORR and WOR) is considered as a promising and desirable solution for on‐site applications. However, the efficiency of such a process is low due to the poor solubility of molecular oxygen and the rapid reverse reaction of hydroxyl radicals ( • OH) with hydrogen atoms (H). Here, a strategy is proposed to boost the H 2 O 2 evolution via oxidation of water by employing a H acceptor ( A , nitrocyclohexane), an • OH mediator ( M , dioxane), and a photocatalyst (CdS nanosheets). While • OH radicals are stabilized by dioxane to produce ketyl radicals prior to the formation of H 2 O 2 , H atoms are effectively utilized in the generation of cyclohexanone oxime, an important intermediate in the production of Nylon 6. The system displays a rapid kinetic accumulation of H 2 O 2 (0.13 min −1 ) to a high concentration (6.6 m M ). At optimum reaction conditions, a high quantum efficiency (16.6%) and light‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency (4.9%) can be achieved under 410 nm irradiation.

Ammonia has recently emerged as a promising renewable energy carrier owing to its carbon-free nature and high energy density of 4.3 kW h kg −1 . However, traditional industrial synthesis of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process demands high temperatures (400–500°C) and pressures (100–200 atm), resulting in substantial energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The electrochemical nitrate to ammonia reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) presents a viable alternative to the Haber-Bosch process, although its efficacy is hindered by low reaction performance, particularly due to competitive hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). In this study, we successfully prepared oxygen vacancy-controlled copper oxide (CuO x ) catalysts via a simple plasma treatment. These catalysts were supported on high surface area porous carbon supports co-doped with nitrogen and selenium species to enhance their electrochemical properties. Among these catalysts, the oxygen vacancy-increased CuO x catalyst supported on N,Se co-doped porous carbon (CuO x /NSePC) demonstrated the highest NO 3 RR performance, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87.2% and a yield of 7.9 mg cm -2 h -1 for ammonia production. These results signify significant enhancements in FE and ammonia yield compared to the un-doped or oxygen vacancy-decreased catalysts. The observed high performance can be attributed to an increase in catalytic active sites facilitated by heteroatom doping and weakened N-O bonding strength, enhancing the adsorption of NO 3 - ions on modulated oxygen vacancies. Our findings underscore the importance of co-doping heteroatoms and regulating oxygen vacancies as key factors for enhancing NO 3 RR catalyst performance, offering valuable insights for effective catalyst design. This work presents a novel approach in the realm of electrochemical nitrate reduction for green ammonia production, providing a foundation for the development of high-efficiency metal oxide-based catalysts and extending their applicability to diverse electrochemical reactions Figure 1

Abstract The possibility of reducing energy costs during hydrogen release was realized using a system in which the anodic process of oxygen release was replaced by the process of dissolution of an electronegative metal (aluminum alloy). The rate of hydrogen release on aluminum, among other equal conditions (temperature and concentration of the electrolyte), depends on the polarization of hydrogen release. On aluminum - a metal of the third group of the periodic table of elements, it is high. The dissolution (corrosion) rate of aluminum can be increased by short-circuiting with an electrode with a low hydrogen evolution polarization, such as nickel. The ratio of hydrogen evolution currents on aluminum and nickel was estimated. The effect of alkali concentration and temperature on the current density, polarization and polarizability of electrodes made of aluminum alloy containing Cu, Mg, Mn and Fe was determined. It was shown that in a 0.1 mol l− 1 NaOH solution at a temperature of 20°C, the polarization resistance of hydrogen release on nickel is lower than on aluminum, and the hydrogen release rate on Ni is higher. At high temperatures and sodium hydroxide concentrations, the polarizability of metal dissolution and hydrogen release on aluminum increases sharply and exceeds those on nickel.

This study explores the effects of film thickness and water content on the oxygen permeation properties of ionomers in the cathode catalyst layer of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs) using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The aim is to understand in detail how these parameters influence the efficiency of oxygen transport within the ionomer of the catalyst layer, which is important for optimizing the performance of PEFCs. In this study, we adopt the MD simulation, which computes the time evolution of the positions and velocities of particles based on Newton's equations of motion. In this study, Nafion, commonly used in PEFC, served as the ionomer material, employing a simplified model with 10 sulfonic acid groups per chain to lower computational costs, yet reflecting its actual structural and transport properties[1]. For the oxygen molecule, a model in which the intramolecular force is represented by the Morse potential is used. For the water molecule, the F3C model in which the oxygen and hydrogen atoms move independently and are combined with BOND and ANGLE potentials to form a molecule was used. The number of Nafion chain in the ionomer was changed to 14, 25, and 35 to control the film thickness. From here, the difference of thickness is expressed by Thin, Medium, and Thick. The thicknesses correspond to 3.5 nm, 5.0 nm, and 7.0 nm, respectively. The water content was varied with λ =3, 7, and 11 to investigate the effect of water content in the ionomer on oxygen permeability. Water content is the ratio of the sum of water molecules and hydronium ions to the number of hydrophilic groups in the polymer. In this study, the oxygen permeability of the ionomer membrane was determined using equation (1). The number of atoms in a water cluster that contains the most atoms was determined as the maximum cluster size to analyze the extent to which water clusters expand. Furthermore, a group of water molecules and hydronium ions, in which the distance between the oxygen atoms within the water molecules and hydronium ions is within 3.5 Å, has been defined as a water cluster. 3.5 Å is the end value of the first peak in the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) between the oxygen atoms of the water molecule in the Nafion bulk film. RDF is a function that shows the average density of particles as a function of distance from a specific point. The density distribution of Nafion and water vertical to the platinum interface was calculated to analyze the layer structure of the film. Fig. 1 shows the film thickness dependence of maximum cluster size for each water content condition. The vertical axis of the graph is the common logarithm of the maximum cluster size. For water content λ =3, the maximum cluster size is the highest when the film thickness is Medium. However, for water contents λ =7 and 11, the maximum cluster size increases as the film thickness increases. Fig. 2 shows the film thickness dependence of oxygen permeability for each water content condition. For a water content of λ =3, the oxygen permeability reaches a minimum value when the film thickness is medium, and for water contents of λ =7 and 11, the oxygen permeability decreases as the film thickness increases. Moreover, oxygen permeability decreases with increasing water content across different film thicknesses. Fig. 3 shows the vertical density distribution of water molecules and Nafion at the Pt interface for each film thickness condition at a water content of λ =3. In this graph, the water density has a second and third peak in addition to the first peak above the Pt interface only when the film thickness is Medium, suggesting that a thick layer of water formed near the interface hinders the permeability of oxygen. In addition, when the film thickness is Thick, there are two peaks in water density at the top of the film, suggesting that a layer of water has formed at the top. However, the water layer formed in a thicker film is considered to be more mobile than that on the hydrophilic platinum surface, the effect of the water layer on oxygen permeability is considered to be smaller than that of the water layer formed in the intermediate film thickness. From the above results, designing the catalyst layer to avoid forming water layers near the platinum interface that hinder oxygen permeability is important.

Nitrite and nitrate play pivotal roles in industrial applications, being utilized in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, nylon precursors, explosives, and especially as fertilizer compounds. However, their synthesis primarily relies on the energy-intensive Ostwald process, which operates at high temperatures. Recently, there has been growing interest in producing nitrite and nitrate through the electrooxidation of ammonia. This method shows promise for enabling decentralized small-scale production under mild conditions while directly utilizing renewable energy sources. [1] However, production is currently restricted to low ammonia concentrations (typically 0.1 M) in aqueous systems while requiring high cell voltages. [2,3] An alternative yet unexplored concept is the electrooxidation of liquefied ammonia gas with molecular oxygen. This concept would enable nitrite and nitrate production at lower cell voltages without being restricted to low ammonia concentrations. In fact, the pioneering studies of Allen Bard have demonstrated that cathodic activation of gaseous oxygen in liquefied ammonia is possible. [4] Nonetheless, the possibility of producing nitrite and nitrate in liquefied ammonia has yet to be investigated. By using an autoclave for electrochemistry experiments, we are able to investigate the possibility of nitrite and nitrate synthesis at ammonia equilibrium pressures, elevated temperatures, and different oxygen partial pressures. [5] In a two-electrode configuration, a Pt coil and a Pt sheet (1cm x 1cm) are used as the cathode and anode, respectively. In this work, we utilize the high overpotential of Pt electrodes in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in liquefied ammonia to selectively form active oxygen species via the competitive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The so-formed oxygen species then react with the ammonium-containing electrolyte to form nitrogen oxides. By introducing 30 bars of pressure of O 2 (4%) in Ar, we observed a reduction in the overall cell voltage by approximately 800 mV at current densities of 20 mA cm -2 . After transferring 100 C of charge, ion chromatography (IC) confirms the formation of both nitrite and nitrate with formal faradaic efficiencies of 15% and 41%, respectively. Additional headspace analysis via diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) disproved the formation of significant amounts of gaseous NO x species. Via GC analysis, we confirmed that the ORR successfully suppresses the HER. At the same time, the Faraday efficiency towards the anodic nitrogen evolution (NER) is unchanged, indicating a solely cathodically driven reaction mechanism. To determine the role of in-situ formed water in the reaction mechanism, we conducted experiments examining the impact of water addition. These investigations revealed that adding water is advantageous in the presence of oxygen. However, when water was the exclusive source of oxygen, only trace amounts of nitrite were observed, and no nitrate was formed. This indicates that in-situ-formed water molecules are not the primary active species responsible for the production of nitrite and nitrate. Currently, we further study the reaction mechanism and the influence of different electrolyte salts and ammonium-ion concentrations on the nitrite and nitrate yield. In addition, experiments at various reaction temperatures have been conducted, further improving nitrite and nitrate efficiency. In summary, we present a novel method for the electrochemical formation of nitrite and nitrate in liquefied ammonia under equilibrium pressures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study of this kind. By exploring various reaction parameters, we additionally probe the impact of water content, reaction temperature, and different electrolyte salts on the yields of the nitrogen oxides, thereby advancing our understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism.

Low-temperature water electrolysis with a proton exchange membrane (PEM) enables the production of green hydrogen without direct emissions of CO 2 . Besides the ability to generate hydrogen at elevated pressure and very high current densities, PEM water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) offer a high load flexibility [1]. This facilitates a coupling to renewable energy sources and opens pathways for the large-scale implementation of the PEM water electrolysis technology. Considering the limited supply of iridium, current efforts target reduced iridium loadings and even higher current densities while maintaining high performance, along with the implementation of iridium recycling loops [2]. To nevertheless ensure the durability of iridium-based catalysts over the desired >50,000 hours of PEMWE lifetime, it is crucial to fundamentally understand the various degradation mechanisms as well as lifetime-affecting operating parameters and conditions. Therefore, growing efforts are put into the development of accelerated stress tests (ASTs) to predict and understand the degradation of PEMWE components and materials within reasonably short experiments. While various anode catalyst materials have for example been screened by Alia et al. in galvanostatic and potentiostatic ASTs with intermittent operation or simulated start-stop cycles [3, 4], the underlying degradation mechanisms of iridium-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEMWE anodes are still not fully understood. The here presented work aims for a better understanding of anode catalyst degradation during intermittent operation of PEMWEs. Performance changes and catalyst durability of a TiO 2 supported IrO 2 anode catalyst are investigated in 5 cm 2 single-cells at loadings of 1.7-1.8 mg Ir cm -2 over the course of an AST, consisting of operation periods at 3 A cm -2 and 0.1 A cm -2 and of periods at open circuit voltage (OCV), which was previously developed by our group [5]. To mitigate the growing contact resistances between the Ti-based porous transport layer (PTL) and the anode electrode that was observed by Weiß et al. [5] and to focus on the performance changes resulting from catalyst layer degradation, a platinum-coated PTL is used here. While the catalyst activity and therefore the performance is increasing in the first cycles of the OCV-AST due to a transition of the IrO 2 -catalyst surface to a hydrous iridium oxide, a significant subsequent performance loss is observed upon further cycling (see blue symbols in Fig. 1). On the other hand, for an AST where the cell voltage during idle periods is held at 1.3 V to prevent the intermittent reduction of the iridium catalyst (caused by hydrogen crossover during OCV periods), the high-frequency resistance-corrected cell voltage at 0.1 A cm -2 initially remains at high values but increases by only ~5 mV over 660 cycles (see red symbols). Besides presenting factors that affect the initial performance improvement during the OCV-AST to better understand the performance gain, we will investigate the impact of different operating conditions such as maximum current density or operating temperature on the performance decay after prolonged cycling. With different in-situ characterization methods like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or cyclic voltammetry, we will disentangle and elucidate possible reasons for the observed voltage losses to better understand catalyst degradation and critical lifetime-affecting operating parameters and conditions.

In water electrolysis cells, optimizing the anode electrode where the oxygen evolution reaction takes place is crucial for high performance and durability. The ionomer is an essential part of the catalyst layer (CL). It provides ionic conductivity, enabling ions to move to the catalyst sites where the electrochemical reaction occurs. Additionally, ionomers contribute to tuning the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the CL, which influences water availability at catalyst sites and gas removal. Moreover, ionomers ought to help to maintain optimal pH levels, an important factor for catalyst stability. In anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), when a supporting electrolyte is used, the ionic conduction takes place not only via the ionomer but also via the supporting electrolyte. Therefore, many studies in AEMWE use Nafion TM as an ionomer even though it is a cation exchange ionomer. 1 , 2 Also, several studies use polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a binder. 3 , 4 Thus, in this study, different commercial ionomers/binder are compared for the usage on the anode side of the AEMWE to understand their influence on the performance of the AEMWE cell at different pH feed electrolytes (1M, 0.1M and 0.01M); Hydrophilic cation exchange Nafion™, hydrophilic anion exchange Aemion ® and PiperION ® , and hydrophobic inert PTFE are used in the Ir-based anode CL. A commercial anion-exchange membrane (PiperION ® ) and a Pt/C cathode with PiperION ® ionomer are used, respectively. CL compositions and morphologies are investigated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical characterizations such as polarization curve and constant current hold analysis along with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are performed on a full cell set up to assess the performance, durability, and ionic transport resistance of the anode CL. We show that anionic ionomers (Aemion ® and PiperION ® ) do not lead to a better performance of the cell at 1M KOH concentration (see figure) and even at lower concentrations such as 0.1M KOH. Nafion™ ionomer incorporated membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) exhibit better performance than anionic ionomers (Aemion ® and PiperION ® ) and inert binder (PTFE) in 1M KOH measurement. One hypothesis on Nafion’s TM outstanding performance is that Nafion’s TM anionic head groups form an ionic interaction with the cationic head groups of the PiperION membrane and therefore lower the contact resistance between CL and membrane. 5 However, in our measurements, all high-frequency resistances of different ionomers/binder incorporated MEAs are in the same range (55-65 mΩ cm -2 ), which opposes the hypothesis. Based on the overall polarization characteristics, the performance for the different ionomers changes mainly in the kinetic region. As this difference can already be observed at begin of life where ionomer decomposition can be neglected, we assign this difference to an ionomer-catalyst interaction phenomenon (i.e., poisoning effect) or to a structural change in the CL when using different ionomers. Nafion’s ™ swelling in 1M KOH solution is lower than anionic ionomers. Therefore, it might be influencing the performance by having the optimal triple phase boundary and not blocking some of the catalyst particles. However, the PTFE binder also doesn’t swell in the KOH solution, but the performance is worse than for the Nafion™-based anode CL. By a variation of testing parameters (KOH feed molarity, temperature) and ink/CL fabrication we discuss the possible reasons for this phenomenon. In general, the role of ionomers for AEMWE must be reevaluated as the ionic conductivity of anion exchange ionomers becomes irrelevant when supporting electrolyte is in use, and anion exchange ionomers do not follow the same design criteria as for proton exchange ionomers.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) have drawn attention among various hydrogen production technologies due to their zero-emission, high conversion efficiency, high hydrogen purity (>99.99%), and quick response under dynamic operation. 1,2 With these auspicious characteristics in PEMWEs, they are believed to produce 40 % of green hydrogen by 2050 among all electrolyzer technologies. Nonetheless, many bottlenecks within PEMWEs still hinder their broader commercialization. Iridium oxide is the most widely used oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst at the anode. Moreover, this catalyst occupies the biggest portion (26–47%) of the overall cost of PEMWE systems, mostly due to the scarcity of iridium. 3 Commercial iridium oxide catalysts are generally two types depending on the material structure: amorphous IrO x and crystalline IrO 2 . The trade-off relationship exists in catalytic activity vs. stability between amorphous and crystalline IrOx catalysts. 4–6 To overcome these problems, fundamental studies of iridium oxide need to be conducted to reduce catalyst loading while maintaining high performance. Herein, we report the new iridium oxide catalysts (amorphous IrO x , crystalline IrO 2, Ishifuku Metal) for the first time. These new iridium oxide catalysts are physically and electrochemically characterized. To be specific, we confirm the distinct characteristics of each catalyst using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis with nitrogen adsorption isotherm, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As a result, the crystalline IrO 2 has a unique morphology with grown needles onto catalyst particles thereby the BET specific surface area of crystalline IrO 2 (~110 m 2 g -1 ) is over two times higher than amorphous IrO x (~50 m 2 g -1 ). Electrochemical performance is evaluated for varied catalyst loadings of membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The catalyst loadings (0.10, 0.26, 0.35, and 0.85 mg IrOx cm -2 ) for both anode catalysts were prepared. The CV results of amorphous IrO x exhibit unique redox peaks under specific voltage (~0.8 and ~1.2 V vs. RHE), which indicates the transition of oxidation state. These peaks develop with CV cycling and become fully developed after 100 cycles, indicating that the surface of the catalyst takes some time to activate. On the other hand, crystalline IrO 2 shows no specific redox peaks but rather has a double-layer capacitance under lower voltage (<0.5 V vs. RHE). Figure 1 shows 1.92 V (amorphous) and 1.94 V (crystalline) at 5 A cm -2 for 0.85 mg cm -2 loading, respectively. Both catalysts showed relatively low Tafel slopes of 43.8 mV dec -1 (amorphous IrO x ) and 53.7 mV dec -1 (crystalline IrO 2 ). This presentation will correlate the electrochemical performance described here to the structural properties of these two types of IrO x catalysts. Figure 1.

Iridium (Ir) is a widely used anode electrocatalyst material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEM water electrolysis. [1] However, high loadings of very costly and scarce Ir are currently needed to achieve sufficient performance and durability, which hinder the broad implementation of large-scale PEM water electrolyzers. To overcome these challenges, size-controlled Ir nanoparticles (NPs) [2] are typically used with different loadings in combination with robust support materials such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) [3] or antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) [4] . The variation of the metal loading and support material allows tailoring the metal-support interactions (MSI) and particle proximity effect based on the interparticle distance. Although the particle proximity effect of other catalyst material systems, e.g. Au NPs supported on TiO 2 [5] , is well-established, the influence of different support materials and loadings (interparticle distance) on the OER activity and durability for Ir NPs catalysts are not fully understood to date. This study focuses on the metal-support interactions (MSI) and particle proximity effect for Ir NPs deposited on three different support materials: antimony doped tin oxide (ATO), titanium oxide (TiO 2 ) and graphitized carbon (C) at different metal loadings between 20 – 60 wt.%. First, surfactant-free Ir NPs with controlled particle size were obtained by a colloidal route in methanol. [2] Afterwards, the Ir NPs were homogeneously distributed on the support materials with similar loadings and particle sizes and characterized by TEM and XPS. Thin-film rotating disc electrode (TF-RDE) technique was employed to determine the OER activity in 0.05°M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution. The ex-situ XAS and XPS data show significant differences in oxidation behavior of Ir depending on the loading and support material. Interestingly, the OER mass activity at 60 wt.% Ir loading increases in the order: TiO 2 (36 ± 4 A/g Ir ) < C (54 ± 5 A/g Ir ) < ATO (92 ± 8 A/g Ir ) measured at 1.5 V RHE-iR and 25 °C. Although the NPs on the support materials are aged similar, the iridium on TiO 2 is more strongly oxidized than on ATO. In addition to the effect of the support material, the proportion of oxidized iridium increases with decreasing loading. However, no changes in the chemical state of Ir as a function of the loading for TiO 2 support material used are observed. Furthermore, operando XAS investigations on the as-prepared Ir catalysts were preformed to correlate the OER activity and stability with the loading and support material. The operando Ir L III edge XAS experiments were performed at the P64 beamline at DESY and the ID24 beamline at the ESRF using a home-made spectro-electrochemical flow cell consisting of a three-electrode configuration. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using two different protocols. The first protocol included a fixed lower vertex potential and starting from 0.06 V RHE , with increasing upper vertex potentials of 0.8, 1.2, 1.4, or 1.6 V RHE . The second protocol used a fixed upper vertex potential of 1.6 V RHE as the starting point, and a variable lower vertex potential of 1.4, 1.2, or 0.8 V RHE , respectively. All CV profiles were conducted at a scan rate of 2 mV/s in 0.05°M H 2 SO 4 . Based on the Quick-XANES data, the Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) was used to uncover the electrochemical reversibility behavior of iridium oxidation state as a function of metal loading and support material. Very interestingly, when the iridium loading is very high, a loss of the reversibility of the chemical state of Ir species on carbon and ATO are observed during the CV scan up to 1.6 V RHE , but not on TiO 2 support material. In contrast, the chemical state of the Ir species was found to be highly reversible for low-loaded catalyst materials irrespective of the support material. In summary, our operando XAS investigations provide fundamental insights into the dynamic changes in electronic structure of Ir NPs depending on the support material and interparticle distance. Knowledge about the complex metal-support interactions and particle proximity effect can help to design more efficient and robust OER catalyst materials for PEM water electrolysis. Literature: [1] P.

Pretreatment and purification of water is necessary to use it as a feed for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode of PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE). Fresh water typically contains several multivalent cations such as Ca 2+ and K + . In addition, iron cations may accumulate in PEMWE over a long period of time due to corrosion of system components and fittings of the PEMWE. The presence of these multivalent cations in the feed water causes higher ohmic resistance of the cell and higher iR-free voltages, resulting in a performance loss.[1] Furthermore, the cations can be transported by the water crossover stream from anode to cathode and by diffusion transport.[2] In other words, even traces of metal cations drastically influence the efficiency and durability of PEMWE stacks. Despite this knowledge, contamination with multivalent cations is one to the main reason for the breakdown of PEMWE stacks.[3] Very interestingly, simulations of cationic contamination for PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs)[4] have shown that the distribution of metal cations in the through-plane direction depends on the proton current through the membrane. The cation concentration profile indicates an accumulation of metal cations close to the cathode side and leads to an increase of the proton transport resistance. In addition, the simulations indicate that in case of a complete substitution of protons by metal cations, the proton transport resistance approaches infinity. Finally, the proton current cannot increase further and a limiting current is reached.[4] The transfer/adoption of these simulations from PEMFC to PEMWE allows to clarify the behavior of the limiting current in dependence of the nature of metal cations such as Ca 2+ and K + and their concentrations, which is still poorly understood to date. In this work, we investigated if the concept of limiting protonic current from simulations for the PEMFC can be (partially) transferred to PEMWE on a laboratory scale. For this purpose, we evaluated the effect of trace metal cations in the anode feed water on the performance of a PEMWE single cell and quantified the cation concentration in the membrane using spectroscopic techniques such as micro X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). Electrochemical measurements were carried out in an in-house PEMWE test bench equipped with a single cell of 5 cm 2 geometric electrode area and potentiostat with booster. Commercially available catalyst coated membranes with a loading of 0.3 mg cm -2 geo of Pt/C and 1 mg cm -2 geo of IrOx were used. The measurements were carried out at atmospheric pressure and a cell temperature of 80°C. First, a conditioning procedure was performed using highly purified feed water (>20 MΩ cm at room temperature) until a stable cell performance had been achieved. Cation contamination experiments were conducted by introducing various concentrations of metal sulfates (1-100 µmol L -1 cation concentration) into the anode feed water. Performance evaluation was carried out by measuring the polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to determine the Tafel slope, overvoltage, and high frequency resistance (HFR). µ-XRF and EDX spectroscopy techniques were used to detect the cation concentration profile along the membrane. We observed a significant rise of the cell voltage by adding cations to the anode water feed within few hours. More precisely, a limiting current density of 1 A cm -2 geo after 16 hours of exposure to 100 µmol L -1 K + -ions in the anode feed water was determined using the Koutecký-Levich equation. This result is in line with our first simulations. The switch back to purified feed water allows us to monitor the dynamics of the performance recovery process obtained from EIS data. Additional measurements of the polarization curves and HFR were used to distinguish between reversible and irreversible degradation processes due to the cation contamination. Very interestingly, a partial reversibility was observed after the K + -contamination, as the limiting current increased from 1 to 2 A cm -2 geo after 16 hours recovery with purified water feed. Altogether, this study evaluated the transferability of limiting protonic current concept from simulations in PEMFC to PEMWE to uncover the impact of trace metal cations in the anode feed water on the performance of PEMWE.

Water electrolysis driven by renewable energy is a promising method to produce green hydrogen that can work as a clean energy carrier for a sustainable energy society. Various water electrolysis systems have been developed and commercialized, however, operations at high current density produce large quantity of bubbles leading to additional overpotentials. Engineering on electrodes, such as surface modifications and 3D-printed structure, is one of the strategies to minimize the bubble influence. Previous studies revealed hydrophilic and periodic structure is preferred for fast bubble departure to reduce overpotential. [1,2] Substrates with three-dimensional structures, including foams and felts, are often employed to deposit sufficient amount of electrocatalysts to minimize overpotentials at a given geometric current density. However, requirements for the substrate thickness have not yet been thoroughly discussed. In this study, we used Ni mesh substrate as a simple model structure and stacked them to vary the thickness to minimize the overpotential during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Optimization strategy is discussed based on bubble observations, kinetics of electrocatalysts, and electrolyte conductivity. The steady state chronopotentiometries at various current densities were conducted in 1 mol kg −1 KOH at 353 K using pristine and NiFeO x coated Ni mesh (NiFeO x /NM) with various stacking number of meshes. NiFeO x was selected as a model OER electrocatalyst because of its high activity in alkaline media. [3] Tafel slope values were nearly identical among various stacking numbers in the low current density region (<100 mA cm − 2 geo ) on both pristine and NiFeO x /NM. However, the value became larger in the high current density region (>500 mA cm − 2 geo ) using highly stacked mesh electrodes. The measured potentials at 10 and 800 mA cm − 2 geo as a function of the stacking number were summarized in Figure 1 . A monotonic decay of potential was observed at 10 mA cm − 2 geo . Tafel equation predicts surface area enlargement leads to a logarithm potential decay following their Tafel slope values (shown as dashed lines in Figure 1 ). Their agreements suggest the electrode surface is used uniformly through the thickness direction at 10 mA cm − 2 geo . However, volcano trends were observed at 800 mA cm − 2 geo suggesting the additional overpotential at high current density using thick electrodes. In addition, the optimum stacking number changes by the presence of the catalyst and the aperture of meshes. NiFeO x /NM showed a smaller thickness as an optimum compared to the pristine ( Figure 1 ). The optimum thickness of the stacked electrode with 200 mesh (aperture width of 77 mm) was smaller than that using 20 mesh (aperture width of 1020 mm), which may be due to the bubble accumulation within the stacked meshes. The bubble observation using a high-speed camera was conducted to compare 20 and 200 mesh with various stacking number at 800 mA cm − 2 geo in 1 mol kg −1 KOH at 298 K. Although the average bubble size from 200 mesh was smaller than that from 20 mesh, the size was comparable to the aperture width of 200 mesh. The bubbles filled in the aperture of 200 mesh may reduce the available active sites and the ion conduction path, which can be the reason for the smaller optimum thickness using the dense mesh. To clarify the contribution from the electrocatalysts, particularly Tafel slope values, 1D numerical simulation at 800 mA cm − 2 geo without bubbles was conducted through the stacked direction assuming a porous electrode. The electrode potential no longer decreases above the thickness of 0.5 mm with Tafel slope values of 40 mV dec −1 while continuous decay is predicted with the value of 120 mV dec −1 . At 800 mA cm − 2 geo , the electrolyte ohmic voltage loss builds up to 10 – 100 mV within the porous electrode, which results in the loss of local overpotential. The electrode with lower Tafel slope value easily suffers from the additional ohmic voltage loss, which localizes the active region to the near-surface and limits the benefit from the enlarged surface area through the stacking. This study highlights the necessity of substrate structure optimization based on the nature of the deposited electrocatalyst, the electrolyte conductivity, and the dynamics of the bubbles.

In a rapidly changing world, the evolution of semiconductors and information processing technology is unstoppable and will continue to be a source of international competitiveness in the future. Semiconductor devices are becoming increasingly miniaturized for higher integration. Therefore, the manufacturing process is becoming more complex and delicate. Oxidation is the first step in semiconductor fabrication, and the formed oxide film serves as a protective film against impurities, thus affecting the accuracy of subsequent microfabrication processes. An experimental oxidation model for Si, a commonly used group IV semiconductor substrate material, has been clarified by B. E. Deal et al. 1 . In recent years, device design based on material properties has become mainstream, and Ge is attracting attention as a next-generation semiconductor material. However, the effects of parameters such as atomic species and surface orientation of the substrate material on oxide film quality and oxygen diffusion still need to be investigated. Therefore, a systematic and atomistic understanding of the reaction-diffusion phenomenon of oxygen into the substrate and a better understanding of the oxide film formation process will contribute to the optimization of actual production conditions. In this study, the influence of substrate material properties on oxide film quality and oxygen diffusion during the oxidation process was simulated using the Reactive force-field Molecular Dynamics (ReaxFF MD) method, which can simulate the behavior of atoms by considering dynamics and chemical reactions. The parameter set of the Si/Ge/O/H system developed by Nayir et al. 2 was used in this study. In the calculation system, a substrate consisting of single elements of Si or Ge was placed in the lower part of the system, while the upper part of the system was vacuumed and O 2 was injected at regular time intervals. The radial distribution function (RDF) analysis between O-O atoms on Si (100) and Ge (100) substrates at 500 K and 1500 K is shown in Figure 1. The RDF is denoted by g(r) and is a quantitative function of the probability of the presence of other atoms at a certain distance from an atom. Figure1. (a) is the RDF for a Si substrate. Large peaks appeared at 1.32 Å and 2.52 Å, indicating a specific strong interaction force between oxygen atoms on the Si substrate. From the snapshot of the calculation system in the graph, oxygen atoms are deposited more on the substrate surface, confirming the same trend as in the model of B.E. Deal et al. Since the calculations were validated by obtaining qualitatively the same trend as the existing oxidation model for the Si substrate, the calculations for Ge were also performed using the same simulator. The RDF results for the Ge substrate are shown in Figure 1. (b) shows that the oxygen atoms are relatively more deeply buried than in the Si substrate since the peaks are located at positions where the distance r between the oxygen atoms is large. The second peak at Ge 500 K in (3) changed from 2.52 Å to 3.72 Å due to the difference in bond length between Si and Ge. In (4), oxygen atoms are present to some extent at any distance, suggesting that oxygen diffusion is more intense on the Ge substrate than on the Si substrate. As the temperature was increased for each substrate material, the peak at 1.32 Å at 500 K became smaller at 1500 K. In (1) and (3), 1.32 Å is the distance between atoms of O 2 molecules bonded to the substrate, indicating that the O-O bond is preserved at 500 K. At 1500 K in (2) and (4), the peaks at 2.52 Å and 3.72 Å (O-substrate-O bond) become larger, and the peak at 1.32 Å becomes smaller. This indicates dissociation of O 2 at the surface with increasing substrate temperature, and it is more likely to occur on Ge substrates than on Si substrates. Thus, differences in the reactive diffusivity of oxygen for each substrate material were confirmed. The results suggest that the reaction and diffusion of oxygen atoms are slow on Si substrates and that multiple oxygen atoms move in layers, while on Ge substrates, the incident O 2 dissociates one after another, and oxygen atoms may diffuse one after another.

Hydrogen (H 2 ) starvation, for example due to insufficient supply of H 2 or nonuniform gas distribution, remains one of the major challenges for PEMFC applications.[1,2] The H 2 starvation in PEMFCs results in a rapid (several milliseconds to few seconds) increases in voltage at the anode.[3] In order to continuously provide protons and electrons to the cathode during the H 2 starvation, the carbon oxidation reaction (COR) commences as an alternative reaction at the anode.[4] To mitigate carbon corrosion and improve the long-term durability of PEMFCs, several material strategies can be utilized. One promising approach is the utilization of co-catalysts such as IrO x to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as an alternative source for protons and electrons.[3,5] The iridium can be (i) physically mixed into the platinum-based catalyst layer as IrO x , (ii) added to the same carbon support material as Pt nanoparticles (NPs) or (iii) alloyed with Pt NPs. Although several studies showed an increase in cell reversal tolerance using Pt-Ir alloys instead of physical mixing [6-9], no operando spectroscopic studies have so far been conducted to understand the surface oxidation states and electron transfer processes between the two metals and metal oxides during the cell reversal event. As this is a very dynamic process occurring within several milliseconds to few seconds, our approach is to use operando Quick-X-ray absorption near edge structure (Quick-XANES). This allows us to fundamentally understand the dynamics of structural and electronic interactions of both metals during the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and OER. In this work, alloyed Pt-Ir NPs with Pt:Ir ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 were prepared by two different synthetic routes (colloidal and wet-impregnation).[10] Very interestingly, the oxidation states of platinum and iridium as well as the particle size strongly vary depending on the synthesis route. More precisely, the wet-impregnation enables preparing Pt-Ir NPs of 3 – 4 nm size, while ~2 nm Pt-Ir NPs with amorphous IrO x species are obtained by the colloidal route. Using the RDE technique in 0.1 M HClO 4 , all Pt-Ir catalysts show activities close the diffusion limiting current, indicating high HOR kinetics. Despite the different oxidation states and particle sizes, the Pt-Ir NPs show considerable activity for the OER compared to pure commercial Pt/C and IrO x catalysts. Especially, the Pt-Ir NPs prepared by the colloidal route exhibit 2.5 times increase in OER mass activity (normalized to the Ir content) at 1.5 V RHE compared to commercial IrO x . To gain fundamental insights into the reversibility and catalytically active states of these bifunctional Pt-Ir catalysts under working conditions, operando Quick-XANES experiments by jumping between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER within a few seconds were conducted. Very interestingly, these jumping experiments reveal that the bifunctionality of these Pt-Ir NPs is highly reversible for several minutes independent of the Pt:Ir ratio and synthesis route. However, the oxidation state of iridium during the OER is strongly influenced by the Pt:Ir ratio as well as the synthesis route. For both synthetic routes, using a Pt:Ir ratio of 3:1 results in a higher abundance of Ir 4+ species during the OER compared to using a 1:1 ratio. During the OER the content of oxidized Pt and Ir species are lower for the larger NPs (3 – 4 nm) prepared by the wet-impregnation route compared to the colloidal ones (2 nm). In addition, we reveal the influence of electronic effects between alloyed and non-alloyed NPs during the electrochemical reactions, especially for OER. During the HER, independent from the synthetic route the Pt-Ir NPs show a reduction of Pt z+ species to metallic platinum within a few seconds, while the Ir 4+ species are partially reduced to form Ir 3+ species. These dynamic changes in oxidation state of both elements within Pt-Ir alloy NPs are highly reversible within seconds under the HER or OER conditions. Based on the operando Quick-XANES, our results provide new insights into the dynamic behavior of bifunctional Pt-Ir NPs during HOR and OER within a few seconds to design new cell reversal tolerant catalyst materials with low loading of the very costly and scarce iridium.

Abstract The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e‐NRR) presents a promising approach for environmentally friendly ammonia synthesis. However, the efficiency of ammonia synthesis can be hindered by competitive hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Therefore, the development of a catalyst capable of suppressing HER is essential. In this study, a synergistic hybrid catalyst Sr(Ti 0.6 Fe 0.4 ) 0.8 B 0.2 O 3‐δ [S(TF)B 0.2 ], composed of Sr 3 B 2 O 6 (SB) and Sr y Ti 0.6 Fe 0.4 O 3‐δ (S y TF, y<1) is synthesized and used as an electrocatalyst for electrochemical ammonia synthesis via protonic ceramic electrolysis cells, in which SB is utilized as a proton acceptor, thereby inhibiting HER and promoting proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) for the ammonia synthesis. The formation of SB results in a deficiency of A‐site cations in S y TF, leading to an increased number of oxygen vacancies in S(TF)B 0.2 . DFT calculation indicates that oxygen vacancies facilitate ammonia generation and desorption, adhering to the enzymatic pathway for NH 3 synthesis. Additionally, the grain boundary (GB) between S y TF and SB introduces further defects, which contribute to the enhancement of the eNRR. Research indicates that utilizing S(TF)B 0.2 as a catalyst enhances both the ammonia synthesis rate and Faradaic efficiency. This study presents a straightforward and efficient approach for the fabrication of eNRR catalysts.

Oxygen redox-based layered cathode materials, such as P2/P3-types Na x [A y Mn 1-y ]O 2 (A=Li, Mg, Zn, vacancy), are of great importance to realize high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, we introduce a novel oxygen redox-based layered cathode material, P3-type Na 0.67 [Zn 0.3 Mn 0.7 ]O 2 with Na-O-Zn local configuration (Figure a,b). We investigate the effect of Zn doping on the electrochemical performance using a variety of methods such as galvanostatic potential cycling (Figure b), operando -X-ray diffraction (o-XDR) (Figure c), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nuclear magnetic resonance ( 23 Na NMR), atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS). O -XRD analysis reveals that P3 - Na 0.67 [Zn 0.3 Mn 0.7 ]O 2 material undergoes a phase transformation from P3 to O/P during charging and from O/P to P3 and finally to O3 during discharging (Figure d), which is also proved with the local structure transformations obtained by 23 Na NMR. Moreover, STEM and XANES reveal the displacement of Zn from the transition metal (TM) layer to the Na layer. Therefore, the Na-O-Zn configuration and the possibility of Zn migration in the Mn 4+ - based layered material are expected to play an important role in activating oxygen redox. As a result, our findings provide new insights into the reaction mechanism of P3-type oxygen redox-based cathode materials and a new design strategy for optimizing the bulk properties of SIB cathode materials.

Issues related to explosions and energy density constraints are presented by lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) employing organic electrolytes. 1 The pursuit of overcoming these challenges has brought all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), representing the next generation of batteries, to prominence as a viable solution. The interest has been directed towards sulfide-based solid electrolytes (SEs), recognized as a crucial component in ASSBs due to their elevated ionic conductivity. Nevertheless, challenges are encountered, encompassing the generation of hazardous hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) attributed to the sulfide electrolytes' diminished chemical stability in the presence of moisture, which results in the degradation of cells. 2 This necessitates the production of batteries in an environment devoid of reactive elements, thus imposing a hurdle for mass production. To address this issue, two strategies have been delineated: i) the integration of metal oxides such as Fe 2 O 3 , ZnO, and zeolite for the sequestration of H 2 S produced through hydrolysis; ii) the enhancement of SE's stability through doping with Bi, Sn, and Sb in alignment with the theory of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB), or through replacement with oxides like Li 2 O and P 2 O 5 . The suppression of H 2 S generation might contribute to prolonged degradation of cells, as it entails the capture of H 2 S, a breakdown product of SEs. In contrast, the reinforcement of SE structures via the integration of oxygen derivatives is posited to provide the benefit of precluding the generation of H 2 S while preserving cell efficiency. Despite the notable influence of oxygen inclusion, the elucidation of its impact, anchored in dependable cell functionality and underlying mechanisms, has yet to be fully clarified. 3,4 Thus, delving into the comprehension of structural reinforcement mechanisms facilitated by oxygen substitution and their implications is deemed of considerable importance for addressing the intrinsic challenges in SEs. In this study, a novel argyrodite composition incorporating a specified quantity of oxygen has been introduced to simultaneously augment its resistance to moisture and enhance its electrochemical performance without detracting from either attribute. The advantageous effects of oxygen substitution on structural reinforcement, resistance to moisture, and battery properties are delineated. The augmentation of the cathode/SE interface stability through oxygen substitution has been corroborated employing a high-capacity NCM811 (LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 ), and the decomposition behavior has been delineated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). An evaluation and comparison of moisture stability have been conducted using transmission electron microscope-selected-area electron diffraction (TEM-SAED), and the sites of oxygen substitution have been meticulously identified utilizing Rietveld refinement and Raman spectroscopy. A mechanism positing the stabilization of the PS 4 unit, pivotal for moisture resistance through oxygen-mediated structural evolution, is proposed. Furthermore, the significance of the SE in facilitating the commercial viability of sulfide-based ASSBs, accompanied by a substantial enhancement in battery performance, has been elucidated.

Metal-air secondary batteries using aqueous alkaline solutions are attracting attention as a next-generation large-scale energy storage system. However, the large overpotential of the bifunctional air electrode is a challenge for its practical application. In order to reduce the overvoltage, one approach is to optimize the design of the electrode to enhance both electrochemical as well as transport properties within. We have previously estimated the oxygen diffusion resistance in bifunctional air electrodes with different thicknesses and electrolyte solutions from the difference in the steady state potential under air and oxygen flow. We identified that the reaction zone for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions concentrated on the gas and electrolyte sides of the catalyst layer, respectively. 1 On the other hand, it is difficult to analyze local reaction rates in more detail since gas diffusion electrodes have a complex structure with a mixture of solid, gas, and liquid. In this study, we analyzed the local conditions in gas diffusion electrodes by combining digital simulations using finite difference methods and electrochemical measurements. The electrolyte solution's distribution significantly affects the simulation result since the electrolyte solution works as both an ionic conductiont and an obstacle to oxygen transport. 2 Therefore, the electrolyte solution distribution in the electrode was determined by impedance analysis using a transmission line model, and a simulation model was constructed based on this impedance analysis. Figure 1 shows the Nyquist plot of a gas diffusion electrode at OCV. A transmission line-type frequency dependency is observed in the high-frequency region. The impedance simulated with an equivalent circuit where the ion transport resistance in the electrode does not change in the thickness direction shows a relatively significant difference from the measured one. On the other hand, the impedance simulated with an equivalent circuit with the linear decrease in the ionic conductance from the electrolyte to gas diffusion layer sides showed good agreement with the measured one. This result indicates that the amount of electrolyte in the gas diffusion electrode decreases from the electrolyte side to the gas diffusion layer side. Simplifying the pore structure with the porosity and average pore size obtained with the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method and the tortuosity calculated from the Bruggeman’s equation, the electrolyte thickness was calculated to be 2.1 and 1.1 nm at the electrolyte and gas sides, respectively. The local conditions in the electrode obtained with a one-dimensional simulation model based on the obtained electrolyte solution distribution will be presented at the site.

The current societal pursuit towards carbon neutrality would necessitate self-contained systems, ultimately to be independent on the existing water and energy grid. On-site wastewater treatment and reuse can reduce water and waste transportation, in-turn decreasing the carbon footprint for sanitation and hygiene. Electrochemical oxidation processes (EOPs) have emerged as a promising way of decentralized treatment of toilet wastewater and effluent reuse. On the other hand, a distributed and point-of-use electrolysis of locally available, nontraditional water sources including wastewater (effluent) can be involved within the H 2 economy, reducing costs and CO 2 emission from H 2 transportation. This study proposes wastewater electrolysis cells (WECs) for localized wastewater treatment coupled with conversion of redundant renewable energy into H 2 . In the single-compartment WEC, therefore, oxygen reduction reaction competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), substantially decreasing the current and energy efficiency. Relatively low-grade H 2 (< 60%) in mixture with N 2 and CO 2 can be utilized by combustion. This approach might be more available and appropriate practice in household and community level. This presentation also introduces recent electrocatalysts to overcome the bottlenecks of WEC such as requirements of precious elements based electrocatalysts and unsatisfactory selectivity of chlorine evolution reaction. These includes i) NiFe 2 O 4 and CoSb 2 O 6 with tiny amounts of Ir, and ii) precious metal cations (Ru and cocatalysts) atomically anchored on Magneli phase Ti 4 O 7 .

Li and Mn-rich cathode materials (LMR) that utilize both cation and anion redox can yield substantial increases in battery energy density. 1-3 However, even though voltage decay issues cause continuous energy loss and impedes its commercialization, prerequisite driving force for this phenomena are a mystery 3-6 Here, with in-situ nanoscale sensitive coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) techniques, we reveal that nanostrain and lattice displacement accumulate continuously during cell operation. Evidence unequivocally shows that this effect is the driving force for both structure degradations and oxygen loss that triggers the well-known rapid voltage decay in LMR. By further leveraging micro to macro length characterizations that span atomic structure, primary particle, multi-particle and electrode level, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous nature of LMR cathodes inevitably causes pernicious phase displacement/strain which cannot be eliminated by conventional doping or coating methods. These results affirm that lattice displacement and nano-strain, which represent commonly occurred but less detectable dynamic structure evolutions, play an undeniable role in structure decomposition and voltage fade. With these fundamental discoveries, we propose mesostructural design as a strategy to mitigate lattice displacement and inhomogeneous electrochemical/structural evolutions, thereby achieving stable voltage and capacity profiles. These findings highlight the significance of lattice strain/displacement in causing voltage decay and will inspire a wave of efforts to unlock the potential of the broad-scale commercialization of LMR cathode material.

Lithium-ion batteries have proved their dominance in the mobile vehicle market; however, their energy densities need to be increased to facilitate a swifter transition to a greener future. [1] Of the promising materials, nickel-rich layered oxide cathodes emerge as a key contender, where their operation at high voltages allows access to higher capacities, providing an overall increase to the W⋅h/kg. [2] However, at high voltages, degradation in the form of oxygen-loss from the cathode arises for layered oxides. [3] For NMC811, an emerging cathode material, this effect is especially prominent as a mode of suspected degradation when operated under wider voltage windows (2.5–4.4 V). The nature of these species evolved at the surface and their contribution to electrode degradation, are not yet fully understood, and more details need to be uncovered to reliably access higher energy densities in current and next generation cathode materials. Here, we report the use of O K-edge soft X-ray absorption (sXAS) measurements to probe into species variation at the cathode’s surface for single crystal NMC811 full cells cycled at voltages below and above their oxygen loss threshold. The results confirm that operation at high voltage (above oxygen loss) results in the evolution of a layer forming at the surface. Our calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) have allowed us to confirm the nature of this surface being comprised of a reduced nickel oxygen species as an Ni-O ‘rock-salt’ type layer (RSL). We coupled these results with surface measurements using hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) and observed trapped lithium for cells in their charged state, suggesting there is a kinetic barrier hindering their mobility. We then proceeded to understand the relationship of this trapped lithium to the bulk structure using operando XRD measurements . Here, we show that structural fatigue is generated in NMC811 as a consequence of high voltage cycling. This feature of fatigue was evident from the evolution of the 003 reflection from the NMC phase and was seen to develop with prolonged cycling ( Fig. 1b & c ). This ‘fatigue’ feature in literature has been attributed to trapped lithium in the bulk and has only been observed after long-term cycling. [4] This feature is known to be associated to a reconstructed part of the bulk structure with poor lithium kinetics [4] and here, we observe this feature as early as the first cycle which we attribute to the formation of the RSL. Mitigating the formation of this RSL layer will therefore reduce the kinetic capacity loss, thus this discovery proves promising towards engineering future cathodes with higher utilisable capacities.

Introduction During the operation of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), certain parts of the anode flow channel may not receive sufficient supply of hydrogen due to water blockage or sluggish diffusion. This can lead to hydrogen starvation, which further causes a shortage of protons during cell reaction. Such phenomenon causes an increase in anode potential, which triggers the carbon oxidation reaction (COR) and damages the catalyst layer. This destructive chained reaction is known as cell reversal degradation. Promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to alleviate the COR is a promising strategy to develop reversal-tolerant anodes (RTAs). Incorporating OER-active co-catalyst such as IrO 2 is an effective way to mitigate the rise in anode potential and prevent COR [1]. We developed a new reversal tolerant anode (RTA) by directly coating a novel OER-active material, iridium oxide nanosheets (IrO 2 (ns)), as a co-catalyst to commercial Pt/C (c-Pt/C) [2]. With only 2.5 mass% of IrO 2 (ns) coating, the IrO 2 (ns)-c-Pt/C catalyst achieved an improved cell reversal resistance. The OER current of IrO 2 (ns) plays an important role in enhancing the reversal tolerance. In this study, we focus on the degradation behavior of IrO 2 (ns)-supporting material. IrO 2 (ns) supported on carbon was physically mixed with c-Pt/C (IrO 2 (ns)/KB+c-Pt/C) and compared with IrO 2 (ns) coated on c-Pt/C (IrO 2 (ns)-c-Pt/C). Experimental IrO 2 (ns) colloid was synthesized following literature [3] [4]. The directly coated catalyst, IrO 2 (ns)-c-Pt/C, was prepared by mixing IrO 2 (ns) colloid and Pt/C. The samples will be denoted as Coated- x , where x is the IrO 2 mass% in the catalyst. The mixed catalyst, IrO 2 (ns)/KB+c-Pt/C, was prepared by physically mixing IrO 2 (ns) /KB, which was prepared by mixing IrO 2 (ns) colloid and KB (Ketjen black EC-300J), and c-Pt/C. The sample will be denoted as Mixed- x , where x is the IrO 2 mass% in the catalyst. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) studies were conducted using a 3-electrode half-cell setup with 0.1 M HClO 4 as the electrolyte. For hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity measurements, the electrolyte was purged with H 2 . For chronopotentiometry (CP) and electrochemically active Pt surface area (ECSA) measurement, the electrolyte was purged with N 2 . All data were accumulated at 60 o C. Results and Discussion: To simulate the degradation behavior in the fuel cell anode, accelerated stress test (AST) was conducted by applying a series of CP (178 μA/cm 2 , 20 mins) and CV (0.05-1.2 V, 50 mV/s, 10 cycles) tests. The HOR mass activity was measured after 5 CP-CV tests. The HOR activity was evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) from -0.08 V to 0.5 V vs. RHE and calculated at 20 mV vs. RHE based on the Koutecky-Levich equation. After AST, the Coated-5 sample showed a decrease in HOR activity from 1575 A/g to 272 A/g (17.3 % retention). In contrast, the Mixed-4.6 sample showed a decrease in HOR from 1840 A/g to 575 A/g (31.2 % retention). Samples with higher IrO 2 (ns) content ratio were used for morphology observation by TEM and treated with higher AST current (CP current 1120 μA/cm 2 ). Figures 1(A) and 1(B) show the initial state of Coated-15 and Mixed-10.7 and Figures 1(C) and 1(D) show the morphology after AST. In Coated-15 sample, agglomerated clusters were found, suggesting the dissolution/re-precipitation of Pt nearby IrO 2 (ns) (Figure (C)). On the other hand, in Mixed-10.7 sample, instead of forming large cluster, the damage of carbon substrate without Pt particle was found, suggesting the degradation of IrO 2 (ns)/KB due to high OER current (Figure (D)). According to the results above, the separate coating of IrO 2 (ns) onto KB helps in preventing the high OER current that damages the Pt/C structure and provides a high HOR retention after AST.

Co has been extensively used in lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathodes with LiTMO 2 structure (TM: transition metals) due to its high specific capacity and stability. However, the scarcity and costliness of Co have prompted researchers to explore alternatives utilizing more abundant and cost-effective elements like Mn and Ni. Despite these efforts towards Co reduction or elimination, there remains a critical knowledge gap concerning the specific functions of cobalt in cathode capacity and structural stability. In this study, we employed advanced characterization techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate the roles of cobalt in Co-free Ni-rich cathodes, as well as to elucidate degradation mechanisms in Li- and Mn-rich cathodes. To understand the Co roles, Co-rich LiNi 0.6 Co 0.4 O 2 , (NC64) and Mn-substituted Co-free LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.4 O 2 (NM64) were used [1]. TEM observations show that both NC64 and NM64 surface structures change to a rock-salt phase after prolonged cycling, suggesting surface phase transformation was independent of the Co and Mn content. However, the surface structures for NC64 and NM64 during the cycling exhibit clear difference. The subsurface structure of NC64 completely transited to a Co 3 O 4 -type spinel-like structure. Such an irreversible phase transition is related to oxygen release, which triggers TM migration to form a spinel-like phase. In contrast, the structure stability of NM64 remained a typical layered structure after 100 cycles, indicating the Co reduction and Mn substitution improved the stability of the structure and oxygen of Ni-rich cathodes. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) line scans from surface to subsurface of NM64 sample shows the O K-edge pre-peak only decreased near the surface, and the L edges of Ni and Mn also consistently shift towards lower energy loss near the surface. These results suggest that oxygen release only occurred on surface areas of the NM64 particles. In contrast, oxygen released not only occurred on the surface, but also extended into bulk NC64, because the O K-edge pre-peak of NC64 exhibited a relatively low intensity in the whole scan area of around 40 nm. In conclusion, Co is detrimental to structural/ morphological stability and oxygen reversibility. Co reduction and Mn increase could greatly alleviate these challenges in Ni-rich cathodes. HRTEM observations indicate that Li- and Mn-rich cathodes consist of nanoscale Li 2 MnO 3 and layered domains. To understand the voltage fade mechanism in Li- and Mn-rich cathodes [2], XRD, TEM, 3D rotation electron diffraction (3D-rED), and EELS were performed on delithiated samples to investigate lattice displacement and nanostructure evolution. XRD and TEM studies show that inhomogeneous electrochemical activities and structural difference between Li 2 MnO 3 and layered domains result in nanoscale strain. The accumulated strain severely affects the structural stability of the composite Li- and Mn-rich cathode, which triggers the decomposition of Li 2 MnO 3 domains, oxygen release and TM migration. The activation of Li 2 MnO 3 and oxygen release in turn release the lattice strain at high voltages. References [1] Liu, Tongchao, et al. Nature Energy 6.3 (2021): 277-286. [2] Liu, Tongchao, et al.

Abstract Analyzing dynamics at both temporal and spatial scales of surface photocarrier interactions is pivotal for optimizing the photocatalytic chemical activity. Taking the photocatalytic conversion of CH3OH to HCOOCH3 on TiO2 surface as a prototypical system, we elucidate the correlated time- and spatial- evolution of photoexcited electron-hole (e-h) pairs, defining the polaron-catalyzed molecule-surface chemistry at the ab initio theory level. The photocatalytic process is driven by two photoexcited holes, each inducing C-H bond cleavage via a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). It leads to the formation of HCOOCH3, with a pair of protons adsorbed on bridge oxygen atoms and the release of two electrons, forming two small polarons. The entire reaction occurs on picosecond timescale. Photoexcited electrons do not directly participate in the reaction but form small polarons in TiO2 within tens of femtoseconds, which lowers reactant energy and suppress the photocatalytic efficiency. This study illuminates novel insights on the design and optimization of surface photocatalytic reactions.

The development of efficient hydrogen production technology by water splitting electrolysis with low overvoltage is underway to realize a hydrogen society, and the development of a technology to precisely design and sheet the chemical structure along with catalyst development is very important to understand the electrocatalytic reaction mechanism such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction and the effect of gap spacing on the active site at the nanoscale. This is very important for visualizing and understanding the mechanisms of electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (HER and ORR), and the effect of gap spacing on the active sites at the nanoscale. For example, it has been reported that ORR activity is enhanced on surfaces with adsorbed hydrophobic organic molecules on Pt compared to that on clean surfaces ( Nat. Commun. 2018, 9 , 4378). The effect of nanopores (vacancy sites) on the HER is unclear, although it is attributed to the limited reaction sites of Pt atoms owing to the adsorption of organic molecules. Furthermore, it is difficult to control the size of the nanopores and their dispersion (distance between nanopores) at the nano-level using a top-down approach, in which graphene sheets are mechanically and chemically processed, and a bottom-up 2D sheet fabrication method should be established. The development of a technique to precisely design chemical structures and fabricate sheets is important to understand the electrocatalytic reaction mechanism at the nanoscale and to visualize the effect of nanopore size and spacing on the active sites at the nanoscale. In this study, we investigated the formation of nanostructures by the intermolecular condensation of nanographene, such as ovalene and dicoronylene (Fig. 1), and investigated the thermal condensation conditions by adsorption on a Au(111) substrate under various conditions. The pore size of the nanostructures formed by ovalene and dicoronylene was characterized by using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). A clean Au (111) substrate was immersed in an ovalene- and/or dicoronylene-saturated benzene solution for 10 – 60 s, and the coated Au(111) electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The current density was significantly reduced before and after the vacuum heat treatment, suggesting that the ovalene molecules were rearranged on Au(111) and condensed between molecules. In addition, as a result of observation of the surface state in the atmosphere with STM, it was found before heating (Fig. 2a), confirming that the ovalene molecule was adsorbed over a wide area, and after heating (Fig. 2b), nanostructures with voids of 2.5 ~ 3 nm in diameter were observed. These results suggest that condensation may have occurred between the ovalene molecules due to heating, resulting in the formation of nanostructures with many nanopores. In contrast, dicoronylene forms a diamond-shaped lattice structure with sides of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 nm. Considering the molecular size of dicoronylene, it is difficult to judge whether intermolecular condensation among dicoronylene molecules occurred; however, the adlayer structure was different from that observed at room temperature. These results strongly suggest that intermolecular condensation reaction among ovalene and dicoronylene occurred on Au(111) upon elevating the temperature in vacuum. From the CV measurements, no significant change in the electric double-layer region was observed before and after the vacuum heating treatment; however, we found small change in the overpotential on the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Disordered Rock-Salt (DRX) cathode structures are materials where lithium and transition metal atoms are arranged in a disordered solid solution. These structures are currently under intensive study [1] due to their potential higher energy density, bigger capacity than the typical layered cathode structure, and improved flexibility in the selection of raw materials. Driven by this, we have recently compiled a DFT-based database of DRX structures with over 6,000 different metal oxide compositions. Moreover, since oxygen loss is linked to voltage degradation, intergranular cracks, and irreversible phase transformation, developing a descriptor that allows us to understand and reflect the stability of oxygen within the DRX anion lattice is crucial. It represents a significant research challenge that our study aims to address. In this work, we study two things: First, since the generation of oxygen vacancies holds a critical value in elucidating the stability of cathode material oxides[2], our methodology focuses on generating an extensive DFT database of over 1,400 oxygen vacancy formation energies (E vf (O)) from selected DRX structures. We then employ a machine learning (ML) model to predict the E vf (O) and their distribution for a variety of different compositions. The ML model incorporates site-specific features, such as the maximum reduction potential of the cations neighboring the O vacancy, the O p-band center of mass, and information from atomic population analysis (such as the bond order and the bond spin polarization between each O and its nearest neighbors). This approach is necessary because the DRX structure contains different local environments where O vacancies could be created, and recent work from Baldassarri et al. has highlighted the limitations of ML models that only include global features and lack their ability to differentiate the behavior of compounds containing the same elements but in different oxidation states [3]. This allows us to predict the O vacancies energetics with an accuracy comparable to DFT and to develop a descriptor to classify different compositions of DRX structures. Second, given that oxygen destabilizes during delithiation, we analyze the impact and relationship of the Li vacancy formation energies (E vf (Li)) and E vf (O) of each O able to create a vacancy. The results show a strong interaction between these energetics, and in particular, an inverse correlation between E vf (O) of a specific O site and the E vf (Li) of the Li atoms that surround this O, which within these DRX prototypes the number of surrounding Li varies from 1 to 5. In line with what others proposed [4], there is a strong interaction between these two vacancy types. However, we expect that the generation of O vacancies is determined not only by their thermodynamic driving force but also by the displacement/migration of the nearest neighbor lithium (NN-Li) that surrounds each O. The methodology and fundamental understanding developed in this study about DRX O-vacancies and their relationship with NN-Li during delithiation could help investigate and describe compositionally similar transition metal oxide cathodes belonging to the same crystal structure family (layered, spinel-like, γ-LiFeO 2 ). Hence, this research not only enhances our understanding of these materials but also paves the way for the design and development of more flexible and stable energy storage systems. [1] S. Anand, B.

In this study, we demonstrate energy conversion in a device that couples photo- and bioelectrocatalysis. This device can be described as a photoelectrochemical biofuel cell where electricity is generated via photoelectrochemcial dioxygen evolution supplying substrate (i.e. dioxygen) for the oxydoreductase, laccase. This device mimics the photosynthetic process of leafs where the energy from sunlight is used to produce dioxygen and glucose, an energy-rich reaction product (electricity equivalent). The overall reaction of this system is the reversible interconversion of oxygen and water in a closed loop. This closed-loop device makes use of a photoanode of TiO 2 (rutile, single crystal) that generates dioxygen via photoelectrolysis of water when illuminated, thereby providing an internal substrate (i.e., cathodic dioxygen fuel) for the oxidoreductase, laccase. The cathode of this system consists of an electrode coated with a conducting polymer matrix entrapping laccase and a redox mediator, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiaxoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) (PAL-coated cathode), previously reported by our laboratory. The immobilization of the enzyme and its mediator eliminates the need for a separation membrane, allowing the anode and cathode to be located within the same compartment.

Iron based electrocoagulation (Fe-EC) is a promising contaminant removal technology based on electrochemical dissolution of iron from steel electrodes; however, the Fe-EC performance declines over extended operation associated with fouling layer formation. In this study, we characterized the fouling layer growth in a continuous-flow EC reactor for silica and hardness removal from secondary effluent of wastewater. The fouling layer exhibited a passivating effect, requiring a higher anode potential to maintain the desired electrical current, thus significantly decreasing Faradaic and pollutant removal efficiencies. To better understand the evolution and composition of the passivation layer, we conducted time-resolved microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis to obtain critical insights into the structure, morphology, and elemental composition of the fouling layer at different stages of formation. Experimental observations indicated that an initial thin, porous iron oxide layer formed on the anode surface. During extended operation, this oxide layer thickened to a dense, over 100-µm black iron oxide layer containing magnetite due to limited oxygen availability near the surface where iron ions were released. To address the challenge posed by the fouling layer, polarity reversal was applied to break up the fouling layer and restore anode reactivity, resulting in recovering Faradaic and pollutant removal efficiencies. The mechanism responsible for this improvement could be associated with the evolution of gas at the cathode surface after electrode reversal, which effectively removed the fouling layer. This work not only provides a deeper understanding of fouling-layer formation in Fe-EC, but also presents a practical approach to maintain the reactivity of the electrodes and optimize the effectiveness of Fe-EC systems.

Lithium-ion batteries are currently used in large power sources such as automobiles, for which durability and safety are required. However, LIB suffers from degradation such as CO 2 generation from electrolyte decomposition and O 2 emission from cathode materials. These side reactions and gas generation can cause serious problems leading to ignition and explosion. It is important to understand how reactions occur at the interface during charging to generate CO 2 and O 2 . This reaction at the cathode/electrolyte interface has been studied by various experimental and computational methods. In particular, density functional theory (DFT) simulation studies are effective in clarifying the decomposition process of the electrolyte at the atomic level. However, DFT calculations for liquid electrolytes are computationally demanding, since the number of molecules are prone to be large when considering molecule-molecule interaction 1 . To solve, we apply universal neural network potential (UNNP) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to the reaction at the electrolyte solution / solid electrode interface. In this study, we focused on Li x CoO 2 (0≤x≤1) and Li x NiO 2 (0≤x≤1) as cathode materials, and ethylene carbonate (EC) as the electrolyte solvent. The model consists of Li 180(1-x) Ni 180 O 360 (Li 180(1-x) Co 180 O 360 ) slab and 100 EC molecules. After the structural relaxation calculations, MD calculations were performed for a 500 ps in a canonical (NVT) ensemble with a time step of 1 fs. Temperatures were 373 K and 473 K, which are below the boiling point of EC. In LiCoO 2 , no decomposition of the electrode or electrolyte was observed. On the other hand, CO 2 was generated in the MD calculation for LiNiO 2 . The generation process (3 steps) is shown below. (1) Hydrogen dissociation/desorption from EC molecules. (2) Combination of the ethylene group carbon of the EC molecule, from which hydrogen dissociation has occurred, with the oxygen on the cathode surface. (3) Ring-opening between the ethylene group carbon of the EC molecule and oxygen, resulting in CO 2 generation. The O 2 generation phenomenon was observed to occur in the following three steps as shown in Figure 1. (1) Ni moves to the Li layer to form NiO 4 tetrahedron. (Figure 1 (a) → (b)) (2) Oxygen dimer is formed by the bonding of NiO 4 tetrahedron and NiO 5 polyhedron derived from NiO 6 octahedron. (Figure 1 (c)) (3) Oxygen dimer is released. (Figure 1 (d)) Technical details will be presented, in particular on CO 2 evolution, at the poster session. References 1. Okuno et al.

Proton conducting solid oxide electrolysis cells (p-SOECs) represent emerging technologies for hydrogen production, theoretically capable of yielding pure hydrogen at one electrode without carbon emissions. However, owing to the multi-charge-carrier nature inherent in proton-conducting materials, encompassing protons, oxygen ions, electrons, and holes, thorough evaluation of energy conversion efficiency is imperative to identify promising candidates for practical deployment. Faradaic Efficiency (FE) serves as a crucial parameter delineating the efficacy with which external energy (electrons) is harnessed for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Presently, FE values span a considerable spectrum, despite similar materials and devices being assessed across disparate research laboratories. Consequently, the prevalence of uncertainty and skepticism regarding comprehensive assessments of materials and devices may significantly impede the advancement of p-SOECs. We propose an examination of FE measurement protocols and associated deviations in FE calculations, drawing upon recent practices elucidated by the Idaho National Laboratory. Such an endeavor not only aids newcomers to the field but also furnishes guidance for the comparative analysis of results obtained from diverse laboratory settings and research groups.

Abstract Several characterization techniques were performed on a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to relate the performance degradation induced by the membrane-targeted accelerated stress test (AST) to the evolution of electrochemical and physical properties of the electrode. This works investigated the ionomer structure and the proton transport properties. Electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering analysis provided access to the electrode’s nanoscale structure, the distribution of the platinum particle size, the structure of the 2-3 nm thick ionomer film, as well as the location of the water uptake by the electrode. A newly-developed technique using proton desorption under diluted O2 allows to distinguish effectively used active sites for oxygen reduction reaction. Proton transport and dioxygen diffusivity properties were measured using impedance spectroscopy and limiting current technique respectively. The Membrane-AST leads to an increase in the water uptake of the electrode due to a modification of the global structure of the electrode, a reduced platinum surface area, and corrosion of carbon particles. However, it does not alter the ionomer structure. The decrease in performance is partially attributed to the increase in proton resistivity, but mainly due to the limitation of dioxygen transport fostered by the electrode structure modifications.

Transition metal single-atom catalysts supported on N-doped graphene (M-N-Cs) offer significant advantages in metal utilization and uniformity of active sites compared to traditional heterogeneous catalysts. They are particularly notable for their superior electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) performance. Various modifications have been explored, including different metal combinations, different first shell elements (N, C, S, B), and coordination numbers, to enhance electrocatalytic ORR activities. Another emerging focus is the link between their local structure and spin state. The Zhenan Bao and Jaramillo groups recently found that the catalytic activity of the NiN x moiety stems from its tetrahedrally distorted structure because it stabilizes the high-spin Ni state more than the low-spin state.[1] The local structure and its distortion can be modified by adjusting the carbon nanotube diameter,[2] pore size,[3] layering,[4] or by adding ligands at the first or second shell.[5] In this study, we have conducted a computational screening of M-N-Cs with 3d, 4d, and 5d metals and local structures including square planar, tetragonal pyramidal, and tetrahedral symmetries. Metals in their divalent states within the MN 4 units exhibited a V-shaped trend in formation energy correlated with increasing atomic numbers across each series. This pattern appears to be linked to the interaction between the two electrons of the N 4 ligand and the d electron count of the metals, and it also emerged in the *O/*OH adsorption energy plots. Additionally, the preferred spin state varied with the metal type and structural symmetry, influencing electron distribution and crystal field splitting. These factors collectively impacted the binding energies with adsorbents, subsequently altering oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Further, we explored the adsorption energies of various intermediates (*CO, *H, *Cl, and *N 2 H) relevant to carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), chlorine evolution reaction (ClER), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), respectively. Our primary objective was to identify optimal metal-structure combinations for enhanced catalytic performance. To achieve this, we considered several descriptors including partial Integrated Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (ICOHP), metal d-band center, Madelung energy, and metal ionization potential. Moving forward, we aim to extend these findings by incorporating distorted coordination environments and integrating experimental synthesis strategies to induce such distortions, potentially unlocking new pathways for catalytic efficiency enhancement.

ABSTRACT When hydrogen is depleted in PEFCs, the anode potential increases (cell reversal), which involves the oxidation of carbon (COR), resulting in the deactivation of the anode. The addition of the oxygen evolution (OER) catalysts has been reported to suppress the degradation 1 . Ioroi et al. have reported that the combination of Ti 4 O 7 with Ir catalysts improved the reversal-tolerance 2 . Li et al. have recently reported that Pt-IrO 2 catalyst supported on Ti 4 O 7 exhibited excellent reversal-tolerance 3 . We have also independently found a similar combination to be effective using Ti 4 O 7 -C synthesized by the carbothermal process 4 and reported that the composite catalysts (Pt and OER catalysts supported on Ti 4 O 7 -C) showed better reversal-tolerance than the physical mixture of Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C and Ti 4 O 7 -supported OER catalysts 5 . In this study, the composite effect of Pt-Ir was studied in terms of the chemical state of iridium catalysts and the effect of Ti 4 O 7 -supported catalysts. The reversal-tolerance was evaluated on the hydrogen pump. Experimental Preparation of catalysts: 20 wt% Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C (11 wt% C) was prepared as previously reported 4 . IrO 2 catalysts Ti 4 O 7 -C or Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C was impregnated in IrCl 3 solution, and hydrothermally treated at 180°C. Afterwards, the sediment was washed and dried at 80°C. 3.8 - 5.7 wt% IrO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C and 18 wt% Pt-3.7 wt% IrO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C were used for the physical mixture catalysts (hereafter denoted as “catalyst name-M”) and the composite catalyst, respectively. Ir 0 catalyst Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C was dipped into IrCl 3 aqueous solution, and NaBH 4 solution was added. It was washed by ethanol and water and dried at 80°C. Electrochemical measurement: The MEA was composed of Nafion NRE211 as the electrolyte membrane, a commercial heat-treated c-Pt/CB as the cathode (0.5 mg -Pt /cm 2 ), and the above-mentioned catalyst or the physical mixture catalyst as the anode (0.2 mg -Pt /cm 2 ). A commercial c-Pt/CB was also used for a physical mixture catalyst. The Ir loadings were 0.036 - 0.047 mg/cm 2 and are indicated in parentheses. The performance was firstly evaluated with IV curves, and then the hydrogen pump, CV and LSV were conducted by flowing H 2 gas to the cathode under 80°C fully humidified condition. The cell reversal test was performed by switching the anode supply gas to N 2 (RH 78%) while the hydrogen pump was carried out at 0.2 A/cm 2 , and it was kept it was kept for 10 minutes at a cutoff voltage of 2.7 V. After the test, the same check of the characteristics was conducted. The second test was repeated in the same manner, and the third test was performed until it reached the cutoff voltage. Results and Discussion Difference in Ir chemical states of composite catalysts: The difference between IrO 2 and Ir 0 catalysts was studied (Cat 1 and Cat2). Both catalysts exhibited similar behavior. It was inferred that the oxidized Ir on the surface functioned as the active species for both catalysts 3 . Since 41% of Ir was leached after the tests for Pt-IrO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C catalyst (Cat1), the catalyst calcined at 300°C was also tested. Though the amount of leached Ir by the tests was suppressed to 10%, the degradation behavior hardly changed. Effects of Ir catalysts for the physical mixture catalyst: To confirm the effect of Ti 4 O 7 -C-supported IrO 2 catalyst for the physical mixture catalyst, the same loading of Ir black was added to Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C (Cat4). It showed better reversal-tolerance than the catalyst with IrO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C (Cat3), which means that the reversal-tolerance was improved in the case that Ir was supported on Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C. Differences between Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C and c-Pt/CB for the physical mixture catalysts : For the physical mixture catalyst with IrO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C, c-Pt/CB was used (Cat5). c-Pt/CB showed better reversal-tolerance than the catalyst with Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C. Even though the catalyst with c-Pt/CB held below 1.7 V during the second test, the performance on the hydrogen pump deteriorated, because the COR slowly occurred below 1.7 V 2 . On the other hand, Ti 4 O 7 -C supported Pt-based catalysts did not exhibit significant deterioration on the hydrogen pump while they were kept below 1.7 V, and the HOR activity decreased after the anode voltage increased over 1.7 V. We have confirmed that the Ti 4 O 7 -C was slightly oxidized above 1.7 V, however the increase in the ohmic resistance was not the main factor for the increase in the voltage.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis (WE) and fuel cells (FCs) stand out as promising technologies for hydrogen generation and utilization, leveraging renewable and sustainable energy sources. A pivotal element in both PEMFC and PEMWE is the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA), comprising catalyst layers (CLs) and a membrane. These CLs facilitate electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, crucial for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in PEMWE and PEMFC. The catalyst ink for CLs consists of electrocatalyst, ionomer dispersion, and additional solvents. Among these components, the choice of solvent significantly influences PEMFC and PEMWE performance, shaping the catalyst ink's properties. In this investigation, we formulated ionomer dispersions for CLs to enhance performance in PEMWE and PEMFC. We scrutinized the effects of solvents in terms of solvation energy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), particle size distribution (PSD), and electrochemical assessment.

Coherent X-rays provide a unique structural and dynamical viewpoint of electrode surfaces and nanoparticles. Using the coherent X-ray techniques, we have been studying several electrochemical phenomena such as electrochemical dissolution reactions of silver surfaces and nanoparticles, oxygen reduction/evolution reactions of platinum and platinum alloy nanoparticles, and the surface reconstruction dynamics of gold surfaces and nanoparticles. The coherent X-ray techniques are typically developed for real-space images and real-time dynamics. For imaging techniques, X-ray imaging such as Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) is used to image nanoparticles, and X-ray Ptychography is used to image electrode surfaces, and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) is used to monitor the electrode surface dynamics. In this talk, we will present a broad overview of the examples based on our previous studies and provide each example with an emphasis on the uniqueness of the coherent X-ray techniques and the structural and dynamical aspects of the electrodes, unavailable in traditional X-ray techniques. We will also provide a perspective of the coherent X-ray techniques using the more powerful and brilliant coherent X-rays becoming available in the newest generation X-ray photon sources such as upgraded Advanced Photon Source (APS-U).

Currently, most research on bio-corroded mortar focuses on cyanobacteria and microorganisms in the marine environment, but the specific mechanism of mortar performance at different stages of the specific biological system of marine dominant algae, Enteromorpha-diatom, is still lacking. Therefore, this paper investigates the growth characteristics of Enteromorpha-diatom proliferation organisms and their attachment evolution on mortar. First, the concentration of Enteromorpha spores over 0 to 15 days was studied. Subsequently, the effects of Enteromorpha-diatom on the properties of mortar at different growth stages over 0 to 360 days were investigated through changes in pH, DO (dissolved oxygen), microstructure, mineral composition, and microstructure in the culture medium. The results showed that Enteromorpha-diatom organisms significantly affected the pH and DO in water through photosynthesis and metabolic activities. Additionally, the adhesion of Enteromorpha-diatom organisms significantly impacted the mechanical properties of mortar, with compressive strength decreasing by 46.1% and flexural strength decreasing by 39.0% over 0 to 360 days. Furthermore, the formation of biofilm, deposition of CaCO 3 , and accumulation of organic and inorganic substances altered the microstructure of mortar, changing its electrochemical characteristics. The electric flux change rate was 46.1%, and the internal impedance decreased by 59% over 0 to 360 days.

OH* electro-adsorption of platinum plays a critical role in the electrocatalysis of small molecules, including carbon monoxide and methanol. Recently, the OH* electro-adsorption has also been linked to the electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER and HOR), widely believed to be the result of the Pt-OH on the Pt-H formation. In addition, OH* is part of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline fuel cells. In this contribution, we report our investigation on the OH* electro-adsorption of platinum using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as a function of scan rate. Our approach builds on the recently reported rate-dependent CV methodology, which we have developed to measure the kinetics of the Pt-H formation. The adsorption mechanisms are determined by comparing OH* electro-adsorption kinetics as a function of electrolyte chemistry, from pH to the chemistry of cation. Our results show that OH* electro-adsorption rate depends strongly on the ionic strength but weakly on pH. What’s more, the OH* electro-adsorption rate is at least an order of magnitude faster than H* electro-adsorption rate in alkaline. Therefore, we think that the water forming in HOR is limited by H* formation or H2O recombination and the OH* electro-adsorption in ORR is likely not the rate-limiting step.

Reversible zinc-air batteries are widely regarded as one of the most promising candidates for clean energy conversion and storage technology owing to their cost-effectiveness, inherent safety, wide operating temperature window and high theoretical energy density.(1) In general, the performance of zinc-air batteries is heavily dependent on highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts, which effectively accelerate oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics. Among various electrocatalysts for advanced air cathodes, multivalent Co 3-x Mn x O 4±δ oxides, as the representative mixed transition metal spinel, have attracted widespread interest because of their O 2 catalytic potential and diverse properties.(2) In comparison to the state-of-the-art Pt- and Ir-based catalysts, the catalytic performances of Co 3-x Mn x O 4± δ remains constrained by its low electrical conductivity and inadequate ability to adsorb and activate O 2 .(3) Herein, we develop a unique pathway to achieve the self-reconstruction of the local micro-interface and electronic structure of Co 3-x Mn x O 4±δ via a combustion reaction coupled with a high-temperature reduction process. The Co particles derived from the self-reconstructed Co x @Co 1.5-x Mn 1.5 O 4-δ catalyst not only facilitate the formation of a metal/oxide heterojunction active interface but also improve the electrical conductivity. More importantly, Co metal precipitated from the tetrahedral site with high spin electronic configuration induces the transformation of lattice oxygen into oxygen vacancies, thereby effectively accelerating reactant adsorption. As expected, the Co x @Co 1.5-x Mn 1.5 O 4-δ catalyst shows good ORR/OER activity with low overpotential. Furthermore, the zinc-air battery assembled by Co x @Co 1.5-x Mn 1.5 O 4-δ catalyst demonstrates an extended charge-discharge lifespan exceeding 1000 hours, significantly surpassing that of the Pt/C+Ir/C catalyst (100 hours). The primary factor contributing to its high stability is the dimensional growth following catalyst reconstitution. This work offers novel insights into enhancing the small molecule electrocatalytic performance of typical mixed transition metal oxides, including spinel and perovskite catalysts. References A.

Lithium-ion batteries have become an irreplaceable part of daily life, yet state-of-art LIBs could not meet the growing demand of higher energy density partially due to limited choices for the cathode and the electrolyte that can provide the desired safety and reliability. One of the solutions is to move towards higher voltage systems. To rationalize the CEI design, on the electrolyte side, fundamental studies of electrochemical decomposition behavior at high voltage of common electrolytes, typically using carbonate-based organic solvent, remain incomplete despite experimental and computational efforts. Several decomposition products of EC were identified, mostly pointing at ring-opened linear molecules such as CO, CO 2 , glycolic acid and oxalic acid with the presence of active/singlet oxygen or PEO-like polymer owing to Lewis acid induced polymerization. However, in some cases there were no ring opening observed with EC forming vinylene carbonate (VC) or poly-EC instead. While the mechanism of ring-opening reactions that involve deprotonation, nucleophilic and/or electrophilic reactions are straightforward and widely reported, full reaction mechanisms pathways are not yet realized. In this study we combined experimental and computational NMR to track the dynamic evolution of intermediate species to discover their chemical nature by following their NMR fingerprints. The findings will be presented to provide a clearer picture of the effects of high voltage on electrolyte systems in general and their implications on overall battery chemistry.

ABSTRACT The electrocatalytic oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) are key processes used in energy storage and conversion. We have developed a highly efficient MnCo 2 O 4 nanostructure anchored with functionalized carbon black (MnCo 2 O 4 / f ‐CB), which has been characterized by XRD, FT‐IR, Raman spectra, FE‐SEM, and HR‐TEM analyses as robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for both HER and OER. At a characteristic 10 mA cm −2 current density, the MnCo 2 O 4 / f ‐CB composite ECs exhibit low overpotentials of 330 mV for OER and 360 mV for HER, respectively. Furthermore, the MnCo 2 O 4 / f ‐CB composite ECs exhibit superior current density, the shortest Tafel slope, and admirable durable stability in OER and HER together. Due to the supported f ‐CB, the MnCo 2 O 4 composite catalyst has more active sites, effective charge transfer, and longer durability. A high‐efficiency dual electrocatalyst can be developed from these highly efficient and dual ECs, which are comparable to standard noble metal–based catalysts. The synergetic coupling effects of high‐activity f ‐CB and MnCo 2 O 4 composites with appropriate morphologies are critical factors for the enhanced catalytic performances of the MnCo 2 O 4 / f ‐CB composite.

Abstract This work used high velocity oxygen fuel spraying technology to prepare three types of ceramic-based self-lubricating sealing coating on C/SiC substrates, with Yttria-stabilized zirconia as the matrix and different mass fractions of Mo and Ag as lubricating phases. The compositions are S1(50%YSZ40%CaF 2 10%Mo), S2(50%YSZ40%CaF 2 10%Ag) and S3 (40%YSZ30%CaF 2 10%Mo10%Ag10%SiO 2 ). The friction coefficient and wear rate of the coating were examined at room temperature (RT), 400°C and 800°C. The effects of different lubricating phases on the tribological properties of the coating were compared. The wear mechanism of the coating under different temperature environments will be revealed by clarifying the evolution law of the microstructure of the coating. The results show that the addition of Ag can improve the lubricating ability of the coating. Ag element forms a continuous and smooth tribo-layer on the sliding surface to reduce the friction coefficient of the coating. In addition, the lubricating effect of Ag element is more significant at medium and low temperatures. At 800°C, the S3 coating with both Ag and Mo exhibited excellent tribological properties. The wear mechanism of the coating is that it starts with adhesive wear and gradually transitions to abrasive wear as friction continues. This work provides theoretical support and experimental evidence for the construction of ceramic-based self-lubricating sealing coating with a wide temperature range.

In this study, we examined the flexoelectric characteristics of two-dimensional TiO 2 nanosheets. Our theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal an excellent strain-induced flexoelectric potential (flexopotential) by an effective defect engineering strategy, which suppresses the recombination of electron–hole pairs, thus substantially improving the catalytic activity of the TiO 2 nanosheets in the degradation of Rhodamine B dye and the hydrogen evolution reaction in a dark environment. Our results indicated that strain-induced bandgap reduction enhances the catalytic activity of the TiO 2 nanosheets. In addition, the TiO 2 nanosheets degraded Rhodamine B, with being approximately 1.5 × 10 −2 min −1 in dark, while TiO 2 nanoparticles show only an adsorption effect. 2D TiO 2 nanosheets achieved a hydrogen production rate of 137.9 µmol g − 1 h − 1 under a dark environment, 197% higher than those of TiO 2 nanoparticles (70.1 µmol g − 1 h − 1 ). The flexopotential of the TiO 2 nanosheets was enhanced by increasing the bending moment , with excellent flexopotential along the y -axis. Density functional theory was used to identify the stress-induced bandgap reduction and oxygen vacancy formation, which resulted in the self-dissociation of H 2 O on the surface of the TiO 2 in the dark. The present findings provide novel insights into the role of TiO 2 flexocatalysis in electrochemical reactions. Figure 1

In the electrocatalytic (EC) degradation process, challenges such as inefficient mass transfer, suboptimal mineralization rates, and limited current efficiency have restricted its broader application. To overcome these obstacles, this study synthesized spherical particle electrodes (FeNi@BC) with superior electrocatalytic performance using a bio-inspired preparation method. A three-dimensional electrocatalytic oxidation system based on FeNi@BC electrode, EC/FeNi@BC, showed excellent degradation efficiency of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), reaching 0.0456 min−1. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments showed that the excellent SMX degradation efficiency in the EC/FeNi@BC system was attributed to the synergistic effect of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) and revealed their evolution path. Characterization results showed that FeNi3 generated in the FeNi@BC electrode was a key bimetallic active site for improving electrocatalytic activity and repolarization ability. More importantly, the degradation pathway and reaction mechanism of SMX in the EC/FeNi@BC system were proposed. In addition, the influencing factors of the reaction system (voltage, pH, initial SMX concentration, electrode dosage, and sodium sulfate concentration, etc.) and the stability of the catalyst (maintained more than 81% after 5 cycles) were systematically evaluated. This study may provide help for the construction of environmentally friendly catalytic and efficient degradation of organic pollutants.

The significant advantages of alkaline electrolyzers, including their maturity, large capacity, and cost-effectiveness, have garnered considerable attention as viable applications for energy storage systems linked to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. These attributes offer economic benefits for managing fluctuations in electrical loads by storing excess energy as hydrogen, serving as an efficient energy carrier, particularly in long-term and large-scale storage systems. However, the fluctuating loads stemming from renewable power sources can impact electrolysis performance and potentially affect overall durability. Here, we will discuss improvements in the dynamic operational stability of alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE), mainly focusing on the electrodes, analyzing degradation phenomena. This analysis was conducted from the perspective of material design disciplines, combined with computational engineering and X-ray spectroscopic analysis. The dynamic operational stability of the screened electrodes in alkaline solutions was evaluated using accelerated test protocols. Importantly, no significant oxygen & hydrogen evolution reaction performance degradation was observed after the lab-scale dynamic operation tests, and no structural deformation or metal ion dissolution were found to occur. Furthermore, these electrodes were scalable up to an area of 2,500 cm2 and could be evaluated in electrolyzer stacks of 100 kW or higher. We believe that enhancing poor kinetic efficiency and mitigating component degradation would extend the system's lifetime, thereby improving the economics of alkaline water electrolysis.

Ordered intermetallic nanocatalysts supported on high-surface-area skeletons are of great importance in catalysis and have disclosed notable catalytic activity and stability that are remarkably better than their random alloy counterparts. Ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts are synthetically challenging, especially for universal and scaled-up synthesis, because of inevitable sintering and phase separation under high temperatures that promote atomic alloying and ordering. Herein, a universal solid-phase and scaled-up method is reported for synthesizing ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts with uniform size distributions and wide compositional spaces confined in ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) supports, where the strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates remarkably suppress the high-temperature sintering and phase separation even up to 1000 °C. Libraries of intermetallic nanocatalysts are successfully synthesized including 52 combinations of host platinum/palladium/rhodium with 15 guest elements confined in 4 OMC supports. Taking oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions as examples, the intermetallic PtFe nanocatalysts hold remarkable performance, whose activities reach up to ten times higher than commercial Pt/C and also are comparable to the best electrocatalysts reported recently. This feasible synthetic strategy offers an intermetallic library spanning from binary to senary materials for industrial synthesis and applications.

As an important phenomenon in the evolution of fire, the ghosting flame exhibits dynamic and irregular behavior in environments with limited ventilation. By ghosting flame, we mean the phenomenon where the flame separates from the fuel surface under certain conditions. This study investigates the combustion characteristics of the ghosting flame in pool fires within a coal mine dead-end roadway by small-scale experiments. Results indicate that the ghosting flame appears more readily and earlier when the fire source is closer to the heading face or when the oil pan size is larger. Additionally, the fire source's location significantly influences the type of ghosting flame observed. When the fire source is near the heading face, the flame predominantly exhibits horizontal-type ghosting flame; however, when the fire source is at the entrance of the roadway, only the edge-type ghosting flame occurs. Furthermore, dead-end roadway fires easily transition to ventilation-controlled conditions, leading to a continuous increase in the mass loss rate. The occurrence of a ghosting flame does not result in a sudden change in the mass loss rate. Moreover, the transient oxygen volume fraction when the ghosting flame occurs is related to the ghosting flame type and is also affected by ventilation conditions, fuel types, roadway structure, and the location of measurement points. Importantly, the root cause for the occurrence of the ghosting flame lies in the pressure differential generated by the temperature disparity between the two sides of the fire source.

Abstract Recently, metal‐based atomically thin materials (M‐ATMs) have experienced rapid development due to their large specific surface areas, abundant electrochemically accessible sites, attractive surface chemistry, and strong in‐plane chemical bonds. These characteristics make them highly desirable for energy‐related conversion reactions. However, the insufficient active sites and slow reaction kinetics leading to unsatisfactory electrocatalytic performance limited their commercial application. To address these issues, defect engineering of M‐ATMs has emerged to increase the active sites, modify the electronic structure, and enhance the catalytic reactivity and stability. This review provides a comprehensive summary of defect engineering strategies for M‐ATM nanostructures, including vacancy creation, heteroatom doping, amorphous phase/grain boundary generation, and heterointerface construction. Introducing recent advancements in the application of M‐ATMs in electrochemical small molecule conversion reactions (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur), which can contribute to a circular economy by recycling molecules like H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , and S. Furthermore, a crucial link between the reconstruction of atomic‐level structure and catalytic activity via analyzing the dynamic evolution of M‐ATMs during the reaction process is established. The review also outlines the challenges and prospects associated with M‐ATM‐based catalysts to inspire further research efforts in developing high‐performance M‐ATMs.

Producing clean energy is one of the world's greatest challenges today. The use of solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen is therefore of great interest. In addition to semiconductor materials, heterogenized molecular catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and water oxidation catalysts (WOC) have attracted considerable interest. The development and design of artificial molecular devices (i.e. artificial photosynthesis systems) using visible light requires the heterogenization of catalysts (CAT) and photosensitizers (PS). However, the correlation of structural heterogeneity, leaching of active components and degradation processes during illumination, as well as the continuous monitoring of reactivity have not been fully addressed. 1,2 Scanning electrochemical probe microscopy such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), and scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPEM), have been used to map light-driven water splitting and local electron transfer kinetics under in situ and operando conditions. 3-5 In this contribution, we present the deposition of mixed CAT/PS nanowires using earth-abundant BPh 2 -bridged, organometallic cobaloxime CATs and Ru-based ([Ru(tbbpy) 2 (mmip)]Cl 3 ) PS on various substrates using SECCM. Based on different studies an cabolime microarrays 6 , the nanowires are characterized with respect to their stabilty, elemental composition as well as their light-driven H 2 evolution activity. The H 2 evolution of nanowire arrays is imaged via SECM using Pd- and Pt-Black modified microelectrodes. In addition, submicron-sized electrocatalytically active cantilever-based probes, recently developed by our group, are used for improved lateral resolution. These probes can be used for colloidal force spectroscopy 7,8 providing nanomechanical properties of the studied materials. A thorough characterisation of the cantilever-based sensors will be presented together with nanomechanical and activity mapping of nanowires with different CAT/PS ratios. References: 1 C. Kranz, M.

Broadly conserved developmental programmes have been challenged with modifications throughout evolution, generating phenotypic diversification. A big part of this diversification arises from changes in the timing, order and speed in the formation of tissues, which together are included under the umbrella term heterochrony (Gould et al., 1977; Smith, 2002). Despite their relevance from an evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) perspective, the molecular mechanisms behind heterochrony remain unsolved, partly due to the practical challenges of cross-species comparisons.Limb development in tetrapods has often been used as a system to examine the mechanisms underlying similarities and differences in morphogenetic events, because a vast diversity can emerge from the limb's highly conserved and well-characterised developmental programmes. This system allows comparisons between species but also within individuals, by contrasting forelimb and hindlimb development. The differences between forelimb and hindlimb are not only characterised by their position along the anterior-posterior axis but also by their timing of formation and growth. The relative time sequence of forelimb and hindlimb formation varies by class. Aves develop both limbs synchronously, Amphibia develop hindlimbs first, and Mammalia develop forelimbs first, with marsupials showing the most extreme forelimb prioritisation (Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007; Chew et al., 2014).In a recent preprint, Zhu and colleagues compare chicken and mouse limb development to investigate the mechanisms behind limb heterochrony (Zhu et al., 2024 preprint). Two T-box transcription factors, Tbx5 and Tbx4, are known key players in the initiation of forelimb- and hindlimb-forming fields, respectively (Agarwal et al., 2003; Logan et al., 1998). Using RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR RNA-FISH), the authors quantified Tbx5 and Tbx4 transcripts to determine their expression dynamics across a time course in chicken and mouse embryos. While the expression dynamics of both factors were almost synchronous in chicken embryos, Tbx4 expression in the mouse hindlimb was delayed by around 18 h relative to Tbx5 in the mouse forelimb. However, upstream regulators of Tbx4, including Pitx1 and Isl1, were expressed synchronously with Tbx5, suggesting that a delay in the expression of known upstream factors did not cause the delay in Tbx4 expression.Species-specific cis-regulatory elements can control the timing of expression of a particular gene. For example, a marsupial-specific sequence promotes the early activation of Sox9 in the opossum neural crest (Wakamatsu and Suzuki, 2019). Zhu and colleagues investigated the influence of cis-regulatory elements by identifying chicken Tbx4 enhancers and comparing their activity to known mouse Tbx4 enhancers. Using elegant enhancer-swap experiments to test the activity of mouse enhancers in the chicken embryo, and vice versa, the authors confirmed that these elements were functionally equivalent, being activated at the expected time and place in both species. These experiments ruled out the possibility that sequence variation between enhancers would be responsible for the temporal shift in Tbx4, but different factors binding to those elements could still drive it. To identify differentially expressed factors that could act as Tbx4 regulators, the authors performed forelimb and hindlimb bulk RNA-seq analyses in mouse and chicken embryos at the time of forelimb and hindlimb initiation. These analyses identified cRel (Rel), an effector of the NFκB signalling pathway, as a potential Tbx4 repressor. Overexpression of cRel in chicken embryos resulted in a reduction in hindlimb bud size and lower Tbx4 expression. Conversely, cRel knockout mouse embryos showed scarce but earlier expression of Tbx4 in the hindlimb field. The authors reasoned that the low penetrance could be due to the compensatory role of other NFκB effectors such as RelA (Rela).Zhu et al. then analysed oxygen levels as a potential upstream regulator of NFκB signalling based on a link in other cellular contexts (Jiang et al., 2015; Yin and Juurlink, 2000). Furthermore, they argued that oxygen conditions are different during chicken (normoxia) and early mouse (hypoxia) development. Once the mouse placenta is functional, the embryo has access to higher oxygen levels, and this correlates with the timing of hindlimb formation. These observations prompted the authors to test whether oxygen levels could influence the timing of hindlimb initiation. They collected mouse embryos at embryonic day (E) 6.75 and cultured them ex utero under normoxic (20% oxygen) and hypoxic (5% oxygen) conditions for 1.5 days (ending the culture at the equivalent of ∼E8.25; i.e. before normal Tbx4 expression takes place in vivo). Remarkably, Tbx4 expression was initiated in mouse embryos cultured in normoxic conditions, but not in those cultured in hypoxic conditions. Concomitantly, cRel expression levels were higher in embryos cultured in hypoxic conditions, sustaining its repressor role.These interesting observations support the idea that hypoxic conditions could delay the expression of Tbx4 in the mouse hindlimb and raise more questions about the direct or indirect link between hypoxia, NFκB signalling and the Tbx4 enhancers. Moreover, this work opens up an exciting evolutionary perspective where one could investigate the timing of hindlimb formation in other mammals in which the maturation of the placenta occurs at different time points or in those where the placenta capacity, and thus the oxygen supply, is limited. Similarly, comparisons between oviparous and viviparous lizards could reveal whether the presence of a placenta delays hindlimb induction in closely related species. Interestingly, a small delay in hindlimb outgrowth can be inferred from the description of developmental hallmarks in Eremias multiocellata, a viviparous lizard, although some oviparous lizards also develop forelimbs slightly earlier (Lin et al., 2021).An interesting observation of Zhu and colleagues is that, when cRel was knocked out in mouse, the low-penetrant premature expression of Tbx4 always happened on one side of the embryo. This result is reminiscent of the left-specific defects that a moderate loss of function of Tbx5 – or of its upstream regulator retinoic acid – has been shown to generate in mouse embryos (Niederreither et al., 2002; Sulaiman et al., 2016). It remains to be determined whether this indicates that retinoic acid had an ancestral role in controlling limb induction, which was superseded in the hindlimb when the hypoxia/NFκB axis took over.HIF1α, a hypoxia response transcription factor, is needed later for early chondrogenesis in the limb bud (Provot et al., 2007). Therefore, oxygen levels could regulate different steps in limb morphogenesis; however, it is unclear if and how oxygen, HIF and NFκB factors coordinate the progression of these programmes.

Each cell in the human body is continually exposed to harmful external and internal factors. During evolution, cells have developed various defence systems, divided into enzymatic and non-enzymatic types, to which low-weight molecule antioxidants belong. In this article, the ionisation potential and electron affinity, as well as global reactivity descriptors of Vitamin C, Melatonin, Uric Acids, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, were theoretically investigated at the MP-2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory in the condensed (aqueous) phase. The vertical ionisation potential and electron affinity are discussed in terms of non-equilibrated and equilibrated solvent–solute interactions. Additionally, at the same theoretical level, the electronic properties of canonical and oxidised derivatives of guanine were analysed. The presented results indicate that the selected antioxidants for this study (Vitamin C, Uric Acid, NAC, and Melatonin) exhibit the highest adiabatic electron affinity, while guanine derivatives (Gua, OXOGua, Guo, dGuo, OXOGuo, OXOdGuo) are more prone to adiabatic radical cation formation. A red-ox balance (redox homeostasis) is crucial for intracellular signalling pathways that are reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RO/NS)-dependent. Should this gentle balance be disrupted, either by an overload or deficit of species, physiological consequences may result, which in turn lead to pathological outcomes. On the other hand, maintaining the stability of the above balance of antioxidants/radicals may result in the improved effectiveness and safety of anticancer radiotherapy/chemotherapy or combined therapies with a subsequent increase in a patient’s quality of life.

Tuning active site electronic structures is crucial to the efficient interconversion of electrochemical energy. The recent discovery of flat electronic bands in stacked atomically thin layers of graphene has sparked unprecedented interest in moiré superlattices with small twist angles (0.22º < theta < 5º). 1 A recent work in electrocatalysis demonstrated enhancement of hydrogen evolution using Ru embedded in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) nanosheets. 2 In this talk, we explore moiré superlattice effects for applications in PGM-free fuel cell cathode catalysts, where molecular oxygen is electrochemically reduced at the catalyst-electrolyte interfaces (i.e., oxygen reduction reaction, ORR) to power polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The activity, stability, and affordability of catalysts are current bottlenecks at the materials level that prevent widespread adoption of PEFCs in the clean energy sector. Replacing rare and expensive Pt/C catalysts with graphene-based structures would greatly aid in addressing cost, but co-optimization in the activity and stability of such structures is required. We will discuss the theoretical and computational framework needed to unveil the mechanisms and merits of TBG as an effective material platform for realizing highly active and stable ORR precious metal free catalysts. This includes the feasibility of driving 4 electrons ORR pathways on TBG systems as a function of twist angle, which will provide us with an activity descriptor. For structures demonstrating feasible 4 electrons reduction pathway, we will further explore stability against metal dissolution. These efforts enable us to explore the existence of “magic angles” of TBG in ORR applications. This work will leverage our prior efforts in developing activity and stability descriptors for electrocatalyst and atomically dispersed systems. 3–6 We will also combine uncertainty quantification approaches with multi-objective Bayesian optimization to navigate the TBG structural-chemical material space and suggest new synthesis target structures exhibiting both high activity and stability.

With ever-increasing production volumes of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the worldwide quantity of end-of-life (EoL) electric vehicle (EV) LIBs is expected to be 3.6 to 5.3 million metric tons until 2030. In order to meet legislative regulations, and reduce environmental and health risks, effective recycling strategies are crucial. Direct recycling, i.e . the direct reuse of battery components without breaking down the chemical structure, is a closed-loop approach allowing the reduction of costs, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions during recycling. Compared to well-known low- to mid-Ni layered oxides, LiFePO 3 (LFP) and LiCoO 2 (LCO), the promising Ni-rich layered oxides are supposed to be even more prone to severe morphological and structural degradation during charge/discharge cycling, making direct recycling particularly challenging. Here, spent cathode active material, i.e. LiNi 0.83 Co 0.12 Mn 0.05 O 2 (NCM-831205), is directly recycled via re-lithiation and reconstruction. Re-lithiation is performed via a solid-state reaction with lithium hydroxide monohydrate under oxygen atmosphere at 800 °C, i.e. mimicking original synthesis procedures of pristine Ni-rich NCM. In the directly recycled powders, polycrystallinity and high tap density are maintained, and the evolution of particle size and shape, specific surface area, crystal structure at the surface and in the bulk, and lithium content, are explored. Pristine-original performance is reached for 100 cycles in graphite-based full-cells and remaining issues including possible strategies are highlighted. In summary, the current status of direct recycling is reviewed, presented experimental results are contextualized and economic feasibility is discussed. Figure 1

Lithium metal is expected to be next-generation anode because of its low redox potential (-3.04 V vs SHE.) and high specific capacity (3860 mAh g -1 ), which can achieve high energy density by matching with sulfur or oxygen cathode. 1 However, Li metal anode is not viable until now due to the uncontrollable morphology and high activity during Li plating/stripping. 2 Especially the growth of Li dendrites, the formation of dead Li, and the broken of unstable SEI (solid electrolyte interphase), result in significant safety risk and low coulombic efficiency. Therefore, to obtain the stable Li metal anode, it’s important to investigate the behavior of Li plating/stripping and the properties of SEI. In recent years, concentrated electrolyte has received great attention as an effective means to improve the performance of lithium anode. 3 With the development of these electrolytes, new insights into lithium morphology and SEI composition have also emerged. Compared with that in dilute electrolytes, the solvation structures of Li ions in concentrated electrolytes are changed, thus the SEI components are also changed from solvent derived to lithium salt anion derived. 4 As a result, the morphology of Li and the performance of lithium metal anode are effectively improved. 5 However, how these changes in solvation structure and SEI composition affect lithium morphology during cycling, which is helpful to gain more information about the basic Li behavior, remains unclear. This study endeavors to elucidate the Li plating/stripping behaviors in concentrated electrolyte by operando X-ray computed tomography. The morphological evolution of Li on Cu current collector surface is investigated. In particular, the growth of Li dendrites and the formation of dead Li, as well as the evolution process between them, have received special attention. These results are helpful to understand basic Li plating/stripping behaviors during cycling and provide guidance to lithium metal anode improvement.

Water electrolysis is an eco-friendly technology that does not emit pollutants when connected to renewable energy and can obtain high purity hydrogen (>99.9%) through the process of electrochemically splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Among them, proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) has the advantage of high current density, low gas crossover, high gas purity, and high pressure operation compared to existing alkaline water electrolysis. [1] The material that shows the best catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is platinum (Pt), which has a low overpotential and high exchange current density. Therefore, it has been the subject of various studies in the fields of catalysis and electrochemistry to investigate the effect of the size and structure of Pt nanoparticles and nanostructures on electrocatalytic activity. [2,3] However, due to the limited resources and high cost of platinum, the use of platinum acts as an obstacle to commercialization of PEMWE. Accordingly, many studies have been conducted on the development of low-platinum hydrogen generation catalysts to reduce platinum usage and increase activity. has been in progress. In this study, a porous transport electrode incorporating a Ni catalyst in which Ru was atomically dispersed was fabricated through simple electrodeposition. The Ni 98.1 Ru 1.9 catalyst doped with trace amounts of Ru showed a low overpotential of 35 mV at –10 mA cm -2 for hydrogen evolution and a low Tafel slope of 31 mV with excellent stability. It was found that optimized hydrogen adsorption strength and improved mobility of hydrogen adsorbates on the catalyst surface contributed to high performance through density functional theory calculations. As a result of further verifying the performance and durability by applying Ni 98.1 Ru 1.9 to the hydrogen electrode of the PEMWE cell, it showed excellent performance of 6.0 A cm -2 at 2.25V cell and high stability operating at 1 A cm -2 for 50 hours.

Cobalt plays a significant role within sustainable energy technologies, including but not limited to hydrogen fuel cells for transportation, lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and portable devices, and electrolyzers for renewable hydrogen production. For devices that contain a proton exchange membrane (PEM), such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), cobalt-based materials are commonly used to perform the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. However, the PEM in these devices induces an acidic environment (pH = 1) that cobalt is thermodynamically unstable in under ORR and HER relevant potentials. This instability results in cobalt dissolution and as a consequence, substantial decreases in device performance and lifetime. To mitigate such dissolution of cobalt-based materials in acidic environments, a holistic understanding of cobalt’s degradation mechanism is required. To gain such an understanding, we have developed an experimental platform with comparable in-situ and operando techniques, including on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS), to concurrently monitor relationships between electrochemical output (current/voltage), time, cobalt dissolution, and product formation (i.e, H 2 and H 2 O). Under HER relevant potentials in acidic media (0.1 M HClO 4 ), it was observed that cobalt is active for HER and undergoes little to no dissolution (< 10 ppb Co 2+ ) while evolving H 2 , per comparable EC-MS and ICP-MS experiments. These observations suggest that cobalt stability in acidic media strongly coincides with hydrogen evolution. Additionally, these data showcase a surprising window of stability for cobalt that is different than would have been predicted with classical chemical thermodynamics (i.e., Pourbaix diagrams). Along with cobalt being HER active, we have also uncovered its activity for ORR in acidic media (O 2 saturated 0.1 M HClO 4 ). Furthermore, the rate of cobalt dissolution was different in O 2 versus N 2 saturated electrolyte, where it was observed that cobalt dissolution initially occurs faster (~3x more dissolution) in the presence of O 2 . Altogether, this work showcases how time-resolved techniques such as ICP-MS and EC-MS can be combined to unravel material degradation mechanisms, with cobalt as a case study. This experimental platform has high potential to accelerate current understandings of material degradation, paving the way for new avenues to design and develop more robust and affordable materials and devices.

In the context of climate change, reducing the environmental impact of agriculture has become increasingly critical. To ensure sustainable food production, it is essential to adopt cultivation techniques that maximize resource efficiency, particularly in water and nutrient usage. The Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) is one such hydroponic system, designed to optimize water and nutrient use, making it a valuable tool for sustainable agriculture. This bibliometric review examines the evolution of NFT research from 1977 to 2023, focusing on the growing interest in this method as a solution to the agricultural challenges posed by climate change. Through the analysis of 774 scientific documents, this review highlights an upward trend in NFT-related studies, with a noticeable shift from conference proceedings to peer-reviewed journal articles, particularly in recent years. Acta Horticulturae has been a leading journal in this field, underscoring the significance of early conference contributions. Lettuce and tomatoes have emerged as the primary crops studied in NFT systems, demonstrating the technique’s broad applicability. Research on lettuce has primarily focused on nitrate accumulation and biofortification, aiming to improve both the nutritional quality and safety of the crop. Studies on tomatoes have explored challenges related to oxygen concentration in the nutrient solution, where innovations such as the Nutrient Drip Technique (NDT) and the New Growing System (NGS) have shown promise in addressing these issues. Other key areas of NFT research include the effects of water salinity on crop growth and the integration of NFT with aquaponics systems, highlighting its potential for sustainable, water-efficient crop production. However, challenges such as nutrient imbalances and disease management persist. This review underscores the growing relevance of NFT in the pursuit of environmentally sustainable agriculture. Continued innovation and research are essential to optimizing nutrient management, refining environmental controls, and exploring new crop varieties, thereby enhancing the potential of NFT for sustainable farming systems.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a severe and debilitating complication that can occur in patients undergoing radiotherapy to treat head and neck cancers. Characterized by bone necrosis associated with radiation exposure, ORN results in chronic pain, persistent infections and, in severe cases, pathological fractures and disfigurement. Dental intervention plays a crucial role in both the prevention and treatment of ORN. Pre-radiotherapy dental assessment, including preventive dental procedures and the removal of compromised teeth, is essential to reduce the risk of ORN. During and after radiotherapy, continuous dental monitoring, strict maintenance of oral hygiene and the use of adjuvant therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, are essential to minimize the risk of developing ORN. Modern radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), have been shown to be effective in reducing the radiation dose to healthy tissues, reducing the incidence of ORN. Collaboration between oncologists, dental surgeons and other health professionals is crucial for the effective management of osteoradionecrosis. Early identification of signs and symptoms allows for faster interventions and improves the patient's prognosis. In addition, continuous patient education on oral care is essential for long-term prevention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of current practices and to the development of more effective approaches to the management of osteoradionecrosis, emphasizing the importance of the dental surgeon's role in the multidisciplinary team. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a literature review, which looked at articles published in the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline/Pubmed) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo) databases. Terms such as: "Dentistry"; "Osteoradionecrosis"; "Cancer"; "Head and neck cancer"; "Treatment protocols" were used, covering the period from 2019 to 2023. Ro 2023, resulting in a total of 35 articles using the Qualis Periódicos evaluation criteria. RESULTS: Based on the data collected, it is possible to observe that the dental surgeon has the role of minimizing or even combating the progression of oral diseases that spread the evolution of ORN, through appropriate oral hygiene guidance that precedes the start of radiotherapy. Prior dental practice is of great importance so as not to compromise the methodology of the cancer treatment prescribed to the patient. CONCLUSION: The researched studies show that the dental surgeon, as a member of the oncology team, should work early in radiotherapy, with the aim of reducing the progression of the disease through oral hygiene guidance, periodic visits to the dentist, avoiding the progression of periodontal diseases and exodontia during the period of radiotherapy treatment.

The cracks in Micro Porous Layers (MPL) can have a significant impact on the performance of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs) [1–4]. For such a reason, the interest in researching and understanding the crack formation processes, as well as studying their final morphology, is rapidly increasing [2-4]. In this contribution, we propose a method for tuning the MPL’s cracked area and an analysis of the superficial and intersected cracks through a combination of optical microscopy, XTM (X-ray Tomographic Microscopy), and image processing. An example of optical images of MPLs with different cracked areas and the results of the segmentation process applied to them is reported in the Figure. After segmentation, the calculation of the cracked area yields values of about 4.5%, 1%, and < 0.1%, respectively, for the images in the Figure. By having good control and thorough characterization of the cracked area, we target a conclusive correlation between the cracked area and fuel cell performance. This is made possible by testing the cells in dry and wet conditions and by analyzing how the polarization curve and the oxygen transport resistance vary for MPLs with different amounts of cracked areas. In such a way, we aim to answer two questions: “Are the cracks beneficial for fuel cell performance?”; and most importantly: “What is the amount and type of cracks that optimize the fuel cell performance?”.

The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) is one of the promising pathways which primarily leverages electrocatalysts such as copper (Cu) to facilitate the conversion of CO 2 into higher value carbon products; C1 (e.g., CO, methane, formic acid, and methanol etc.) and C2 (e.g., ethylene, ethane, and ethanol etc.) using renewable electricity. Cu is the only monometallic electrocatalyst able to electrochemically transform CO 2 into higher hydrocarbons with appreciable activity and selectivity. However, Cu and oxide-derived Cu surfaces (OD-Cu) fall short in stability or durability during eCO2RR. One significant challenge is the cathodic corrosion of Cu. Cathodic corrosion leads to degradation of Cu surfaces, reducing their catalytic activity, selectivity, and long-term operability. In this study, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we delve into the intricate mechanisms driving this phenomenon. Our hypothesis posits the pivotal role of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in facilitating cathodic corrosion. Through comprehensive analysis, we establish correlations between various microenvironments, including subsurface oxygen (O sub ) diffusion, pH-dependent OH adsorption on the Cu surface, and Cu dissolution as a (Cu-OH) complex into the electrolyte solution. We rigorously calculated the pH-dependent OH adsorption on the surface, as well as the stability and diffusion behavior of O sub . Furthermore, our investigation explores the significance of under-coordinated sites in Cu corrosion. By integrating DFT-derived thermodynamic data into our KMC model, we successfully predict the formation of experimentally observed corrosion pits on Cu surfaces. This combined approach not only advances our fundamental understanding of Cu cathodic corrosion but also offers insights crucial for developing effective corrosion mitigation strategies. The data obtained from theoretical calculations were also corroborated with available experimental observations. Finally, the details of this study will be presented during the conference.

Ni-rich layered cathode materials have garnered significant attention as promising candidates for Li-ion batteries due to their high energy density. Although extensive research efforts focus on enhancing the structural stability of these materials through elemental doping, surface coating, and the use of electrolyte additives, the intrinsic chemical-mechanical instability caused by atomic- and nano-scale defects during the synthesis process remains a substantial challenge. Recent studies have focused on improving the cycle life of Ni-rich layered cathodes by fundamentally enhancing Li/O insertion. These enhancements have been achieved by regulating key parameters, including excess-Li content, temperature, and oxygen atmosphere during synthesis, often without the need for additional treatments. Additionally, a pre-calcination stage at 200–500°C is typically employed during synthesis to efficiently decompose the precursor. However, the precise rationale behind Li overloading remains largely unexplored, and comprehensive studies on the impact of the pre-aging process on the crystal structure and morphologies of Ni-rich NCM materials are notably scarce. In this study, we investigate the atomic- and nano-scale structural evolution of the Ni-rich layered cathode using X-ray/neutron scattering and electron/X-ray microscopy. Our findings reveal that excessive Li can be integrated into the transition metal layer of the layered structure by modulating the Li content and synthesis temperature. We present the first quantification of nanoscale pores in primary and secondary particles of the Ni-rich cathode using small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering analyses. Furthermore, we propose a simplified synthesis route aimed at mitigating the formation of multi-scale defects in Ni-rich layered cathodes, leading to superior electrochemical cycle stability. This research provides crucial insights into defect characterization and management, potentially driving advancements in the design and production of high-performance Ni-rich layered materials.

An efficient multi-functional electrolyzer with an electrodeposited Ni- and Fe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) anode and an electrodeposited NiMo cathode is designed for overall water splitting coupled with the desalination of saline water and production of acid and base solution. NiFe-LDH is characterized by abundant active sites for OH adsorption and an optimal binding energy for M-OH. Meanwhile, loading bimetallic NiMo on an active electrode for the HER has been known to improve the electrocatalytic activity and durability owing to its high surface area. The NiFe-LDH and NiMo pairs separated by a bipolar membrane (BPM) show overpotentials as low as those of noble metal catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in 1 M KOH and 1 M H 2 SO 4 solutions, respectively. Thereafter, the electrode pair with an array of anion- and cation-exchange membranes (AEMs and CEMs) in alternatively stacking manner showed the desalination of brackish water and seawater at specific energy consumption of 1.8 kW h m −3 , with concurrent production of HCl and NaOH. The Faradaic efficiencies of the device for O 2 and H 2 production are >95% at J = 100 mA cm −2 over 20 h, while the initial pH values of the anolyte and catholyte remain unchanged. The proposed multi-functional electrolyzer is highly promising for converting electrical energy into hydrogen energy, simultaneously desalinating saline water, and producing value-added chemicals. Subsequently, we compared electrodialytic performance over unit cell thickness, types of ion exchange membranes, and number of stacks in the device.

Abstract. This article presents a 45-year data series (from 1978 to 2023) acquired under the IGA (“Impact des Grands Aménagements” in French; Impacts of Major Developments) program, conducted by Ifremer for EDF (Électricité de France, the French multinational electricity utility company). The IGA program was established to monitor the ecological and environmental quality of the coastal area surrounding the Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), located in the southern bight of the North Sea. The main objective of this program is to assess medium- and long-term environmental evolution by providing means to identify possible changes in the local marine habitats. Since 1978, the IGA program has measured key parameters, including temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, oxygen levels, chlorophyll-a concentrations, as well as the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton species. These measurements have been taken at different sampling stations around the NPP, including the “Canal d’amenée” sampling station, for which hydrological and biological characteristics are considered as representative of broader coastal area of the southern bight of the North Sea. This data paper provides an overview of the main statistical characteristics of the time series, including long-term trends and shifts analysis. Despite the importance and length of this dataset, one of the longest available for this region, its application in advancing knowledge of hydrological and biological processes has been surprisingly limited. The aim of this paper is to make this valuable dataset available to the scientific community, stakeholders, and society to help decipher the local and global influence of anthropogenic activities in a world increasingly affected by climate change. Since all the main statistics and patterns are still available thanks to our analysis, the user should be able to use this data and combine it with other sources (in situ, satellite, modelling), in order to dive into deeper analyses, and to investigate new key scientific challenges as well as more specific ones.

Nitrate (NO 3 − ), one of the most crucial forms of reactive nitrogen, is widely used in industry and agriculture. Currently, NO 3 − is manufactured predominantly via a two-step procedure, including the Haber–Bosch process for ammonia synthesis and the Ostwald process for ammonia oxidation. However,both techniques require high-pressure and high-temperature reaction conditions (Haber–Bosch reaction at 150-200 bar and 400-500 ℃; Ostwald reaction at 4-10 bar and 800-1000 ℃), which consumes 1-2% of world energy and releases 1-2% of CO 2 . In addition, due to the complexity of the Ostwald and Haber-Bosch processes, it is only economical at large scales, leading to centralized production, which situation is poorly matched with the distributed nature of HNO 3 utilization. Therefore, bypassing the ammonia route and developing a direct and sustainable approach for NO 3 − synthesis is highly desirable. Electrochemical synthesis of chemicals has been regarded as an attractive alternative to traditional thermochemical methods since electric potential can replace high temperature and pressure in electrochemical reactions as the thermodynamic driving force. Therefore, direct electrochemical oxidation of molecular nitrogen appears to be a potential approach for NO 3 − synthesis,which could be sustainable, modular and easily integrated with intermittent renewable electricity. However, due to the lack of natural catalysts as a reference, the nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) still needs to be explored despite its enormous practical value as a replacement for the fossil fuel-driven two-step nitrate preparation approach. To date, only a few works have reported nitrate's electrosynthesis from nitrogen, and the proposed electrocatalysts can only achieve limited NOR activity and selectively due to the complex reaction networks which involve multi-electron transfers, multi-bond breaking and formation steps. In addition, oxidation evolution reaction (OER) as a competitive reaction further limits the selectivity toward nitrate synthesis. One major challenge in improving electrochemical NOR is that its reaction pathways and reactivity are highly sensitive to the catalyst-active-site identity and the non-catalyst components at the electrode/electrolyte interface, such as the local reaction environment. Even minor changes at the catalyst-reaction environment interface can significantly impact the overall catalytic performance.However, the previous works generally regarded the catalyst and reaction environment as two independent systems despite their dynamic interaction throughout the electrochemical reaction 20 . For example, most works improve NOR performance only by designing the morphologies, chemical states, and compositions of the catalysts. To date, a comprehensive design on the interplays between the above catalyst–reaction environment and the NOR performance is absent, which motivates us to employ a synergistic strategy to regulate both catalyst and reaction environment to achieve the overall optimization of the electrocatalytic interface from the microstructure to the macrosystem, thereby achieving the improvement of NOR performance. Here, we propose that the intrinsic property of the catalyst structure and its reaction environment can be considered as gradient interfaces, ranging from microstructure to macroenvironment, to achieve the effect of one plus one greater than two in terms of NOR performance. Specifically, we synthesized Ru nanoclusters confined within the lattice of TiO 2 (RuNC@TiO 2 ) as a microstructural interface and created a macro-interface environment through which we synergistically achieved exceptional NOR performance. The introduced TiO 2 , an oxophilic species with strong OH ad adsorption capability, inhibits OER on Ru active sites by competitively adsorbing OH ad between Ru and TiO 2 . Consequently, the OER on Ru clusters is effectively suppressed due to the preferential adsorption of OH ad on TiO 2 . Importantly, we propose leveraging a macro-interface environment by utilizing the previously considered unfavored oxygen from OER, successfully enhancing the NOR via Le Chatelier's principle. As an experimental demonstration, the as-prepared RuNC@TiO 2 delivered a record-high nitrate yield rate of 26.80 μg h -1 cm -2 (20.54 mol h -1 g Ru -1 ) and a Faradaic efficiency of 35.52 % under simulated conditions with high-concentration oxygen (8 atm air). In addition, an increasing nitrate yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (38.87%) after a continuous 20-hour electrochemical process was found due to the increasing oxygen concentration in the reaction environment caused by the OER.

A key challenge in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis stems from product oxygen bubble accumulation in the titanium (Ti) porous transport layer (PTL), which limits hydrogen production at high current densities. To design the next generation of PTLs with efficient porous structures that enhance bubble removal, obtaining three-dimensional (3D) water and gas distributions in an operating electrolyzer is critical. Previous works have demonstrated that neutron [1,2] and X-ray [3] imaging techniques can be used to quantify gas and water content, but capturing these phenomena with 3D imaging remains a challenge due to low transmission through metallic cell hardware, limitations in spatial and temporal resolutions, and low contrast between reactant water and product gas bubbles. In this work, we used the high flux neutron beam at the NeXT instrument of the Institut Laue-Langevin to perform operando radiography during electrolysis and to acquire tomography scans of the steady-state water and gas distributions. We designed a custom PEM electrolysis cell with a Ti PTL and serpentine flow field design for neutron radiography and tomography to reveal the water distribution and its evolution in the PTL. To correlate electrochemical losses to reactant distributions, polarization curves and EIS measurements were acquired. Operando radiography was employed to reveal changes in water distributions over time with increasing current density. Additionally, to elucidate the steady-state water and gas distributions at a variety of current densities, neutron tomography was utilized. Within our analysis, we reveal the impact of water and bubble distributions through the PTL on activation, ohmic, and mass transport overpotentials, particularly at the PTL and catalyst layer interface. The insights provided will aid in identifying performance degradation mechanisms and desirable reactant distributions for the next generation of PTL design. References J. K.

Since Fujishima and Honda reported photoelectrochemical water splitting using a TiO 2 electrode in 1972 [1], solar hydrogen (H 2 ) from water using a photocatalyst has attracted attention as a clean energy resource. Most recent research has been focusing on the visible-light sensitization of catalysts to effectively utilize solar energy. Our group has investigated water-splitting photocatalysts that are able to utilize the whole range of visible light and even infrared light on the basis of material designs and mechanistic approaches. We successfully created a solid-state hetero-junction photocatalyst, following a conventional well-known Z-scheme mechanism [2], but the present photocatalyst did not require any chemicals as a redox mediator. The solid-state hetero-junction photocatalyst is silver (Ag) inserted zinc rhodium oxide (ZnRh 2 O 4 (ZRO), bandgap energy ( E g ) of 1.2 eV) and bismuth vanadate (Bi 4 V 2 O 11 (BVO), E g of 1.7 eV), abbreviated to ZRO/Ag/BVO, where Ag, ZRO, and BVO act as an electron mediator, H 2 -evolution photocatalyst, and oxygen (O 2 )-evolution photocatalyst, respectively [3,4]. Overall water splitting, liberating H 2 and O 2 simultaneously from pure water at a stoichiometric ratio 2 to 1, was accomplished using ZRO/Ag/BVO irradiated with red light at wavelengths of up to 740 nm. This system functioned via the inserted Ag which could transfer photoexcited electrons from the conduction band (CB) of BVO to the valence band (VB) of ZRO. The photoexcited electrons in the CB of ZRO and photogenerated holes in the VB of BVO can effectively reduce and oxidize water, respectively, producing H 2 and O 2 at a molar ratio of 2 to 1. In place of BVO, silver vanadium oxide (Ag 2 V 4 O 11 (AVO), E g of 1.4 eV) was utilized to directly connect to ZRO, forming ZRO/BVO. ZRO/BVO accomplished overall pure-water splitting under irradiation with near-infrared light at wavelengths of up to 910 nm. The key point without an electron mediator is that the CB potential of AVO is almost the same as the VB top potential of ZRO [5]. Thus, photoexcited electrons transfer smoothly from the CB of AVO to the VB of ZRO. Notably, both ZRO/Ag/BVO and ZRO/AVO systems did not include a cocatalyst, which is inevitably required for the water splitting reaction due to the increase in the lifetime of electron-and-hole pairs and storing either electrons or holes. Thus, to enhance the water splitting activity, we tried to load a cocatalyst, platinum (Pt), Ag or copper (Cu), selectively onto the H 2 -evolution photocatalyst, ZRO, in ZRO/Ag/BVO to enhance the photosensitivity of this system. The loading of Pt, Ag, or Cu was performed by a photo-deposition method under light irradiation at wavelength longer than 850 nm. Under the irradiated light condition, only ZRO was photo-excited because the energy of irradiated light was higher than the E g of ZRO (1.2 eV) but smaller than that of BVO (1.7 eV). Due to the specific photoexcitation of ZRO, Pt, Ag, or Cu was expected to be only photo-deposited onto this material, generating Pt/ZRO/Ag/BVO, Ag/ZRO/Ag/BVO, or Cu/ZRO/Ag/BVO. The deposition of Pt, Ag, or Cu 3-fold enhanced the H 2 and O 2 evolution rates compared to those of bare ZRO/Ag/BVO, demonstrating that Pt, Ag and Cu functioned as cocatalysts for the overall water-splitting reaction [6,7]. In addition, we discuss on the selective loading of a cocatalyst, cobalt oxide (CoO x ), onto the O 2 -evolution photocatalyst, BVO, in ZRO/Ag/BVO and co-loading of Cu and CoO x on ZRO and BVO, respectively, at the conference.

The escalating presence of nitrogen pollutants in urine wastewater poses a significant environmental challenge. Among the array of methods available to tackle this issue, electrochemical oxidation processes that produce reactive chlorine species (RCS) from readily available chloride ions appear as a promising solution. Despite the investigation of various anode materials, current options continue to face challenges such as low selectivity in generating reactive chlorine species (RCS), instability, and significant energy consumption. This study investigated iridium-doped tin oxide (Ir-SnO 2 ) as an efficient, stable, and energy-saving anode for RCS-mediated treatment of urine wastewater. The Ir-SnO 2 anode surpassed counterparts like IrO 2 SnO 2 and Sb-SnO 2 , showcasing its superior electrochemical performance marked by high current density, minimal charge transfer resistance, and a significant active surface area. Additionally, it attained outstanding current efficiency of 91.7% and energy efficiency of 7.79 mmol Wh -1 for generating reactive chlorine species (RCS) at 30 mA cm –2 in a diluted 0.1 M chloride solution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborated experimental findings, indicating that the introduction of Ir to SnO 2 boosts chlorine adsorption by altering the electronic structure, thereby reducing overpotential and enhancing electrocatalytic activity for chlorine evolution reactions. Ir-SnO 2 also showcased impressive effectiveness in removing ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, and chemical oxygen demand, achieving efficiencies of 100%, 97.8%, and 89.1%, respectively. These outcomes rivaled those attained by IrO 2 (dimensional stable anode, DSA), surpassing the performance of the boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. Additionally, Ir-SnO 2 demonstrated the lowest energy consumption compared to benchmark DSA and BDD anodes when treating urine wastewater. In stability evaluations, the Ir-SnO 2 electrode maintained a stable anodic cell potential for 100 hours of continuous electrolysis in a 0.1 M NaCl electrolyte and remained operational over five cycles without any signs of deactivation.

The push to increase the driving range and lower the cost has prompted to increase the nickel content in layered oxide cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. However, as the nickel content increases, the cathodes encounter air, cycle, and thermal instabilities. These instabilities arise from the high surface reactivity of Ni 3+ and Ni 4+ . The reactivity of Ni 3+ with ambient air results in the formation of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate on the surface, termed as residual lithium, which not only degrades the cathode performance but also causes clogging during electrode fabrication. The high surface reactivity of Ni 4+ with the electrolyte in the charged state results in a reduction of Ni 4+ to Ni 2+ on the surface, loss of oxygen, formation of resistive rock-salt phases, formation of cracks, loss of active lithium, Ni dissolution and migration to the anode, and consequent capacity fade during extended cycling. The reactivity also leads to thermal instability, gas evolution, and safety concerns. The surface reactivity depends both on the surface characteristics of high-Ni cathodes and the electrolyte. Doping of the cathode with various ions is generally pursued to overcome these challenges. The doping generally improves air and thermal instabilities, but there is no clear understanding of which dopant does what. This presentation will focus on a systematic investigation of doping LiNiO 2 with various dopants, such as Co, Mn, Al, Mg, Ti, Nb etc. to identify the role of each dopant. The effect of dopants on air and thermal stabilities and gas release in the charge state will be presented. The reaction mechanisms involved and the nature of phases formed on cathode surface with various dopants in contact with air will be presented. This will help to design cathodes with appropriate dopants that have specific functions. In addition, a systematic investigation of various electrolyte compositions on the cycle stability and gas release will be presented. Also, the fundamental understanding developed with the use of advanced analytical techniques, such as in-situ XRD, SEM, XPS, and TOF-SIMS will be discussed. It will be demonstrated that the cycle instability and gas release can be overcome to a large extent by developing cathodes with a robust surface structure as well as by employing electrolytes with less reactivity with the cathode surface.

Piezocatalysis has gained considerable attention since it can deliver appreciable efficiencies by coupling the piezotronic and electrochemical effects. The piezopotentials generated by external stress are efficient in inducing charge carrier separation, thereby enabling energy conversion from mechanical energy (ultrasound, wind, and tidal) to chemical energy (hydrogen). However, the piezocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiencies currently remain lower than those from electrolysis or photocatalysis. An alternative approach to improve the HER performance is to activate the material using combined ultrasound and light ( viz. , piezo-photocatalysis). During the piezo-photocatalysis, the synergistic effect in charge carrier generation and separation from the creation of piezoelectric potential and photoactivation will lead to an enhanced HER efficiency. These phenomena indicate the synergy of the two processes, where the initial activation of the material by piezocatalysis overcomes the limitation of photocatalysis alone, thereby facilitating subsequent charge carrier generation and separation by combined piezocatalysis and photocatalysis. Our present work reveals the potential of piezo-photocatalytic in energy conversion,especially in splitting of water and seawater, using lead-free perovskites, including BaTiO 3-x (BTO) [1] and Na 0.5 Bi 0.5 TiO 3 (NBT) [2] nanoparticles. The BTO was purchased commercially, and further heat treated in H 2 to create defects. This annealing conditions were observed to impact the extent of Ti 4+ → Ti (4-x)+ reductions and subsequent defect formation, leading to structural alterations which affected the stability of piezoelectric tetragonal BTO domains. Furthermore, reduction also altered the energy band structure. An efficient H 2 evolution rate of 132.4 μmol/g/h was achieved from DI water using piezo-photocatalysis. On the other hand, the NBT was synthesized hydrothermally and then its defect structures were modified by varying the NaOH concentration. This engineering facilitates the substitution of Bi 3+ by Na + in the NBT solid solution, which also enables the regulation of oxygen vacancy and modification of the band structure. Consequently, the NBT exhibited an efficient HER rate of 140 μmol/g/h from DI water through piezo-photocatalysis. More significantly, the heterojunction also causes notable seawater splitting capability, with the HER rates of 68 μmol/g/h from simulated seawater and 58 μmol/g/h from natural seawater. This approach of piezo-photocatalysis represents a new strategy for commercial H 2 production, potentially using large-scale green technologies, including ultrasound vibrations deriving from wind energy and/or tidal energy (piezocatalysis) and sunlight (photocatalysis). It has the potential to provide the bases for novel systems aimed at a net zero emissions future while driving economic growth. [1] Y. Jiang, C. Y. Toe, S. S. Mofarah, C. Cazorla, S. L. Chang, Y.

Photocatalytic water splitting is one promising route to reducing the cost of H 2 production to industrially relevant levels. However, these systems are currently limited in their solar-to-hydrogen efficiency requiring further development in designing highly active and selective reaction sites. Reverse reactions, such as hydrogen oxidation or oxygen reduction, can greatly reduce overall system efficiency and are exacerbated by the close proximity of neighboring particles, which creates locally high concentrations of reactants. Metal oxide coatings have previously been used to selectively block undesired reactants from reaching the active sites, but can be limited in their ability to allow two different desired half reactions to occur as required for photocatalysts. In this work, we target selectively-deposited ALD of oxide films (e.g., TiO 2 and SiO 2 ) onto metallic co-catalysts for enhancing reaction selectivity while maintaining a high overall activity. Pt and Au were used an exemplary reduction and oxidation co-catalysts sites, where Au was deactivated towards ALD growth through self-assembled thiol monolayers while TiO x coated Pt suppressed Fe(II) redox reactions while maintaining the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The efficacy of the selective ALD growth was assessed through ellipsometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while reaction selectivity was assessed through cyclic voltammetry. A planar photocatalyst model of patterned interdigitated arrays of Au and Pt was developed to further assess the selective ALD on the micron scale. Patterned electrodes were evaluated through cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) and XPS, while reaction selectivity towards the HER over Fe(II) reduction was estimated using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Finally, interdigitated electrodes were used to simulate the effect of neighboring particle photocatalysts, where selectively deposited TiO x showed a significant reduction in reverse reactions over the uncoated samples.

Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic had a widespread global impact and presented numerous challenges. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has changed transmission rates and immune evasion, possibly impacting the severity. This study aims to investigate the impact of variants on clinical outcomes in southern Brazil. Methods In total, samples from 277 patients, hospitalized and non-hospitalized, were collected between March 2020 and March 2021, before the vaccine was made widely available to the general population in Brazil. Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was performed and bioinformatics and biostatistics analyses were implemented on molecular and clinical data, respectively. Results The study identified significant demographic and clinical differences. The hospitalized group exhibited a higher proportion of males (51.9%) and an increased prevalence of comorbidities, including hypertension (66.0%), obesity (42.6%), and chronic kidney disease (23.6%). Patients were identified with twelve SARS-CoV-2 strains, predominantly B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 in the early 2020 first wave, and P.1 overlapping in the late 2020 and early 2021 second wave of COVID-19. Significant differences in hospitalization rates were found among patients infected with the different SARS-CoV-2 lineages: B.1.1.33 (46.0%), B.1.1.28 (65.9%), and P.1 (97.9%). Severity markers, such as pneumonia (62.5%, p=0.002), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 72.9%, p&lt;0.001), and oxygen support &gt;6 L/min O 2 (64.6%, p&lt;0.001), were more frequent in patients from the second wave. These findings highlight the impact of different variants on the clinical evolution and prognosis of COVID-19, especially when comparing the first and second waves of the pandemic. Conclusions The study underscores the association between SARS-CoV-2 strains and COVID-19 severity by integrating clinical and viral data for public health responses during different pandemic phases, highlighting the importance of adapting pandemic strategies as the pandemic evolves.

Iron (Fe) metal is used to make steel, which is a critical component in manufacturing and transportation in the industrialized world. Close to 1.2 billion tons of ‘primary’ Fe is produced globally using carbothermic reduction of iron ore to Fe metal in a blast furnace. This process is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During carbothermic reduction, about 0.6 kg of CO 2 is emitted per kg of Fe, corresponding to 0.7 billion tons of CO 2 emitted annually by iron producers around the world. Furthermore, the steelmaking industry is highly energy intensive, accounting for about 2% of the global energy consumption.(1) Due to the scale of this environmental burden, energy-efficient and sustainable (GHG-free) Fe metal production that eliminates CO 2 emission has been the holy grail of the steelmaking industry for decades. Recently, electrochemical methods for iron production have been of particular interest for their ability to convert iron oxides to oxygen and iron metal in a low temperature carbon free process.(2, 3). However, electrochemical production of iron from aqueous systems poses several challenges. First the deposition potential of iron is -0.447 V vs SHE meaning that at any potential in which iron could be plated, hydrogen evolution will also occur as a parasitic side reaction. Minimizing or eliminating the hydrogen side reaction is critical to efficient deposition of iron and several pathways to eliminating this challenge have been investigated.(4) Literature suggest that that water-in-salt electrolytes at a wide variety of salt composition and concentrations have the ability to enhance or suppress hydrogen evolution rates depending on the choice of salt, concentration and electrode material.(5, 6) While hydrogen evolution as a parasitic side reaction can be a major drawback when developing aqueous based electrochemical metal production methods, minimizing this effect is but one of many considerations that must be addressed in the development of a viable process. In this work, we investigate several convoluting factors that affect the energy requirements and rate capability of iron electrodeposition such as conductivity, solubility, deposition kinetics, and efficiency as a function of the electrolyte pH and salt composition from relatively dilute systems such as 0.1 M NaCl to highly concentrated salt systems such as 7 M choline chloride that approach water-in-salt type electrolytes. We use careful measurement techniques such IR-free RDE polarizations, gas collection and impedance spectroscopy to quantify these changes on parasitic side reaction rates on an iron surface at potentials negative of the iron plating potential to ensure a stable substrate and to characterize typical operating potentials for an iron plating process. We then discuss the tradeoffs between this Coulombic efficiency improvement and other critical parameters to gain a holistic view of the capability of aqueous electrolytes to enable sustainable iron production.

The performance of next-generation Li-ion batteries (LIBs) for electric vehicle applications relies on energy-dense and low-cost lithium-ion chemistries. Single-crystalline LiNiO 2 (SC-LNO) cathodes are regarded as promising materials for high-energy-density applications owing to their high practical capacity, resistance to particle cracking and competitive cost [1]. However, under high voltage operation (≥ 4.4 vs. graphite), they experience rapid capacity loss, owing to parasitic electrode-electrolyte reactions expedited by surface oxygen loss [2]. Overcoming this, stabilising the long-duration performance of SC-LNO cathodes to operate at high voltages while maintaining capacity retention is critical for their integration into commercial batteries. Surface engineering by coating could provide an effective approach to tune the electrochemistry of Ni-rich cathodes while inhibiting degradation pathways [3,4]. Aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) coating is used as a barrier to eliminate highly reactive electrolyte species (HF) from the cathode surface, thereby enhancing long-term stability and improving high voltage performance [5,6]. It offers a viable strategy to control the surface of SC-LNO from O loss (O -n , n > 2) and protect it from electrolyte attack. In this study, we employ an ultrathin and conformal film of AlO x on SC-LNO powder via Powder Atomic Layer Deposition (P-ALD). To minimise moisture exposure, the slurry and casting processes were performed in a controlled dry room environment. Electrochemical testing was carried out in balanced coin cells ( vs . commercial graphite) at 25 o C and cycled between a voltage range of 2.5–4.2 V and 2.5–4.4 V. Following two formation cycles performed at a C/20 rate, the cells were cycled 100 times at C/3 rate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were also performed before and after 100 cycles to assess any impedance changes. The electrochemical data revealed that AlO x coated SC-LNO cathodes provide significantly higher capacity retention (94.5%) than uncoated ones (66.3%) after 50 cycles at 4.4 V ( vs. graphite). Regarding the rate capability test, the coated cathode delivers improved and stable capacities at faster rates compared with uncoated SC-LNO cathodes. Online electrochemical mass spectroscopy (OEMS) analysis of the AlO x coated cathodes indicates that the onset potential for oxygen loss related gas evolution is > 4.4 V vs. Li/Li + . In contrast, for the uncoated SC-LNO sample, this was found to be ~4.2 V. Hence, the AlO x coating serves as a protective layer, for the cathode against electrolyte-induced degradation and transition metal dissolution at high voltage by forming Al-O-F species at the surface [6]. This beneficial interaction enhances the electrochemical performance by effectively inhibiting impedance growth and improving the cycling life and stability of SC-LNO cathodes. This study highlights the crucial role of AlO x coatings in mitigating surface oxygen loss, which is a key factor contributing to the deterioration of cell performance and issues related to Li + kinetics. Our findings significantly contribute to advancing the development of high-performance SC-LNO cathode materials, offering valuable insights into the application of ALD coatings for enhancing the performance of Li-ion battery cells.

Electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies, which include fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries, photoelectrochemical devices are at the forefront of the transition to a sustainable future. Although they have all been in use for more than half a century, they are far from reaching their full potential as defined by the laws of thermodynamics. Their performance rests almost entirely on the electrochemical interface - the boundary between the electronic conductor (electrode) and the ionic conductor (electrolyte). The desire of both phases to reduce the surface energy as well as the appearance of electrochemical potential across the interface can manifest itself as the formation of unique (near)surface atom arrangements (e.g. surface relaxation or reconstruction), as significant differences in electrode composition close to the surface (e.g. segregation profile), via substrate-adsorbate covalent and non-covalent interactions, via formation of a passive film as well as ordering of solvent and/or electrolyte molecules several nm away from the surface. This extremely complex and sensitive "interfacial bridge", is a consequence of inherent incompatibility of two materials, brought into contact, and is very hard to control. However, to control it means to control the energy efficiency, power density, durability and safety – the most important metrics of any energy conversion and storage device. In this presentation we will discuss, how the chemical nature of non-covalently and covalently [1,2] adsorbed species as well as thicker passive films and their morphology at the electrochemical interface affect the individual terms of the common rate equation [1], including the free energy of adsorbed intermediates and adsorbed spectators, mass transport, availability of active sites and electronic and ionic resistivity for common electrocatalytic reactions in acid and alkaline aqueous as well as in non-aqueous media on a plethora of metal electrodes (Pt, Ir, Au, Ni, Cu) as well as carbon. We will draw parallels between HER, OER, HOR and ORR in electrolyzers [1], fuel cells [2] and Li-ion batteries [3,4]. The interphase properties will be discussed through the lens of deviations of modified electrode properties from its intrinsic properties. Examples of artificially modified interfaces [5,6] will be given to demonstrate our ability to tailor their activity, stability and selectivity to our liking. [1] Strmcnik, D.

There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change, and its conversion into useful carbon-based fuels or chemicals. Numerous homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been proposed to induce the CO 2 reduction and, depending on the reaction conditions various products that include carbon monoxide, oxalate, formate, carboxylic acids, formaldehyde, acetone or methanol, in addition to various hydrocarbons at different ratios. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To produce highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts, the transition-metal-based molecular materials are often considered. It is believed that, during electroreduction, the rate limiting step is the protonation of the adsorbed CO product to form the CHO adsorbate. Because reduction of CO 2 can effectively occur by hydrogenation, to optimize the conventional copper-based electrocatalytic approach, we explore such a model catalytic matrix as nanostructured tungsten oxide nanowires which are capable to undergo partial reduction to hydrogen-rich nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide bronzes. We demonstrate here that following the ntercalation of copper into tungsten(VI)-oxide-nanowires, the resulting electrocatalytic systems exhibits synergistic properties toward electroreduction of carbon dioxide, in addition to other inert inorganic reactants, such as oxygen, nitrates(V), nitrates(III) or bromates(V). In particular, evidence has been provided that hierarchically deposited films (on glassy carbon) of copper(I) oxide decorated with tungsten(VI) oxide nanowires and, subsequently, subjected to electroreduction and voltammetric conditioning to generate hybrid Cu/WO 3 catalyst can be successfully utilized to drive reduction of carbon dioxide (saturated solution, concentration, ca. 0.033 mol dm -3 )in a fairly strong acid medium of 0.5 mol dm -3 H 2 SO 4 . Here formation of the partially reduced tungsten oxides (H x WO 3 and WO 3-y ) is accompanied by consumption of protons and sorption of hydrogen, and it tends to inhibit hydrogen evolution by shifting the proton discharge toward more negative potentials. Our observations are consistent with the view that copper is irreversibly trapped (i.e., it cannot be reoxidized) within the network of WO 3 nanowires. The dispersed metallic copper sites seem to facilitate electron transfers and charge distribution in the catalytic layers. Among important issues are the capacity of copper-containing partially reduced tungsten oxides to induce reductions of nitrates, bromates and oxygen in acid medium. On mechanistic grounds, the existence of hydrogen-rich partially-reduced tungsten oxides, H x WO 3 , which contain large population of delocalized electrons and monoatomic H, or coexisting protons and electrons, H + + e - , is likely to induce hydrogenation of carbon oxo species, followed by protonation, in the vicinity of Cu to form oxo-hydrocarbon-type products. The hybrid Cu/WO 3 system, is also characterized by improved durability, relative to pristine Cu 2 O-dervied copper, as evident from electroreductions under chronoamperometric conditions. Our research aiming at optimization the material’s activity and selectivity have also concentrated on application of mixed oxides, e.g. WO 3 -ZrO 2 . Finally, the present study demonstrates the usefulness of certain diagnostic electroanalytical approaches, such as ultramicroelectrode-based sensing,chronocoulometric probing of the diffusional-type charge propagation dynamics , or voltammetric stripping and monitoring of small organic or inorganic molecules as electroreduction products.

Metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) based gas sensors have been identified as a promising solution for future applications due to their exceptional electrochemical, physical, and gas sensing properties. Due to their excellent optical and electrical features, ZnO nanostructures have become increasingly popular for gas detection applications, mainly because of their abundant availability. Despite its potential, the ZnO-based sensors have challenges such as poor selectivity and high power consumption at elevated operating temperatures. Transition metal doping, for example with cobalt depicted decent promising results in high response and selectivity of ZnO nanomaterials towards certain gasses. This study investigates the sensitivity enhancement of room temperature CO 2 sensors utilizing the cobalt-doped ZnO (CZO) nanorod architecture. The CZO thin films were deposited on glass substrates using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at varying powers. Structural, morphological, and gas response properties of the CZO thin films were analyzed. Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of resistance over time for CZO sensors when exposed to CO 2 gas concentrations ranging from 1 to 500 ppm at room temperature in dry air. In this investigation, the response to gas follows a consistent linear pattern within the 1−300 ppm range. However, as the concentration rises, a noticeable deviation towards nonlinearity becomes more pronounced. The sensor exhibits a heightened response across various concentration levels: 1 (8.9), 50 (12.5), 100 (14.79), 150 (15.7), 250 (18.82), and 500 (23.52) ppm. Discrepancies in the sensor response are attributed to the distinct surface morphology inherent to each sensor type. The introduction of co-doping enhances the occurrence of point defects and oxygen vacancies within the CZO sensors. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images reveal that the CZO material exhibits a highly organized surface morphology, characterized by densely packed spherical structures, and the cross-sectional analysis of the material shows a uniform thickness of 136 nm, indicating its potential applications in the field of sensing and detection, shown in figure 2. This study underscores the effectiveness of CZO nanorod architecture in rapidly detecting CO 2 at room temperature, presenting promising avenues for environmental monitoring and sensing applications Figure 1

Seamless integration of deep learning and computer vision is accelerating research that addresses the global energy challenge. This is particularly true in the field of renewable electrochemical energy devices, where much-needed progress hinges on the availability of high throughput characterization and the rapid and reliable analytics of large data volumes. The presentation will explore three different use-cases related to autonomous image analysis of polymer electrolyte membrane technologies across nano-, micro-, and macro-scales, aimed at accelerating and enhancing insights in this domain. For each case, a tool was developed that integrates image preprocessing, deep learning-based model prediction, feature extraction, and visualization of results. At the nanoscale, we have developed a tool for the autonomous analysis of 2D Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images to assess the size and shape of Platinum nanoparticles supported on carbon, the key ingredients in catalyst layers of polymer electrolyte fuel cells [1]. Progressing to the microscale, we will introduce a deep learning-based approach for analyzing micro-CT 3D volumes, focusing on the analysis of pores. This software is designed to perform multi-class segmentation of pores and liquid channels within gas diffusion layers (GDL), providing detailed insights into pore structures and water transport properties.[2] Lastly, at the macroscale, we showcase a tool developed for detecting oxygen bubbles in optical videos from polymer electrolyte water electrolyzers (PEWE). This application enables the time-resolved analysis of bubble dynamics within the flow field of the device, offering a macroscopic view of gas evolution and its impact on device performance.[3] Through these tools, our work demonstrates the potential of deep learning and computer vision to bridge the gap between scales in energy materials research, offering novel insights and expediting the analysis process.

Electrochemical energy storage systems (ESSs) are crucial for various applications, such as portable electronics, transportation vehicles, and large-scale grid systems. This is evident from the significant increase in social demand and market share over the past few decades. Li-O 2 batteries (LOBs) have the highest theoretical capacity among current batteries, but their capacities degrade significantly over charging–discharging cycles due to the irreversible growth/decomposition of Li 2 O 2 products in the positive electrodes. This degradation is due to low round-trip efficiency, slow rate capability, and poor cycle stability, caused by the sluggish dynamics of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Particularly, the uneven growth of Li 2 O 2 nucleation sites in 3D structures and the high overpotential for Li 2 O 2 breakdown during charging are major obstacles to achieving high capacity. In this study, we introduce a metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with lithiophilic sites attached to reduced graphene oxide (MOF@rGO) as a positive electrode material to address this issue. The ordered 3D nanocages were shown to control the size and shape of Li 2 O 2 growth over multiple charging-discharging cycles, indicating that N sites in MOF facilitate conformal Li 2 O 2 formation inside MOF’s 3D nanocages during discharging. During charging, these N sites also allowed for the adequate decomposition of Li 2 O 2 products within the 3D MOF nanocages. Conformal Li 2 O 2 growth during discharging was promoted, while Li 2 O 2 decomposition during charging occurred with a low overpotential (0.487 V vs. Li + /Li at 200 mA g c -1 ), outperforming the Pt/C-based electrode (0.857 V). The MOF@rGO//Li LOBs demonstrated an exceptional discharge capacity (17,275 mAh g c -1 at 100 mA g c -1 ) and stable cycling for 270 cycles at 1,000 mAh g c -1 under 2,000 mA g c -1 . Additionally, the high gravimetric capacity at low mass loadings (0.27-0.44 mg cm -2 ) and stable cycle operation at a high areal-current density (0.5 mA cm -2 ) highlight significant potential for practical applications.

The development of cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for advancing renewable energy applications. Recently, the authors identified the Ni 0.7 -W 0.3 sample as a promising alternative electrocatalyst candidate for HER in acidic media. However, further enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of this material is needed. Therefore, to improve the activity towards hydrogen evolution in acidic media, the influence of adding small amounts (≤10 mol.%) of Ru to the Ni 0.7 -W 0.3 sample was studied. Ruthenium is known for its highly efficient performance in the HER and is considered a promising alternative to Pt due to its relatively low price and similar hydrogen bonding strength. Low-Ru-loading hybrid electrocatalysts have great potential as efficient materials for HER, achieving a balance of low cost and high activity. Herein, ternary (Ni 0.7 -W 0.3 ) 1-x Ru x (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) nanocomposite electrocatalysts with different proportions of Ru were synthesized using the solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method, followed by annealing under a reductive atmosphere (10 vol.% H2/Ar flow) for application as HER electrocatalysts in acidic electrolysis. Morphological characteristics of the nanocomposite materials were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), along with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Microscopy techniques revealed a porous, coral-like morphology, a distinctive feature commonly observed in combustion products synthesized using the SCS methodology. EDX elemental mapping analyses confirmed the uniform dispersion of Ru, Ni, and W elements throughout the sample, suggesting a close interconnection of the ternary species within the nanostructure. N 2 adsorption/desorption measurements showed a high specific surface area and mesoporous structures in the as-prepared products. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the (Ni 0.7 -W 0.3 ) 1-x Ru x nanocomposites consist of Ru and Ni 0.85 W 0.15 metallic phases, along with oxygen-deficient WO 2 , with their composition varying depending on the Ru:Ni:W molar ratio in the precursor solution. Electrochemical assessments in an acidic medium (0.5 M H 2 SO 4 ) using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) unveiled that the incorporation of Ru into the Ni 0.7 -W 0.3 matrix yielded a synergetic effect, resulting in a significant improvement of the catalyst’s intrinsic electrocatalytic activity relative to both Ni 0.7 -W 0.3 and the commercial 5 wt.% Ru/C. This improvement was attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the change in the electronic structure of the catalyst induced by the interaction between different electrocatalyst components (Ru, Ni, and W), which effectively accelerated the kinetics of the HER, enhancing the catalytic activity. The change in the electronic structure was evident in the spectroscopy techniques, which revealed the shift in the oxidation state of Ru, inducing a downshift of the d-band center of Ru nanoparticles, resulting in reduced binding strength to reactive intermediates and improved HER kinetics on the Ru surface. Furthermore, its three-dimensional structure, stemming from the nanoparticle morphology and mesoporous structure, contributes to the high exposure of active sites throughout the nanocomposite material. This work has demonstrated that engineering the electronic interactions between ternary composite systems is a promising route for constructing high-performance electrocatalysts. Although inferior to the state-of-the-art 20 wt.% Pt/C, the ternary Ru-Ni-W nanocomposite emerges as a promising and cost-effective alternative cathode material for HER in acidic media. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop efficient and economically viable electrocatalysts for renewable energy technologies.

In a world with an ever-increasing energy demand, efficient and durable energy conversion devices for renewable energy sources are of great importance. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are among the industry-established systems for converting electricity into hydrogen as a chemical energy carrier. In these systems, the proton exchange membrane (PEM) has to separate the two evolved gases (H 2 and O 2 ). The degradation of this membrane during operation, e.g., membrane thinning, can lead to system failure due to electrical shorts or dangerous explosive gas mixtures of H 2 in O 2 [1]. Therefore, it is important to gain a detailed understanding of the membrane degradation mechanisms in order to develop suitable mitigation strategies and extend the device lifetime. One possible cause of ionomer degradation is the evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals, during WE operation, causing main chain scission and leading to membrane thinning [2]. Due to the very short lifetime of these highly reactive species, direct detection within the PEM is challenging. However, there is an indirect detection method possible that has already been applied to PEM fuel cells [3]: The membrane is infused with a radical-sensitive fluorescent dye and an optical probe is embedded within this dyed membrane [Fig.1]. This way, a fluorescence signal can be measured upon excitation with a suitable light source. With the membrane being exposed to ROS, the radicals attack the membrane as well as the dye molecules, which can be measured by a change in fluorescence intensity. This setup was adapted for the application in PEMWEs to measure the effect of various operating conditions of the cell on ROS production and, hence, to detect stressors for membrane degradation.

Marine and aerospace structures sometimes combine lightweight aluminum alloys with dissimilar metals to optimize mechanical performance and reduce costs. Unfortunately, the exposure of such dissimilar couples in a harsh environment can cause severe corrosion damage to the aluminum structure due to its position in the galvanic series. Corrosion of Aluminum Alloy (AA) 6061-T6 coupled to non-passivating and passivating alloys was studied to elucidate galvanic effects on local corrosion. In this work, local and galvanic corrosion were quantified, the effects of cathode material on local electrolyte pH were explored, and a relationship between pH and local-corrosion of AA6061-T6 was established. Experimental studies quantified local and galvanic corrosion of AA6061-T6 coupled to 316 stainless steel, copper, titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, and 316 stainless steel coated with titanium nitride, chromium nitride, and a sol-gel nano-coating. Galvanic couples were misted with 3.15 wt.% sodium chloride solution and exposed in a controlled temperature-humidity chamber. Galvanic currents were measured during exposure, and the total mass loss of the aluminum alloy was determined to quantify the corrosion damage. Exposure tests showed that galvanic corrosion decreases over time and accounts for less than 15% of the total corrosion of AA6061-T6. Therefore, most aluminum corrosion damage was caused by local corrosion. In addition, immersion experiments of AA6061-T6 galvanic couples in gelled 3.15 wt.% NaCl solutions showed that galvanic coupling influences the evolution of electrolyte pH leading to severe acidification at the aluminum anode surface and alkalization around the cathode. The solution pH at the aluminum surface was decreased by galvanic action and severity of pH decrease depends on galvanic couple materials and design. To quantify the effect of acidity on local corrosion of AA6061-T6, potentiodynamic polarization tests were performed in aerated and deaerated 3.15 wt.% NaCl solution adjusted to different pH values. Anodic dissolution reactions and cathodic oxygen reduction reactions show significantly higher anodic and cathodic currents for more acidic solutions due to the instability of the passive oxide film of aluminum. This film is stable in near-neutral solutions and unstable in highly acidic solutions. As a result, the breakdown of the passive film increases the effective area contributing to anodic or cathodic currents resulting in enhanced local corrosion. The series of experimental results show that galvanic interaction leads to a decrease of pH at the aluminum anode, and therefore increasing local corrosion of the aluminum surface. The increase of local corrosion induced in a galvanic couple depends on the cathode material and underlines the importance of accounting for local corrosion and pH-dependent corrosion kinetics when predicting the galvanic compatibility of aluminum alloys.

In recent years, a type of layered oxide, LiNi x Mn y Co z O 2 , shortly NMCxyz (where x+y+z=1), has become the preferred cathode material for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Despite some disorder in the crystal structure due to Li + /Ni 2+ cation mixing, the composition offers a high specific capacity of up to 200 mAh g -1 at 4.3 V vs. Li/Li + 1 . Despite offering high discharge capacity, Ni-rich NMCs have some disadvantages, such as lattice oxygen release and material degradation during deep discharge. Moreover, nickel-rich NMCs can react with ambient air, forming impurities on the surface, which complicates slurry preparation and further battery performance 2–4 . The objective of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the structural, morphological, and electrochemical changes in the NMC family (111, 622, and 811) after being stored in ambient conditions for at least one month. The findings of our study hold immense significance as they focus on the possible challenges that may arise due to ambient-air lithium extraction from NMC materials. However, there is no consensus in the literature on whether lithium on the NMC surface can harm the material's structural and electrochemical properties, reduce performance and safety concerns, or benefit its protective properties, especially for Ni-rich NMC 5–7 . An in-depth analysis of the electrode materials helps to understand the lithium extraction pathway and develop treatment protocols for each NMC family member leading to enhanced long-term performance and safety. Here with this presentation, we would like to underline another aspect not being considered in the literature before, regarding morphological evolution upon ambient conditions and its impact on electrochemical performance.

Sodium ion batteries are promising alternatives to complement lithium ion batteries in the modern energy storge market. Among sodium-based cathodes, layered oxides (Na x TMO 2 , TM = transition metal) are one of the most attractive candidates. P2 and O3 are two of the most studied structures in the Na x TMO 2 system. Regarding Na + conductivity, P2 is believed to be preferable over O3 as it provides open prismatic pathways with a lower energy barrier for Na diffusion. [1] However, a drawback for P2 materials is that they are typically synthesized with low Na content, often close to x = 2/3, and can rarely reach beyond 3/4, which is not ideal when building full cells. [2] The other major issue of P2 is the P2–O2 phase transition taking place at high voltage during electrochemical cycling, which is not well reversible and limits its cycling stability and capacity retention. [3,4] Our work aims to improve the Na inventory by doping inactive elements in pristine cathode materials while maintaining their cycling stability. In this presentation, we would first focus on a family of Li doped P2 materials with nominal compositions of Na 5/6 Li y Ni 5/12-3y/2 Mn 7/12+y/2 O 2 ( y = 2/18, 3/18, 4/18, 5/18). We report on the characterizationsof the crystal structures of these materials, as well as the temperature-resolved in situ XRD during their solid-state synthesis. These studies provide guidance for further synthesis of desired phases and compositions of the P2 materials. Electrochemically, this family of materials show an increasing trend of polarized hysteresis in the first charge and discharge cycle, which suggests the capacity contribution from oxygen redox. We coupled semi-simultaneous operando XRD and x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) to understand the structural evolution and redox behavior during this process. In particular, we observed that Li in the TM site mitigates phase transitions at high voltage, with a threshold likely between 0.15 and 0.18 Li per formula unit (f.u.). An increasing Li amount facilitates the activation of the O-redox starting at lower voltages (in attached Figure). To further understand the contribution by TM- and O-redox, we studied the gassing behavior using online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) to detect the amount and onset of oxygen release depending on the materials composition. We studied rate performance and cycling stability of these materials in half cells against sodium metal reference. The 0.15 and 0.18 f.u. Li stoichiometric compositions prove to deliver the best balance of cycling stability and capacity. We further applied these two compositions against hard carbon in exploration of their possibility in full cells. We also compared the electrochemical characteristics of similar compositions with distinct morphology. Finally, we would share the ongoing progress of other inactive element doping beyond TM layer, e.g., Ca in the alkali layers in the P2 materials. References [1] N. Yabuuchi, K. Kubota, M. Dahbi, S.

The pursuit to optimize cathode active materials (CAMs) stands as a paramount endeavor within academia and industry to push for higher energy densities in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). Predominately, aims have focused on the increase of the Nickel content of CAMs to achieve Ni-rich (> 80%) layered transition metal oxides such as NCAs (LiNi x Co y Al z O 2 , where x+y+z=1), owing to their higher achievable capacity at given cut-off voltages. With the increase in Ni-content, however, the structural stability of these CAMs is significantly decreased at high upper cut-off potentials, resulting in capacity fading. [1] The reduced structural stability is accompanied by the release of reactive oxygen species, occurring at ~80% delithiation. [2,3] The released oxygen can trigger a cascade of follow-up reactions, such as the chemical oxidation of electrolyte solvents, conduction salt decomposition, and transition metal (TM) dissolution. [4,5] Charging to even higher voltages (> 4.7 V vs. Li + /Li at 25°C) induces the so called electrochemical oxidation of the electrolyte, which as a result of its reactive reaction products, can induce further CAM degradation. [6-8] These reactions significantly impede the lifetime of batteries, and hence require in depth understanding of their underlying mechanisms to establish improved cell chemistries which enable high voltage operation of cells. On-line electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) for the detection of gas evolution, or synchrotron operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for the detection of TM-dissolution delivered valuable insights in the mechanistic understanding. [9] However, as these methods are very time and cost-intensive, a simplified cell design based on a dual working electrode setup was developed by our group, which enables the investigation of parasitic reactions without the use of complex auxiliary devices. In its first proof-of-concept application, it enabled the quantification of oxygen release via the measurement of reductive currents at an sense carbon electrode. [9] In the present study, we apply a three-electrode setup for the qualitative analysis of parasitic species formed when Ni-rich cathodes are charged to high cell voltages in LiBs. As in our previous study, the working electrode (WE) is based on LiNi 0.80 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O 2 (NCA; BASF TODA Battery Materials LLC, Japan) and the sense electrode (SE) is a carbon black based electrode (Vulcan-type carbon, XC-72, Tanaka, Japan), both coated on a stainless-steel mesh. As counter electrode (CE), a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) based electrode, delithiated to a degree of 90% and capacitively oversized was used, providing a constant CE potential (at ~3.43 V vs. Li + /Li). This setup allows us to cycle the NCA WE within a desired potential window, while holding the carbon SE at a constant voltage against the LFP CE. Hence, the SE can be used to reduce the species formed at the NCA WE, with the reduction current being a measure of their quantity. The experiments were conducted in a LP47 electrolyte (1 M LiPF 6 in EC:DEC (3:7)). We apply the developed cell setup to study the formation of O 2 , H 2 O, H + , HF, and dissolved transition metal species (TM z+ ) while the NCA WE is charged to 5.0 V vs. Li + /Li via an intermittent CV charging protocol at temperatures of 10, 25, and 45°C by holding the sense electrode at potentials where the parasitic reactions of interest can be probed. The hereby derived reductive currents are compared to temperature dependent gassing traces determined via OEMS, as well as the TM dissolution behavior measured via operando XAS. References: H.

This study proposes a new electrochemical method for extracting methanol and hydrogen from unused or discarded lignocellulosic biomass. Although some lignocellulosic biomass is being used as solid fuels such as wood chips and pellets, a large amount of lignocellulosic biomass is discarded. A need therefore exists to develop effective methods to recover resources and energy from these waste materials. 1,2 We have developed a method of using a graphite sponge anode to generate reactive oxygen species under relatively mild conditions of 75°C and ambient pressure in the process of extracting methanol from lignosulfonic acid. Compared with the conventional method that uses Pt anodes, the new method significantly improves the methanol yield. The use of graphite sponges enhances the demethylation of methoxy groups in lignin and inhibits the peroxidation of methanol to CO 2 , thereby increasing the methanol yield and expanding the surface area and capacity of the electrode to increase lignin utilization. In addition, hydrogen is produced at the cathode in this method and the electrolysis residue can be reused as a fuel for fuel cells, contributing to energy recovery and the efficient use of resources. The hydrogen evolution reaction proceeds in proportion to the current density at the cathode and is not affected by the type of reactants at the anode, imparting the system with flexibility to process various biomass wastes. An important aspect of this research is the ability to efficiently convert lignocellulosic biomass waste into chemicals, fuels, and electricity. In particular, the process can be run using only renewable energy while minimizing energy consumption, thus reducing environmental impact. In addition, for this research to be practical, estimating the amount of biomass produced annually in each region and the amount disposed of without being utilized, as well as the amount of methanol and hydrogen that could be produced using this technology, is important. We therefore used semantic segmentation to recognize forested areas in satellite images and calculated the forest area per region. Under the assumption of a model forest, we estimated the lignin content from the forest area and calculated the potential methanol and hydrogen contents. These estimates are expected to be useful in discussing the economics of methanol and hydrogen production from waste biomass. In conclusion, this study provides a sustainable recycling and estimation method for lignocellulosic biomass waste. In addition to the extraction of methanol and hydrogen, the electrolysis residue can be effectively used as a fuel to increase the overall efficiency of biomass utilization. This technology is expected to contribute to the reduction of waste, the recovery of resources, and the promotion of the use of renewable energy and is an important step toward the realization of a recycling-oriented society.

Nowadays sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attracting significant interest due to environmentally abundant and cost-effective sodium sources and are projected as an alternative to Li-ion batteries [1]. Getting from lithium-ion batteries to sodium-ion batteries presents many obstacles with regards to material advancement and comprehension of the underlying mechanisms. Certainly, during the last decade research focused on the study and development of SIB materials, particularly cathode materials [2]. Among the all reported cathode materials layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO 2 , where TM = Mn, Co, Cr, Fe etc) has been found to be appealing owing to its simple synthesis, high energy density and high capacity [3]. The structure of NaxTMO 2 can be described as P2, P3 and O3 where the letters P, O represent the prismatic and octahedral Na+ coordination environment and a number indicates TMO 2 layer [4]. Mn-based P3-type materials are seen as more renewable due to their ability to synthesize at lower temperatures than P2-type materials. These materials have the ability to provide high capacities but suffer from several phase transitions which leads to poor electrochemical performance. In order to enhance the cycling performance of layered cathodes, it has been demonstrated that employing doping in the structure [5]. In this work, we investigated the Cu-doping effect on Na 0.62 Mn 1-x Cu x O 2 ( x=0.09, 0.19 and 0.28) material properties. The Na 0.62 Mn 1-x Cu x O 2 materials are synthesized via solid-state method in the oxygen atmosphere, whose crystal structure and atomic compositions are confirmed by XRD and ICP-AAS. The HR-TEM, XPS, XANES, operando-XRD and in-situ DEMS analysis were employed to systematically examine surface morphology and structure evolution during cycling.

Li ion batteries are appealing for their high energy density and high working potential, however, concerns regarding their expense, access to raw materials and safety have steered researchers towards exploring new sustainable, clean, cost effective and efficient energy storage system. 1 Within this domain, aqueous zinc metal battery has emerged as potential candidate due to its impressive specific capacity, low redox potential, environmental sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, impediments such as corrosion of Zn anode, excessive dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution and dissolution of cathodes impose constraints on their applicability. 2 To tackle these challenges, numerous investigations show utilization of organic molecules (Triethyl Phosphate 3 , Pyridine 4 ) as additives or cosolvents. However, the use of high concentration salt and various organic additives reduces the ionic conductivity of the electrolytes and negatively impacts the cost and energy density of the battery. Along this line, we have delved into electrochemical properties of hybrid electrolyte composed of water and propylene carbonate, and their ability to form solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Through this exploration, we've noted a remarkable improvement in battery characteristics such as high coulombic efficiency and stable capacity. By introducing a small amount of propylene carbonate, we have observed substitution of water molecules solvating Zn 2+ ions with additives and triflate anions. This led to electrochemical reduction of solvated Zn ion species, forming a solid electrolyte interphase rich in ZnF 2 as confirmed by XPS. Moreover, spectroscopic investigations indicate a significant interaction between the highly basic carbonyl oxygen moiety of propylene carbonate (PC) and water molecules, thereby mitigating the dissolution of the cathode. 5 This phenomenon facilitates the attainment of remarkable specific capacity of approximately 300 mAh g -1 over the course of 900 cycles at a current density of 1 A g -1 . Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of considering the dielectric constant and polarity of an additive or cosolvent in evaluating the performance of the electrolyte for aqueous zinc ion batteries.

The world's dependence on fossil fuels for transportation and power continues to contribute to anthropogenic climate change. However, fossil fuels are depletable resources and therefore a renewable fuel and energy source is needed in the immediate future [1]. Hydrogen is an ideal candidate to replace fossil fuels. Energy can be stored in hydrogen bonds and released as electricity by hydrogen fuel cells, creating only heat and water in the process [2]. Traditionally, hydrogen is produced from steam methane reforming and coal gasification, where carbon dioxide is generated in tandem [3]. Therefore, a renewable method to produce hydrogen is needed. Hydrogen can be produced with zero carbon emissions in water electrolysis, provided the electricity used is renewable, e.g. wind, solar, hydro. Currently, the widespread application of water electrolysers is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively) that require large overpotentials and complex multistep proton-coupled electron transfer processes, thus limiting the overall efficiency. Efficient electrodes for water electrolysis are based on expensive and scarce platinum group metals, further limiting the widespread application of water electrolysis [4]. Ideally, water electrolysis electrodes should have high corrosion resistance, conductivity, catalytic activity, and surface area while being low-cost, widely available and scalable. Alkaline water electrolysis allows for non-noble, low-cost, transition metal oxides to be used as they are relatively stable thermodynamically compared to acidic environments [5]. Recently, Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides were shown to have high electrocatalytic activity and stability for the OER in alkaline conditions [6]. This led to a series of studies on optimising the activity of stainless steel, owing to it being an alloy predominantly composed of Fe and Ni while being low cost, widely available and having excellent corrosion resistance. In this research, we utilise laser surface texturing, a scalable, efficient and widely used technique to modify surface area and morphology [7]. We create microchannel arrays with 20 µm channels spaced 10-200 µm apart on stainless steel 304 (SS304), thus systematically increasing the electrodes’ surface area. The electrode performance for the OER/HER was evaluated by slow linear sweep voltammetry in a 3-electrode cell containing 1 M KOH. Results show that the HER performance is strongly influenced by surface area and morphology while OER is relatively unimpacted ( Figure 1 ). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry suggests the performance is not a result of modification of the surface composition. Tafel slope analysis shows that all textured electrodes have similar Tafel slopes to the planar electrodes, indicating that the texturing does not affect the rate-determining step revealing that increasing surface area is key to unlocking stainless steel’s potential for the HER.

Fuel cells and electrolyzers are key components in the energy transformation from non-renewable fossil fuels, to technologies based on renewable energy, such as solar and wind, which utilize or synthesize hydrogen (and oxygen) rich fuels/feedstocks in place of hydrocarbons. Following a brief introduction, a description of modeling activities, past, present and future, developed by the authors over many years, are described. Electrochemical conversion cells may be considered as natural problems in combined heat and mass transfer with the electrochemical reactions functioning as the main driving force for the interconversion of chemical and electrical energy, and heat. Ionic and electronic charge transfer within the electrodes and electrolyte must be considered, and multi-phase flow (liquid-gas) is also frequently present. The authors have led development of a suite of object-oriented open source models for both polymer electrolyte membrane cells (PEMCs) and solid oxide cells (SOCs), the emphasis being on generic (rather than specific) algorithms. The implementation is based around the popular open-source finite-volume-based software library, OpenFOAM. This allows the user access to a flexible framework/library of C++ classes, thereby allowing for further model research, as well as development appropriate to practical real-life applications. The main features of the methodology are described and explored both, with the benefit of hindsight from past experiences, and foresight to the problems to be tackled in the future. In addition to the above cell-level macro-homogeneous analysis, substantial work is being devoted to micro-scale analysis; for example, detailed studies of flow phenomena within the porous transport layers and electrodes of electrochemical cells as well as construction of digital twins of physical morphologies. These are necessary, not only for basic qualitative understanding and control of the underlying 3-D processes, but also to provide quantitative closure parameters for quantifying the dynamics of macro-scale equations (multi-scale models). The state-of-the art of CFD-based modeling in electrochemical science is presented with examples of PEMC (and SOC) technologies together with a discussion of the important issues and limitations of the present generation of models as well as examples of success stories. Some of the issues for concern include degradation and evolution of material properties, code stability and numerical issues, suitability of present-generation existing two-phase models (mixture, Euler-Euler, volume of fluid methods, etc.) to electrochemical applications, and computational issues such as parallel efficiency. In spite of numerous unexpected problems encountered over the years, great progress was, is, and will continue to be made in this quest for mathematical descriptions and prototypes of complex electrochemical processes and products, based on physical modeling. Artificial neural network techniques have found applications in tackling scientific and industrial challenges involving the concept of digital twins. In the domain of electrochemical cells, data-driven models or physically informed data-driven methods have been shown to provide valuable insight into issues that were traditionally explored using physical models. Areas for investigation include; material properties, performance prediction, and control strategies. By integrating physical/mathematical models with data-driven counterparts, a more comprehensive suite of methodologies should become capable to address ever more complex issues in the field.

Decarbonization of hydrogen production is critically important to the renewable energy economy, indeed, the US Department of Energy recently released the Hydrogen Shot, setting the target at reducing the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per kilogram in 1 decade. Of the electrolysis technologies that might meet the Hydrogen Shot goal, high temperature electrolysis based on solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) is particularly promising due to its high efficiency and the ability to avoid the use of expensive and scarce metal catalysts. 1 However, the harsh environment (high temperature, reducing/oxidizing environments, interfacial compatibility, and high current density) that SOECs are operated in presents a major challenge with respect to material stability. To reach relevant SOEC lifetimes on the order of sixty to eighty thousand hours of operation, drastic improvements in cell durability must be made. However, ageing cells on the order of tens of thousands of hours to characterize physicochemical changes at the material level to inform mitigation strategies is prohibitively slow. Accelerated stress test (AST) protocols must be developed to activate degradation mechanisms more quickly in the SOEC, enabling comparison of different materials and fabrication methods in a timely fashion. This approach will enable mitigation strategies to directly address degradation pathways identified as a function of testing conditions, SOEC physicochemical properties, and cell processing history. Several possible degradation pathways for SOECs have been hypothesized and identified, including cation migration into/across the electrolyte, particle coarsening in the electrodes and subsequent change in porosity, undesired phase formation, and others. 2 These can lead to increased electrical resistance, decreased mass transport rate of gaseous reactants or products, and deactivation of active sites through formation of inactive species. Particular attention has been paid to microstructural evolution of the fuel electrode comprised of Ni and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs electrocatalytically at the triple-phase boundary (TPB) of Ni (catalysis and electron conduction) YSZ (oxygen ion conduction) and pore space (gas phase transport), and any change in distribution of these three phases can result in both increased resistances and loss of active HER sites. Therefore, extensive effort has been made to understand Ni redistribution and optimize the Ni-YSZ microstructure to decrease the rate of change in Ni properties. However, there is still debate within the literature on the exact mechanism for Ni redistribution as both a surface hydroxide mediated transport and a particle curvature-based hypothesis have been suggested. 3 Furthermore, clear correlation of degradation symptoms, including Ni particle size change, migration towards/away from the electrolyte, Ni/YSZ de-wetting, and isolation of pore space/TPB with variations in initial microstructure or different operating conditions is still lacking. This work focuses on illuminating these relationships between performance losses in Ni-YSZ fuel electrodes with dynamic, AST operating conditions using X-ray nanoscale computed tomography (nano-CT). Nano-CT yields 3D microstructural information through image segmentation, which can then be used to track changes in TPB density, phase fraction depth profile, phase size distribution, and phase connectivity/isolated fractions. 4 This extensive set of properties can aid in identifying whether loss of fuel electrode performance is due to Ni coarsening, de-wetting, or migration. Understanding how Ni migration may be influenced by operating conditions will inform efforts to effectively suppress and slow degradation of the fuel electrode. These efforts will drive SOEC technology advances towards longer operating lifetimes, enabling cheaper lifetime hydrogen production. References (1) Hauch, A.; Küngas, R.; Blennow, P.; Hansen, A.

Wide commercialization of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) for electric transport stimulates a demand for safer batteries with higher energy density. Thiophosphate solid electrolytes (TSEs) for LIBs are one of the most promising candidates to replace a classical liquid electrolyte with volatile components owing to their high ionic conductivity values and appropriate mechanical properties for processing [1]. However, one of the main drawbacks of TSEs is their high sensitivity towards humidity even in trace amounts. The reactivity with water and moisture impacts the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes and leads to toxic H 2 S emissions. This aspect plays a crucial role for the choice of LIB manufacturing environment (dry room characteristics) and requires fine understanding of underlying mechanisms to optimize a performance / cost ratio for solid-state batteries (SSBs). In the present study, a unique combination of characterisation methods was applied to investigate the reaction between densified Li 3 PS 4 pellet and different levels of humidity (dew point (DP) -40 °C and DP=12 °C for 15 min and 2 h) from chemical and morphological/microstructural points of view. H 2 S gas evolution was accurately quantified upon a TSE exposure to humid atmosphere using a home-made flow-through setup with differentiation between surface and bulk pellet reactivity [2]. Further, top-view propagation of Li 3 PS 4 pellet degradation was investigated using SEM and EDX techniques showing fractures generated through gas released leading to some increase in the pellet porosity at DP= -40 °C; apparition of cracks and oxygen content raise in case of DP = 12 °C exposure. The bulk of the exposed pellets was probed using non-destructive X-ray nanotomography (ESRF, ID16b). Different scenarios were observed at low and high levels of humidity during 15 min and 2 h of the pellet exposure (see Fig.). Degradation front containing large pores and cracks propagated up to 50 µm to the depth of the pellet (~400 µm total thickness) after 2 h of exposure to DP= 12 °C. X-ray diffraction-computed tomography (XRD-CT, ESRF, ID15a) was employed to observe structural changes in 3D for Li 3 PS 4 SE upon its reaction with humidity at different depths. Minor changes were find in crystalline structure of Li 3 PS 4 after DP= -40 °C exposure while a reaction at DP=12 °C provoked formation of new phases propagating up to 90 µm depth of the pellet. Some of newly formed compounds were identified, i.e. P 2 S 2 O 3 , Li 2 HPO 3 , P 2 O 5 and Li 2 S 2 O 6 .2H 2 O. Structural strains for Li 3 PS 4 crystalline phase after its exposure to DP=12 °C were revealed thanks to advanced XRD-CT analysis. Finally, the impact of the pellet exposure to humidity at different conditions on its ionic conductivity was investigated. As a result of this study, a solid link was found between the morphological, microstructural, chemical degradation of the TSE and its ionic conductivity upon reaction with water. It was evidenced that the crack formation and propagation to the bulk of TSE pellet is a result of a complex cyclic mechanism, which includes chemical attack of H 2 O molecules on Li 3 PS 4 pellet surface, creation of mechanical strain for the TSE lattice, formation of solid degradation products and gaseous H 2 S, crack propagation due to the strain release and the gas evolution, further penetration of water to the bulk of the pellet, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first comprehensive study of reaction between SSE and humidity taking into account all the aspects above. This work contributes to understanding of key triggers for TSE deterioration in contact with different concentrations of water and to definition of proper environment for solid-state batteries production and handling.

Our research interests aim at establishing structure/property relations leading to rational designs of functionalized materials for efficient electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy conversion and storage. There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To optimize the hydrogenation-type electrocatalytic approach, we have proposed to utilize nanostructured metallic centers (e.g. Pd, Pt or Ru) in a form of highly dispersed and reactive nanoparticles generated within supramolecular network of distinct nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen-coordination complexes. Among important issues are the mutual completion between hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction and specific interactions between coordinating centers and metallic sites. We have also explored the ability of biofilms to form hydro-gel-type aggregates of microorganisms attached to various surfaces including those of carbon electrode materials. Upon incorporation of various noble metal nanostructures and/or conducting polymer ultra-thin films, highly reactive and selective systems toward CO 2 -reduction have been obtained. Another possibility to enhance electroreduction of carbon dioxide is to explore direct transformation of solar energy to chemical energy using transition metal oxide semiconductor materials. We show here that, by intentional and controlled combination of metal oxide semiconductors (titanium (IV) oxide and copper (I) oxide), we have been able to drive effectively photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide mostly to methanol. Application of metal oxides as active matrices in electrocatalysis is particular importance. The hydrous behavior, which favors proton mobility and affects overall reactivity, reflects not only the oxide’s chemical properties but its texture and morphology as well. For example, the mixed WO 3 /ZrO 2 systems are characterized by fast charge (electron, proton) propagation during the system’s redox transitions. By dispersing metallic Cu electrocatalytic nanoparticles over such active WO 3 /ZrO 2 supports, the electrocatalytic activities of the respective systems toward the reduction of carbon dioxide have been enhanced even at decreased loadings in acid media. The fact that WO 3 /ZrO 2 nanostructures are in immediate contact with the metallic catalytic sites leads to the specific interactions (via the surface hydroxyl groups) with the reaction intermediates (e.g. CO adsorbates). Formation of ammonia is one of the most important chemical synthetic processes. Under industrial conditions, ammonia is primarily been synthesized from nitrogen and hydrogen via the Haber-Bosch process which requires pressurizing and heating, despite utilization of catalysts. Consequently, development of low-temperature synthetic methodology is tempting both from the practical and fundamental reasons. An ultimate goal for electrochemistry is to generate NH 3 from N 2 at temperatures lower than 100ºC, atmospheric pressure, and with use of new generation of catalysts. Currently, most of electrochemical approaches to drive N 2 -fixation suffer from slow kinetics due to the difficulty of achieving the appropriate adsorption and activation of dinitrogen molecule leading to cleavage of the strong triple N≡N bond. Our recent studies, clearly demonstrate that coordinatively stabilized iron catalytic sites, e.g. iron-centered heme-type porphyrins or iron phosphide, FeP and Fe 2 P phases, have been found to act as efficient catalysts for the formation of NH 3 in alkaline and semi-neutral media.

LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NMC811) is attracting attention as high capacity cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, which potentially increases specific capacity and reduces cost by replacing the rare metal cobalt with nickel. However, NMC811 has an issue with cycle capability compared to the conventionally used LiCoO 2 (LCO). Various factors contribute the degradation of NMC811. Although the crystal structure evolution, such as cation mixing and oxygen loss 1 , surface reconstruction 2 and intraparticle crack formation induced by charge-discharge cycles were proposed 3 , previous studies tend to focus on the specific factors. In addition, the effect from high rate charge-discharge has not been analyzed. In this study, the cycle capability of NMC811 was examined at various rates. The particle morphology and the surface chemical state after charge-discharge cycle were examined X-ray computed tomography (CT) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), respectively. Composite electrodes were prepared by mixing cathode active material (NMC811 or LCO), conductive additive (acetylene black) and binder (polyvinylidene fluoride) in a mass ratio of 8:1:1. Current collector was an aluminum foil. 2032-type coin cells were assembled, using 1 M LiPF 6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate in a 3:7 v/v as electrolyte, and lithium metal foil as the counter electrode. Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements were conducted at cut-off potential 3.2-4.3 V at a rate of 0.1C and 2C. After the cycle test, the coin cells were disassembled, and the electrode sheets were washed with dimethyl carbonate and then vacuum dried. X-ray CT measurements of the disassembled electrodes were performed at the beamline BL20XU of SPring-8. O K-edge XAS measurements were performed at the beamline BL-2 of the Ritsumeikan University SR Center. When comparing the results of charge-discharge cycle tests over 50 cycles at 0.1C and 2C rates using NMC811 and LCO, a significant degradation was observed for NMC811 cycled at 2C rate. X-ray CT analysis compared the initial state of the particles with the state after 50 charge-discharge cycles. Only surface cracks were observed in the LCO, whereas cracks extending to the interior were observed in the NMC811 after 50 cycles. In addition, an increase in microcracks on the particle surface was observed at the electrode after 2C cycles for NMC811. O K-edge XAS obtained from the total electron yield mode reflects the chemical state of the particle surface. In the electrode of NMC811 after 50 cycles at 2C, the peak derived from active materials disappeared and the peak from surface film increased. These findings indicate that higher cycle rates in NMC811 induce mechanical stress on the particles, leading to cracking and the formation of a resistive layer, which ultimately cause significant capacity degradation.

The Southern Ocean plays a key role in atmospheric CO2 sequestration, accounting for ~40-50% of the anthropogenic CO2 absorbed by the modern ocean (Landschützer et al., 2015;Gruber et al., 2019). The Southern Ocean also played a critical role in modulating variation in the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in the geologic past on both orbital and millennial timescales (Anderson et al., 2009;Sigman et al., 2010;Gottschalk et al., 2016).Moreover, the Southern Ocean influences atmospheric and oceanic circulation in the tropics remotely, including low-latitude atmospheric CO2 exchange (Sarmiento et al., 2004;Hendry and Brzezinski, 2014;Sigman et al., 2021). Thus, the Southern Ocean is a key component of the global climate system through its influence on atmospheric CO2 variations at a range of timescales (Fischer et al., 2010;Rae et al., 2018;Dong et al., 2024) processes. These articles can be classified into the three themes explored below.Li et al. analyzed sea-surface temperature (SST) data from the Southern Ocean since 1870 to resolve why SSTs have been cooling since 1980 despite a global warming trend (Yang et al., 2023). They found that three main modes (i.e., the Global Temperature Anomaly, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) can explain over 70% of SST variability. The negative phase of the AMO and the positive phase of the ENSO counteract the effects of global warming, resulting in a cooling trend in Southern Ocean SSTs since 1980.Zhang et al. identified strong seasonal variations of siliceous microplankton fluxes and radiolarian assemblages from a sediment trap, which are dominated by seasonality in sea ice cover and plankton community composition in Prydz Bay polynya, Antarctica. The results of this study provide new insights concerning the fluxes and assemblages of siliceous microplankton as carbon-cycle proxies in the geological past (Ragueneau et al., 2000;Tréguer et al., 2017).Fe (FeHR) and organic carbon in surface sediments from Prydz Bay and the adjacent Southern Ocean. They discovered that the FeHR to total Fe (FeT) ratios are lowest for the surface sediments in the global ocean due to weak bedrock weathering and slow glacier melting. They proposed that the influence of FeHR on sedimentary organic matter significantly varies across different sedimentary environments and sediment categories. high versus low FeHR/FeT, respectively), which are linked to lower Fe solubility and primary production in the water column and to greater carbonate dilution/dissolution at proximal versus distal sites. This study underscores the significance of Fe dynamics in regulating glacialinterglacial atmospheric pCO2 variation in multiple oceanic regions, particularly in the Southern Ocean, where variation in dust delivery on glacial-interglacial timescales is pronounced (Lamy et al., 2014;Martínez-García et al., 2014).The influence of the Southern Ocean on atmospheric pCO2 and global climate evolution is complicated, being related not only to the carbon cycle but also to the nitrogen and silicon cycles, sulfur and oxygen cycles, iron cycle, hydrological cycle, and icesheet/ice shelf dynamics. The articles collected on this Research Topic represent state-of-the-art investigations into the above-mentioned biogeochemical and dynamic processes at a range of timescales based on modern observations, paleoclimate data, and model simulations. These collective efforts are of great scientific significance in providing new insights concerning the role of the Southern Ocean in modulating variations in atmospheric pCO2 and global climate in the past, present and future. Despite the progress made by the studies in this Research Topic, key scientific issues remain incompletely understood and will require further investigation in the future in order to achieve a better understanding of the role of the Southern Ocean in global climate change from the perspective of the carbon cycle.

Atmospheric corrosion on a steel is known to promote hydrogen entry into the steel. However, the mechanism of corrosion-induced hydrogen entry is still unclear, because it is difficult to detect the small amount of hydrogen entered steels due to corrosion. In previous literature, electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests with Devanathan-Stachurski cells have been conducted to detect corrosion-induced hydrogen entry. While the electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests can measure the corrosion-induced hydrogen permeation current with high sensitivity and high time resolution, the hydrogen distribution in the steels cannot be measured. It has been challenging to analyze the two-dimensional information of corrosion-induced hydrogen entry. In this study, a hydrogenochromic sensor consisting of the polyaniline (PANI) and Ni layers was used to visualize the hydrogen distribution in an Fe sheet under corrosion conditions. A PANI layer polymerized on a metal surface reacts with atomic state hydrogen in the metal, resulting in the color change from blue or purple to yellow or transparent. 1,2 The intermediate Ni layer between the metal surface and the PANI layer works as a catalysis of the hydrogenation reaction of the PANI layer. 1 Therefore, the small amounts of hydrogen that entered the metals can be visualized using the hydrogenochromic sensor consisting of the Ni and PANI layers. 3 –6 In this study, the Ni layer was plated on one side of an Fe sheet by current-static polarization at –30 A m –2 for 180 s in the Watts bath at 333 K. In addition, the PANI layer was electrically polymerized on the Ni layer at a constant voltage of 1 V for 200 s in a 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 -0.5 M aniline solution. A droplet of 0.1 M NaCl containing thymol blue was placed on the other side of the specimen (bare Fe surface). The color of thymol blue is known to be changed by the increase in pH from neutral to alkaline. Thus, the hydrogen entry behavior and pH change in the droplet were analyzed simultaneously by observing the droplet and hydrogenochromic sensor with digital cameras. Large crystallographic pits occurred in the initial stage of corrosion, but hydrogen entry was hardly promoted by the crystallographic pits. Subsequently, a rust-formed area was observed. Because the hydrogen entry proceeded under the rust-formed area, acidification was thought to occur under the rust-formed area, causing the hydrogen evolution reaction. The pH on the non-corroded area was alkaline, suggesting that alkalization proceeded on the non-corroded area due to the oxygen reduction reaction. The edges of the rust-formed area were close to the alkalized area, resulting in the thickening of rust at the edges. After the disappearance of the droplet due to drying, hydrogen entry almost ceased. However, hydrogen entry was confirmed under the thick rust layer formed at the edge of the rust-formed area. It was found that hydrogen entry is likely to proceed under the thick rust layer, which contains concentrated NaCl solution, even after the disappearance of the droplet. References: 1) H.

Geographical distribution of authors for the articles in the Applied Materials Portfolio Journals' Early Career Forum.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThis Forum highlights groundbreaking research and innovative ideas from the emerging authors in the scientific community. A broad range of topics are covered, among these, energy and biorelated research take center stage, with a significant number of papers dedicated to these fields. Given the diversity of the topics, it is challenging to single out individual contributions. Instead, I have approached this by analyzing the prevailing trends across the Forum.Energy research is undergoing a transformative phase, fueled by advancements in catalysts, photocatalysts, batteries materials, and fabrication techniques. These breakthroughs are driving innovations in energy storage, harvesting, and conversion technologies, offering sustainable and efficient solutions for the future. Multifunction catalysts and photocatalysts materials are unlocking new potential in applications such as zinc–air batteries, hydrogen production, and water splitting. (1−4)Progress in advanced photovoltaic materials, including perovskites and photonic nanomaterials, is accelerating renewable energy technologies. Thermoelectric materials enable the conversion of low-grade heat into usable energy, whereas lightweight, flexible materials, such as 2D structures and thin-film polymers, are paving the way for scalable solar films and stretchable thermoelectric generators. (5−7)In biomaterials, different types of nanoparticles are revolutionizing cancer therapy, imaging, and biosensor technologies. Stimuli-responsive materials are employed for targeted drug delivery and advanced medical applications. Meanwhile, bioinks and 3D-printed biomaterials are driving breakthroughs in tissue engineering and wound healing, combining biocompatibility with functional properties to support regenerative medicine. (8−12)I would like to highlight a few noteworthy articles in key themes such as energy, catalysis, and device technologies. In a perspective, Xin et al. discuss nonconventional electrochemical reactions in rechargeable lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, addressing the challenge of unstable polysulfide intermediates. The authors review innovative strategies to enhance battery stability and performance, focusing on modifications to sulfur allotropes, electrolyte composition, and electrode design. (13) In a related study, Shi et al. investigate the nucleation mechanisms of lithium pits and their morphological evolution across large electrode areas. Their findings reveal that overpotential is inversely related to pit radius and exponentially related to nucleation rate, offering new insights for predicting and controlling surface area and roughness in lithium electrodes under various stripping conditions (Figure 2). (14)Figure 2Figure 2. Selected graphics from ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces Early Career Forum, showcasing energy-related research, including studies on lithium–sulfur batteries and lithium pit nucleation.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideIn the rapidly growing area of electronics, two particularly exciting fields─optoelectronic synapses and heat harvesting─are showcased. Xu and co-workers present an organic optoelectronic synapse with multilevel memory, enabled by gate modulation. It mimics synaptic plasticity with both volatile and nonvolatile states, transitioning between short-term and long-term plasticity through gate voltage and light exposure. The device offers program/erase current ratios and stability, making it a promising candidate for neuromorphic systems in image processing and memory retention (Figure 3A). (15) In parallel, Cai et al. introduce a heat harvesting system that combines daytime radiative cooling with thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC). Using nanoporous polyethylene and MXene, the system passively generates a 35 °C temperature difference under sunlight, converting ambient heat into continuous electricity with a 50 mV cell voltage and over 20 mAh/g specific capacity, without external charging (Figure 3B). (16)Figure 3Figure 3. Selected graphics from ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces Early Career Forum.

Despite the challenges posed by vast geographical distances and relatively small populations (Australia: 26 million, New Zealand: 5 million), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) are renowned for their high quality innovative pediatric intensive care research. A strong culture of partnership across units led to the formation of the ANZ Intensive Care Society Paediatric Study Group (ANZICS PSG) in 2003, which has evolved since its formation into one of the leading international pediatric intensive care trial networks, along with two in the United States (1,2) and one in the United Kingdom (3). Here, we describe the factors leading to the growth of the ANZICS PSG, explore the current established research ecosystem, along with future plans to sustain success. ORIGINS OF ANZICS PSG The ANZICS PSG was established in 2003 as a working group of the ANZICS Clinical Trials Group (CTG), which had been in existence since 1993. This administrative change recognized the need for an organized research network of PICUs in ANZ. All PSG Member PICUs were based in specialist pediatric, nonprofit, public, university teaching hospitals. By 2003, ANZ already had established a centralized training body for pediatric intensive care medicine (initially as a Joint Faculty of the ANZ College of Anaesthetists and Royal Australasian College of Physicians started in 1998, and subsequently as a stand-alone College of Intensive Care Medicine in 2001). Recognition of the importance of clinical research for physicians in subspecialty training was underscored by the requirement that trainees had to carry out a research project. The College of Intensive Care Medicine set expectations and standards for ANZ PICUs, including recommendations for permanent Data Manager and Research Coordinator positions in all PICUs. Since the inaugural meeting of the ANZICS PSG in Sydney, New South Wales in 2003, representation was broadened to ensure inclusion of Research Coordinators and Nurse Researchers, as well as regional representatives. In 1998, the CTG had recognized the pivotal role of Research Coordinators in the design, management, and conduct of clinical trials in adult ICUs in ANZ. Soon after, it formed the Intensive Care Research Coordinators Interest Group to facilitate peer-led guidance necessary to support isolated individuals providing local clinical research infrastructure. In 2019, the PSG formally instituted a similar Paediatric Intensive Care Research Coordinator Interest Group. Between 2003 and 2023, the ANZICS PSG has endorsed more than 25 studies led by physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and statisticians. ANZICS PSG studies cover a range of research designs, recognizing the importance of a pipeline capable of bridging observational data on burden of disease, consumer engagement, and pilot studies to generate the necessary steps toward high-quality clinical trials (Fig. 1). In 2004 and 2005, the PSG carried out multicenter, prospective observational studies on prevalence of acute lung injury (4) and hyperglycemia (5), which established collaboration between PICUs and processes needed for centralized study management and data collection. Then, from 2006 to 2010, we used this organizational infrastructure to carry out our first phase II multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) of hypothermia therapy for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children (6). Invitation to the PSG to participate in the 2007–2011 phase III international "Cool Kids" (hypothermia vs. normothermia after severe TBI in children) RCT (7) followed and helped to establish the PSG as an international research partner.Figure 1.: Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Paediatric Study Group (PSG) research ecosystem strategy. ANZPICR = Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care Registry, ECR = Early Career Researcher, LTOs = long-term outcomes, MDT = multidisciplinary team.In recent years, like the U.S. and U.K. study groups (1–3), the ANZICS PSG membership has grown and diversified to include dieticians, pharmacists, and physiotherapists, as well as researchers from key academic partners. Working groups have been established to advance and coordinate the research focus and outcomes, the capacity given our population size, and the capability given our resources. We have also included consumer engagement, data science specialists, and new and early career investigators (Fig. 2).Figure 2.: Timeline of key milestones of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Paediatric Study Group (ANZICS PSG) and Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care Registry (ANZPICR). *Australian and New Zealand PICU trial run by a Paediatric Study Group member but not submitted for endorsement.

This provides a strong foundation for embedding the pediatric intensive care research agenda in the broader aims of the Society and its members. In 2003, the PSG found a natural home within the ANZICS CTG, which provided administrative and secretarial support as well as the opportunity to observe and collaborate with the adult intensive care scientific community, which was rapidly gaining a reputation for clinical trials relevant to real world practice. In recent years, exchange between pediatric and adult clinical trialists has helped facilitate the design and conduct of RCTs in children, by targeting the gap between adult ICU and PICU trials, which has enabled pediatric trials to occur even though, previously, they seemed unachievable. For example, in the period 2015 to 2021, adult ICU-inspired pediatric RCTs have investigated the role of vitamin C in sepsis (8), early adrenaline in sepsis (9), a comparison of dexmedetomidine to midazolam for sedation (10), and the use of high-flow during intubation (11). Seasoned CTG trialists provide mentorship, not only for the conduct of trials, but also for early career research development. The CTG has demonstrated that the path to sustainable, world-leading intensive care research is developed by network wide collaboration, a strong sense of partnership, dedication to fostering novice researchers, and regular face-to-face meetings. The annual CTG Scientific Meeting, conducted in Noosa (a resort town in Queensland, Australia), enables pediatric researchers to propose study designs, develop ideas, seek critical input and support for trials, and leverage the expertise of both adult and pediatric research groups to enhance research methodology. THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE REGISTRY The Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care Registry (ANZPICR) was founded in 1996. Its history has played an important part in the evolution of the PSG. It started with the development of the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM), a locally derived and validated prediction mortality score, requiring information from consecutive admissions to all seven specialist PICUs in Australia between 1994 and 1996 (12). This work was instrumental in enabling an international comparison between two models of PICU care: the distributed provision across Trent, United Kingdom, vs. the centralized model in Victoria, Australia (13). Based on 1994–1995 risk-adjusted mortality the authors demonstrated a possible excess mortality in the decentralized model of PICU organization. Subsequent iterations to PIM occurred in 2003 and 2013, PIM 2 (14) and PIM 3 (15), respectively. Now, the ANZPICR dataset is a health service mandatory requirement with central data quality checks that includes any and all ICUs admitting children. This process has fostered standardization of care, clinical collaboration, and benchmarking of practice. ANZICS PSG research using ANZPICR data has always been carried out as a collaborative undertaking between the PSG and ANZPICR. This activity has strengthened PSG productivity with observational studies in its early years and given ANZPICR clinicians' data to undertake secondary research. These investigations have assessed burden of disease (16), changes in therapies, diseases, and outcomes (17,18), and explored outcomes in specific diseases or populations (19–22). ANZPICR data are a frequently used and valuable resource for researchers providing accurate, contemporary, and population-based information about potential study participant numbers, use of individual therapies, and ICU and hospital outcomes. In recent years, the linkage of additional datasets with the comprehensive ANZPICR dataset, spanning more than 2 decades of PICU admission in ANZ, has uncovered in-depth insights into the risk factors and consequences of critical illness in children, which can inform future research and practice (23,24). Building on this extensive experience and sustainably funded registry, the focus of the ongoing PSG and ANZPICR partnership is now turning toward registry-embedded trials and how registry data and infrastructure might be used to collect short- and long-term outcomes for RCTs. As ANZPICR embarks on collection of long-term nonmortality outcomes (https://www.anzics.org/patient-reported-outcomes-and-experience-measures/), incorporation of core outcome sets to improve consistency and completeness of outcome data for clinical trials is gaining traction (25). EVOLUTION OF ANZICS PSG RCTs Over the past decade, the PSG has undergone an evolution in use of trial designs, marked by the transition from pilot studies, to traditional RCTs, with a more recent move toward incorporating digital and pragmatic trial strategies using innovative design (Fig. 2). This journey has been propelled by several success factors. First, the cultivation of a collective ethos, fostering collaboration and enthusiasm among multidisciplinary teams across ANZ PICUs and academic partners. Accordingly, in recent years, we have witnessed an increase in the diversity of professions leading ANZICS PSG studies. This has resulted in a balanced portfolio of studies addressing a more comprehensive range of clinical questions along the patient journey compared with earlier studies by our group. Second, our increasing familiarity with interventional trials has enabled confidence and a "can do attitude" that has led to increased sample sizes, and the ability to move from small-scale pilot studies to comprehensive trials that encompass diverse patient populations. Lessons gleaned from our catalogue of RCTs (6,8,11,26–28), and the timeline (Fig. 2), have not only provided invaluable insights into the development of robust trial methodologies, key criteria for successful collaboration, and utility of pilot work, but additionally fostered trust and collegiality in our collaborations, and created a spirit where performing RCTs in critically ill children is considered an essential component of PICU practice, rather than being burdensome. Third, the employment of pragmatic research designs (29) has facilitated empowerment and agency for PICU clinical teams and families, and has demonstrated feasibility of conducting interventional research in a high-risk context, such as acute cardiopulmonary bypass surgery where a consent rate of 73% was achieved (26). Fourth, we have benefited considerably from the implementation and research of alternative consent models, notably consent-to-continue (8,11,28), using similar approaches to studies led from the U.K. Paediatric Critical Care Society Study Group (3). By embracing novel consent frameworks, we have enhanced recruitment rates and streamlined trial processes while upholding ethical standards and safeguarding participant rights. However, consent-to-continue models remain challenged in some jurisdictions in ANZ, which represents an ongoing risk to the sustainability of effective interventional research in our setting. Finally, in the absence of a national trial unit comparable to the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre in the United Kingdom, we have sought to leverage each ANZICS PSG study to develop a more sustainable trial infrastructure, developing a comprehensive modular package of digital solutions, including a Research Electronic Data Capture-embedded platform for enabling high-quality data capture, optimizing efficiency in trial methodology and infrastructure. Additionally, the pandemic experience has underscored the importance of remote monitoring capabilities and propelled our methodological research investigating research monitoring practices (30,31). This research underpins innovation in best-practice approaches to risk-based research monitoring, can streamline ethical approval, facilitate effective interaction with Data Safety Monitoring Boards, and enhance reproducibility of trial data. These collective advances have strengthened streamlined data collection and standardization, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of our research endeavors. To enable more robust strategic planning and focus, in 2020, the PSG conducted a research prioritization exercise, to define key areas of research for children in intensive care in ANZ (32). A three-stage modified Delphi survey followed by face-to-face meeting with Hanlon prioritization was completed by 193 medical and nursing members aiming to rank key themes of research as well as important outcomes. Examples of key themes included fluid and vasoactive therapies, family experience, care of staff, respiratory therapies such as oxygen, and quality improvement initiatives. Key prioritized outcomes in terms of feasibility included short-term mortality, resource use (PICU and hospital length of stay, duration of ventilation), and, in terms of overall priority, long-term survival with good neurodevelopment and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as patient centered outcomes. This process provided the groundwork for developing a common framework for future research design and collaboration within the PSG. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER PICU: TOWARD LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP An increase in survival rates over the last 2 decades has seen a shift away from mortality as a primary outcome and inclusion of the longer-term impacts of critical illness (33). The identification of HRQoL and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes as critical for progressing research in the field, led to the formation of a PSG Long-term Outcomes Working Group (32). Currently, ANZ PICUs do not provide PICU follow-up services; recruitment into PSG research studies offering long-term follow-up is thus providing an emerging model of care to an underserved population. Accordingly, long-term outcomes have been included as secondary outcomes in most recent PSG trials where acute outcomes, such as ventilator-free days, are typically the primary outcome (8,26,34). In addition to HRQoL, we have developed a suite of validated questionnaires for follow-up by proxy incorporating more comprehensive domains under the post-intensive care syndrome-pediatrics framework such as adaptive/cognitive and behavioral function as well as family functioning and post-traumatic stress (35). As our understanding of the risk factors, biology, and long-term effects of interventions during critical illness remains incomplete, we are currently conducting a 5-year follow-up of the Nitric Oxide During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Improve Recovery in Infants with Congenital Heart Defects (NITRIC) trial population using annual surveys, followed by face-to-face neuropsychologic assessment (36). Complementary to the above studies, we have endeavored in recent years to conduct observational and interventional trials primarily focused on long-term outcomes; including surveys, cohort studies, data linkage, and clinical trials of follow-up models of care (23,24,36,37). Analyzing over 5000 PICU survivors, features related to socioeconomic status emerged as a key feature associated with long-term educational outcomes in addition to critical illness features in our population. While ANZ are considered high-income countries, inequalities persist and disproportionately affect the Indigenous populations of both countries, extending into worse health outcomes for critically ill children (21). A research agenda aiming to improve long-term outcomes for critically ill children in the ANZ setting thus needs to be optimized given the unique context of the ANZ population, geography, and consumer-identified needs to avoid recruitment and follow-up bias by social determinants of health. While parent-based questionnaires are not the gold standard of child development assessment, they provide the ability to collect the more nuanced outcomes of development that global assessments on HRQoL or overall function may miss, at a relative cost saving to the research budget (33). With growing evidence of significant premorbid impairments, our current studies to measure HRQoL and neurodevelopment at baseline aim to accurately determine the impact of the PICU admission and interventions above that already experienced by the child. INTEGRATING AND PRIORITIZING CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT In response to the increasing involvement of consumers in research development, design, implementation, and dissemination, the PSG Consumer Working Group was established in 2018. The group aims to encourage and support consumer involvement in PICU research by helping researchers to engage meaningfully with consumers and to identify the priorities and needs of patients and their families involved in PICU research. This process also provides an opportunity to build on previous experiences and iteratively improve the approach to consumer engagement, as well as avoiding uncoordinated contacts with families at risk of "consumer fatigue." This project has moved from a process of consultation with consumers on documentation and study videos (26) to their inclusion in study design, study oversight as members of Steering Committees (8), contributors to the critical care quality outcomes set (25), and follow-up design and conduct. The NITRIC follow-up study (35) has worked in partnership with consumers and consumer advocacy groups in elements of study design including development of study documentation and contact processes as well as designing the final aspects of the study aiming to explore families' experience of participation in the study. THE FUTURE: HOW ANZICS PSG WILL SUSTAIN AND GROW Four pillars form the core strategy of the ANZICS PSG for the coming years. These have been chosen to ensure ongoing growth in capacity and capability to deliver pediatric critical care research. First, to address trial costs. We are committed to pursuing digitalization of trials, including registry-embedded RCTs, from screening toward outcome capture. However, as healthcare infrastructure in ANZ remains heterogeneous in terms of electronic health records, achieving higher granularity of data (such as temporal resolution, details of treatment, and on pre- and post-ICU care) will require systems to enable reliable data extraction and linkage with ANZPICR. Second, we need to establish the infrastructure for platform and adaptive trials (38). We have successfully piloted a pediatric sepsis trial with elements of platform trial design, the Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Metabolic Resuscitation—A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study in the PICU (RESPOND PICU) (39). The study investigates early inotropes and metabolic resuscitation on overlapping populations, using a standard education package, and harmonized screening and data collection modules (8,9), and confirms the feasibility and benefit of this approach. These developments can underpin the framework to incorporate arising questions, for example, on artificial intelligence-decision support tools, in a more agile way than previously. Third, these designs will become even more relevant as we seek to develop and validate precision-medicine strategies for critically ill children. Seeking to decipher the heterogeneity of patients in terms of clinical behavior and underlying biological mechanisms (40), we have committed to biobanking in several trials which are currently undergoing multiomic analyses. This strategy places additional demands on recruiting sites, brings additional ethical challenges to families, and is reliant on additional funding and external partnerships. Finally, while ANZ has the advantage of relative homogeneity of clinical practice within a well-resourced context supported by solid research infrastructure, this setting is not generalizable to the global PICU populations and, increasingly, even such a network will not be able to power trials adequately to answer pressing questions. Thus, ANZICS PSG in recent years has sought to strengthen international partnerships. We are convinced that commitment toward a sustainable International PICU Trial Network is essential. We therefore look forward to contributing to the ongoing learning of the international PICU community as it delivers better outcomes for critically ill children and their families across the globe.
