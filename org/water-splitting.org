Designing ultrathin transition metal electrocatalysts with optimal surface chemistry state is crucial for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the structure‐dependent electrochemical performance and the underlying catalytic mechanisms are still not clearly distinguished. Herein, we synthesize ultrathin Co6.8Se8 nanosheets (NSs) with subnanometer thickness by incorporating catalytically inactive selenium (Se) into ultrathin Co(OH)2, thereby switching the OER reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM). The prepared ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit an overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA/cm2, outperforming the mostly reported Co‐based electrocatalysts. Advanced operando synchrotron spectroscopies and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs, whose surface is reconstructed into Se‐doped Co(OH)2 during the OER process, could trigger direct O*‐O* radical coupling rather than OOH* intermediates within AEM pathway thus lowering the energy input. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Co6.8Se8 NSs with shorter Co‐Co bond length and stable Co‐Se bond could optimize the rate‐determining step barrier via OPM pathway. Besides, rechargeable zinc‐air batteries based on Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit excellent stability for more than 500 h of continuous charge‐discharge cycles at 4 mA/cm2. The present study highlights the structural‐dependent switch of OER pathways and provides valuable insights for further development of ultrathin OER catalysts.

Abstract The development of robust and efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been the main focus of water electrolysis but remains a great challenge. Here, the synthesis of a highly active and ultra‐stable Fe‐CoOOH electrocatalyst is reported by steering raw cobalt foam via an in situ solution combustion method assisted by a galvanic replacement reaction and subsequent electrochemical reconstruction of the CoFeO x pre‐catalyst. In/ ex situ electrochemical analysis and physicochemical characterizations show that the CoFeO x undergoes quick chemical and slow morphological reconstruction to Fe‐CoOOH nanosheets. The Fe‐CoOOH possesses a semi‐crystalline nature with distinct short‐range ordering and outstanding OER activity with overpotentials as low as 271 and 291 mV at current densities of 500 and 1,000 mA cm −2 , respectively. The remarkable stability under 1,000 mA cm −2 for at least 700 h is achieved. Theoretical calculations confirm the crucial role of Fe doping in facilitating surface reconstruction, enhancing OER activity, and improving the stability of the Fe‐CoOOH. Comparative analysis with other transition metals doping reveals the unique ability of Fe to adsorb onto the CoOOH surface, thereby modulating the electronic density and facilitating faster adsorption of reaction intermediates. This work represents valuable insights into the surface reconstruction and doping processes.

Abstract Spinel‐structured transition metal (TM) oxides have shown great potential as a sustainable alternative to platinum group metal‐based electrocatalysts. Among them, high‐entropy oxides (HEOs) with multiple TM‐cation sites are suitable for engineering octahedral redox‐active centers to enhance the catalyst reactivity. This paper reports on the preparation of electrospun (Cr 1/5 Mn 1/5 Fe 1/5 Co 1/5 Ni 1/5 ) 3 O 4 nanofibers (NFs) and their evaluation as electrocatalysts. Its main aim is to unveil the nanostructural features that play a key role in the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. Differing calcination temperature (300−800 °C) and duration (2 or 4 h) leads to different morphology of the NFs, crystallinity of the oxide, density of defects, and cation distribution in the lattice, which reflect in different electrocatalytic behaviors. The best performance (overpotential and Tafel slope at 10 mA cm −2 : 325 mV and 40 mV dec −1 , respectively) pertains to the NFs calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. To gain a deeper understanding of their electrocatalytic properties, the pristine NFs are investigated by a combination of analytical techniques. In particular, broadband electric spectroscopy reveals that the mobility of oxygen vacancies in the best electrocatalyst is associated to very fast local dielectric relaxations of metal coordination octahedral geometries and experimentally demonstrates the key role of O‐deficient octahedra.

Currently, direct electrolysis of seawater for green hydrogen production is primarily focused on neutral and alkaline systems. However, the precipitation of calcium and magnesium ions restricts the advancement of this technology. An acidic system can effectively address this issue. Given that Ru/Ir‐based catalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity also exhibit high chlorine evolution reaction (CER) activity, acid seawater splitting requires anodes with higher selectivity and stability compared to the other two systems. In this study, we propose a non‐precious Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox as the active anode for direct acid seawater electrolysis, which exhibits a high OER selectivity and remarkable stability for more than 1200 hours. Different from the Cl‐‐free system, *Cl occupied on Ru sites could shift the OER active center to Mn on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, which prevents the lattice oxygen consumed on Ru and hinders the metal site dissolution. As the CER‐insensitive catalytic center, Mn activated by the introduction of Ru can adsorb a substantial amount of *OH, creating an OER‐favored local environment that inhibits CER. We introduce Cl‐‐assisted transfer of OER active sites to CER‐insensitive Mn as a fundamental strategy for achieving highly selective and durable oxygen evolution in acidic seawater.

Metal‐organic hybrid catalysts with highly tunable single‐sites are promising for oxygen‐evolution reaction (OER), but molecular‐scale understanding of underlying reaction mechanisms still remain elusive on these bulk materials. Herein, we report a direct construction of heterogenized molecular complexes stabilized on carbon substrates via coordinating Fe‐Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands (FeNi‐Lx). The ligands‐tuning π‐π stacking interaction between aromatic carboxylate ligands and carbon supports promote the oxidative charge accumulation on Fe‐Ni sites via fast electron transferring, thus the optimized FeNi‐Lx rendering a mass activity of 6680 A gFe/Ni‐1 at 0.3 V overpotential. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the OH‐ nucleophilic attack on hypervalent iron sites induce the reconstruction of active Fe‐O‐Ni species, accompanying with fast valence increasing. Whereas, during OER, the unexpected valence reduction of Fe‐O‐Ni sites would be attributed to the oxygen‐generating from OOH* intermediates. These findings would establish an essential understanding of the origin of active centers in molecular complexes catalysts for oxygen‐evolution.

The development of non-noble-metal oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts stable in acid to replace rare and expensive iridium catalysts is crucial yet challenging for the large-scale application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis technology. Here, we show that increasing the Pr (pyrolusite ratio) in γ-MnO2 from 73% to 84% results in about 10 times longer durability at a high working current density of 100 mA cm–2 in 1 M H2SO4 for more than 1000 h. Dramatic stability enhancement is due to the inhibition of lattice Mn or O dissolution by leveraging the formation of more stable corner-shared pyrolusite MnO6 octahedra with a higher oxidation state of Mn, fewer defects, a shorter Mn–O bond distance, an increase in stable mono-oxo-bridged Mn–O–Mn pyrolusite MnO6 octahedra, and a decrease in di-oxo-bridged Mn–O2–Mn ramsdellite MnO6 octahedra with more Mn–Mn tension. Because polymorph materials like γ-MnO2 are quite common in nature, phase composition turning may serve as an effective strategy for the development of stable OER catalysts in acidic environments.

Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach for clean hydrogen production, but the process is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the spin-dependent electron transfer process. Efforts to control spin through chirality and magnetization have shown potential in enhancing OER performance. Here we harnessed the potential of topological chiral semimetals (RhSi, RhSn and RhBiS) and their spin-polarized Fermi surfaces to promote the spin-dependent electron transfer in the OER, addressing the traditional volcano-plot limitations. We show that OER activities follow the trend RhSi < RhSn < RhBiS, corresponding to the increasing extent of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). The chiral single crystals outperform achiral counterparts (RhTe 2 , RhTe and RuO 2 ) in alkaline electrolyte, with RhBiS exhibiting a specific activity two orders of magnitude higher than RuO 2 . Our work reveals the pivotal roles of chirality and SOC in spin-dependent catalysis, facilitating the design of ultra-efficient chiral catalysts.

Abstract Seawater electrolysis under alkaline conditions is a crucial technology for sustainable hydrogen production. However, achieving the long‐term stability of the electrocatalyst remains a significant challenge. In this study, it is demonstrated that surface reconstruction of a transition metal nitride (TMN) can be used to develop a highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Rapid introduction of phosphate groups (PO 4 3− ) accelerates the in situ surface reconstruction of Ni 3 FeN, generating a catalyst, with a conductive nitride core and Cl − ‐resistant hydroxide shell that demonstrates outstanding performance, maintaining stability for over 2500 h at 1 A cm −2 current density in alkaline seawater. In situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the dynamic evolution of active sites, providing insights into the mechanisms driving long‐term stability. This work not only introduces an efficient approach to TMN‐based catalyst design but also advances the development of durable electrocatalysts for industrial‐scale seawater hydrogen production.

Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived metal–nitrogen carbon (M–N–C) materials are considered as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) applied in rechargeable zinc–air batteries (ZABs). However, due to their unsatisfied conductivity and aggregation, appropriate regulations about structure and components are still necessary to achieve superior bifunctional performance. Herein, by simple ion exchange and one-step electrospinning method, a beaded composite electrocatalyst (Fe, Co–N–C/CNF) with Fe, Co, N codoped carbon nanocages uniformly embedded in the carbon nanofibers one by one was synthesized, achieving simultaneous structural and compositional regulation. Benefiting from the beaded-like structure and dual sites, the Fe, Co–N–C/CNF exhibits outstanding bifunctional catalytic performance for the ORR and the OER. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) reveals that Fe, Co–N–C/CNF has a low electron transfer barrier between active centers and the ORR (OER) intermediates, ultimately accelerating the reaction kinetics. In addition, the Fe, Co–N–C/CNF-based ZAB also demonstrates superior charge–discharge performance compared to the Pt/C-RuO2-based ZAB. This study not only offers an effective structural design strategy but also provides a component regulation method for ZIF-derived materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Abstract The development of economical and stable catalyst electrodes for industrial-scale seawater splitting is one of the current challenges in hydrogen production. The economical transition metals possess high electrical conductivity and offer the potential for designing electrodes with high intrinsic activity through appropriate modifications, thus holding promising applications in industrial contexts. Herein, a durable and economical self-supported bifunctional electrode (Fe@Ni) with high efficiency and large area is successfully constructed by one step in-situ deposition of iron on the porous structure of nickel foam (NF) via mild (298 K) electroplating method. Transition metals like iron and nickel offer high electrical conductivity and can be properly modified to achieve electrodes with high intrinsic activity. Due to the in-situ growth of cost-effective iron on the NF surface, the electrode surface morphology and electronic structure are reconstructed, which significantly improves the electrochemical activity surface area and electron transfer capability of the electrode. The hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) in simulated seawater (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl) require only 129 mV and 323 mV overpotentials to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm −2 . Overall seawater splitting (OWS) achieves 10 mA cm −2 at a low voltage of 1.49 V and with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%. More importantly, the bifunctional electrodes remain stable at industrial-level current density (1.0 A cm −2 ) for more than 50 days. More attractively, this work realizes the universal construction of large-area electrode for multiple metals (e.g., Fe, Cu, Al, etc . ) with mild and simple process, which provides a new strategy for the current research of energy and materials.

The electrochemical performances of an oxygen-evolving anode produced by the reactivation of waste Ti substrate by a typical IrO2-Ta2O5 coating are correlated to the textural (non)uniformities of the coating and its exhaustion state. Coating degradation is considered operational loss of the activity in a metal electrowinning process. It was found that (pseudo)capacitive performances can vary over the coating surface by 20–30% and depend on the type of dynamics of the input perturbation: constant through cyclic voltammetry (CV) or discontinuous time-dependent through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CV-EIS data correlation enabled profiling of the capacitive properties through the depth of a coating and over its surface. The correlation was confirmed by the findings for the analysis of coating activity for an oxygen evolution reaction, finally resulting in the reliable proposition of a mechanism for the operational loss of the anode. It was found that the less compact and thicker coating parts performed better and operated more efficiently, especially at lower operational current densities.

Abstract Constructing metal alloys/metal oxides heterostructured electrocatalysts with abundant and strongly coupling interfaces is vital yet challenging for practical electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, CoRu nanoalloys uniformly anchored on CoMoO 4 nanosheet heterostructured electrocatalyst (CoRu‐CoMoO 4 /NF) are synthesized via a self‐templated strategy by simply annealing of Ru‐etched CoMoO 4 /NF precursor in a reduction atmosphere. The dense and robustly coupled interface not only provides abundant active sites for water splitting but also strengthens the charge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the theoretical calculations unveil that the strong electronic interaction at CoRu‐CoMoO 4 interface can induce an interfacial electron redistribution and reduce the energetic barriers for the hydrogen and oxygen intermediates, thereby accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. The resultant catalyst only requires the overpotentials of 49 mV for HER and 209 mV for OER at 10 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the constructed CoRu‐CoMoO 4 ||CoRu‐CoMoO 4 two‐electrode cell achieves a cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm −2 , outperforming the benchmark Pt/C||IrO 2 . This work explores an avenue for the rational design of heterostructured electrocatalysts with abundant interfaces for practical water‐splitting electrocatalysis.

Abstract The covalency of the metal─oxygen (M─O) bond is significantly amplified in the transition metal sites with elevated oxidation states, thereby enabling the lattice oxygen‐mediated mechanism (LOM) to transcend the traditional linear scaling limitations of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, an innovative surface atom release speed‐mediated doping of Mo atoms in NiFe (oxy)hydroxides by controlled dissolution of Mo atoms from the Mo 2 N surface, which resulted in the formation of NiFeMo(OH) 2 with high valence Ni species for OER. Structural characterizations, coupled with in situ Raman and theoretical calculations, elucidate that the incorporation of Mo in NiFeMo(OH) 2 modulates the electronic configuration of the metal centers, thereby diminishing the formation energy of Ni 3+/4+ species. This modulation augments the M─O bond covalency, facilitating a shift in the OER pathway from the conventional absorbate evolution mechanism to the more efficient LOM. Consequently, the NiFeMo(OH) 2 displays a low overpotential of 236 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , along with long stability (>500 h) at 50 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, when integrated into an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it achieves a current density of 1.0 A cm −2 at a cell voltage of merely 2.27 V, underscoring its potential for practical applications.

Abstract While considerable efforts have been devoted to developing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in recent years, studies related to the investigation of the true catalytically active species for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain lacking in the field. In this work, the active species of a cobalt‐functionalized COF (TpBpy‐Co) is studied as electrochemical OER catalyst through a series of electrochemical measurements and post‐electrolysis characterizations. These results suggest that cobalt oxide‐based nanoparticles are formed in TpBpy‐Co from Co(II) ions coordinated to the COF backbone when exposing TpBpy‐Co to alkaline media, and these newly formed nanoparticles serve as the primary active species for oxygen evolution. The study thus emphasizes that caution is warranted when assessing the catalytic activity of COF electrocatalysts, as the pristine COF may act as the pre‐catalyst, with the active species forming only under catalyst operating conditions. Specifically, strong coordination between COFs and metal centers under electrochemical operation conditions is crucial to avoid unintended transformation of COF electrocatalysts. This work thus contributes to the rational development of earth‐abundant COF OER catalysts for the production of green hydrogen from renewable resources.

Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key for clean energy applications such as rechargeable metal‐air batteries. Highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts have been the focus of great attention by scientists. Here, an innovative and continuous growth method is established to fabricate integrated Janus structure Co3O4/CoNGDY catalyst, which can work for bifunctional oxygen catalytic conversion, achieving highly durable zinc‐air batteries. Embedded in the hydrangea‐shaped N‐doped graphdiyne (NGDY), the Co3O4/CoNGDY is self‐organized by CoNGDY at the NGDY contact sites and Co3O4 at the upper part, in which Co3O4 works as OER catalyst and CoNGDY acts as ORR catalyst. Due to the incomplete charge transfer within integrated structure, NGDY reduces the d‐band center of the Co sites, so the adsorption strength of intermediates is balanced, and the catalytic activity for ORR/OER is increased. The Co3O4/CoNGDY can serve as an efficient air electrode of rechargeable zinc‐air batteries. The rechargeable Co3O4/CoNGDY‐based aqueous zinc‐air batteries demonstrate excellent performance with a high specific capacity of 746.8 mAh g−1 and an extremely long lifetime of more than 5000 hours. The recoverable modularized cylindrical Co3O4/CoNGDY‐based solid‐state zinc‐air batteries with a power density of up to 167.6 mW cm−2 can be achieved.

Developing a low‐cost, robust, and high‐performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine‐linked isoindigo‐based covalent organic networks. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar 2D‐nanosheets covalent organic framework (I‐TTA COF), whereas its combination with ionic non‐planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (I‐TG COP) with a fibrous morphology. The sheet‐like crystalline I‐TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I‐TG COP. I‐TTA exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of ~134 mV for HER (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and ~283 mV for OER (in 1 M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I‐TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal‐free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24 hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. However, its performance is often hindered by low selectivity and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report an anthrazoline‐based supramolecular photocatalyst, SA‐SADF‐H+, featuring an unsymmetric protonation structure for H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air. The introduction of unsymmetric protonation disrupts the initial mirror symmetry of SADF, significantly enhancing the molecular dipole and facilitating efficient charge separation and electron transfer. Additionally, this modification increases the hydrophilicity of SA‐SADF‐H+, enabling the interaction of water and dissolved oxygen with the catalytic sites. The altered electron density distribution creates numerous dual active sites for Yeager‐type O2 adsorption, facilitating an efficient ORR towards H2O2 via a direct one‐step two‐electron pathway. Notably, SA‐SADF‐H+ achieves an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production at a rate of 4667 μmol L‐1 h‐1, with a remarkable solar‐to‐chemical conversion (SCC) of 1.35%, surpassing most organic photocatalytic systems. Furthermore, SA‐SADF‐H+ demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic antibacterial activity, achieving 100% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus within 60 min.

The development of efficient and stable photoelectrodes is essential for the advancement of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water‐splitting technologies, which hold promise for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER), necessary for sustainable hydrogen production. In this study, the synthesis of a ternary composite, In2S3/FeVO4/CNT has been reported, designed for highly efficient PEC oxygen evolution. The formation of In2S3/FeVO4 heterostructure enhances PEC performance significantly due to the type‐II band alignment, which minimizes electron‐hole recombination and improves charge separation The addition of CNTs further enhances performance by providing conductive pathways that improve electron transport and reduce charge transfer resistance. The resulting In2S3/FeVO4/CNT ternary composite achieves a current density of 14.70 mAcm−2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE, representing a notable increase in performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the ternary composite has the lowest charge transfer resistance, while Bode phase analysis indicates a longer carrier lifetime, emphasizing the synergistic effect of heterostructure formation and CNT inclusion. The ternary composite also demonstrates excellent stability and responsiveness during transient photocurrent cycling, maintaining performance under repeated illumination, making it a strong candidate for water‐splitting applications driven by visible light.

The coupling of lattice and heterostructure interfaces represents an effective strategy for disrupting the so-called scalar relationship and accelerating reactions involving multiple intermediates. In view of this, a lattice-heterostructure interfacial catalyst consisting of a crystalline Fe/Ni bimetallic MOF and amorphous Fe-MOF was designed in this paper for high-performance alkaline oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. The strongly coupled lattice-heterostructure interface induces a unique synergistic effect that promotes electron transfer of the catalyst. The resulting catalyst exhibits exceptionally high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media, the

It is crucial to utilize extremely efficient and economical catalysts for the energy-intensive and kinetically slow oxygen evolution process. Here, we fabricated a NiFeLDH coupled with the NiFe-MOF catalyst with a unique hierarchical structure using a facile and rapid electrodeposition and electrochemical activation strategy. With a low overpotential of about 187 mV at 10 mA cm–2, the NiFeLDH/NiFe-MOF/NF demonstrates exceptional stability for more than 1000 h. Additionally, the produced NiFeLDH/NiFe-MOF/NF could provide high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm–2 in 6 M KOH at relatively low overpotentials of 293 and 353 mV, respectively. The construction of heterojunctions provides abundant interfacial active sites and optimizes catalytic activity by adjusting the surface electronic structure and energy levels. This serves to enhance the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further prove that the construction of NiFeLDH regulates the band structure of metal sites, enhances the catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and lowers the intermediate medium's adsorption free energy.

The synthesis of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts that markedly reduce the overpotential over an extended period is crucial for electrolytic water splitting toward hydrogen production. A kind of Ni/Fe fluoride (hydroxide) nanocomposite OER catalyst is designed and prepared by a two‐step method for the first time. The nanocomposite with the optimal OER performance (Ni:Fe precursor ratio of 9:1) is observed to possess a nanoparticle morphology with size of about 100 nm. Each nanoparticle hosts extensive nanoregions of Ni4OHF7, NiFeF5∙2H2O and Fe1.9F4.75∙0.95H2O phases. The optimal nanocomposite (Ni:Fe precursor ratio of 9:1) exhibits OER overpotential of merely 208 mV and 349 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and 100 mA cm‐2 respectively, tafel slope of 53.1, and outstanding stability for 10 h duration at 100 mA cm‐2. The superior OER catalytic performance of the optimal nanocomposite after CV activation is mainly ascribed to the comprehensive catalytic effect of multiple Ni, Fe active sites from three phases, the smaller charge transfer resistance achieved at this particular Ni:Fe precursor ratio. The abundant resources of Ni, Fe, F elements and the superior OER properties of the Ni/Fe fluorides (hydroxide) nanocomposite, makes it a good OER catalyst candidate for electrolytic water splitting toward hydrogen production.

Abstract The development of cost‐effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical and challenging in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting for industrial applications. Herein, a series of cations (Fe, Ni, and Zn)‐doped Co‐based borophosphates with an anion skeleton (Na 2 CoB 3 P 2 O 11 (OH)· n H 2 O are prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, in which the cation dopants could be easily achieved via a simple cation exchange during the hydrothermal reaction process. Especially, the Fe dopant increases active sites, improves charge‐mass transfer, and tunes the electronic structures of the Co‐based borophosphate electrode. The optimal Fe‐doped NaCBPO (NaC 3 FBPO), with the cobalt to iron molar ratio of 3, shows a low overpotential of 289 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and it can be stable for 16 h at this current density. Above all, it has a fast reaction rate with a low Tafel slope of 84.25 mV·dec −1 . This work provides a promising transition metal‐based borophosphates materials with high efficiency and durability toward water splitting.

The edges of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) display an exceptionally efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity than the (001) basal plane as demonstrated by both theoretical calculations and experimental studies. However, a controllable synthesis method of LDHs with abundant edges has yet to be described. Herein, we report a strategy enabling the synthesis of nickel‐iron LDHs with abundant edges (NiFe LDHs‐E) based on the use of citrate anions as the structure‐directing agent. The edge density is characterized using spectroscopy techniques and its OER performance is compared with that of nickel‐iron LDHs with abundant basal planes (NiFe LDHs‐B). In alkaline electrolyte (1M KOH), NiFe LDHs‐E exhibits excellent OER activity with very low overpotential (235 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and current densities up to sixfold (at η = 320 mV) higher than those of NiFe LDHs‐B. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the high OER activities ascribed to the abundant side‐plane edges with optimal strength of binding of OER intermediates. Overall, a comprehensive investigation, employing both experimental and computational methodologies, yields new insights to fabricate superior catalysts meticulously designed with specific crystal planes and unveils the crucial structural attributes, thus unleashing the limitless potential of the catalytic domain.

Development of large-scale alkaline seawater electrolysis requires robust and corrosion-resistant anodes. Here we propose engineering NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based anodes by incorporating a series of anions into the LDH interlayers. The most optimal NiFe LDH anode with intercalated phosphates demonstrates stable operation at a high current density of 1.0 A cm−2 for over 1000 hours in a 2 W-scale alkaline seawater electrolyzer (ASWE). Fundamental studies indicate that the basicity, indicated by pKa values, of the intercalated anions in NiFe LDH governs its oxygen evolution reaction activity and corrosion resistance. Highly basic anions (i.e., phosphates) securely anchor Fe sites and facilitate proton transfer to boost both durability and activity. Notably, we demonstrate the proof-of-concept for the NiFe anode in an industrial 1 kW-scale ASWE stack (1,081.2 cm2 anode area in total). This unit achieves a stable operating current density of 0.5 A cm−2 at about 2.0 V, twice that of the commercial alkaline pure water electrolyzer, contributing to an economically competitive hydrogen production cost of US$ 1.96 kgH2−1. Large-scale alkaline seawater electrolysis demands robust anodes for efficient hydrogen production. Here, the authors report a NiFe layered double hydroxide anode with intercalated phosphates, achieving stable performance at 1.0 A cm−2 for over 1,000 hours, offering improved durability and activity.

Abstract Developing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in an efficient strategy, while maintaining high catalytic activity and stability under high current densities, remains a crucial problem. In this study, a bimetallic iron‐cobalt phytic acid complex loaded with polyaniline hollow structure (FCP@PAn) was successfully constructed, via a progress of selective etching and surface modification in one step without high‐temperature phosphating or carbonization. The as‐obtained FCP@PAn required only 329 and 385 mV overpotentials at high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm −2 , respectively, due to phytic acid and polyaniline incorporation and the coordinated effect of each component. Additionally, the FCP@PAn exhibited the lowest Tafel slope values of 44.6 mV dec −1 and was able to continuously operate for 120 h at 500 mA cm −2 , displaying high catalytic activity and stability. Hence, the hollow structure of the conductive polymer and MOFs composites provided a new surface modification strategy for transition metal‐based catalysts that are prone to dissolution or corrosion during the OER process, as well as for high current density applications.

The development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic media is vital for the commercialization of the proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. In this work, we successfully construct Ru–O–Ir atomic interfaces for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalysts achieve overpotentials as low as 167, 300, and 390 mV at 10, 500, and 1500 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, with the electrocatalyst showing robust stability for >1000 h of operation at 10 mA cm−2 and negligible degradation after 200,000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. Operando spectroelectrochemical measurements together with theoretical investigations reveal that the OER pathway over the Ru–O–Ir active site is near-optimal, where the bridging oxygen site of Ir–OBRI serves as the proton acceptor to accelerate proton transfer on an adjacent Ru centre, breaking the typical adsorption-dissociation linear scaling relationship on a single Ru site and thus enhancing OER activity. Here, we show that rational design of multiple active sites can break the activity/stability trade-off commonly encountered for OER catalysts, offering good approaches towards high-performance acidic OER catalysts. Efficient and stable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution are essential for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Here, the authors report Ru–O–Ir atomic interfaces that enable bridging oxygen-mediated deprotonation pathways, overcoming the activity/stability trade-off in acidic oxygen evolution.

Abstract The long‐term challenge in overall water splitting is the conflict in the pH condition of electrolytes for achieving efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the same time, in addition to the typical cost issue in catalysts. It hence raises an intense research interest in seeking cost‐efficient non‐noble metal electrocatalysts as well as compromising electrolyte conditions for electrocatalytic HER and OER. To tackle the problems, various approaches are demonstrated to engineer the electronic effect on the active sites of catalysts for enhancing the activities. In this work, the core‐shell CoS 2 ─Fe x Co 1‐x S 2 nanooctahedra is fabricated with a tunable Fe content over the surface and took them as the model catalyst for systematic studies in alkaline OER and HER. By various X‐ray spectroscopies as well as electron microscopy, the results showed that the shells of CoS 2 ─Fe x Co 1‐x S 2 nanooctahedra formed the {111} surfaces of Fe 0.9 Co 1.0 S 2 and Fe 0.25 Co 0.75 S 2 with and without the promotion by OH − anions during the syntheses. Catalyzed by the CoS 2 , Fe 0.25 Co 0.75 S 2 , and Fe 0.9 Co 1.0 S 2 {111} surfaces, the results of alkaline OER and HER indicated the Fe 0.9 Co 1.0 S 2 the most superior activities by virtue of the optimized Fe─Co electronic effect. From the predictions by density functional theory (DFT) calculations in reaction thermodynamics, the energy barriers in OER and HER both follow the order of Fe 0.9 Co 0.1 S 2 (111) < Fe 0.25 Co 0.75 S 2 (111) < CoS 2 (111). However, FeS 2 (111) is worse than Fe 0.9 Co 0.1 S 2 (111). From the confirmations by in‐situ X‐ray spectroscopies in reaction kinetics, the Co sites of Fe 0.9 Co 0.1 S 2 (111) on the core‐shell nanooctahedra exhibited much higher activities than those of CoS 2 (111) under the applied potentials for OER and HER, which reflected the electronic benefits from the existing Fe neighbors.

Abstract Nickel‐based electrocatalysts are promising for industrial water electrolysis, but the dense hydroxyl oxide layer formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits active sites accessibility and presents challenges in balancing structural stability with effective charge transfer. Based on this, an efficient in situ leaching strategy is proposed to construct grain boundary‐rich catalyst structure with high charge transfer ability and a deep catalytic active layer reached >200‐nm. Under OER conditions, stable sub‐nano Ni 3 Al particles are embedded in Ni(Fe)OOH, originating from leaching out the unstable Ni 2 Al 3 phase of the initial Ni 2 Al 3 /Ni 3 Al alloy doped with Fe. The structural evolutions are characterized using in situ Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy. The catalyst exhibits exemplary performance, evidenced by a low overpotential of 212 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , a minimal Tafel slope of 25.0 mV dec −1 . The catalyst maintains stable for >500 h at 500 mA cm −2 under industrial conditions. Furthermore, its performance in seawater electrolysis is notably superior, exhibiting an overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 37.5 mV dec −1 . The in situ high activity in the deep porous phase by leaching out unstable phases provides a new method for engineering high‐performance industrial catalysts.

Abstract Efficient and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for fuel cells, metal‐air batteries, and other energy technologies. Here, a highly stable, efficient bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst (FeNi‐NC@MWCNTs) is reported and demonstrated its integration and robust performance in an aqueous Zinc–air battery (ZAB). The catalyst is based on neighboring iron/nickel sites (FeNiN 6 ) which are atomically dispersed on porous nitrogen‐doped carbon particles. The particles are wrapped in electrically conductive multi‐walled carbon nanotubes for enhanced electrical conductivity. Electrocatalytic analyses show high OER and ORR performance (OER/ORR voltage difference = 0.69 V). Catalyst integration in a ZAB results in excellent performance metrics, including an open circuit voltage of 1.44 V, a specific capacity of 782 mAh g −1 (at j = 15 mA cm −2 ), a peak power density of 218 mW cm −2 (at j = 260 mA cm −2 ) and long‐term durability over 600 charge/discharge cycles. Combined experimental and theoretical (density functional theory) analyses provide an in‐depth understanding of the physical and electronic structure of the catalyst and the role of the FeNi dual atom reaction site. The study therefore provides critical insights into the structure and reactivity of high‐performance bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts based on atomically dispersed non‐critical metals.

Abstract Currently, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline seawater still faces problems such as low catalyst activity and Cl − poisoning of active sites. In this work, an electron transfer facilitator of oxygen vacancies is introduced as a driving force for electronic transmission, which enhances the electron‐metal‐support interactions (EMSI) effect while introducing a charge protective layer, realizing killing two birds with one stone. In situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the EMSI effect enhances the H * transfer step at the interface. At the same time, due to oxygen vacancies for the enhanced EMSI, Ru forms an electron‐rich layer, avoiding the poison of Cl − on active sites in seawater for HER. As a result, the Ru/Ni(OH) 2‐x has an overpotential of only 156 mV at a current density of 1.0 A cm −2 in alkaline seawater. After assembling anion‐exchange‐membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE), the Ru/Ni(OH) 2‐x has a flat efficiency of ≈70% at different current densities, low energy consumption and price of per gallon gas equivalent (GGE) H 2 produced. Owning to the well Cl − tolerance, the catalyst also maintains long‐term stability at 0.5 A cm −2 , indicating its great potential for industrial feasibility.

Developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is critical for advancing hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) for hydrogen production. Herein, we report a facile approach to fabricating a hierarchical catalyst featuring ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles uniformly integrated with nitrogen/oxygen co‐doped carbon nanotube aerogels (Ru‐NOCAs). Heteroatoms N and O‐modified CNTs can result in a negatively charged surface to effectively trap Ru3+ ions. Ru‐NOCAs exhibit a well‐defined hierarchical morphology facilitated by the self‐assembly of functional groups on the surface of CNTs, which enhances the interaction between Ru nanoparticles and CNTs. Due to the synergistic effect of hierarchical structure and strong interaction formation, Ru‐NOCAs show excellent catalytic activity and stability. Ru‐NOCAs catalyst demonstrates a remarkable overpotential of 41 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 with a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec‐1 in 1 M KOH and an overpotential of 68 mV with a Tafel slope of 65.8 mV dec‐1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. These results indicate superior catalytic efficiency and enhanced charge transfer kinetics compared to the control samples. This study highlights the effectiveness of incorporating hierarchical structures and tailored surface chemistries in electrocatalyst design, offering new avenues for optimizing HER performance and advancing hydrogen fuel technology.

Metal‐organic hybrid catalysts with highly tunable single‐sites are promising for oxygen‐evolution reaction (OER), but molecular‐scale understanding of underlying reaction mechanisms still remain elusive on these bulk materials. Herein, we report a direct construction of heterogenized molecular complexes stabilized on carbon substrates via coordinating Fe‐Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands (FeNi‐Lx). The ligands‐tuning π‐π stacking interaction between aromatic carboxylate ligands and carbon supports promote the oxidative charge accumulation on Fe‐Ni sites via fast electron transferring, thus the optimized FeNi‐Lx rendering a mass activity of 6680 A gFe/Ni‐1 at 0.3 V overpotential. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the OH‐ nucleophilic attack on hypervalent iron sites induce the reconstruction of active Fe‐O‐Ni species, accompanying with fast valence increasing. Whereas, during OER, the unexpected valence reduction of Fe‐O‐Ni sites would be attributed to the oxygen‐generating from OOH* intermediates. These findings would establish an essential understanding of the origin of active centers in molecular complexes catalysts for oxygen‐evolution.

Electrochemical regeneration is very suitable approach for industrial effluents, but it suffers from low regeneration efficiency due to side reactions like oxygen evolution, as well as oxidation of the adsorbent. Utilizing PVA films through a solution casting method, incorporating varying concentrations of Cr₂O₃ nanoparticles to evaluate their effects on the material properties .The measurement of the viscosity of the PVA- nanoparticle solution shows that the viscosity increases with the addition of Cr₂O₃, indicating that the viscosity is related to the interaction between the nanoparticles and PVA chains.

Developing oxygen evolution (OER) catalysts with opti­mum composition and highly active catalytic centres is a challenge during electrode scale‐up. We show a selection strategy for the optimum composition of Co‐Fe‐Ni catalyst systems through a scanning droplet cell‐based high‐throughput screening on thin‐film materials libraries, followed by fabrication and testing of the selected compositions in form of catalyst‐coated porous electrodes for the OER in alkaline media. The electrode with optimum composition (Co17Ni58Fe25_Ni foam) exhibits a high current density of 1 A cm‐2 during water electrolysis at an operating potential of ~1.9 V.

In recent years, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental remediation has become a topic of great interest. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), linked by covalent bonds, have emerged as promising materials in the field of electrocatalysis due to their well-defined structures, high specific surface areas, tunable pore structures, and excellent acid–base stability. However, the low conductivity of COF materials often limits their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. To enhance the catalytic performance of COF-based catalysts, various nanomaterials are integrated into COFs to form composite catalysts. The stable and tunable porous structure of COFs provides an ideal platform for these nanomaterials, leading to improved electrocatalytic activity. Through rational design, COF-based composite electrocatalysts can achieve synergistic effects between nanomaterials and the COF carrier, enabling efficient targeted electrocatalysis. This review summarizes the applications of nanomaterial-incorporated COF-based catalysts in hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. Additionally, it outlines design principles for COF-based composite electrocatalysis, focusing on structure–activity relationships and synergistic effects in COF composite nanomaterial electrocatalysts, as well as challenges and future perspectives for next-generation composite electrocatalysts.

The pursuit of efficient and economical catalysts for water splitting, a critical step in hydrogen production, has gained momentum with the increasing demand for sustainable energy. Among the various electrocatalysts developed to date, cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its availability, stability, and catalytic activity. However, intrinsic limitations, including low catalytic activity and poor electrical conductivity, often hinder its effectiveness in electrocatalytic water splitting. To overcome these challenges, substantial efforts have focused on enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4 by synthesizing composites with conductive materials, transition metals, carbon-based nanomaterials, and metal–organic frameworks. This review explores the recent advancements in Co3O4-based composites for the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction, emphasizing strategies such as nanostructuring, doping, hybridization, and surface modification to improve catalytic performance. Additionally, it examines the mechanisms driving the enhanced activity and stability of these composites while also discussing the future potential of Co3O4-based electrocatalysts for large-scale water-splitting applications.

Abstract Electrocatalysis plays a central role in clean energy conversion and sustainable technologies. However, the trade-off between activity and stability of electrocatalysts significantly hinders their practical applications, notably in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for producing hydrogen and solar fuels. Here we report a steam-assisted synthesis armed with machine learning screening of an integrated ruthenium-titanium-manganese electrode, featuring intrinsic metal-support interactions. These atomic-scale interactions with self-healing capabilities radically address the activity-stability dilemma across all pH levels. Consequently, our electrode achieved high mass activities, 48.5, 112.8 and 74.6 times those of benchmark ruthenium oxides in acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively; and stable operation for up to 3,000 hours, a multi-fold improvement in stability over the reported advanced catalysts. The breakthrough in activity-stability limitations highlights the potential of intrinsic metal-support interactions for enhancing electrolysis and other heterogeneous catalysis.

Replacing global depleting fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources that are affordable and environmentally-benign, is from the most pressing challenges for the future socio-economic developments. To that goal, electrochemical water splitting would provide green hydrogen fuel which is considered one of the most promising energy carriers. However, the viability of the process still hinges on the availability of robust earth-abundant electrocatalysts that catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In recent years, transition metal based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) electrocatalysts, with advantageous physio-chemical properties, can represent a promising outstanding research approaches to accelerate the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of these two half-reactions. Herein, we present brief explanations of the reaction mechanisms and the important parameters relating to the electrochemical water splitting along with the recent developments of different LDHs derived electrocatalysts towards the HER/OER performances. Furthermore, the innovative fabrication strategies of the LDHs systems and the subsequent evolution of the LDHs classes, including adopted modification strategies including cation/anion doping, defect engineering, exchanging interlayer anions, nanostructured morphology, designing hierarchical heterostructures or nanocomposites, etc. Finally, the current perspectives and challenges of some critical issues as well as the future opportunities for the developments of outstanding LDHs-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical water electrolysis are also provided.

Abstract In the present work, we investigates the potential of two dimensional (2D) Janus MoSH monolayer as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting using first-principles calculations. Our results shows that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits excellent structural stability and electronic properties, which are essential for efficient electrocatalysis. We find that the charge transfer mechanism between Mo and S atoms plays a crucial role in the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer. Due to the asymmetric structure of MoSH monolayer, it has intrinsic electric field with dipole moment of 0.24 D. Moreover, we demonstrate that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits high catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential 0.04 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotential 0.11 V, making it a promising candidate for overall water splitting. Our findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of 2D monolayered materials for renewable energy production. By providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of HER and OER on 2D Janus MoSH monolayer, our study paves the way for the development of efficient and sustainable electrocatalysts for water splitting. We hope that current work will be helpful in understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer and its potential applications in renewable energy production.

Developing a low‐cost, robust, and high‐performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine‐linked isoindigo‐based covalent organic networks. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar 2D‐nanosheets covalent organic framework (I‐TTA COF), whereas its combination with ionic non‐planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (I‐TG COP) with a fibrous morphology. The sheet‐like crystalline I‐TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I‐TG COP. I‐TTA exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of ~134 mV for HER (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and ~283 mV for OER (in 1 M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I‐TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal‐free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24 hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted much attention as an efficient alternative reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its low required overpotential. Despite significant progress in efficient nickel‐based catalysts, the fundamental issues regarding product selectivity control and dissociation mechanism during the UOR process have not been clarified. Here, we report that tuning the electron delocalization strength of Ni sites significantly affects the OH‐ binding sites, altering urea molecule dissociation patterns in alkaline systems. Using spinel NiCo2O4 as a model catalyst, the charge delocalization strength of nickel active centers is influenced by the degree of phosphorus‐substituted anions. Specifically, complete phosphorus‐substituted spinel enhances N2 selectivity to over 26.8% with a peak current density of 300 mA·cm‐2, while partial phosphorus‐substituted spinel achieves a Faraday efficiency of 78.1% for liquid products (NOx‐). Experiments and theory reveal that strong charge delocalization at Ni sites favors remote‐site attack on urea molecules by hydroxide ions, whereas weak delocalization prefers nearby‐site attack, enhancing UOR efficiency and suppressing OER in both pathways.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted much attention as an efficient alternative reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its low required overpotential. Despite significant progress in efficient nickel‐based catalysts, the fundamental issues regarding product selectivity control and dissociation mechanism during the UOR process have not been clarified. Here, we report that tuning the electron delocalization strength of Ni sites significantly affects the OH‐ binding sites, altering urea molecule dissociation patterns in alkaline systems. Using spinel NiCo2O4 as a model catalyst, the charge delocalization strength of nickel active centers is influenced by the degree of phosphorus‐substituted anions. Specifically, complete phosphorus‐substituted spinel enhances N2 selectivity to over 26.8% with a peak current density of 300 mA·cm‐2, while partial phosphorus‐substituted spinel achieves a Faraday efficiency of 78.1% for liquid products (NOx‐). Experiments and theory reveal that strong charge delocalization at Ni sites favors remote‐site attack on urea molecules by hydroxide ions, whereas weak delocalization prefers nearby‐site attack, enhancing UOR efficiency and suppressing OER in both pathways.

The activity of nickel-based electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is influenced by the presence of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte. Since the underlying mechanism is not fully resolved yet, we conducted a study combining Raman, FTIR, and photoelectron spectroscopies. We found that an improved OER activity correlates with structural changes of the catalyst. The cations are adsorbed in increasing amounts in the order Li+ < Na+ < K+ < Cs+, opening the layers of the NiOOH layered double-hydroxide structure and promoting a transition from a more β-like to a more γ-like NiOOH phase. In addition, the NiOOH surface gets increasingly deprotonated with increasing alkali cation size. We stabilized the activated catalyst materials in ultra-high vacuum and exposed them to controlled doses of H2O to analyse the catalyst-electrolyte interface in a quasi in-situ approach with photoelectron spectroscopy. Going from Li+ to Cs+, more OH groups are found on the surface after the exposure to H2O, demonstrating that such structural changes are facilitating the dissociation of H2O. As the dissociation of H2O is a crucial step in many OER mechanisms, its modified efficiency can be correlated with the observed trends in OER activity in LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and CsOH.

Sustainable energy materials for energy storage applications are crucial for a reliable energy transition. However, evaluating material sustainability in early stages of energy material research is a big challenge, as it is difficult to predict the final industrial process and supply chain of the investigated material. In this work we showcase that a sustainability evaluation can already be conducted in the early stage of electrocatalyst research. We provide a case study of two highly active alkaline oxygen evolution catalysts La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ with a thin film model catalyst approach. For the sustainability evaluation, we consider the material criticality, compare precursor prices, conduct an environmental impact analysis of the precursors based on life cycle assessment and provide a qualitative discourse for social impacts of raw material extraction. We find that La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ has a reduced environmental footprint, smaller precursor supply risk and 10 times lower precursor price compared to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ. However, for both perovskites the high environmental impact and high supply risk of lanthanum is of immediate concern towards larger scale application purposes. Sustainability evaluation in the early stages of energy material research can be a great chance to develop new material selection strategies leveraging sustainability in later stages of materials research for the energy transition.

Abstract Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) can be compositionally controlled at the single‐atom level, but understanding structure‐property correlations is required for tailoring specific optical properties. Here, the impact of Ni atom doping on the optical, structural, and electrochemical properties of atomically precise 1,3‐benzene dithiol (BDT) protected Ag 29 NCs is studied. The Ni‐doped Ag 29 (NiAg 28 (BDT) 12 ) NCs, are synthesized using a co‐reduction method and characterized using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS), ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Only a single Ni atom doping can be achieved despite changing the precursor concentration. Ni doping in Ag 29 NCs exhibits enhanced thermal stability, and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to the parent NCs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict the geometry and optical properties of the parent and NiAg 28 (BDT) 12 NCs. DFT is also used to study the systematic single‐atom doping effect of metals such as Au, Cu, and Pt into Ag 29 NCs and suggests that with Ni and Pt, the d atomic orbitals contribute to creating superatomic orbitals, which is not seen with other dopants or the parent cluster. The emission mechanism is dominated by a charge transfer from the ligands into the Ag core cluster regardless of the dopant.

Abstract The design of heterojunctions offers a crucial solution for energy conversion and storage challenges, but current research predominantly focuses on charge transfer benefits, often neglecting spin attribute regulation despite the increasing recognition of spin‐sensitivity in many chemical reactions. In this study, a novel magnetic heterostructure, CoFe 2 O 4 @CoFeMo 3 O 8 , is designed to simultaneously modulate charge and spin characteristics, and systematically elucidated their synergistic impact on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Experimental results and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the magnetic heterostructure exhibits both charge transfer and spin polarization. It is found that the charge‐transfer behavior enhances conductivity and adsorption ability through band structure regulation. Meanwhile, magnetically polarized electrons promote triplet O 2 generation and accelerate electron transport via spin‐selective pathways. Moreover, the heterostructure's effective response to external alternating magnetic fields further amplifies the spin‐dependent effect and introduces a magnetothermal effect, locally heating the active sites through spin flip, thereby boosting catalytic activity. Consequently, the OER activity of the magnetic heterostructure is improved by 83.8 times at 1.5 V compared to its individual components. This magnetic heterojunction strategy presents a promising avenue for advanced catalysis through synergistic regulating of charge‐transfer and spin‐ordering.

Water-splitting technology is crucial for generating green hydrogen energy, a sustainable and clean fuel source that can significantly decrease reliance on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thereby helping to mitigate the global energy crisis. Renewable energy sources are expected to significantly replace fossil fuels, contributing to lowering greenhouse gas releases and helping to mitigate the energy crisis. The water-splitting process for generating green hydrogen energy is acknowledged as a promising approach toward achieving carbon neutrality. In this context, the attributes and features of electrocatalysts have a crucial part in shaping the reaction activity and selectivity of both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes involved in the water-splitting process. In addition to traditional noble-metal-based catalysts, carbon-based materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and porous carbons have proven effective for catalyzing these reactions. A highly effective strategy to enhance their electrical, physical, and chemical characteristics involves doping them with heteroatoms like nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), boron (B), and transition metals. These materials, renowned for their exceptional characteristics, have been extensively researched in both the academic and industrial sectors for diverse applications, like energy conversion and storage technologies. This chapter comprehensively reviews notable advancements in the progress of heteroatom-doped carbon allotropes materials and their utilization in overall water splitting, highlighting different synthesis methods and strategies like templating strategy, hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis, chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and high-temperature annealing aimed at achieving heteroatom-doped carbon allotrope materials with diverse types and quantities of dopants (both metallic and non-metallic), as well as multi-atoms. Additionally, the discussion underlines the structural and morphological characteristics that elucidate the structure-property relationship and improvements in the physicochemical features of heteroatom-doped carbon allotropes. It explores how heteroatom doping enhances different properties, such as conductivity, and optimizes surface adsorption for various reaction intermediates, as evidenced by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the chapter explores recent promising studies of heteroatom-doped carbon allotropes with excellent catalytic performance and reveals their future prospects for overall water splitting.

Motivation: Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions with different pathologic conditions could be distinguished by MRI. There may be differences in oxygen metabolism in different types of lesions. Goal(s): To explore the oxygen metabolism of different types of lesions in MS patients by oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Approach: The OEF map was reconstructed from a 3D multi-echo gradient echo scan. White matter lesions were classified into four types based on contrast-enhanced T1WI and quantitative susceptibility mapping. Results: There were differences in OEF among different types of MS lesions. The OEF in the lesion and the lesion type may change as time progresses. Impact: This study revealed tissue damage and oxygen metabolism level in different types of MS lesions. The OEF may contribute to further understanding of the pathological mechanisms in MS lesion evolution.

The impact of global warming on the ocean’s oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) is uncertain, partly because of a lack of data on past changes. We report monthly resolved records of coral skeleton–bound nitrogen isotopes (CS-δ 15 N) to reconstruct denitrification in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ over the last 80 years. The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability. ODZ evolution over the next century will depend on how global warming interacts with the decadal oscillations.

Abstract To alleviate the destructive alteration of the glass layer surface caused by gas evolution during the oxygen‐blocking process of the HfB 2 ‐MoSi 2 ‐SiC coating, CeO 2 was incorporated to modify HfB 2 ‐MoSi 2 ‐SiC coating, and the anti‐oxidation mechanism at 1700°C in air was investigated. Compared with the unmodified HfB 2 ‐MoSi 2 ‐SiC coating, the addition of the refractory CeO 2 to the Hf‐B‐Si‐O system leads to the formation of a stable Hf‐Ce‐B‐Si‐O complex phase glass, which substantially enhances the viscosity, stability, and self‐healing sealing properties of the glass layer. The introduction of 0.75 vol.% CeO 2 significantly lowers the oxidative activity of the HfB 2 ‐MoSi 2 ‐SiC coating, boosting its average protective efficiency to 99.96% and reducing the maximal oxygen permeability by 43.48%, thus exhibiting superior oxygen‐blocking performance. However, excessive addition of CeO 2 leads to an overabundance of oxygen release through its distinctive oxygen vacancy mechanism, which accelerates the formation of Hf‐oxides, resulting in excessive viscosity on the coating surface and leaving oxidation defects unrepaired.

The addition of oxygen or nitrogen in refractory high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has been widely reported, but studies on boron-doped HEAs have mainly focused on the segregation of boron elements at grain boundaries. The changes in the microstructure and mechanical properties in TiZrNb-based HEAs remain enigmatic. In this work, boron-doped Ti35Zr30V10Nb25 (Ti35-xB) refractory HEAs were designed to elucidate their microstructural evolution and mechanical properties. Unlike oxygen and nitrogen, trace amounts of boron addition result in the formation of borides, and boron exhibits a strong repulsion towards Zr, leading to Zr-depleted borides. Borides distributed along the grain boundaries refine the grain size and dendritic structure. The borides and structural refinement effect enhance the strain-hardening capacity and uniform elongation, resulting in an over 15% uniform elongation for Ti35-0.25B.

Abstract Coupled non-linear Schrödinger equations are crucial in describing dynamics of many-particle systems. We present a quantum imaginary time evolution (ITE) algorithm as a solution to such equations in the case of nuclear Hartree-Fock approach. Under a simplified Skyrme interaction model, we calculate the ground state energy of an oxygen-16 nucleus and demonstrate that the result is in agreement with the classical ITE algorithm. We examine bottlenecks and deficiencies in the quantum algorithm and suggest possible improvements.

High-altitude plants face extreme environments such as low temperature, low oxygen, low nutrient levels, and strong ultraviolet radiation, causing them to adopt complex adaptation mechanisms. Phenotypic variation is the core manifestation of ecological adaptation and evolution. Many plants have developed a series of adaptive strategies through long-term natural selection and evolution, enabling them to survive and reproduce under such harsh conditions. This article reviews the techniques and methods used in recent years to study the adaptive evolution of high-altitude plants, including transplantation techniques, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics techniques, and their applications in high-altitude plant adaptive evolution. Transplantation technology focuses on phenotypic variation, which refers to natural variations in morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, exploring their key roles in nutrient utilization, photosynthesis optimization, and stress-resistance protection. Multiple omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have revealed genes, regulatory pathways, and metabolic networks associated with phenotypic variations at the genetic and molecular levels. At the same time, the limitations and deficiencies of current technologies used to study plant adaptation to high-altitude environments were discussed. In addition, we propose future improvements to existing technologies and advocate for the integration of different technologies at multiple levels to study the molecular mechanisms of plant adaptation to high-altitude environments, thus providing insights for future research in this field.

The technological solution adopted for aerobic treatment of Waste Organic Fraction (WOF) can influence the evolution of the physical parameters of the process making the facility acting as a biostabilization or a biodrying system. In the present study, the continuous flow biological section of the full-scale mechanical biological treatment plant was experimentally investigated by means of evolution, during treatment period (day), of temperature (T) (° C), volatile solids (VS) (%TS) and oxygen uptake of the WOF under treatment. Oxygen uptake was measured by the Dynamic Respirometer Index Potential (DRIP) (mgO2/kgVSh). Main findings were that T (° C) and VS %TS remained quite constant among inlets and outlets of the biological treatment sections, about 70° C and 50 (%TS), respectively. DRIP (mgO2/kgVSh) values measured by several samples withdrawn along the basin width increased significantly in the first half portion of the basin of the aerobic section, remaining quite constant in the second half. This was mainly caused by the strong moisture reduction that rapidly achieved values lower than 40% causing inhibition to microbial activity. The simulation model developed in this work showed that the mean retention time (day) of the WOF inside the aerobic basin was about 14-16 days, this parameter being strongly influenced by the WOF inlet rate (tonnes/day). Finally, experimental evidence pointed out that the reduction of WOF DRIP (mgO2/kgVSh) stopped after the first days of treatment indicating that the facility operates mainly as biodrying system. Based on simulations, biostabilization can also be pursued by maintaining the moisture of WOF to proper values not lower than 40 (% w/w).

Abstract Feedback processes that drove Earth's second major increase in ocean–atmosphere oxygen levels during the Neoproterozoic are poorly constrained. Variability in seawater redox over geological timescales is commonly linked to changes in the biogeochemical cycling of P and thus the rate of primary production and generation of photosynthetic oxygen. In the modern surface ocean, an important source of bioessential P and micronutrients (Fe, Cu, Co, Zn, Mo, Cr and Ni) is aeolian dust derived from deserts and arid, post‐glacial landscapes. It is interpreted herein that glacial retreat following the Sturtian ( ca 717 to 660 Ma) and Marinoan ( ca 650 to 635 Ma) snowball glaciations provided copious dust to the global ocean. Correlation of interglacial siltstone successions in palaeogeographical context suggests that such dust accumulation was diachronous and concentrated in the palaeo‐horse latitudes (30° N and 30° S). Delivery of this dust from continents is likely reflected in the steep increase in global radiogenic Sr isotope values ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) in post‐Sturtian carbonates, and changes in the δ 18 O signatures of Cryogenian zircons derived from subducted marine sediments. Accumulation of sedimentary organic matter also peaked during interglacial periods, suggesting a causal link between glaciation, aeolian dust and primary production. This relationship implies windblown dust was an important source of P and micronutrients for an evolving biological pump that stimulated primary production, enhanced burial of organic carbon and increased ocean–atmosphere oxygen concentrations. Thus, delivery of aeolian dust to the global ocean was likely critical for sustaining Earth's second major increase in oxygen. Sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 in organic‐rich siltstones and shales is also interpreted to have been an important negative feedback process, which together with silicate weathering, prevented runaway greenhouse conditions during interglacial periods. The oxygen produced by this aeolian marine biological pump may have helped pave the way for the evolution of multicellular animals in the Ediacaran.

Aim and objectives: This study aimed to explore insulin necessity in hospitalized patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) for the first six months after COVID-19 infection. A pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulative status probably contribute to the risk of worse outcomes in diabetes. Material and Methods: A number of 78 non-insulin necessitate diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection which needed oxygen therapy were included in the research. There were collected parameters routinely assessed to detect the possible predictors of diabetic patient evolution in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The evolution of insulin necessity for 78 patients with non-insulin-dependent DM at admission was towards transformation into insulin-dependent DM at 6 months after discharge in 30 cases (38.5%), while the rest of the patients remained on oral antidiabetic drugs (48 patients, 61.5%). Conclusions: At hospitalized diabetic patient with covid-19 infection under corticotherapy, statistically significant differences were noted in HbA1c and aPTT level at 3 and 6 months after discharge.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are critical for portable electronics and electric vehicles, demanding higher energy density to meet increasing energy storage needs. Current commercial cathode materials, such as LiFePO4 and LiCoO2, are limited by a single electron transfer, restricting their energy density. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) emerges as a promising high-capacity cathode due to its high theoretical capacity of 443 mA h g–1 with three Li storage capacities, significantly surpassing conventional materials. However, the practical application of V2O5 is hindered by a large structural evolution and rapid capacity fading during full lithium intercalation. This study introduces a multinonmetal doping (MNM) strategy to enhance V2O5 cathodes by incorporating all-nonmetal dopants (B, P, and Si) and graphene (G). MNM-V2O5-G exhibits increased surface oxygen defects, improving charge transfer kinetics and thus enhancing the rate performance and cycling stability. Our results provide valuable insights into the role of surface oxygen defects in stabilizing V2O5 with element doping. This research highlights the potential of multinonmetal doping to improve LIB cathode materials, offering a promising pathway for design of high-energy-density V2O5 cathodes and advancing the development of next-generation energy storage solutions.

Abstract Large-scale fire tests at the University of Waterloo compare behaviour of a Canadian non-fire retardant faux leather couch and a UK fire-retardant faux leather couch of the same construction under ventilation limited conditions. Results reveal that both fuel loads reach maximum, but different, mass loss rates at minimum oxygen concentration in the environment. Following this, they document the rapid decay in fuel mass loss rate with consequent decrease in temperature through the burn structure. Time-varying volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide data show preferential increase in concentration as combustion efficiency decreases. The paper adds novel time varying, simultaneously collected fuel mass, temperature and concentration data with aim to provide new insight into the full evolution of compartment fires through transition from early growth to ventilation limited conditions and subsequent fire decay.

The Ordovician dolomite in the Ordos Basin is an important natural gas reservoir. Exploring dolomite genesis and the factors influencing reservoir characteristics is essential for deep carbonate rock exploration. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of dolomite evolution using methods such as thin-section petrography, isotope analysis, and trace and rare earth elements. The analysis shows that: Based on petrographic observations of the Majiagou Formation in the study area, the dolomite in the study area can be divided into residual oolitic dolomite of synsedimentary or metasomatic origin, micritic dolomite of secondary metasomatism or recrystallization origin, powder crystal dolomite, and fine crystal dolomite. Reservoir pores mainly develop intergranular pores, mold pores, dissolved pores, and fractures. Combined with the characteristics of major elements, trace elements, carbon and oxygen isotopes, rare earth elements, and inclusions in the study area, it can be concluded that the fifth member dolomite of the Majiagou Formation is of shallow–medium burial origin. The diagenetic evolution sequence from the penecontemporaneous period to the middle–deep burial period in the study area is penecontemporaneous dolomite, anhydrite dissolution → seepage silt filling, freshwater dolomite, calcite, and gypsum filling, pressure solution compaction, calcite partial dissolution → gypsum filling, karst cave, buried hydrothermal dolomite, dolomite partial dissolution → calcite complete dissolution, pore dissolution expansion, and quartz pyrite filling. In the early stage of compaction and pressure solution, the primary pores are rapidly reduced, and in the later stage, sutures are generated to provide channels for reservoir fluid migration. The recrystallization reduces the porosity during the middle–deep burial period.

Abstract S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are defined by their carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio approaching unity. However, observations of circumstellar molecules in these stars are limited and challenging. In this study, we used the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope to search for cyanide (CN) in 12 selected S-type AGB stars, with only 4 of these stars displaying CN spectral line signals. The column density and fractional abundance of CN were calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, and the average CN-to-hydrogen-cyanide (HCN) abundance ratio of the four sources is about 0.036. We investigate, for the first time, the relationship between CN and HCN fractional abundances in all types of AGB stars, finding that the ratio is similar in O-rich and S-type stars, while those in C-rich stars are quite different. This result supports the idea that the level of HCN photodissociation plays a crucial role in determining the CN abundance in the circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars at various stages of their evolution.

Motivation: This abstract focuses on educating on how high-gradient MRI systems can utilize the multi-echo functional MRI (ME-fMRI) techniques. Goal(s): We explain the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal technique and how additional echoes can improve the signal fidelity. Approach: The ME-fMRI, using three or more echoes allow for the pixelwise T2* decay to be modeled, and as BOLD contrast is a function of T2* evolution over time, an experiment sampling the voxel-wise T2* signal decay can be used to separate BOLD from artifact signal constituents. Results: Gradient systems with ultra-rapid slew rates (&gt; 400 T/m/s) allow ME-fMRI to reduce artefacts from flow, motion, and susceptibility effects. Impact: MRI systems with ultra-high gradient systems can reduce artefacts from flow, motion, and susceptibility effects in the BOLD contrast technique using an ME-fMRI technique with three or more echoes to improve fidelity of fMRI.

Abstract To satisfy the needs of modern intelligent society for power supplies with long-endurance ability, Li-rich Mn-based layered oxides (LRMOs) are receiving much attention because of their ultrahigh capacity. However, their real-world implementation is hindered by the serious voltage decay, which results in a continuous decrease in energy density. The understanding on voltage decay still remains a mystery due to the complicated hybrid cationic-anionic redox and the serious surface-interface reactions in LRMOs. Moreover, some of the mechanisms are occasionally contradictory, indicating that the origin of voltage decay is still unclear. As a result, none of the innovative strategies proposed on the basis of mechanisms has effectively alleviated the problem of voltage decay, and voltage decay becomes a long-term distress of LRMOs. Therefore, it is particularly crucial to sort out the mutual relation of various mechanisms, which helps to go back to the source of voltage decay. In this review, we summarize the current mechanisms of voltage decay as structural evolution and oxygen chemistry, and attempt to trace the origin of voltage decay for LRMOs. In addition, we discuss how current researches address the issue with generalized guidance in designing appropriate strategies based on mechanisms.

Abstract Phosphorothioation serves as a DNA backbone modification mechanism, wherein a sulfur atom substitutes the nonbridging oxygen atom within the phosphodiester, facilitated by the gene products of dndABCDE or sspABCD. The combination of dndABCDE with dndFGH forms a bona fide defense system, where the DndFGH protein complex exhibits DNA nickase and DNA translocase activities to prevent phage invasion. In this study, we identified that dndI, co-transcribed with dndFGH, can independently couple with iscS-dndBCDE as an anti-phage defense system. Moreover, we resolved the crystal structure of DndI from Salmonella at a resolution of 3.10 Å. We discovered that its residue Y25, residing within a hydrophobic region of DndI, is involved in phosphorothioate (PT) sensing. Upon sensing PT modifications at 5′-GPSAAC-3′/5′-GPSTTC-3′, the ATPase activity of DndI is stimulated, which subsequently triggers a conformational transition, facilitating the dissociation of DndI from self-DNA, thereby allowing DndI to avoid cleaving self-DNA while restricting PT-deficient phage DNA. This research broadens the knowledge of the mechanistic diversity underlying PT-based defense systems and highlights their complexity in the course of evolution.

Abstract Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolic intermediate and the product of various natural and synthetic one-carbon (C1) assimilation pathways. While an efficient conversion of acetyl-CoA into other central metabolites, such as pyruvate, is imperative for high biomass yields, available aerobic pathways typically release previously fixed carbon in the form of CO 2 . To overcome this loss of carbon, we develop a new-to-nature pathway, the Lcm module, in this study. The Lcm module provides a direct link between acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, is shorter than any other oxygen-tolerant route and notably fixes CO 2 , instead of releasing it. The Lcm module relies on the new-to-nature activity of a coenzyme B 12 -dependent mutase for the conversion of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA into lactyl-CoA. We demonstrate Lcm activity of the scaffold enzyme 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase from Bacillus massiliosenegalensis , and further improve catalytic efficiency 10-fold by combining in vivo targeted hypermutation and adaptive evolution in an engineered Escherichia coli selection strain. Finally, in a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the complete Lcm module in vitro. Overall, our work demonstrates a synthetic CO 2 -incorporating acetyl-CoA assimilation route that expands the metabolic solution space of central carbon metabolism, providing options for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.

Abstract Despite extensive investigation on the lattice oxygen redox (LOR) in Li‐rich cathodes, significant challenges remain in utilizing LOR activity without compromising structural and electrochemical stability. Related breakthroughs are hindered by the lack of understanding regarding how different LOR activity influences the structural evolution and electrochemical stability, and what is the optimal LOR activity. Herein, the degree of LOR activity is successfully regulated from 22% to 92% in Co‐free Li‐rich cathodes (Li 1+x Mn 0.62 Ni 0.18 O 2 ) by controlling local chemical disorder, and the relationship between LOR activity and cycling stability is revealed. Conventional consensus is challenged by new findings that the over‐suppressive LOR activity also undermines electrochemical/structural stability, and even causes more severe voltage fading compared to cases with excessive LOR. However, their failure mechanisms related to lattice strain present different characteristics. Based on the established understanding, the appropriate LOR activation is necessary to balance the maximum reversible LOR activity and good stability, and the optimal degree is identified as 86% in Li 1.18 Mn 0.62 Ni 0.18 O 2 (LR‐78). LR‐78 exhibits remarkable voltage retention of 96% after 400 cycles at 1 C, and superior high‐rate cyclability without capacity decay within 600 cycles at 5 C. These findings significantly broaden the understanding of LOR mechanisms and provide critical guidance for designing durable LOR‐based cathodes.

Background and Objectives: A large amount of recent evidence suggests that cellular inability to consume oxygen could play a notable part in promoting sepsis as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The latter could, in fact, represent a fundamental stage in the evolution of the “natural history” of sepsis. Following a study previously conducted by the same working group on heart samples, the present research project aims to evaluate, through an immunohistochemical study, the existence and/or extent of oxidative stress in the brains of subjects who died due to sepsis and define, after reviewing the literature, its contribution to the septic process to support the use of medications aimed at correcting redox anomalies in the management of septic patients. Materials and Methods: 10 cases of subjects who died in healthcare facilities with ante-mortem clinical-laboratory signs that allowed the diagnosis of septic shock were selected as case studies, and 1 case of a subject who died immediately following a road traffic accident was used as a negative control. Samples of the cerebral cortex were then taken, fixed in formalin, and subjected to sections on which an immunohistochemical study was performed using anti-NOX-2, NT, iNOS, and 8-OHdG antibodies. Results: The results emerging from the present study demonstrate that despite a variable expressivity for the NT, iNOS, and NOX2 markers, the brain samples demonstrated univocal and high positivity for the 8-OHdG marker. Conclusions: This would allow us to hypothesize how, regardless of the mechanism of production of ROS and NOS (iNOS or NOX2 mediated) and the pathophysiological mechanisms that are triggered during sepsis, oxidative damage to DNA represents the event to which this whole process leads and, in fact, in the literature, is directly correlated to sepsis-dependent mortality. Neurons, conversely, appear to be more sensitive to oxidative stress because of a low number of protective or scavenger molecules (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, GSH, or vitamin E). Therefore, despite reduced production, the manifestation of the damage remains high. This evidence, together with that of the previous study, can only support the introduction of substances with an antioxidant function in the guidelines for the treatment of sepsis.

Zhuqueibacterota is a novel bacterial phylum proposed based on hot spring metagenomes and public metagenome-assembled genomes, classified within the Fibrobacterota-Chlorobiota-Bacteroidota superphylum. This globally distributed phylum consists of one class and five orders, with the majority of its members being facultative anaerobes. Notably, the order Zhuqueibacterales utilizes hydrogen as an electron donor for carbon fixation through the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle. Phylogenetic and metabolic analyses reveal the phylum's key role in the carbon cycle, with frequent horizontal gene transfer events influencing its evolutionary trajectory. To the editor, The candidate phylum KSB1 has been identified as anaerobic heterotrophic bacterium and detected in various environments. However, little known about its diversity, ecology, and evolutionary history. In this study, we analyzed 30 new metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Tengchong hot spring and 45 public MAGs. Phylogenetic analyses based on the draft genome and 16S rRNA gene indicate they form a distinct group within the Fibrobacterota-Chlorobiota-Bacteroidota (FCB) superphylum, and thus we propose their classification as a new phylum, herein Zhuqueibacterota, which contain five orders and one class. Members of Zhuqueibacterota are globally distributed and likely facultative anaerobes, with one order exhibiting autotrophy via the Calvin Benson Bassham (CBB) cycle by using hydrogen as an electron donor. Metabolic predictions at the community level suggest that Zhuqueibacterota play a significant role in the carbon fixation of hot spring. Ancestral state reconstruction points to frequent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events throughout Zhuqueibacterota evolution. Facultative anaerobic traits appear to be ancestral, with some lineage losing hydrogen oxidation capabilities while acquiring carbon fixation capabilities through HGT in Zhuqueibacterales. These results shed light on diversity, ecological roles, and evolutionary history of Zhuqueibacterota, highlighting their significance in the carbon cycle. The earth harbors a huge biodiversity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms. However, only a small portion of bacteria is culturable under laboratory conditions and most bacterial phyla have no cultured members. The candidate bacterial phylum KSB1, as one of the uncultured phyla, was first identified in sulfur-rich marine sediments, and now was recognized for its broad ecological adaptability [1]. In estuary sediments, genome studies revealed its capacity for carbohydrate metabolism and β-oxidation [2]. KSB1 members from hydrothermal sediment possess genes encoding benzylsuccinate synthase and alkylsuccinate synthase, suggesting a role in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation [3]. In wetland sediments, KSB1 MAGs encode enzymes such as isopropanol dehydrogenase, phosphotransbutyrylase, and butyrate kinase, further highlighting their ecological versatility. Notably, KSB1 was also recovered from metagenomic data of hot spring, indicating KSB1 may harbor new functional niches that allow it to grow in the extreme environment. In addition, although nearly 100 MAGs of KSB1 have been reconstructed from various environments, the limited number of high-quality genomes hinders the ability to understand the ecological roles and metabolism of KSB1. Thus, more comprehensive research is needed to explore their metabolic pathways and evolutionary history. To address this, we collected available KSB1 genomes from public database and extracted new MAGs from hot spring samples. Our study significantly expands the genomic diversity of KSB1, clarify the phylogenetic relationships, and revealing its facultative anaerobic lifestyle and carbon fixation potential via the CBB cycle. We hereby designate this phylum as Zhuqueibacterota. Continuous sampling of hot springs in Tengchong County, Yunnan province, China, has been conducted for metagenomic studies since 2016, and 30 high-quality MAGs (Table S1) assigned to KSB1 were reconstructed from 16 metagenomes of hot springs. In total, 75 high-quality KSB1 MAGs were used to construct phylogenetic trees, including 45 genomes (Table S2) downloaded from GenBank. A maximum-likelihood tree, employing Bac120 marker sets from genome taxonomy database (GTDB), revealed that KSB1 forms a monophyletic clade within the FCB superphylum [4], and clearly separated from other phyla (Figure S1A). Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene further supports the classification of KSB1 as a distinct phylum taxon in the domain Bacteria under the kingdom Psuedomonadati [5] (Figure S1B). To resolve the phylogenetic affiliations within phylum Zhuqueibacterota, we constructed a maximum likelihood tree with a concatenated set of single-copy marker genes. Previous analyses identified four clades within KSB1 [1]; however, our phylogenetic analysis revealed five distinct groups, corresponding to five orders of the undescribed phylum KSB1 in GTDB r214 (Figure 1A) and clarified that clade II (GTDB taxonomy: p__JdFR-76) is not part of KSB1 but a sister phylum. Average amino acid identity (AAI, 95%–100% for same species) [6], and average nucleotide identity (ANI, 95%–100% for same species) (Table S3, Figure S2) were used to classify the novel lineage on the species, which were consistent with the GTDB classification. In addition, phylogenomic tree and GTDB toolkit (GTDB-Tk) (Tables S1 and S2) based analyses were performed to classify the novel lineage on genus levels and higher taxonomic ranks. Finally, we identified 1 class, 5 orders, 14 families, 27 genera, and 40 species from the 75 MAGs (Table S4), including 9 novel species from our own 30 MAGs. Following the recommendations for defining species and higher ranks of not-yet-cultured bacteria using MAGs as type material [6, 7], we proposed the name Zhuqueibacterota phyl. nov. for the KSB1 with five orders: Zhuqueibacterales (O1), Residuimicrobiales (O2), Oleimicrobiales (O3), Thermofontimicrobiales (O4), and Oceanimicrobiales (O5). Using 16S rRNA gene sequences as queries in the IMNGS platform, Zhuqueibacterota was detected across six biotopes: aquatic, sediment, soil, hydrothermal vents, animal- and plant-associated environments (Figure 1B). The phylum is particularly prevalent in soil and biofilm samples, where it constitutes 3%–10% of biofilm-associated communities (Table S5), suggesting that biofilms may serve as a protective niche for these bacteria. Zhuqueibacterales (O1), the most widely distributed order (Figure 1C), was found in diverse environments. Residuimicrobiales (O2) and Oleimicrobiales (O3) were predominantly detected in hydrothermal vents and sediment, and Thermofontimicrobiales (O4) was enriched in marine environments. Despite limited data for Oceanimicrobiales (O5), Zhuqueibacterota's broad ecological presence (Figure 1C) highlights its adaptability across various habitats, emphasizing its ecological significance. Previous studies suggested that Zhuqueibacterota is enriched in anoxic environments [1], leading to the hypothesis of an anaerobic lifestyle. In our study, genes associated with anaerobic metabolism, such as acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs), phosphate acetyltransferase (pta), acetate kinase (ack), aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh), and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh), were detected across all clades of Zhuqueibacterota (Table S6), suggesting they may have the ability to produce ethanol through fermentation [8]. Additionally, we identified the Rnf complexes [9] were widely distributed among Residuimicrobiales (O2), Oleimicrobiales (O3), and Thermofontimicrobiales (O4). Phylogenetic analysis of the rnfABCDEG operon indicated that they clustered with anaerobic microorganisms (Figure S3), further suggesting the potential anaerobic lifestyle of Residuimicrobiales (O2), Oleimicrobiales (O3), and Thermofontimicrobiales (O4). Remarkably, Zhuqueibacterota harbored cydAB genes, encoding the cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase, which provides an O2-directed respiratory chain under low-oxygen conditions. The coxABC genes [10] were identified in all MAGs of the Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5), as well as in three MAGs of the Residuimicrobiales (O2) and two MAGs of the Thermofontimicrobiales (O4). Additionally, we observed that several MAGs from Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5) encoded the aerobic aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase [10]. However, the genes of complete pathways for oxidative phosphorylation were just widely distributed in Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5). These findings suggest that members of Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5) may have the ability to utilize oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. Considering these observations, we propose that members of Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5) are more likely facultative anaerobes, rather than being obligate anaerobes. Through metabolic reconstruction, all Zhuqueibacterota orders contain complete genes for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pentose phosphate pathways (Figure 1D). MAGs assigned to the Zhuqueibacterales (O1), Thermofontimicrobiales (O4), and Oceanimicrobiales (O5) harbor the complete gene sets for the TCA cycle. We also identified a diverse array of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) among the 75 MAGs, including 79 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 10 glycosyl transferases (GTs), 10 carbohydrate esterases (CEs), 8 polysaccharide lyases (PLs), and 10 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) (Table S7). Interestingly, the gene encoding the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) was identified in 35 MAGs of Zhuqueibacterales (O1). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RuBisCO large subunit (rbcL) gene belongs to form I group (Figure 2A), which plays a crucial role in carbon fixation via the CBB cycle [11]. Moreover, genes encoding RuBisCO small subunit (rbcS), phosphoribulokinase (PRK), transketolase (TKT), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RuPE) were found near the rbcL gene cluster (Figure 2B). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that members of Zhuqueibacterota possess the capability for carbon fixation via the CBB cycle. Notably, the absence of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) and the presence of transaldolase (TAL) suggest that Zhuqueibacterota uses the transaldolase-variant of the CBB cycle [12, 13]. Carbon fixation via the CBB cycle requires significant energy and reducing equivalents, and hydrogen is a critical energy source in terrestrial hot springs [14] and hydrothermal vents [15]. Numerous prokaryotes can utilize H2 and CO2 as their energy and carbon source [16]. In our study, genes annotated to encode hydrogenases were present in Zhuqueibacterota, and the phylogenetic analyses of hydrogenases revealed five different clades ([Ni–Fe] group 1d, 3b-3d, and [Fe–Fe] group) (Figure S4). In Zhuqueibacterales (O1) MAGs, especially those containing CBB gene cluster, we identified two types of hydrogenases (Figure 2C). The [Ni–Fe]-group 1d hydrogenase, a membrane-bound hydrogenase, transfers electrons from H2 to the respiratory chain via membrane-connected cytochromes [17] (Figure S4). Additionally, the cytosolic [Ni–Fe]-group 3b hydrogenase transfers electrons generated by H2 oxidation to NAD+ [18], which serves as a reducing equivalent, for carbon fixation or for ATP production through the respiratory chain [17]. The biosynthesis and maturation of [Ni–Fe] hydrogenase are catalyzed by six Hyp proteins (hypABCDEF) [19]. The co-localization of hydrogenase maturation proteins, [Ni–Fe]-group 1 d and 3b hydrogenases (Figure 2C) indicate that Zhuqueibacterales (O1) likely utilizes hydrogen as an energy source for carbon fixation. The CBB cycle operates aerobically [20], and both the [Ni–Fe]-group 1d and 3b hydrogenases exhibit O2 tolerance, maintaining hydrogen oxidation even in the presence of oxygen. This further supports the hypothesis that Zhuqueibacterota is facultative anaerobic mixotrophy. Utilizing METABOLIC v4.0, we constructed a community metabolic network comprising with 186 medium/high-quality MAGs (completeness >50% and contamination <6%) derived from JZ2 hot spring (JZ2_202007). Despite being represented by only two MAGs, Zhuqueibacterota exhibited the highest relative abundance (15.48%). It contributed to 24 metabolic processes, with a relative contribution exceeding 25% (Figure S5, Table S8). Notably, Zhuqueibacterota dominated carbon fixation via the CBB cycle, with the highest contribution (57.9%) among all microbial taxa (Table S8). These findings suggest that Zhuqueibacterota, with its chemolithoautotrophic capabilities, plays a vital role in this ecosystem. To decipher the evolutionary histories of the Zhuqueibacterota, we predicted gene gain and loss events mapping onto a Bayesian tree showed that contemporary Zhuqueibacterota harbor more gene families over time (Figure 2D, Figure S6), with 71% of HGT events occurred within Zhuqueibacterales (O1), mostly from hot spring-associated MAGs. HGT played a major role in genome diversity, despite the common trend of genome reduction in hot spring environments. The ancestral Zhuqueibacterota likely possessed hydrogenase, with later loss events leading to the loss of this hydrogen utilization capability in some lineages. The cydAB gene (Figure 2E, Table S9) for high oxygen stress response was acquired early, while the coxABC gene was independently acquired by different lineages (Figure 2E, Table S9). Anaerobic fermentation-related genes were lost at multiple evolutionary nodes, potentially contributing to metabolic diversity, indicating that the ancestors of Zhuqueibacterota were facultative anaerobic bacteria. Genes related to the CBB cycle, such as rbcL, rbcS, and PRK, were acquired gradually. Over time, Zhuqueibacterota inhabiting thermal environments gained the ability for carbon fixation via the CBB cycle. In this study, we have expanded our understanding of the uncultured phylum KSB1, herein Zhuqueibacterota, by utilizing high-quality genomes to explore its diversity and function. Our analysis indicated that Zhuqueibacterota has clear functional differentiation, and distinct environmental preferences among its clades. Notably, this phylum represents a group of facultative anaerobic chemoautotrophs, which play a pivotal role in sustaining microbial communities in hot springs. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest the facultative anaerobic lifestyle of their ancestor, while carbon fixation capabilities probably evolved through HGT. Overall, this study provides new insights into the ecological functions of Zhuqueibacterota and open avenues for further research. Moreover, the findings indicate the possibility of isolating and purifying members of this phylum using the hydrogen-oxidizing autotrophic enrichment system.
