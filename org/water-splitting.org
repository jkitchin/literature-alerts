In situ studies of the relationship between surface spin configurations and spin-related electrocatalytic reactions are crucial for understanding how magnetic catalysts enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance under magnetic fields. In this work, 2D Fe7Se8 nanosheets with rich surface spin configurations are synthesized via chemical vapor deposition. In situ magnetic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy reveal that a 200 mT magnetic field eliminates spin-disordered domain walls, forming a spin-ordered single-domain structure, which lowers the OER energy barrier, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. Electrochemical tests show that under a 200 mT magnetic field, the OER overpotential of multidomain Fe7Se8 nanosheets at 10 mA cm–2 decreases from 346 mV to 259 mV, while the magnetic field has minimal effect on single-domain nanosheets. These findings highlight the critical role of spin configurations in enhancing electrocatalytic performance, offering new insights into the design of magnetic catalysts for industrial applications.

The perovskite oxides CaMnO3-δ, Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ, and SrMnO3-δ were synthesized in air using a solid-state method, and their structural, electrical, and electrocatalytic properties were studied in relation to their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Iodometric titration showed δ values of 0.05, 0.05, and 0.0, respectively, indicating that Mn is predominantly in the 4+ oxidation state across all materials, consistent with prior reports. Detailed characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), iodometric titration, and variable-temperature conductivity measurements. Four-point probe DC measurements revealed that CaMnO3-δ (δ = 0.05) has a semiconductive behavior over a temperature range from 25 °C to 300 °C, with its highest conductivity attributed to polaron activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M KOH was employed to assess OER catalytic performance, which correlated with room-temperature conductivity. CaMnO3-δ exhibited superior catalytic activity, followed by Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ and SrMnO3-δ, demonstrating that increased conductivity enhances OER performance. The conductivity trend, CaMnO3-δ > Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ > SrMnO3-δ, aligns with OER activity, underscoring a direct link between electronic transport properties and catalytic efficiency within this series.

Mitigating global warming necessitates transitioning from fossil fuels to alternative energy carriers like hydrogen. Efficient hydrogen production via electrocatalysis requires high-performance, stable anode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to support the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Developing noble metal-free electrocatalysts is therefore crucial, particularly for acidic electrolytes, to avoid reliance on scarce and expensive metals such as Ir and Ru. This study investigates a low-cost, solvent-free solid-state synthesis of CoSb2O6, focusing on the influence of calcination time and temperature. Six samples were prepared and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and electrochemical techniques. A non-pure CoSb2O6 phase was observed across all samples. Electrochemical testing revealed good short-term stability; however, all samples exhibited Tafel slopes exceeding 200 mV dec−1 and overpotentials greater than 1 V. The sample calcined at 600 °C for 6 h showed the best performance, with the lowest Tafel slope and overpotential, attributed to its high CoSb2O6 content and maximized {110} facet exposure. This work highlights the role of calcination protocols in developing Co-based OER catalysts and offers insights for enhancing their electrocatalytic properties.

High-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes are critical for electrochemical water splitting in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, a clean fuel for sustainable energy conversion and storage. Among OER catalysts, solid-state synthesized SrCo1−xIrxO3 has demonstrated superior activity compared to commercial standards, such as IrO2 and RuO2. However, the solid-state synthesis process is economically inefficient for industrial use due to the potential for impurities and low yield of the final product. In addition, the requirement for electrochemical cycling to activate the catalyst introduces contaminations and uncertainties for industrial applications. In this study, a modified solution-based sol–gel method was employed to produce SrCo0.5Ir0.5O3 (SCIO) with high purity and yield. Subsequent ball milling and acid leaching treatments were applied, resulting in a catalyst with higher efficiency than those activated solely by electrochemical cycling. The electrochemical analysis and physical characterizations of our SCIO catalyst after ex-situ post-synthesis treatments show a similar active phase in composition and structure to those obtained through in situ electrochemical cycling and activation. Our approach simplifies the preparation process, making the catalyst ready for direct use in PEM electrolyzers without further treatment, offering a promising solution for producing high-performance, industrial-scale OER catalysts.

Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in energy conversion and storage technologies. The precise identification of active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for developing an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. However, this remains a challenging endeavor. Here, it is demonstrated that metal‐free N‐doped defective carbon material derived from triazene derivative exhibits excellent bifunctional activity, achieving a notable ΔE value of 0.72 V. Through comprehensive X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopic analyses, the active sites responsible for oxygen electrocatalysis are elucidated, resolving a long‐standing issue. Specifically, pyridinic‐N sites are crucial for ORR, while graphitic‐N are good for OER. A predictive model utilizing π‐electron descriptors further aids in identifying these sites, with theoretical insights aligning with experimental results. Additionally, in situ ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy provides clarity on reaction intermediates for both reactions. This research paves the way for developing metal‐free, site‐specific electrocatalysts for practical applications in energy technologies.

Abstract Exploring highlyefficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is a challenging butnecessary task for development of green and renewable energy. Herein, PtIrFeCoNi high‐entropy alloy nanoflowers (HEA NFs) withstrong 3d‐5d orbital hybridization were fabricated to achieve highly efficientoverall water splitting at high current density. The Pt 26 Ir 7 Fe 13 Co 22 Ni 32 HEA NFs achieved a 57.52‐fold higher than commercial IrO 2 in turnoverfrequency (TOF) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides, its TOF value forhydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was 2.11‐fold higher than that of commercialPt/C. The cell voltages based on Pt 26 Ir 7 Fe 13 Co 22 Ni 32 HEA NFs for overall water splitting were only 1.594 V and 1.861 V at currentdensities of 100 mA cm −2 and 500 mA cm −2 , which weresignificantly lower than those of Pt/C

Transition metal‐based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition‐diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi‐C‐N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre‐deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9 nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization. The unique crystalline‐amorphous heterojunction interface enhances electrocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the electronic regulation of metal sites by interstitial C and N atoms not only optimizes the adsorption‐dissociation process in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also accelerates the surface reconstruction of hydroxyl oxides to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As a result, the as‐prepared coating achieved overpotentials of only 62 and 237 mV for the HER and OER at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolytes, and exhibited excellent OWS performance and long‐term stability at high current densities. This work presents a new perspective for synthesizing TMISS nanocrystals and promotes their application in bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Abstract Transition metal oxides like Co, Ni, and Mn are promising alternatives to noble metals such as Pt for oxygen electrocatalysis in green energy. Alloying these metals forms multicomponent catalysts with compelling properties. In this study, CoCrFeNi and MnCrFeNi thin films are synthesized using High‐Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) and their catalytic activity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and corrosion resistance in 1 molar (1 M) potassium hydroxide (KOH) are evaluated. MnCrFeNi films exhibit a fine‐grained single face‐centered cubic (FCC) phase, while CoCrFeNi films have larger grains and multiple phases. ORR on CoCrFeNi follows a 2+1 electron transfer pathway, producing hydroxide radicals, while MnCrFeNi exhibits a 2‐electron pathway, yielding hydrogen peroxide. Anodization reduces the CoCrFeNi overpotential from 0.9 to 0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), comparable to platinum and iridium catalysts (Pt/C, Ir/C). Anodization also shifts CoCrFeNi ORR to a 2‐electron pathway. In situ Raman spectroscopy detects no ORR intermediates, but nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) appears during OER. Substituting Mn for Co increases corrosion resistance by raising the corrosion potential. All films show passive behavior during polarization, demonstrating their potential for corrosion protection and electrocatalysis in green energy applications.

Abstract Inducing magnetic ordering in a non‐ferrous layered double hydroxides (LDHs) instigates higher spin polarization, which leads to enhanced efficiency during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In nano‐sized magnetic materials, the concept of elongated grains drives domain alignment under the application of an external magnetic field. Hence, near the solid electrode interface, modified magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) positively impacts the electrocatalytic ability of non‐ferrous nanocatalysts. Consequently, significant improvement in the water‐splitting kinetics can be obtained by using even low magnetic fields. At 100 Gauss, 20% and 10% decrement in the overpotential is reported for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are also presented to explain the thermodynamics of the HER/OER processes. It is established that the Gibbs energy of the process can reduce the exchange energy barrier by using dopant like cobalt. The additional cobalt metal active site have the highest probability for adsorption of reactive intermediates during HER and OER, which results in higher efficiencies.

Abstract Constructing bifunctional electrocatalysts through the synergistic effect of diverse metal sites is crucial for achieving high‐efficiency and steady overall water splitting. Herein, a “dual‐HER/OER‐sites‐in‐one” strategy is proposed to regulate dominant active sites, wherein Ni/Co(OH) 2 ‐Ru heterogeneous catalysts formed on nickel foam (NF) demonstrate remarkable catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the potentials@10 mA cm −2 of Ni/Co(OH) 2 ‐Ru@NF for overall alkaline water and seawater splitting are only 1.36 and 1.41 V, respectively, surpassing those of commercial RuO 2 @NF and Pt/C@NF. The Ru site is identified as the primary active site for HER by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, while the Co(OH) 2 site displays the minimal rate‐determining step energy barrier (RDS) and functions as the main active site for OER. This study offers novel perspectives on the rational utilization of diverse metal species’ catalytic capabilities for developing dual active sites multifunctional electrocatalysts.

The study of degradation behavior of electrocatalysts in an industrial context calls for rapid and efficient analysis methods. Optical methods like Raman spectroscopy fulfil these requirements and are thus predestined for this purpose. However, the iridium utilized in proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is Raman inactive in its metallic state. This work demonstrates the high oxidation sensitivity of iridium and its utilization in analysis of catalyst materials. Laser induced oxidation Raman spectroscopy (LIORS) is established as a novel method for qualitative, chemical and structural analysis of iridium catalysts. Differences in particle sizes of iridium powders drastically change oxidation sensitivity. Oxidation of the iridium powders to IrO2 occurred at a laser power density of 0.47 ± 0.06 mW μm-2 for the 850 μm powder and at 0.12 ± 0.06 mW μm-2 and 0.019 ± 0.015 mW μm-2 for the 50 μm and 0.7-0.9 μm powders respectively. LIORS was utilized to assess possible deterioration of an iridium electrocatalyst due to operation under electrolysis. The operating electrocatalyst exhibited higher oxidation sensitivity, suggesting smaller iridium particle size due to catalyst dissolution. Peak shifts of the IrO2 signal were utilized to assess differences in transformation temperatures. The operated electrocatalyst transformed to IrO2 at lower temperature (8 cm-1 redshift) relative to the pristine catalyst (10 cm-1 redshift), demonstrating that pre-oxidation of the iridium to amorphous IrOx during electrolysis diminishes the energy barrier needed for IrO2 formation. Thus, LIORS can be utilized as a straightforward screening method for the analysis of iridium electrocatalysts in the industrial application of PEMEL.

Designing bifunctional catalysts that improve the efficiency of both oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is a strategy to enhance the performance of lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs). Co3O4/CoFe2O4/nitrogen-doped carbon heterostructures were synthesized as electrocatalysts using coprecipitation and calcination methods. The morphology of the composite was characterized by a hollow nanocube shape, which facilitated the exposure of active sites and provided space for Li2O2 storage. At the heterogeneous interface, electronic interactions gave rise to the interfacial charge redistribution. This redistribution not only improved the catalytic activity but also induced the generation and reversible decomposition of mixed Li2O2 and LiOH discharge products. On this basis, the specific capacity of Co3O4/CoFe2O4/nitrogen-doped carbon when used as a cathode catalyst was 8930 mAh g–1 and could be stably cycled for 118 cycles, which was an improvement over the single Co3O4 cathode.

Abstract Enhancing the catalytic performance and durability of M‐N─C catalyst is crucial for the efficient operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and Zn‐Air batteries (ZABs). Herein, an approach is developed for the in situ fabrication of a MOFs‐derived porous carbon material, co‐loaded with Co nanoparticles (NPs) and Co‐N x sites and integrated onto Fe‐doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs), named Co NP/SA ‐NC/Fe‐NCNTs. Incorporating polymer‐wrapped CNTs improves MOFs dispersion annealing at high temperature, which amplifies the three‐phase boundary (TPB) by generating much more mesopores and exposing additional active sites within the catalysts layer. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the presence of Co NPs promotes the conversion of oxygen‐containing intermediates for Co‐N x sites. The optimized catalysts display a half‐wave potential of 0.9 V (vs RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential of 327 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, which significantly outperforms the counterpart single structure, as well as noble‐metal‐based catalysts. Specifically, the PEMFCs and ZABs derived from Co NP/SA ‐NC/Fe‐NCNTs catalyst exhibit power densities of 702 and 192 mW cm −2 , respectively. This work offers novel insights into the synthesis of the composited bifunctional carbon materials for ZABs and PEMFCs application.

Electrochemical water splitting is a promising method for the generation of "green hydrogen", a renewable and sustainable energy source. However, the complex, multistep synthesis processes, often involving hazardous or expensive chemicals, limit its broader adoption. Herein, a nitrate (NO3-) anion-intercalated nickel-iron-cerium mixed-metal (oxy)hydroxide heterostructure electrocatalyst is fabricated on nickel foam (NiFeCeOxHy@NF) via a simple electrodeposition method followed by cyclic voltammetry activation to enhance its surface properties. The NiFeCeOxHy@NF electrocatalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 72 and 186 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1.0 M KOH. In a two-electrode system, the NiFeCeOxHy@NF obtained a low voltage of 1.47 V at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH with robust stability. Results revealed that the notable activity of the NiFeCeOxHy@NF catalyst is primarily due to (i) hierarchical nanosheet morphology, which provides a large surface area and abundant active sites; (ii) NO3- anion intercalation enhances electrode stability and eliminates the need for binders while simultaneously promoting a strong catalyst-substrate adhesion, resulting in decreased electrode resistance and accelerated reaction kinetics; and (iii) the unique superhydrophilic surface properties facilitate electrolyte penetration through capillary action and minimize gas bubble formation by reducing interfacial tension.

Methanol (ME) is a liquid hydrogen carrier, ideal for on-site-on-demand H2 generation, avoiding its costly and risky distribution issues, but this "ME-to-H2" electric conversion suffers from high voltage (energy consumption) and competitive oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that a synergistic cofunctional Pt1Pdn/(Ni,Co)(OH)x catalyst with Pt single atoms (Pt1) and Pd nanoclusters (Pdn) anchored on OH-vacancy(VOH)-rich (Ni,Co)(OH)x nanoparticles create synergistic triadic active sites, allowing for methanol-enhanced low-voltage H2 generation. For MOR, OH* is preferentially adsorbed on Pdn and then interacts with the intermediates (such as *CHO or *CHOOH) adsorbed favorably on neighboring Pt1 with the assistance of hydrogen bonding from the surface hydrogen of (Ni,Co)(OH)x. The enhanced selectivity of the *CHOOH pathway, instead of *CO, sustains the MOR activity to a practically high current density. For HER, triadic Pt1, Pdn, and OH-vacancy sites on (Ni,Co)(OH)x create an "acid–base" microenvironment to facilitate water adsorption and splitting, forming H* species on Pt1 and Pdn, and *OH at the vacancy, to promote efficient H2 evolution from the asymmetric Pt1 and Pdn sites via the Tafel mechanism. The triadic-site synergy opens new avenues for the design and synthesis of highly efficient and stable cofunctional catalysts for "on-site-on-demand" H2 production, here facilitated by liquid methanol.

Abstract The vast compositional space of high-entropy materials offers unprecedented opportunities for the development of powerful catalysts. However, their inverse design remains unfeasible due to the lack of robust theoretical frameworks and high-throughput experimental tools. This study demonstrates a practical inverse design approach that integrates spectroscopic descriptors, generative machine learning, and a robotic experimental platform to synthesize and optimize catalyst composition for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The automated system significantly accelerated catalysts design and experimental validation, reducing the time required for synthesis, characterization and performance testing from approximately 20 hours to only 78 minutes per sample. Following a rapid screen for efficient senary high-entropy catalysts, the spectroscopic generative model further optimized the top-performing candidate, lowering its overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 by an additional 32 mV. Our findings are a testament to the potential of an inverse design approach that incorporates spectroscopic descriptors into generative machine learning to accelerate catalyst discovery. Moreover, this approach is also expected to drive the intelligent design of high-performance complex materials.

Abstract The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is characterized by a lower overpotential compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during electrolysis, which facilitates the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Charge distribution, which can be modulated by the introduction of a heterostructure, plays a key role in enhancing the adsorption and cleavage of chemical groups within urea molecules. Herein, a facile all‐room temperature synthesis of functional heterojunction NiCo 2 S 4 /CoMo 2 S 4 grown on carbon cloth (CC) is presented, and the as‐prepared electrode served as a catalyst for simultaneous hydrogen evolution and urea oxidation reaction. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) study reveals spontaneous transfer of charge at the heterointerface of NiCo 2 S 4 /CoMo 2 S 4 , which triggers the formation of localized electrophilic/nucleophilic regions and facilitates the adsorption of electron donating/electron withdrawing group in urea molecules during the UOR. The NiCo 2 S 4 /CoMo 2 S 4 // NiCo 2 S 4 /CoMo 2 S 4 electrode pair required only a cell voltage of 1.17 and 1.18 V to deliver a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm −2 respectively in urea electrolysis cell and display very good stability. Tests performed in real urine samples show similar catalytic performance to urea electrolytes, making the work one of the best transition metal‐based catalysts for UOR applications, promising both efficient hydrogen production and urea decomposition.

Abstract Photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes will play a crucial role in future clean energy systems, however severe charge recombination and sluggish charge transfer kinetics have hindered their practical adoption. Exploiting ferroelectric polarization‐controlled charge dynamics promises an additional lever that can potentially enable the performance limits of traditional static photoelectrodes to be surpassed. Here one of the most notable ferroelectric polarization‐induced photocurrent enhancements is reported, using a heterostructure of the multiferroic bismuth ferrite (BFO) and the photoactive bismuth vanadate (BVO) in a neutral pH electrolyte. In contrast to previous works, enhancements for both poling directions are reported, of 136% for down‐poled BFO/BVO and 70% for up‐poled BFO/BVO at 1.23 V RHE in comparison to the unpoled sample, delivering a Faradaic efficiency of >95% for prolonged oxygen evolution reaction. Extensive PEC and surface analyses complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the improvements are attributed to the modulation of gradients in the BFO band energies, as well as changes in band‐bending and offsets at the interfaces. Given the scalability of the employed sol–gel synthesis method and the use of environmentally benign materials and PEC conditions, these findings pave the way for multifunctional materials as new‐generation agile and dynamic catalysts and photoelectrode systems.

Abstract Gold-based (Au) nanostructures are efficient catalysts for CO oxidation, hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions, but stabilizing them on graphene (Gr) is challenging due to weak affinity from delocalized $$p_{z}$$ carbon orbitals. This study investigates forming metal alloys to enhance stability and catalytic performance of Au-based nanocatalysts. Using ab initio density functional theory, we characterize $${\text {M}_{(n-x)}\text {Au}_{x}}$$ sub-nanoclusters (M = Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, and Ag) with atomicities $$n=1-4$$ , both in gas-phase and supported on Gr. We find that M atoms act as “anchors,” enhancing binding to Gr and modulating catalytic efficiency. Notably, $${\text {Pt}_{(n-x)}\text {Au}_{x}}$$ /Gr shows improved stability, with segregation tendencies mitigated upon adsorption on Gr. The d -band center ( $$\varepsilon _{\text {d}}$$ ) model indicates catalytic potential, correlating an optimal $$\varepsilon _{\text {d}}$$ range of $$-1 \text { to }-2$$ eV for HER and OER catalysts. Incorporating Au into $${\text{M}_n}$$ adjusts $$\varepsilon _{\text {d}}$$ closer to the Fermi level, especially for Group-10 alloys, offering designs with improved stability and efficiency comparable to pure Au nanocatalysts. Our methodology leveraged SimStack, a workflow framework enabling modeling and analysis, enhancing reproducibility, and accelerating discovery. This work demonstrates SimStack’s pivotal role in advancing the understanding of composition-dependent stability and catalytic properties of Au-alloy clusters, providing a systematic approach to optimize metal-support interactions in catalytic applications.

Abstract Developing efficient, multifunctional electrodes for energy storage and conversion devices is crucial. Herein, lattice strains are reported in the β‐phase polymorph of CoMoO 4 within CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 heterostructure via phosphorus doping (P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 ) and used as a high‐performance trifunctional electrode for supercapacitors (SCs), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. A tensile strain of +2.42% on the β‐phase of CoMoO 4 in P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 results in superior electrochemical performance compared to CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 . The optimized P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 achieves a high energy density of 118 Wh kg −1 in an asymmetric supercapacitor and low overpotentials of 189 mV for the HER and 365 mV for the OER at a current density of 500 mA cm −2 . This results in a low overall water splitting voltage of 1.71 V at the same current density making it an effective bifunctional electrode in a 1 m KOH freshwater electrolyte. Theoretical analysis shows that the excellent performance of P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 can be attributed to interfacial interactions between CoMoO 4 and Co 3 O 4 , and the β‐phase of CoMoO 4 , which lead to strong OH − adsorption and low energy barriers for reaction intermediates. Practical application is demonstrated by using P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 ‐based ASCs to self‐generate hydrogen (H 2 ) in a P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 ||P‐CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 alkaline seawater electrolyzer, showcasing its potential for future energy technologies.

Abstract The study introduces flexible and scalable manufacturing approach for electrodes utilizing boron‐doped silicon as conductive support for iridium nanoparticles, addressing the challenges of cost and scarcity associated wit noble catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Colloidal Ir nanoparticles are synthesized via pulsed‐laser ablation (≈4–7 nm) and decorated on B‐doped Si (≈100 nm) through electrostatic adsorption. Titanium substrates are ultrasonically sprayed with Si:B – Ir and Ir nanoparticles with very low iridium loading of 12 wt.%. Crystalline Ir phases (Ir(111), Ir(200)) are observed and known to enhance the OER mechanism. Additionally, atom probe tomography confirms that the Si support particles contained 0.03‐0.5 at% of boron throughout the entire particle, while electrical permittivity and through‐plane measurements reveal a positive impact of B‐doped Si on the electrical conductivity of the nanocatalysts and of the ultralow‐loaded catalyst coated Ti substrates (0.12 mg Ir cm −2 ), respectively. Rotating disk electrode results show pronounced oxidation peaks for decorated Ir nanoparticles. The Si:B‐Ir 4 nm catalyst exhibits the highest turonover frequency (2.62 s⁻¹) and a competitive electrochemical surface area (25 m 2 g Ir −1 ) compared to Si:B‐Ir 7 nm (0.96 s⁻¹; 37.5 m 2 g Ir −1 ) and Ir black (0.24 s⁻¹; 5 m 2 g Ir −1 ). The overall analysis of the parameters highlights a performant catalytic efficiency, through balancing activity and reaction kinetics effectively.

Iridium (Ir)-based catalysts embracing both catalytic activity and stability are of great significance for scaling up the application of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein, supported IrO2 on TiO2 (IrO2/TiO2) with high specific surface area and electrolytic activity was prepared by adopting a chlorine (Cl)-free synthesis based on the Adams fusion method. The crucial influential factors of annealing temperature were systematically explored on the catalytic activity and stability of IrO2/TiO2. Although increasing annealing temperature is believed to be of benefit to the increase of crystallinity and nanoparticle size in the catalyst, thus improving the stability of the catalyst, the as-prepared catalyst annealed at high temperature exhibited inferior stability at a constant-current density working state. This result is mainly attributed to the adverse impact of the annealing process at high temperatures on the catalytic activity, in terms of decreasing the active surface area due to the aggregation effect and decreasing the intrinsic activity due to the formation of a highly crystalline structure. The inferior catalytic activity caused by the adverse impact can induce a large working voltage, which can accelerate the catalyst degradation via a positive feedback mechanism (PFM) beneath the electrocatalytic system consisting of 'catalytic activity–electrocatalytic performance (working voltage)–aging'. Besides, the influences of Cl residue on the catalytic activity and stability of the as-prepared IrO2/TiO2 were also investigated by substituting a Cl-free precursor using IrCl3 (IrO2/TiO2–Cl). It presented slightly inferior initial oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic performance to that using a Cl-free precursor, perhaps due to the strong adsorption of Cl residue on IrO2 nanoparticles. However, the stability of the as-prepared IrO2/TiO2–Cl deteriorates significantly in chronopotentiometric measurement probably due to the PFM. Consequently, catalytic activity and stability are of equal significance; both the annealing temperature and Cl residue need to be fine-tuned to achieve an optimal combination of catalytic activity and stability.

ii regions closest to the centre of the MW (at a radii of 4-5 kpc) are close to the binned oxygen abundances in NGC 3521 at the same galactocentric distances; an accurate value of the central oxygen abundance in the MW cannot be established because of the lack of the measurements near the centre. The oxygen abundances in the outer part of the MW are lower than those in the outer part of NGC 3521. The gas mass fraction in the outer part of the MW is higher than in NGC 3521. The obtained values of the effective oxygen yield, Y_eff, in NGC 3521 are close to the empirical estimation of the oxygen yield, Y_O. This suggests that mass exchange with the surroundings plays little to no role in the current chemical evolution of NGC3521. The values of the Y_eff in the MW were determined using two variants of the radial distribution of the gas mass surface density. The values of the Y_eff in the MW obtained with the first distribution are also close to Y_O, as in NGC 3521. The Y_eff in the MW obtained with the second distribution are below Y_O at radii between ∼6 and ∼10.4 kpc. This suggests that the mass exchange with the surroundings can play a significant role in the chemical evolution of this part of the MW, in contrast to that in NGC 3521. To draw a solid conclusion about the role of mass exchange with the surroundings in the chemical evolution of the MW it is essential to determine which of these distributions provides a more adequate description of the gas distribution in the MW.

We applied a highly accurate Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to obtain thermodynamic data for various water-nitrogen clusters. In combination with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and wavefunction analysis, we proposed a theoretical pathway for the evolution of nitrogen-water cation clusters, offering insights into the formation of oxidative environments. Our calculations reveal that nitrogen molecules can form weak bonds with certain hydrogen-oxygen cations, stabilizing key intermediates during hydroxyl radical transfer. Such interaction alters the cluster’s evolution. Our findings show a clear map of how nitrogen-water cluster cations evolve and give oxidative reactants.

Pogo is identified as a deep-seated, intrusion-related gold deposit. Carbonate minerals have a close spatial relationship to hydrothermal gold mineralization in all of its principal ore zones. The carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of carbonate minerals (siderite, ankerite, and calcite) present within the deposit illustrate the isotopic evolution of the ore-forming fluid. The initial hydrothermal fluid phase is interpreted to be magmatic in origin. The fluid evolution was characterized by a gradual decrease in δ18O and a slight increase in δ13C with decreasing temperature. The dominant carbon-bearing species was CO2, with methane introduced sporadically. Siderite is associated with early-stage mineralization and occurs with ankerite in main-stage ore assemblages. Calcite is recognized in the later stages of mineralization. Gold in the Pogo deposit occurs as native gold, Au-Bi-Te minerals, inclusions in sulfide minerals, or as “invisible gold”. The latter is found in pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and quartz, based on ion microprobe analysis. The presence of invisible gold in these minerals has significant metallurgical implications for gold processing at the Pogo mine.

Modern-day applications demand onboard electricity generation that can be achieved using piezoelectric phenomena. Reducing the dimensionality of materials is a pathway to enhancing the piezoelectric properties. Transition-metal dichalcogenides have been shown to exhibit high piezoelectricity. Monolayer MoS2 possesses strong piezoelectricity that is otherwise negligible in its bulk form. The presence of sulfur vacancy defects in two-dimensional MoS2 can starkly reduce piezoelectric output due to enhanced charge screening. Oxygen passivation offers thermodynamically favorable and superior vacancy passivation. Here, we demonstrate an in situ oxygen passivation of sulfur vacancies achieved by performing chemical vapor deposition in atmospheric pressure conditions, resulting in a dramatically enhanced piezoelectric output. We achieved an out-of-plane effective piezoelectric coefficient d33eff 0.54 pm/V for the MoS2 monolayer with sulfur vacancies (SV-MoS2) and 0.94 pm/V where sulfur vacancies are passivated by oxygen (OP-MoS2). The piezoelectric device (PED) based on OP-MoS2 exhibits 26% higher output voltage than SV-MoS2 with the maximum peak-to-peak value of 0.95 V. Additionally, we show that the OP-MoS2-based PED can charge a 330 nF capacitor 30% faster than the SV-MoS2 PED for up to 50 mV in 0.5 s by repetitive finger tapping. The evolution of piezoelectricity in MoS2 with sulfur vacancy defect manipulation promises an avenue for scalable defect engineering for next-generation applications in miniaturized self-powered electronics and sensors across computing, healthcare, and size-, weight-, and power-constrained environments.

In this study, hydrogeochemistry and environmentally stable isotopes were employed to examine the processes involved in recharging aquifer systems and the changes in the groundwater chemistry caused by the interaction between the water and the aquifer matrix. Based on data derived from 113 groundwater wells, various tools and techniques, including stable environmental isotopes Oxygen-18 and Deuterium (δ18O and δD) for 33 samples and geochemical modeling with NETPATH, were used to evaluate the recharge mechanism and the evolution of the groundwater, combining GIS with hydrological and hydrochemical methods. The results revealed that groundwater from the Quaternary was the main source for irrigation; the water quality was categorized as relatively fresh to saline, with the total dissolved solids (TDSs) ranging from 261.3 to 8628.56 mg/L, exhibiting an average value of 2311.68 mg/L. The results of the environmental isotope analysis showed that the range of oxygen δ18O isotopes in the groundwater was from −5.65‰ to +0.39‰, while the range of hydrogen δD isotopes was from −32.60‰ to 4.73‰. Moreover, the δ18O–δD relationship indicated that the groundwater samples fell around the global meteoric precipitation line, showing a strong relationship, with a coefficient (R2) of approximately 0.82. The NETPATH model revealed that the dissolved chemical species within the groundwater system primarily originated from processes such as mineral weathering and dissolution, ion exchange, and evaporation.

In a hybrid microbial–inorganic catalysis system, H2 evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are coupled with microorganisms to achieve the highly efficient conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals using H2 as an electron mediator. However, currently developed HER electrocatalysts suffer from poor biocompatibility, hindering the performance of the system. This study presents a N- and Si-doped polythiophene nanocomposite (PTh-NSi) as a nonmetal HER electrocatalyst with biocompatibility for use in a hybrid microbial–inorganic catalysis system. By coupling PTh-NSi with Ralstonia eutropha H16, conversion of CO2 to poly-β-hydroxybutyrate with a maximum yield of 662.99 ± 27.46 mg/L was achieved. The PTh-NSi electrocatalyst demonstrated HER performance in bacterial media, minimal reactive oxygen species production, and no heavy metal ion leaching, ensuring biocompatibility with R. eutropha H16. The interactions between PTh-NSi and R. eutropha H16 were revealed. This work highlights an approach to designing biocompatible catalysts for hybrid microbial–inorganic catalysis systems, offering the potential for sustainable CO2 conversion.

Plants must effectively respond to various environmental stimuli to achieve optimal growth. This is especially relevant in the context of climate change, where drought emerges as a major factor globally impacting crops and limiting overall yield potential. Throughout evolution, plants have developed adaptative strategies for environmental stimuli, with plant hormones and reactive oxygen species (ROS) playing essential roles in their development. Hormonal signaling and the maintenance of ROS homeostasis are interconnected, playing indispensable roles in growth, development, and stress responses and orchestrating diverse molecular responses during environmental adversities. Nine principal classes of phytohormones have been categorized: auxins, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, and gibberellins primarily oversee developmental growth regulation, while abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and strigolactones are the main orchestrators of environmental stress responses. Coordination between phytohormones and transcriptional regulation is crucial for effective plant responses, especially in drought stress. Understanding the interplay of ROS and phytohormones is pivotal for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in plant stress responses. This review provides an overview of the intricate relationship between ROS, redox metabolism, and the nine different phytohormones signaling in plants, shedding light on potential strategies for enhancing drought tolerance for sustainable crop production.

Abstract The Systemic Evolutionary Theory of the Origin of Cancer (SETOC) is a recently proposed theory founded on two primary principles: the cooperative and endosymbiotic process of cell evolution as described by Lynn Margulis, and the integration of complex systems operating in eukaryotic cells, which is a core concept in systems biology. The SETOC proposes that malignant transformation occurs when cells undergo a continuous adaptation process in response to long-term injuries, leading to tissue remodeling, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately cancer. This process involves a maladaptive response, wherein the 'endosymbiotic contract’ between the nuclear-cytoplasmic system (derived from the primordial archaeal cell) and the mitochondrial system (derived from the primordial α-proteobacterium) gradually breaks down. This ultimately leads to uncoordinated behaviors and functions in transformed cells. The decoupling of the two cellular subsystems causes transformed cells to acquire phenotypic characteristics analogous to those of unicellular organisms, as well as certain biological features of embryonic development that are normally suppressed. These adaptive changes enable cancer cells to survive in the harsh tumor microenvironment characterized by low oxygen concentrations, inadequate nutrients, increased catabolic waste, and increased acidity. De-endosymbiosis reprograms the sequential metabolic functions of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This leads to increased lactate fermentation (Warburg effect), respiratory chain dysfunction, and TCA cycle reversal. Here, we present an updated version of the SETOC that incorporates the fundamental principles outlined by this theory and integrates the epistemological approach used to develop it.

Ambrosia trifida is an invasive weed that destroys the local ecological environment, and causes a reduction in population diversity and grassland decline. The evolution of herbicide resistance has also increased the difficulty of managing A. trifida, so interspecific plant competition based on allelopathy has been used as an effective and sustainable ecological alternative. However, how to control A. trifida through interspecific competition and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we found that extracts from both the roots and leaves of the medicinal plant Sigesbeckia glabrescens suppressed the growth of A. trifida by reducing the plant height and biomass. The decrease in biomass may be explained by disruption of carbon and nitrogen metabolism. These disruptions are due to a significant decrease in the expression of genes related to nitrate absorption and transport in roots and a significant decrease in the expression of key genes related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation. Consequently, genes involved in sucrose synthesis are downregulated. In addition, increases in H2O2 content and respiratory burst oxidase homologue (RbohD) gene expression suggested that A. trifida underwent oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts, resulting in apoptosis due to the significant upregulation of key genes associated with apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, we identified three main allelochemicals, coumarin, ferulic acid, and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), in S. glabrescens extracts and revealed that the combination of these three compounds could suppress the growth of A. trifida seedlings. The phenotypes and transcriptome profiles of the seedlings treated with these chemicals were the same as those of the seedlings treated with the S. glabrescens extracts. Taken together, the results of this study revealed the mechanism underlying the toxic effects of S. glabrescens on A. trifida, providing a theoretical basis for the use of interspecific plant competition for invasive weed control and further application of S. glabrescens allelochemicals in weed management.

The synthesis of micro-and nano-particles must be precisely controlled to achieve the desired shape and composition, as these characteristics profoundly influence their applicative efficacy. A large body of literature aims at constantly improving structure/function of these materials by refining synthesis procedures. Within it, a growing field of chemistry focuses on green synthesis methods to provide more sustainable alternatives while maintaining the bioactive efficiency of the particles. For instance, this Research Topic features a study on magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles synthesized using Azadirachta indica (neem) extract (Al-Harbi et al., 2024). The produced MgO nanoparticles exhibit remarkable stability under heat and in biological media, alongside notable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. Aligned with this search for greener processes and materials, another featured study reviews the development of silk fibroin-based scaffolds for tissue engineering (Ma et al., 2024). Silk, biosynthesized by over 200,000 arthropod species -including the Bombyx mori moth, whose silk is the most characterized -offers a rich source of fibroin, a natural biopolymer. Silk fibroin stands out for its mechanical strength, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and structural tunability. It can be used alone or combined with other materials to enhance cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.A focus in regenerative medicine consists in creating tissue alternatives to repair aging or diseased tissues and organs. It generally relies on the use of a scaffold for cell support. These scaffolds must meet precise guidelines to provide appropriate biomechanical and biochemical cues to facilitate cell adhesion and regulate phenotypic expression. Their conception thus requires control over shape, mechanical properties, and surface characteristics. The previously mentioned review on silk fibroin details the numerous possible processing techniques of this biomaterial (i.e. electrospinning, freeze-drying, solvent casting, gas foaming, particulate leaching, 3D printing) making it versatile and relevant for the repair of various tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, blood vessel, and nerves (Ma et al., 2024). Nano-and micro-structuration of scaffolds is another approach to enhance scaffold features as explored in this research topic in a study that showcases the incorporation of graphene oxide to the pure hardystonite (used for bone repair) leading to the obtention of a porous nano-and microstructured hardystonite/reduced graphene oxide composite (Bagherpour et al., 2023). The produced biomaterial demonstrates enhanced osteogenic differentiation and mechanical strength. An additional study focuses on the nanoscale properties of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), also employed in bone repair (Su et al., 2023). Granular-shaped BCP nanoparticles were synthesized, and the nanoscale texturing of these materials enhanced biocompatibility and osteogenic features. Importantly, they demonstrated immunomodulatory effects by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages, even under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions. The ability of BCP nanoparticles to restore osteogenesis impaired by inflammation underscores their dual role in promoting bone regeneration and modulating the immune response.Nanometer-scaled materials can provide stronger antibacterial features. The silver-copper bimetallic nanoparticles featured in this issue exemplify this strategy (Hao et al., 2024). Silver and copper nanoparticles have superior antibacterial effects compared to their bulk or micron-size counterparts. Furthermore, combining these nanomaterials rather than using them individually amplifies their antibacterial efficacy while minimizing cytotoxicity. These nanoparticles have dynamic interactions in biological environments through metal ions release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which collectively boost localized antibacterial activity, minimizing systemic side effects (Hao et al., 2024).Bioinspired MgO NPs also exhibited targeted effects. They show selective cytotoxicity against liver hepatic cancer cells in comparison to human umbilical vein endothelial ones, encouraging their potential in anticancer therapies (Al-Harbi et al., 2024). Additionally, they demonstrate significant antidiabetic activity through the inhibition of key enzymes like αglucosidase and α-amylase, along with robust anti-inflammatory effects via protein stabilization and cytokine regulation. Antioxidant activity is another critical aspect of bioactive particles. By scavenging free radicals, MgO NPs protect tissues from oxidative stress, a major contributor to inflammation and chronic diseases.Similarly, BCP nanomaterials have shown remarkable bioactivity. They mitigate inflammation in macrophages and enhance osteogenic processes by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and upregulating osteogenesis-related genes, such as Runx2 and OPN (Su et al., 2023). Notably, BCP nanoparticles can reverse the detrimental effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions on osteoblast activity. This dual functionality makes BCP nanoparticles promising candidates for applications in environments where inflammation impedes bone regeneration.The integration of micro-and nano-particles into regenerative medicine can not only support tissue regeneration but also actively engage in therapeutic processes. While these versatile biomaterials hold large promises, challenges still remain for their widespread adoption in the clinic. Among them, the assessment of long-term biocompatibility requires monitoring biomaterial evolution over years. It is a complex task, yet necessary, as these materials are designed to interact with biological systems over extended periods. Another challenge concerns their integration with advanced manufacturing, such as 3D printing, as well as the scalability and reproducibility of their manufacturing. This is necessary to ensure consistent production of high-quality particles for large-scale applications. In parallel to these technical hurdles come regulatory and translational barriers. However, as this field progresses and with sustained efforts to overcome these obstacles, we are optimistic that micro-and nanoparticles can pave the way for more effective medical solutions.

Metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) breast cancer often develops resistance to first-line treatment, typically combining cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with hormone therapy (HT) [1, 2]. After an initial response, most patients become resistant, and compensatory mechanisms are not fully uncovered [3]. To address this, we analyzed HR+ resistant CAMA1 and 747D cells using whole-exome and RNA sequencing, supplemented by proteomics and target validation with human samples. Additionally, we conducted combination therapy trials using xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Detailed study designs and methods are provided in the Supplementary file. In a cohort of 27 patients with metastatic breast cancer, we observed reduced progression-free survival in second- and third-line therapies following progression post palbociclib-HT treatment (Supplementary Figure S1A and Supplementary Table S1). Resistant tumors showed reduced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and progesterone receptor (PR) and increased proliferation rates (Supplementary Figure S1B-D). CAMA1 and T47D cells, treated with palbociclib and fulvestrant (PF) for 2 years, developed resistance (CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR) confirmed by proliferation assays and elevated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. Resistant cells exhibited reduced levels of ERα and retinoblastoma protein (Supplementary Figure S2). Exome analysis revealed no drug resistance-related mutations (Supplementary Tables S2-S3), suggesting non-genetic factors. RNA sequencing of T47D cells treated with DMSO or PF for 20 days and T47D-PFR cells revealed 1,172 upregulated genes and 824 downregulated genes in the resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). Gene set enrichment analysis indicated increased fatty acid localization (Supplementary Figure S3B), with a heatmap showing elevated fatty acid uptake and metabolism-related genes, such as fatty acid binding protein-6 (FABP6), FABP7, cluster of differentiation-36 (CD36), and proteasome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in T47D-PFR cells (Figure 1A). Lipid droplets accumulated in PF-treated parental and PF-resistant T47D and CAMA1 cells (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S3C). FABP6 levels were elevated in PF-treated parental and PF-resistant cells, with CD36 overexpression unique to T47D-PFR cells at both protein and mRNA levels (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S3D-E), suggesting that lipid uptake might be an adaptive response to oxidative stress [4, 5]. This was supported by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in PF-treated parental cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, proteomic analysis in human biopsies revealed a functional network of 11 oxidative stress-triggered proteasomes (Supplementary Figure S4A and Supplementary Tables S4-S5) as indicators of oxidative stress [6]. Immunohistochemistry validated increased proteasome subunit alpha type-7 (PSMA7) in resistant biopsies (Supplementary Figure S4B). Ferroptosis inducers overcome resistance of HR+HER2− breast cancer cells to palbociclib-hormone therapy. (A) Heatmap of upregulated genes (red) or downregulated genes (blue) during the treatment of T47D cells with PF combination for 20 days, and in PF-resistant cells (T47D-PFR) after continuous PF treatment for 2 years, compared to parental T47D cells treated with vehicle (DMSO). All represented genes had a P value < 0.05. (B) Lipid droplet detection by BODIPY 493/503 staining in parental CAMA1 and T47D cells after treatment with the PF combination for 20 days, and in CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells after continuous PF treatment for 2 years. DAPI staining was used to visualize the nuclei.

(E) Western blot analysis of GPX4 in parental CAMA1, T47D and ZR75.1 cells after treatment with PF combination for 20 days and in CAMA1-PFR, T47D-PFR and ZR75.1-PFR cells after continuous PF treatment for 2 years.

(G) Assessment of cell proliferation according to the fold change in confluence in parental and PF-resistant CAMA1 and T47D cells treated with DMSO, the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 (1 µmol/L), the ferroptosis inhibitor Trolox (10 µmol/L), or a combination of both for 7 days. Continuous PF treatment for resistant cells was discontinued 3 days prior to the assay. (H) Assessment of cell proliferation according to the fold change in confluence in parental and PF-resistant CAMA1 and T47D cells treated with different combinations of DMSO, palbociclib (P) (0.3 µmol/L), fulvestrant (F) (30 nmol/L), or eprenetapopt (Ep) (25 µmol/L) for 7 days. Continuous PF treatment for resistant cells was discontinued 3 days prior to the assay. (I, J) Tumor growth curves of parental CAMA1 (6 mice per group) (I) and CAMA1-PFR (8 mice per group) (J) xenografts treated with different combinations of palbociclib (P) 75 mg/kg daily, fulvestrant (F) 50 mg/kg once a week, and eprenetapopt (Ep) 150 mg/kg, 2 times/day or RSL3 100 mg/kg by intratumoral injection every two days for two weeks (***P < 0.001). (K) Growth curves of palbociclib-HT-naïve HBCx-124 PDXs (5 mice per group) treated with different combinations of palbociclib (P) 75 mg/kg daily, fulvestrant (F) 50 mg/kg once a week, and eprenetapopt (Ep) 150 mg/kg, 2 times/day (***P < 0.001). (L) Growth curves of palbociclib-HT-resistant HBCx-180 PDXs (8 mice per group) treated with different combinations of palbociclib (P) 75 mg/kg daily, fulvestrant (F) 50 mg/kg once a week, and eprenetapopt (Ep) 150 mg/kg, 2 times/day. The difference between the measured tumor volumes was significant between the "vehicle" group and the eprenetapopt + fulvestrant + palbociclib (FPE) group from Day 25 until the end of the experiment (P < 0.05). Tumor evolution formula is (Vf − V0 / V0) × 100%, where V0 is the initial volume and Vf is the final volume measured at each time point.

We investigated whether cell survival is affected by ferroptosis—a type of non-apoptotic cell death linked to lipid peroxidation. GPX4 protein, the main protector against ferroptosis, was overexpressed in parental cells after PF treatment and in PF-resistant cells, even after drug wash-out, with no changes in mRNA levels (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure S5A-C). Silencing GPX4 expression reduced cell proliferation in parental and PF-resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S5D-F), indicating their reliance on GPX4. GPX4 overexpression was also observed in resistant human tumors (Figure 1F). Cells were treated with the GPX4 inhibitor RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) and the antioxidant Trolox for 6 days. CAMA1 and T47D cells were insensitive to RSL3, whereas CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells showed high sensitivity to RSL3 (Figure 1G). Trolox reversed RSL3's effect in both cell lines (Figure 1G), highlighting the role of GPX4 in PF-resistant cell proliferation. Due to unverified safety of RLS3, we used eprenetapopt (Ep), a p53 activator and GSH depletory [7] proven safe in hematological cancer patients [8]. In vitro, CAMA1 and CAMA1-PFR cells were sensitive to Ep, while T47D cells were insensitive; T47D-PFR showed higher sensitivity (Figure 1H). To investigate the effect of pharmacologically induced ferroptosis on the palbociclib-fulvestrant response in vivo, we used nude mice implanted with estrogen pellets. Due to its low pharmacokinetics in mouse plasma [9], RSL3 was administered via intratumoral injection. Mice were treated with vehicle, PF, Ep, RSL3, a combination of palbociclib-fulvestrant and eprenetapopt (PFEp), or a combination of palbociclib-fulvestrant and RSL3 (PF-RSL3). PF effectively inhibited the growth of the CAMA1 xenografts, while CAMA1-PFR tumors were insensitive (Figure 1I and J). RSL3 alone did not affect CAMA1-PFR tumor growth, whereas PF-RSL3 demonstrated a strong antitumor effect (Figure 1J), suggesting that RSL3 sensitizes CAMA1-PFR cells to PF, or vice versa. Similarly, Ep alone did not inhibit CAMA1-PFR tumor growth, but its combination with PF completely abolished tumor growth (Figure 1J). To evaluate treatment effects on proliferation and cell death, we assessed Ki67, caspase-3 and hydroxynonenal (HNE) in tumors by immunohistochemistry. Parental CAMA1 tumors treated with PF showed a significant decrease in Ki67, with no effect on caspase-3, while CAMA1-PFR tumors exhibited no significant changes in either marker after treatment with PF, PFEp, or PF-RSL3 (Supplementary Figure S6A-D). HNE labeling revealed no difference between PF- and vehicle-treated CAMA1 tumors (Supplementary Figure S6E), but HNE increased moderately in CAMA1-PFR tumors treated with RSL3 and significantly with PFEp or PF-RSL3 (Supplementary Figure S6F), indicating potential cell death by ferroptosis. No treatments affected CD36 expression in either tumor type, although CAMA1-PFR xenografts showed significantly increased basal expression compared to human biopsies (Supplementary Figure S6G-J). To strengthen the translational impact of our findings, we used patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from HR+HER2− breast cancer patients without p53 mutations (Supplementary Figure S7A) [10]. Consistent with human samples, GPX4 protein was upregulated in the palbociclib-HT-resistant PDX model (HBCx-180) compared to the palbociclib-HT-naïve PDX model (HBCx-124) (Supplementary Figure S7B). While GPX4 mRNA levels were unaffected in resistant cells, its expression was significantly higher in HBCx-180 (Supplementary Figure S7C), suggesting specific transcriptional/translational regulation differing between in vitro and in vivo contexts. In the HBCx-124 model, all the tumors (n = 5) responded well to PF, with no added benefit from Ep (PFEp), although a partial response to Ep monotherapy was observed (Figure 1K). Conversely, the HBCx-180 model showed no significant response to PF or Ep, with significant differences in tumor volumes between PFEp and vehicle and Ep groups from Day 25 onward (P < 0.05) (Figure 1L). These results confirm that adding Ep to PF in PF-resistant tumors produces a strong antitumor effect. Ki67 labeling decreased with PF in the HBCx-124 PDX but not in the HBCx-180 PDX (Supplementary Figure S8A-B). Aside from reduction in caspase-3 labeling in the HBCx-124 treated with PF, no significant changes were observed with Ep or PFEp, and none of the treatment conditions affected HBCx-180 (Supplementary Figure S8C-D), indicating that proliferation and apoptosis are not affected in HBCx-180. HNE labeling suggested that PF promoted ferroptosis in HBCx-124, while only tumors treated with PFEp in HBCx-180 exhibited significant HNE increase compared to vehicle (Supplementary Figure S8E-F). PF slightly increased HNE in HBCx-124 without significance but the only vulnerability of HBCx-180 is attributed to ferroptosis induced with PFEp. The p53-dependent antitumor effect of eprenetapopt was excluded, as p53 expression was similar in parental and PF-resistant cells and in PDXs, while slightly elevated in resistant human tumors (Supplementary Figure S9). Finally, the addition of Ep or RSL3 to PF did not induce significant renal, hepatic, or hematological toxicity in mice (Supplementary Figure S10). In conclusion, HR+HER2− tumors resistant to palbociclib-HT are vulnerable to ferroptosis inducers, highlighting the potential of collateral drug sensitivity and the promise of developing pro-ferroptosis agents for treating drug-resistant metastatic breast cancer (Supplementary Figure S11).

A protocol was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Liege (Liege, Belgium; file#2018/312) for the use of human samples in this study, and the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed. The ethical committee has authorized on May 15, 2019, to retrospectively use biopsies stored in the biobank of the University of Liège and anonymized clinical data associated with these biopsies. The committee noted that this non-interventional use has no impact on patients and is not within the scope of the law of May 7, 2004, on experiments on human beings and thus did not require informed consents. For the animal study, all procedures were performed according to the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Sciences Associations (FELASA) within the accredited GIGA animal facility (University of Liege, Liege, Belgium) (project authorization no. 2078). PDX experiments were performed at the Institute of Curie, in accordance with institutional guidelines and the rules of the French Ethics Committee (project authorization no. 02163.02).
