Chemical modification via functional dopants in carbon materials holds great promise for elevating catalytic activity and stability. To gain comprehensive insights into the pivotal mechanisms and establish structure‐performance relationships, especially concerning the roles of dopants, remains a pressing need. Herein, we employ computational simulations to unravel the catalytic function of heteroatoms in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), focusing on a physical model of high‐electronegative F and N co‐doped carbon matrix. Theoretical and experimental findings elucidate that the enhanced activity originates from the F and pyridinic‐N (Py‐N) species that achieve carbon activation. This activated carbon significantly lowers the conversion energy barrier from O* to OOH*, shifts the potential‐limiting step from OOH* formation to O* generation, and ultimately optimizes the energy barrier of the potential‐limiting step. This wok elucidates that the critical role of heteroatoms in catalyzing the reaction and unlocks the potential of carbon materials for acidic OER.

Abstract Green hydrogen production by water splitting holds great potential as a clean and renewable source of energy for sustainable energy solutions. However, the efficiency of this process is hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Overcoming these kinetic hurdles requires the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts. This study explores the effect of transition metal doping on the electrocatalytic properties of Ni(OH) 2 microflowers towards alkaline OER. Transition metal‐doped Ni(OH) 2 microflowers, with highly porous structures due to interconnected nanosheets, are synthesized by a facile, cheap, and scalable chemical bath deposition (CBD), and combined with graphene paper (GP) substrates to fabricate electrodes. Through a systematic exploration of the relationship between the transition metal dopant element type (Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) or concentration and the consequent electrochemical properties, Co‐doping demonstrates improvement in the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 (329 mV), Tafel slope (45 mV dec −1 ), and other key performance indicators of Ni(OH) 2 microflowers for OER. These results are attributed to the high number of active sites and their enhanced electrocatalytic activity benefiting from the presence of the transition metal dopant. The proposed strategy paves the way for the development of cost‐effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting technologies.

Abstract Long‐term operation of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) poses significant challenges due to the high potential and strong acidic environment associated with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to severe catalyst degradation. Here, ultrafine iridium–ruthenium nanowires (IrRu NWs) are developed through a facile process, which exhibits excellent activity and stability for acidic OER. The IrRu NWs achieve an overpotential of 243 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , which is significantly lower than that of commercial IrO 2 and pure Ir nanowires. Importantly, the IrRu NWs demonstrate 17.6% higher current density at 2 V in real PEMWE device than that of the commercial IrO 2 and Pt/C catalysts at the anode and cathode, respectively. The PEMWE device with the IrRu NWs catalyst layers can be stably operated at 1.0 and 1.5 A cm −2 for more than 500 h with a degradation rate of only 28 µV h −1 , which makes the IrRu NWs a promising catalyst toward PEMWE applications.

Abstract Thanks to their high voltage and delivered capacity, Li-rich transition metal (TM) oxide positive electrode (cathode) materials are among the most promising for next-generation lithium-ion-batteries, where Co-free Li-rich cathodes join reduced costs with competitive performance. However, their cycle-life remains limited, and the individual role of TMs is still not fully understood. The investigation of the TM chemical species’ evolution along the first charge for Li1.2Mn0.56Ni0.16Co0.08O2 and Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 has been accessed by means of operando multi edge XAS. The charge compensation mechanism has been studied and the effect induced by removing Co has been revealed. The absence of Co results in an accelerated and completed Ni oxidation along the first stage of charge and an inhibited formation of the undesired spinel phase and oxygen release at the end of the high voltage plateau. Interestingly, the oxygen release in the Co-containing material involves mainly the oxygen close to the Mn site and occurs while local structural interlayer re-arrangements are taking place.

Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising technique for the production of hydrogen and oxygen. Nevertheless, the development of low-cost, high-activity metal-based electrocatalysts that can effectively catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant challenge. Herein, we polymerized Polypyrrole (PPy) with FeCo layered double metal hydroxide grown in situ on nickel foam (NF) (FeCo-LDH/NF) by electrochemical polymerization to acquire composite material PPy@FeCo-LDH/NF. As a promising electrocatalyst with dual functionality for the HER and OER, the HER overpotential of PPy@FeCo-LDH/NF was 153 mV, and the OER overpotential was 245 mV at a current density of 10 mA·cm −2 . It was because that PPy increased the number of active adsorption sites, which in turn regulated the ion transfer rate between the electrolyte and the prepared catalyst. At the same time, after 24 h of stability testing, the HER and OER capacitance retention rates were 96.7% and 97.1%, respectively.

Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co‐corrole‐based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP‐2‐OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2 = 0.91 V vs RHE and OER with h10 = 255 mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

Abstract The complexity of the multielement interaction in high‐entropy alloys (HEAs) may provide more active sites to adapt different catalytic reaction steps in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Investigating the correlation between structure and performance of HEAs electrocatalysts is both essential and challenging. In this work, FeCoNiCrMo x HEA nanoparticles are successfully fabricated utilizing a unique nanofabrication method called inert gas condensation. With the increase of high‐valence metal component Mo, the atomic structure amorphization and electronic structure reconstruction are unveiled. According to the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence spectra, the d‐band center of FeCoNiCrMo x is ascending, and thus enhancing the adsorption energy. Synchrotron pair distribution function analysis reflects the degree of structural disorder and reveals a robust correlation with the intrinsic OER activities of the electrocatalysts. FeCoNiCrMo 1.0 high‐entropy metallic glass nanoparticles exhibit an outstanding OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 294.5 mV at a high current density of 100 mA cm −2 . This work brings fundamental and practical insights into the modulation mechanism of metal components of HEAs catalysts for developing OER.

Abstract Strategically engineering electrocatalysts with optimized interfacial electronic architectures and accelerated reaction dynamics is pivotal for augmenting hydrogen generation via alkaline water electrolysis on an industrial scale. Herein, a novel triple‐interface heterostructure Ni 3 Se 4 ‐NiSe 2 ‐Co 3 O 4 nanoarrays are designed anchored on Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene (Ni 3 Se 4 ‐NiSe 2 ‐Co 3 O 4 /MXene) with significant work function difference (ΔΦ) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. Theoretical calculations combined with experiments uncover the pivotal role of the interface‐induced electric field in steering charge redistribution, which in turn modulates the adsorption and desorption kinetics of reaction intermediates. Furthermore, the synergistic interaction between Ni 3 Se 4 ‐NiSe 2 ‐Co 3 O 4 and Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets endows the hybrids with a large electrochemical surface area, abundantly active sites, and high conductivity. Thus, Ni 3 Se 4 ‐NiSe 2 ‐Co 3 O 4 /MXene manifests exceptional catalytic prowess for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition, the Ni 3 Se 4 ‐NiSe 2 ‐Co 3 O 4 /MXene electrocatalyst in the water electrolyzer delivers excellent performance and maintains commendable stability beyond 100 h of electrocatalytic operation.

Abstract Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to effectively couple the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for developing high‐efficiency anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). Herein, a coral‐like nanoarray composed of nanosheets through the synergistic layering effect of cobalt and the 1D guiding of vanadium is synthesized, which promotes extensive contact between the active sites and electrolyte. The HER and OER activities can be enhanced by modulating the electronic structure through nitridation and phosphorization, respectively, enhancing the strength of metal‐H bond to optimize hydrogen adsorption and facilitating the proton transfer to improve the transformation of oxygen‐containing intermediates. Resultantly, the AEMWE achieves a current density of 500 mA cm –2 at 1.76 V for 1000 h in 1.0 M KOH at 70 °C. The energy consumption is 4.21 kWh Nm –3 with the producing hydrogen cost of $0.93 per kg H 2 . Operando synchrotron radiation and Bode phase angle analyses reveal that during the high‐energy consumed OER, the dissolution of vanadium species transforms distorted Co−O octahedral into regular octahedral structures, accompanied by a shortening of the Co−Co bond length. This structural evolution facilitates the formation of oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolysers promise to usher in a new era of clean energy, but they remain a formidable obstacle in designing active and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, a protonated iridium oxide embedded with single‐atom dispersed ruthenium atoms (H 3.8 Ir 1− x Ru x O 4 ) that demonstrates exceptional activity and stability in acidic water oxidation is introduced. The single Ru dopants favorably induce localized oxygen vacancies in the Ir─O lattice, synergistically strengthening the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. In addition, the preferential oxidation of Ru and the electronegativity of the oxygen vacancies significantly stabilize the Ir─O active sites, improving the OER stability. Consequently, the H 3.8 Ir 1─ x Ru x O 4 catalyst shows an overpotential of 255 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and displays exceptional catalytic endurance in acidic electrolytes, surpassing 1100 h, representing a remarkable one‐order‐of‐magnitude increase in stability compared to that of pristine H 3.8 IrO 4 . A proton exchange membrane electrolyser utilizing the H 3.8 Ir 1− x Ru x O 4 catalyst as an anode exhibits stable performance for more than 1280 h under a high current density of 2 A cm −2 .

Although the Fe spin state is found to be closely associated with enhanced bifunctional activity, controllably regulating the Fe spin state remains a challenge. Here, the controllable regulation of Fe spin state is directly achieved through competitive coordination between chlorine and pyridine nitrogen in the axial direction of Fe─N 4 . The spin state of Fe is regulated from high spin to intermediate spin by the modulation of axial ligands from weak‐field ligand chlorine to strong‐field ligand pyridinic nitrogen, which leads to the enhanced bifunctional activity of N─FeN 4 with a small potential gap (Δ E = 0.68 V). Theoretical calculations indicate that the spin state turning is accompanied by an enhanced binding strength between Fe sites and *OH leading to a significant decrease in the OER barrier. Moreover, N─FeN 4 exhibits sufficient durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (over 50 h), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (over 200 h), and the assembled zinc–air battery (over 1000 h). Here a novel approach is proposed for designing efficient catalysts based on spin state and profound insights into Fe─N─C spin state for bifunctional oxygen catalysis.

Abstract Metal nitrides with extraordinary electrochemical characteristics established widespread applications in energy devices. Inspired by the recent research on promising heterostructured catalysts, the preparation of a nitride‐based heterostructure via a facile approach involving a one‐step nitridation process is revisited. An innovative Ni/Ni 3 N is decorated on nitrogen‐doped carbon (NC) and evaluated for its dual‐functionality as a catalyst in the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (EHER) and the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (EOER). In contrast to Ni@NC and pristine NC, Ni/Ni 3 N@NC with the well‐constructed NC significantly enhanced its catalytic performance toward EHER and EOER in a water electrolyzer. The water electrolyzer consists of Ni/Ni 3 N@NC as both the anode and cathode achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 with a remarkably low voltage of 1.52 V. The designed catalyst takes full advantage of its heterostructure and ambipolar behavior leading to the presence of active sites for EOER and EHER, as confirmed by in‐situ Raman analysis. These results provide important guidance on designing an efficient and cost‐effective heterostructured dual‐functional catalyst as well as revealing the mechanism at the interface between the surface of an ambipolar catalyst and electrolyte.

Abstract We used Lycium ruthenicum stem-extract mediated green synthesis to prepare a composite of manganese oxide (MnO2) and Mn3(PO4)2 decorated nanowires (MnO2/Mn3(PO4)2). This hybrid material functions as an efficient and long-lasting electrocatalyst for water-splitting reactions, which could significantly improve the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER activity of MnO2/Mn3(PO4)2-based nanowires is boosted by blending with a conducting support, such as manganese oxide (MnO2). The X-ray diffraction pattern and Fourier transform infrared data indicate that the nanowires are highly crystalline. The MnO2/Mn3(PO4)2 composite material demonstrates superior stability compared to its individual constituents and generates a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 244 mV for OER in alkaline media. This research may lead to the development of MnO2/Mn3(PO4)2 composite materials as electrocatalysts for overall water-splitting reactions.&#xD;

INTRODUCTION While the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) has the advantage of low cost and mass production, it has the issue of catalyst coated electrode degradation caused mainly by catalyst layer detachment due to reverse currents generated by the start and stop of variable renewable electricity. A previous study reported that heat treatment of a NiCo 2 O 4 spinel catalyst-supported electrode (NiCo) on a Ni substrate suppress delamination of the catalyst layer with decrease in initial activity due to increase of electrode resistance. [1] In this study, in order to find optimize preparation for both initial activity and durability of the anode electrode catalyst, we compared and evaluated the degradation behavior of NiCo electrodes prepared various conditions. EXPERIMENTAL The accelerated durability test (ADT) was performed in a three-electrode cell with 7 M KOH aqueous solution as electrolyte at 25℃. RHE, Ni coil and 1 cm 2 electrode of NiCo spinel catalyst supported on Ni mesh substrate prepared with 8 to 24 of layered thermal decomposition coating at various temperature are used as reference, counter and working electrodes, respectively. Here, the thickness of the coting was determined by Co loading measured with XRF. Constant current electrolysis at 1 A cm -2 for 2 hours was conducted as pretreatment at 80℃ before ADT. The ADT protocol consisted of three steps [2] (Fig.1): (1) constant current electrolysis at 600 mA cm -2 for 1 min, (2) potential scanning from open-circuit potential (OCP) to anodic potential E min (= 0.5 V vs. RHE) at sweep rate of -500 mV s -1 , and (3) holding at constant potential of E min for 1 min. To evaluate the anode activity, CV (potential range: 0.5 to 2.0 V vs. RHE, sweep rate: 5 and 50 mV s -1, 3 cycles) and AC impedance measurements (bias potential: 1.6, 1.7 V vs. RHE, frequency range: 10 6 -10 -1 Hz, amplitude: 10 mV) were performed at every 200 ADT cycles in 2,000 cycles of ADT. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION As shown in Fig. 2 of the anode potential as a function of the ADT cycle, the potential of the 350°C prepared anode significantly increased around 800 cycles toward around 1.9 V vs. RHE, while the 450°C prepared anode showed slowly and constantly increase in potential. As shown in Fig. 3 of the redox peaks in cyclic voltammograms, the NiCo redox peaks around 1.2 V vs. RHE disappeared and the Ni redox peaks around 1.2 V vs. RHE appeared at the end of the ADT,. The NiCo redox peak of the 350°C prepared anode was significantly larger than the Ni redox peak in the initial period, whereas the Ni redox peaks became larger than the NiCo redox peak around 700 cycles. The charge of NiCo redox peak of the 450°C prepared anode gradually decreased and that of the Ni oxidation peak increased and they reversed for 8, 16, and 24 layered anodes at 1000, 1400, and 1600 cycles, respectively, but NiCo redox peak still remained. These results means that the consumption of the NiCo oxide electrocatalyst occurs during the ADT and the 450°C preparation suppress rapidly detachment of the 450°C prepared anode around 700 cycles. As shown in Fig. 4 of the polarization curves, the OER activity of the 8 layered at the 450°C prepared was almost same as that of the 350°C prepared anode at 200 cycles, and the 16 and 24 layered at 450°C prepared were higher activity than the 350°C prepared and the 8 layered at 450°C prepared. The Tafel slopes of the initial ADT (200 cycles) were almost the same for the 350°C and 450°C. The slope for the 450°C prepared anodes after 2000 cycles were almost same as the initial regardless of the number of applications, but the slope for the 350°C prepared increased. This result also suggests NiCo oxide of the 450°C prepared still remained at the end of the ADT and it dominates oxygen evolution reaction, while the 350°C prepared electrocatalyst completely consumed during the ADT.

A hydrogen-based energy economy is a viable candidate to provide clean power and alleviate carbon emissions produced by hydrocarbon-based fuels. Hydrogen produced by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) provides a path to clean affordable energy; however, PEMWE costs are still too high for wide-scale market adoption. Electrochemical splitting of water is energetically hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) which has sluggish kinetics, and the benchmark OER catalyst iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) has high costs and very limited global supply. Ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) provides a higher activity and lower cost compared to IrO 2 ; however, under the high potential and highly acidic environment required for OER, RuO 2 shows lower stability compared to IrO 2 . Our prior study demonstrated that Ti-substitution within RuO 2 improved electrochemical stability, but also resulted in lower activity. 1 Here, we expand our study by exploring the effects of phase, composition, surface structure, electrolyte, and operating voltage on the activity and electrochemical stability of Ru-based OER catalysts to identify key contributing factors towards improving the electrochemical stability. Catalysts materials were synthesized using wet-chemistry or high energy ball milling, and commercial materials were used for comparison and baselining. Structure was determined using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, porosimetry measurements, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We evaluate electrochemical OER activity and stability using rotating disk electrode electrochemistry, coupled with inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry for analysis of dissolved metals within the electrolyte. We develop structure-activity-electrochemical stability correlations to determine driving factors influencing degradation and provide a pathway to the development of materials with improved catalyst performance and lower cost.

To achieve a carbon-neutral future, sustainable energy is needed through storing energy through its chemical bond. Water electrolysis, an exemplary form of electrocatalysis, presents an example of storing energy within chemical bonds of the high-energy hydrogen gas. Nevertheless, the anodic reaction involved in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses limitations on the overall rate of the process. Plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been added to enhance the charge transfer at the interface of the OER electrocatalysts and electrolyte under light illumination. 1-3 However, the mechanistic understanding of how the Au NPs on the photo-assisted electrochemical process is still lacking. We applied a model system of plasmonic Au electrode with nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co)-based OER electrocatalyst to investigate the plasmon-mediated OER process. The composite system has been characterized with XPS, AFM, (photo)electrochemical and spectroscopic characterizations. Our preliminary data shows that the electrodeposited plasmonic Au electrode is free of surfactant and the resonant light illumination could modulate the electrochemical properties of the Au electrode and the Ni- and Co-based electrocatalysts in the alkaline electrolytes.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an electrochemical half-reaction critical to electrolyzer and metal-air battery technologies. It is well established that Ni (oxy)hydroxides are state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the OER in basic media when Fe impurities are present in these systems. Morphological studies have shown that these catalysts are prone to dramatic nanoscale reconstruction under electrochemical conditions, implying dissolution, migration and redeposition processes of the catalyst’s components. Processes involving the displacement of Fe are especially important to understand, as these impurities, while essential for high activity at the anode, are often associated with cathode fouling. Describing the parameters that govern Fe leaching is thus of interest for the design of materials aimed toward the maintenance of device performance and longevity. To study how the degree of restructuring relates to Fe dissolution and redeposition, we have prepared a series of electrolyte accessible Ni(z)Co(1-z)O(x)H(y) (z = 0, 0.2, 0.4, ...) thin film catalysts, whereby increased amounts of Co limit the material’s dynamic behavior. By introducing tertiary cations with trackable redox features, we map a parameter space of catalyst composition more or less capable of retaining surface active phases. Parallels with Ni-Co + Fe catalysts are then carried out in Fe-free electrolyte to disrupt absorption-desorption equilibria and connect host-structure dynamics to equilibrium concentrations of electrolyte impurities.

Most active electrocatalysts include platinum-group metals (PGMs) and their alloys for electrochemical water splitting, but they are strongly limited by material cost and scarcity. [1] On the other hand, transition metal nitrides overcome this bottleneck and show high electrical conductivity, making them catalytically active for water electrolysis. The high conductivity is based on the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the unit cell of metal, leading to their d-band contraction with electron density enhancement below Fermi level. [2] For instance, metallic nickel nitride (Ni 3 N) has been widely reported as a promising electrocatalyst material to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by in-situ forming a nickel (oxy)hydroxide [Ni(OH) 2 and NiOOH] layer. [3] The Ni 3 N materials can be prepared by single step soft-urea route to obtain pure crystal phase [4] or a composite with carbon [5], which rises the following two research questions: 1. What are the optimal synthesis parameters of the soft-urea route to control the structure of Ni 3 N? 2. What is the relationship between structure and OER activity for Ni 3 N materials? In this work, we used the soft-urea route to prepare Ni 3 N materials by varying the ratios of NiCl 2 , urea and ethanol as precursor chemicals. The precursors were made into a gel by magnetic stirring having metal:urea ratio of 1:5, and then heated up to 400 ºC in a tubular furnace with constant flow of argon. The as-prepared Ni 3 N were then characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental analysis (CHN), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Based on the quantitative Rietveld refinement, the formation of pristine Ni 3 N materials is strongly controlled by the annealing temperature. In addition to the Ni 3 N phase, we observed the formation of the fcc Ni phase (0 – 10 wt.%) as a minor phase. The TEM images show individual particles of below 100 nm in size. Rotating disc electrode (RDE) technique was employed to establish the electrochemical OER activity of Ni 3 N materials by sweeping the potential from 1.3 to 1.8 V RHE at 10 mV s -1 in Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH. Polycrystalline Ni and Ni particles are taken as reference materials. We observed an improvement of the OER activity as the overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 (normalized by the geometric surface area) reduced from 379 mV (poly-Ni) to 358 mV (Ni 3 N). Furthermore, in-situ XAS studies were performed to better understand the nature of the redox reactions between Ni species and the in-situ formation of nickel (oxy)hydroxide [Ni(OH) 2 and NiOOH] layers before and during the OER as a function of the applied potential. Based on the in-situ XANES data, we correlated the structure of Ni 3 N/fcc-Ni/carbon composite with observed OER activity under alkaline conditions. To summarize, we were able to prepare a composite of Ni 3 N/fcc-Ni/carbon material with improved OER activity via soft-urea route. The in-situ formation of the layered nickel (oxy)hydroxide [Ni(OH) 2 and NiOOH] layers as the catalytically active OER species were probed by in-situ XANES data. References: [1] M.

Rechargeable zinc-air batteries are considered as a promising candidate for next-generation electrochemical energy conversion devices due to their safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity/ energy density. Over the past few decades, α-MnO 2 -based electrodes have demonstrated their excellent performance and competitiveness in oxygen catalytic reactions. (1) According to e g filling theory, Mn(III) (t2g3eg1) sites in [MnO6] octahedral unit deliver superior bifunctional activity compared to Mn(II) (t2g3eg2) and Mn(IV) (t2g3eg0) sites.(2) However, the presence of unpaired single electrons of the Mn(III) site leads to low thermodynamic stability. Introducing oxygen vacancies to promote the electron rearrangement of the [MnO6] unit is a promising approach for enhancing the durability of Mn(III) active sites. Herein, we construct an oxygen-vacancy-enhanced MnO 2 -based electrode via a self-assembly process (NiCo 2 O 4 -MnO 2 @Ni foam). The intrinsic oxygen catalytic activity of NiCo 2 O 4 -MnO 2 @Ni foam is significantly improved by forming abundant highly stable Mn(III) active sites, which accelerate the mass transfer ability. As expected, the NiCo 2 O 4 -MnO 2 @Ni foam shows good bifunctional activity with a low overpotential of 0.69 V. The zinc-air battery assembled by NiCo 2 O 4 -MnO 2 @Ni foam exhibits a high peak power density of 576 mW cm -2 , surpassing that of the Pt/C-Ir/C electrode. Additionally, benefiting from its stable flower-shaped hierarchical structure, the self-assembled electrode demonstrates long-term charge-discharge cycling stability, which lasts over 800 hours. This work provides innovative insights into enhancing MnO 2 -based electrodes by oxygen vacancy introduction. References N. Xu, Q. Nie, L. Luo, C. Z. Yao, Q. Gong, Y. Liu, X. Zhou, and J.

Hydrogen is considered the future fuel and promising alternative towards carbon neutrality. In this context, water electrolysis using renewable electricity is an environmentally benign approach for clean hydrogen production. In water electrolysis, among the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), OER is the rate-limiting due to slow kinetics, high overpotential, and complex pathways. To catalyze the OER, choice of non-precious electrocatalysts is preferred over the precious platinum group metal (PGM)-based catalysts owing to their relatively higher abundance and cost-effectiveness. The feasibility of using non-precious electrocatalysts in alkaline water electrolysis is also favorable for the low-capital cost compared to the acidic one. In lab scale research, the preliminary evaluation of OER electrocatalysts is usually performed using thin-film rotating disk electrodes (TF-RDEs) in a three-electrode system. In this process, the very first step involves multiple cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles for better wettability of the catalyst layer to the electrolyte, which is considered as electrochemical activation (EA). Incomplete activation of the catalyst layer would lead to inconsistent OER performance of the electrocatalysts. This is much more pronounced in non-precious electrocatalysts compared to the precious ones in alkaline media. Despite that the importance of EA is overlooked most of the time and rarely studied. In this work, the critical role of EA is systematically investigated for Ni-containing bimetallic tungstate in alkaline OER and also compared with that of monometallic counterparts. This study demonstrates more than 1.2-fold performance improvement in OER for bimetallic tungstate. The corresponding insights on the interfacial structure and oxidative surface reconstruction are also noted by using in-situ electrochemical analysis and ex-situ characterizations. The present study is believed to be beneficial for the precise analysis and development of non-precious alkaline OER electrocatalysts.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a major source of inefficiency in the production of green hydrogen via electrocatalytic water splitting. At high overpotentials relevant to industrial rates of gas production, bubbles can contribute substantially to these inefficiencies by inhibiting the mass transport of electrolyte and partially obstructing the electrochemically active surface area (A ecsa ) of an electrode. 1 Arrays of microscale features have been shown to improve the efficiency of gas evolving reactions, including the OER. The performance of electrodes modified with linear ridge-like surface features has been previously observed to increase with the spacing between the ridges with a separation of up to 200 µm, but it was not known whether this trend continues indefinitely. 2 The present study utilizes rapid prototyping techniques, including microscope projection photolithography and electrodeposition, to determine whether an optimal ridge separation exists between 200 and 450 µm. At a relatively high overpotential of 1.8 V (vs Hg/HgO) in an alkaline electrolyte, the performance of these ridges was observed to increase up to a critical separation, after which the performance decreased to a level comparable to a planar electrode at a wider separation between the ridges. Chronoamperometry measurements indicated that ridges with this optimal spacing attained a current response nearly 3× that of a planar electrode when normalized to (A ecsa ). A better understanding of the reasons for this observed trend was pursued using high speed imaging. Direct observations of bubble production on the surfaces of the electrodes provided a deeper understanding of how the distribution of gas bubbles on an electrode affects performance.

The transition to renewable energy sources is crucial for combating climate change, and hydrogen (H 2 ) is a promising clean fuel. Electrolysis of water, specifically the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a key process for producing H 2 . Prior experimental results have shown that gold (Au) could improve the apparent activities of the OER electrocatalysts such as nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH) 2 ) in alkaline electrolytes. 1-3 However, the detailed interfacial atomic structure and mechanisms of the increased catalytic activity remain poorly understood. To understand the interfacial effect between Au and Ni(OH) 2 in the OER process, our research uses the model system of Au nanoparticles (NPs) and nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), which is the active phase of Ni(OH) 2 layers in the OER, to investigate their interfacial interactions with both experimental and computational approaches. We hypothesize that the Au NPs on NiOOH enhances the OER activity by promoting electron transfer at the interface. Our studies involve computational analysis using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the local density of states (LDOS), which can help us better visualize and compare the local electronic structure of NiOOH in the presence and in the absence of AuNPs. Two architectures of the Au and NiOOH interface will be investigated: Au NPs on a NiOOH film and NiOOH NPs on a Au film.Additionally, Bader analysis is employed to determine the Bader charge, offering a more detailed understanding of how electrons are distributed across the AuNPs/NiOOH interface. Furthermore, the catalytic efficacy of AuNPs on NiOOH is assessed through electrodepositions followed by cyclic voltammetry(CV) measurements. The experimental and computational results will be directly compared, and this research is expected to contribute to the insights of substrate and catalyst interactions for design of more efficient electrocatalysts.

The production of green hydrogen through water electrolysis using electricity generated from renewable sources is one of the most promising strategies toward achieving a carbon-neutral economy.[1-3] Water electrolysis is an effective and well-established water splitting process consisting of two half-cell reactions, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at cathode and anode, respectively. Although hydrogen as the value-added product is generated at the cathode, the anodic reaction plays an important role in determining the reaction kinetics of the entire water splitting process due to the multiple-electron transfer.[4] Therefore, developing low-cost and highly active OER electrocatalysts is one of the keys to further improve overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) has been commercialized for many decades and standing for medium-scale hydrogen production and using non-noble metals as electrocatalysts.[5] Co-, Ni-, and Fe- oxides or (oxy)hydroxides are reported as auspicious OER electrocatalysts for AWE, as well as abundance on earth.[6] In addition, oxygen vacancies in metallic oxides are reported recently as an effective approach to enhance catalyst activity for OER.[7] Herein, we present trimetallic oxides (CoNiFe oxides) annealed in different atmospheres which are oxygen-rich (A; air), an oxygen-poor (M; 1 vol% air in argon), and oxygen-free (H; 5 vol% H 2 in argon), respectively, The CoNiFe (2:2:1)/M with a molar ratio of Co : Ni : Fe = 2 : 2 : 1 treated under an oxygen-poor atmosphere (M) exhibits the best performance in 1 M KOH, with an overpotential of 291 mV at 10 mA cm -2 geo , a mass activity at 1.56 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) of ~345 A g -1 catalyst , and a small Tafel slope of 32.0 mV dec -1 . Moreover, CoNiFe (2:2:1)/M shows excellent stability in the OER process for at least 50 hours at 100 mA cm -2 geo at lab scale and ~75 h at 400 mA cm -2 in an alkaline electrolyzer. This work presents a simple and effective method to design OER catalysts based on trimetallic oxides with oxygen deficiencies for alkaline water electrolysis. References: [1] T. Yusaf, M. Laimon, W.

When hydrogen is depleted in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell, the anode potential increases (cell reversal), which involves the oxidation of supported carbon (COR) and causes the growth of Pt particles, resulting in the deactivation of the anode catalyst. The addition of the oxygen evolution (OER) catalysts has been reported to suppress the degradation 1 . Though it has also been reported that the combination of Ti 4 O 7 with Ir catalysts increased the reversal tolerance 2 , the combination of Pt/Ti 4 O 7 and Ti 4 O 7 -supported OER catalysts has not been reported. We have reported that Pt catalysts supported on Ti 4 O 7 -C synthesized by the carbothermal process showed excellent performance 3 . In order to investigate how the distribution of the OER catalyst in the catalyst layer affects the reversal-tolerance, we compared the performance of the physical mixture of Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C and Ti 4 O 7 -supported OER catalysts with the composite catalysts (Pt and OER catalyst supported on Ti 4 O 7 -C) in this study. The hydrogen starvation was carried out during the hydrogen pump tests in order to clarify the degradation on HOR. Experimental Preparation of catalysts: 20 wt% Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C (11 wt% C) was prepared as previously reported 3 . RuO 2 catalysts Ti 4 O 7 -C or Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C was impregnated with RuCl 3 solution, and precipitated at pH 8 with NaOH solution. The residue was washed, and dried at 150°C. 21 wt% RuO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C and 19 wt% Pt-2.0 wt% RuO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C were used for the physical mixture (abbreviated to catalyst-M) and for the composite catalyst, respectively. IrO 2 catalysts Ti 4 O 7 -C or Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C was impregnated in IrCl 3 solution, and hydrothermally treated at 180°C. Afterwards, the solution was washed and dried at 80°C. 3.8 wt% IrO 2 and 8 wt% Pt-3.7 wt% IrO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C were used for the physical mixture and the composite catalyst, respectively. Electrochemical measurement: The MEA was composed of Nafion NRE211 as the electrolyte membrane, a commercial heat-treated c-Pt/C (Pt loading: 0.5 mg-Pt/cm 2 ) as the cathode, and the above-mentioned catalyst or a commercially available c-Pt/C (Pt loading: 0.2 mg-Pt/cm 2 ) as the anode. The RuO 2 and IrO 2 loadings were 0.021- 0.042 mg/cm 2 and are indicated in parentheses. The performance was evaluated with IV curves, the hydrogen pump, CV and LSV by flowing H 2 gas to the cathode under 80°C fully humidified condition. The hydrogen starvation was performed by switching the anode supply gas to N 2 (RH 100%) while the hydrogen pump was carried out at 0.2 A/cm 2 for 10 minutes at a cutoff voltage of 2.7 V. After the test, a hydrogen pump, CV, LSV, and an IV test were performed. The second hydrogen starvation test was repeated in the same manner. Results and Discussion As shown in Table 1, the voltage of c-Pt/C quickly increased above 1.7 V, however, a plateau was observed at 1.8 V after the rapid voltage increase during the second hydrogen starvation, which indicated COR. After the second hydrogen starvation, the current at 0.4 V for the LSV increased from 7.1 mA/cm 2 before the second test to 47.9 mA/cm 2 , indicating the damage of the membrane. The HOR activity also deteriorated after the hydrogen starvation. No improvement was observed for Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C and Pt/Ti 4 O 7 -C+RuO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -M (0.025) under this condition, however, the voltage rise to 1.7 V on the RuO 2 composite catalyst was suppressed for the first starvation, due to the OER. This effect disappeared for the second hydrogen starvation. On the other hand, the catalyst physically mixed with IrO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 -C showed a voltage plateau from 1.50 to 1.75 V during the hydrogen starvation, indicating a significant improvement, and the increase in the IrO 2 loading improved the reversal-tolerance. Furthermore, for the IrO 2 composite catalyst, a plateau due to the OER was observed at 1.5 - 1.7 V for the two hydrogen starvation tests. The voltage increase of the hydrogen pump after the tests was also slight and the change in ECSA was small. Since the difference from the physical mixture was clearly observed, it was deduced that the OER catalyst in the vicinity of the Pt catalyst improved the reversal-tolerance.

NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and (oxy)hydroxides are among the most active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. 1 However, they still show considerable overpotentials for the OER, i.e. 350 mV at 10 mA cm -2 in pH 13. 1, 2 Understanding the nature of the catalytic active sites and the catalytic mechanism in NiFe LDHs are key challenges to develop better OER electrocatalysts. In this contribution, atomic-scale details of the catalytic active phase will be presented, showing that NiFe LDHs are oxidized under applied anodic potentials from as-prepared α-phase to activated γ-phase. 2 The OER active γ-phase was characterized by operando wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) in alkaline electrolytes. 2 The intrinsic activity was then obtained by an electrochemical impedance method through electrochemical surface area (ECSA) normalization. 3 Comparison with other Ni- and Co- based LDHs revealed that NiFe LDH shows the highest intrinsic activity. 4 Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a γ-phase atomic model showed that O-bridged Ni-Fe reaction centers (Ni-O-Fe) stabilize OER intermediates that are unfavourable on Ni-O-Ni centers and single Fe sites, fundamentally accounting for the high catalytic activity. Furthermore, our DFT calculations predicts that γ-NiFe LDH is close to, but not on, the top of the OER volcano. 2,4 Strategies to modify the catalytic active site to approach the top of the volcano will be presented, together with preliminary experimental results. These strategies will involve the design of active sites involving subsurface metal sites and electronic modulation of the Ni-O-Fe sites by introduction of a third transition metal element.

To alleviate the severe energy crisis and environmental problems caused by the massive and unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels, it is urgent to develop renewable energy conversion and energy storage technologies to reform the traditional energy structure. Batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy storage technologies due to their sustainability, high efficiency and less pollution. Among various battery storage devices, rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have attracted widespread attention on account of their high theoretical energy density (1086 Wh kg – 1 ), low cost, abundant zinc resources, low operating temperature, and good stability and safety in aqueous environments. However, the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurred on the air electrode during the discharging and charging processes are extremely sluggish, leading to low energy efficiency, which significantly limits the large-scale application of rechargeable ZABs. Pt-based electrocatalysts exhibit high ORR activities, while Ru- and Ir-based oxides are excellent OER electrocatalysts, but natural scarcity, high cost and poor durability seriously reduce the marketability and commercial competitiveness of rechargeable ZABs. Therefore, the development of robust, cost-effective and high-efficiency non-noble metal bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts is of crucial significance for the practical application of rechargeable ZABs. As a promising alternative, earth-abundant transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.)-based materials have been extensively studied due to their relatively high electrocatalytic activity and durability. Thereinto, transition metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon (M-NC), especially Fe-NC, has been demonstrated to be the most effective ORR catalyst, and the active sites are generally considered as atomically dispersed metal coordinated to N atoms (M-N x sites, x indicates the number of N atoms coordinating the metal). Nevertheless, M-NC catalysts only possess good ORR activity with poor OER performance. Bimetallic FeNi nanocomposites (metals, oxides, carbides, sulfides) are promising for OER. At high potentials, highly active FeNi oxyhydroxide species are generated on the surface of the FeNi-based electrocatalysts. Since ORR and OER depend on different catalytic active sites, an ideal bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts should integrate M-NC complex with high ORR activity and bimetallic FeNi nanocomposite with a high OER activity to achieve bifunctionality. However, due to the intense competition between transition-metal single atoms and nanocomposites in the preparation process, it is challenging to combine them properly for superior bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic activity. Herein, we report a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst consisting of ZIF-derived carbon-anchored Fe/Ni single atoms and FeNi alloy nanoparticles; meanwhile, graphene is also introduced as carbon support to improve the uniformity of active sites (denoted as Fe/Ni-NC||FeNi@G). Benefiting from this unique composition and structure, Fe/Ni-NC||FeNi@G electrocatalyst displays excellent bifunctional ORR/OER activity and durability in rechargeable ZABs. This work provides an effective approach to designing highly efficient non-noble metal multifunctional catalysts for practical applications in rechargeable metal-air batteries.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a promising next-generation technology for producing green hydrogen coupling with cost-effective, platinum group metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts. In AEMWE, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode plays a more vital role compared with the cathodic reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). While tremendous attention has been devoted to enhancing the activity of OER catalysts, the long-term stability and cost of OER catalysts, which may play an even more important role in large-scale electrolysis industrialization, have been much less emphasized. Herein, we designed electrodes toward OER from cheap and abundant stainless-steel (SS) foam via a green approach, and the obtained electrode shows excellent activity and stability under an alkaline medium. This work can address all three bottlenecks of activity, stability, and cost, thereby revolutionizing the electrode design for AEMWE.

Alternative energy sources to fossil fuels are essential for a sustainable society, and hydrogen energy is expected to be a solution to environmental and energy problems. Currently, proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers are becoming widely used for the electrochemical production of hydrogen due to their advantages such as high efficiency. However, the highly acidic conditions and the large overpotentials of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode are problems, and the development of catalysts that are stable and highly active in acidic aqueous solutions is important for further popularization. Ir-based oxides with pyrochlore structure (A 2 B 2 O 7 ) are known to exhibit high catalytic activities in acidic aqueous solutions. Recently, it has been reported that the improved catalytic activities of Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 by Zn doping, which controlled the composition of A-site elements in the pyrochlore structure [1]. In this study, we synthesized Pr 2- x Mg x Ir 2 O 7 ( x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5), in which a part of trivalent cation Pr 3+ was replaced by divalent cation Mg 2+ and improved the OER catalytic activity in acidic aqueous solutions. Pr 2- x Mg x Ir 2 O 7 was synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The catalyst was mixed with a conductivity aid carbon (Vulcan XC-72) and a cationic conductive ionomer (Nafion) at a weight ratio of 5:1:1 and dispersed in 2-propanol to form a catalyst ink. The catalytic activity was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) as a working electrode, a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as a reference electrode, and a platinum wire as a counter electrode. The electrolyte was a 0.1 mol dm -3 HClO 4 solution saturated with oxygen, and the CV scanning range was 1.1 to 1.7 V with respect to the RHE, scanning speed was 20 mV s -1 , and the RDE rotation speed was 1200 rpm. The stability of the catalyst in acidic aqueous solutions was evaluated by chronopotentiometry (CP) using the same cell. X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis measurements of the synthesized materials confirmed that the desired compounds were obtained, and CV measurements showed that the OER activity of Pr 2- x Mg x Ir 2 O 7 increased in the first 20 cycles for all compositions, and then stabilized over several tens of cycles. The cycle change was similar to that of Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 , suggesting that the surface rearrangement proceeds in acidic aqueous solutions [2]. Linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) and OER activity normalized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area were measured at the 20th cycle, and the catalytic activity stabilized at a high value. The OER activity was enhanced by Mg substitution in the catalysts of Pr 2- x Mg x Ir 2 O 7 . References L. Zhu, C. Ma, Z. Wang, X. Gong, L. Cao, and J. Yang, Appl. Surf. Sci. , 31 , 151840 (2022). C.

The grand challenge in oxygen electrocatalysis lies in overcoming scaling relations. The theoretical activity volcano positions the ideal catalyst at the apex. However, the OH–OOH scaling relation determines a linear path on the volcano surface that limits the activity. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in modeling confirms this scaling relation, at the same time it hinders the experimental development of novel oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, impeding progress in sustainable energy solutions. To address this challenge, we propose to use the geometry effect and introduce the concept of Geometry Adaptive Catalysts (GACs).[1] The geometry effect, based on preliminary research, involves changing catalytic activity by adjusting the adsorption energy of intermediates through the control of catalyst geometry. Our goal is to break through the SOTA frontier for ORR by synthesizing GACs and supporting our efforts with theoretical and computational modeling of the geometric effect. In this work we aimed to utilize the geometry effect by synthesizing GACs with various controlled structures, including specific intersite distances, and variable curvature. This enables precise control of catalyst geometry, allowing manipulation of catalytic activity and overcoming scaling relations. Key geometric parameters, namely inter-site distance, curvature, and specific stabilizations of ORR intermediates, are explored to test our hypothesis: Controlling catalyst geometry adjusts the ORR mechanism and adsorption energies of intermediates, enabling the switching, pushing, and even bypassing of scaling relations. This approach holds promise for substantial improvements in environmental sustainability and human life quality, with broad applicability to various electrocatalytic reactions beyond ORR.

Low temperature proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) represents a critical technology for green hydrogen production. It offers the advantages of significantly higher current density and higher H 2 purity, rendering it a preferred technology when high energy efficiency and low footprint are essential. Working in the oxidative and acidic environment under high polarization voltage, however, adds substantial demand to the electrode catalyst and the support. This is particularly the case at anode where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place. At present, the platinum group metal (PGM) materials such as Ir black or Ir oxide are catalysts of choice. Their high cost and limited reserve add a significant cost barrier to PEM electrolyzer, which contributes to the overall expense of hydrogen production next only to the cost of electricity. Replacing Ir with earth-abundant transition metal oxides could help to reduce the electrolyzer system cost. For PEMWE application, a PGM-free anodic catalyst must be highly active to match the performance of Ir. Furthermore, it must be stable against oxidative acid corrosion. At Argonne National Laboratory, we recently developed a new PGM-free OER of a nanofibrous cobalt spinel catalyst co-doped with lanthanum and manganese (LMCF). [1] The catalyst was synthesized from the precursor of cobalt zeolitic methyl-imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF) doped with manganese and lanthanum. The Co-ZIF was mixed with a polymer solution and electrospun into nanofiber before being converted to fibrous cobalt spinel under low temperature oxidation to remove all the organics and carbon. The new PGM-free catalyst demonstrated a low overpotential of 353 mV (RHE) at 10 mA/cm 2 and a low OER degradation over 360 hours in acidic electrolyte. A PEMWE containing this catalyst at its anode at ~2.0 mg/cm 2 demonstrated a current density of 2000 mA/cm 2 at 2.47 volts (Nafion® 115 membrane) or 4000 mA/cm 2 at 3.00 volt (Nafion® 212 membrane). The membrane electrode was also subjected to accelerated-stress-test (AST) in both voltage cycling and galvanostatic run at different current densities. Low degradation rates under both ASTs were observed. In addition to catalyst design and synthesis, we also conducted extensive structural characterizations, stability measurement, as well as computational modeling. Our in situ study found that the OER process involves significant lattice oxygen movement, leading to lowering instead of raising the cobalt oxidation state during the electrolysis. The measurement of the stability number, combined with computational Pourbaix diagram, elucidated the importance of the operating potential in reducing catalyst dissolution. These findings offer in-depth understanding and direction of future development for PGM-free OER catalyst in PEM water electrolyzer.

Sodium-oxygen (Na-O 2 ) batteries offer a promising path for the advancement of high-energy-density inexpensive storage systems to replace current state of the art Li-based batteries owing to the natural abundance and low-cost Na metal. Despite numerous studies to improve the performance of liquid-based electrolyte Na-O 2 batteries, this technology suffers from poor cycle life, electrolyte stability issues, and limited choice of cell design as well as growing safety concerns associated with liquid electrolytes. Recently, solid electrolytes received a great attention to substitute traditional liquid electrolytes used in Na-O 2 batteries, due to their ability of improving safety and energy density. However, low ionic conductivity and high impedance in contact with the anode and cathode remain as major challenges for the development suitable solid-state electrolyte for Na-O 2 batteries. In addressing these challenges, we recently have established a solid-state Na-O 2 battery cell that comprises a highly conductive composite polymer-ceramic solid electrolyte with a conductivity of 0.7 mS/cm. This solid electrolyte works in synergy with vanadium phosphide (VP) nanoparticles, serving as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts at the cathode and Na metal anode for more than 500 reversible charge-discharge cycles at a capacity of 1000 mAh/g, achieving a low polarization gap of approximately 20 mV in the first cycle. Various electrochemical and physicochemical characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were employed to gain insight into the cell chemistry and solid-state electrolyte role in the formation and decomposition of sodium oxides components such as superoxide (NaO 2 ), peroxide (Na 2 O 2 ). The findings of this study underscore the significance of proper cell component design and possible mechanisms in solid-state Na-O 2 battery technologies. This research represents a promising avenue in advancing energy conversion and storage systems, showcasing the potential of solid-state batteries with enhanced safety and performance characteristics.

Developing durable and active bifunctional gas diffusion electrodes for reversible oxygen reduction/evolution (ORR/OER) reaction catalysis is crucial yet challenging in the development of numerous electrochemical energy conversion systems, including regenerative fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteries. This research is focused on developing manganese oxide-based gas diffusion electrodes for reversible oxygen electrodes. Core-porous shell Mn/Mn 3 O 4 (abbreviated as MnO x ) nanoparticles (QSI) demonstrated increased ORR/OER activities compared to γ-MnO 2 (EMD) and b-MnO 2 .[1] The unique behaviour of core-shell MnO x is attributed to the charge transfer between the low-valent Mn core and the high-valent Mn 3 O 4 shell, thereby regenerating Mn(III) active sites through comproportionation.[1] The stability of transition-metal-based reversible oxygen electrodes remains a challenge. As shown in Figure 1, the deterioration of Mn/Mn 3 O 4 during ORR and OER cycling can be attributed to three aspects: Mn active sites oxidation (Figure 1a), less active MnO x phase formation (Figure 1b), and material loss (carbon corrosion and dissolved MnO 4 - formation) (Figure 1c).[2] As a result, the QSI MnO x electrode transformed from pristine to inactive status within 15 galvanostatic ORR/OER cycles. To improve the stability of the electrode, a set of in-situ electrochemical conditioning and electric field-driven metallic cation incorporation into MnO x GDE was investigated. Among the explored metal cations, the Ni 2+ incorporation showed the most significant improvement in terms of activity and cyclic stability. The Ni-MnO x GDE demonstrated excellent stability for over 120 galvanostatic cycles at ±10 mA cm -2 in O 2 -saturated KOH without losing OER activity, surpassing the Pt/C-IrO 2 benchmark.[3] These findings position the MnO x electrodes as promising and sustainable alternatives to precious metal-based electrodes for ORR/OER catalysis and provide valuable insights into designing reversible oxygen electrodes for energy conversion and storage in alkaline systems, contributing to a green future.

Green energy technologies propose the use of hydrogen as fuel instead of fossil fuels that have drawbacks of limited supplies and greenhouse gas emission during their combustion. Though hydrogen is the most abundant element on the Earth, hydrogen gas is commonly not found in pure form, but bound in compounds such as water or hydrocarbons. Thus, hydrogen gas is a synthetic fuel that needs to be produced. For the energy to be completely green, hydrogen should be produced using renewable energy. Currently, most of the hydrogen is produced using fossil fuels and only ca. 5% is produced using electrolytic water splitting. It is the high cost of the water-splitting process that limits its use on the wider scale. To reduce the associated high energy input to break a water molecule, resulting in high cost of hydrogen produced by water splitting, expensive electrocatalysts are typically used. The aim of this work is to design novel and low cost metal-organic frameworks (MOF) or coordination polymers (CP) utilizing different ligands (for instance, amide functionalized ligands) towards their application in energy conversion reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). MOFs are rarely used in their pristine form; literature reports typically focus on MOF-derived carbon materials. Moreover, herein special attention is given to OER as the efficiency-limiting reaction within the water electrolysis process. The first part of the work focuses on the synthesis and characterization of ligands and MOFs/CPs based on transition metals, nickel and cobalt. The morphology and structure of these composites is examined using electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The second part of the work focuses on the pristine materials’ electrocatalytic activity involving standard electrochemical techniques, i.e., voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry to identify the material with the optimum performance and stability. Main reactions parameters including onset potential, overpotential at defined current density as well as current density at defined potential and Tafel slope, are determined. This work presents step towards green hydrogen production within search for solutions for the current energy crisis.

The development of electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction based on earth-abundant and cheap materials, such as transition metal oxide and hydroxide, is crucial to reduce the emission of CO 2 and slowdown the global warming [1]. Among these transition metal compounds, ferromagnetic electrocatalysts usually exhibit promising activities towards OER due to their unique electron spin properties [2]. Applying an external magnetic field can further tune the electron spin polarization of ferromagnetic materials and, therefore, improve the OER activity. However, evaluating the activity of these electrocatalysts towards OER remains challenging. For example, the electrocatalysts will undergo activation under reaction conditions (frequently due to Fe insertion), which brings difficulties in determining the real reaction sites as well as establishing the “structure-activity” relationship [3]. In addition, the overall measure activity (current density) is contributed by multiple factors such as intrinsic kinetics, mass transfer, conductivity, etc., which strongly depend on operation conditions. In this talk, I will present our recent study of OER on Ni (1-x) Fe x OH [4]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and quasi-in situ XPS will be applied to obtain the contribution from different reaction parameters and understand the intrinsic activity. [1] McCrory, C.

Water electrolysis is extensively researched as a next-generation energy storage method to overcome the intermittency of renewable energy. Electricity generated from renewable sources such as solar and wind power can be converted into pure green hydrogen through water electrolysis. Despite the potential of green hydrogen as a renewable energy storage/carrier medium, the high overpotential resulting from the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the use of expensive noble metals make cost-competitive hydrogen production a significant challenge. Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is one method for hydrogen production, offering economic advantages over proton exchange membrane systems as it allows for the use of relatively inexpensive transition metal catalysts like Ni, Fe, and Co due to its alkaline environment. Nickel phosphide (Ni 2 P)-based catalysts have emerged as highly promising candidates to accelerate the electrocatalytic OER. In particular, the introduction of Fe into Ni 2 P has been found to induce charge transfer, optimizing the electronic structure and accelerating the OER process. OER catalysts based on transition metal phosphides often exhibit a core-shell structure with phosphide at the core and oxide at the shell during OER measurements. This core-shell structure enhances OER performance through the oxide shell, complementing the deficient electrical conductivity of the phosphide core, resulting in superior catalytic activity and durability. From this perspective, transition metal phosphates are also being studied as electrocatalysts for OER. Phosphates, such as PO 3 - , not only promote oxygen adsorbate adsorption but also induce a distorted local metal center geometry that favors OH - adsorption and further oxidation. To address these challenges, this study develops a facile and scalable synthesis of iron-doped nickel phosphide-phosphate (Fe-doped Ni 2 P-PO x ) nano-hybrid system as a superior noble-metal free OER powder-catalyst. The utilization of self-filling and pyrolysis approaches facilitates economically viable production of the highly porous phosphide catalyst with a high specific surface area and rough surfaces. X-ray diffractometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance elucidates the electronic structure modulation, resulting in phosphide-phosphate nano-hybrid structures. Consequently, the catalyst demonstrates excellent OER activity in 1 M KOH, with a significantly low overpotential of 283 mV at 20 mA cm -2 , a small Tafel slope of 28.4 mV dec -1 , and a superior exchange current density of 8.22 mA cm -2 , surpassing state-of-the-art PGM catalysts. Furthermore, its durability over 20 hours indicates its excellent stability, mass transport properties, and mechanical robustness in alkaline media, underscoring its potential as an efficient OER catalyst to facilitate electrocatalytic hydrogen production.

Sunlight-driven photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO under unassisted (unbiased) conditions was recently demonstrated using heterostructured catalysts that combine p-type GaN with plasmonic Au nanoparticles and Cu nanoparticle co-catalysts (p-GaN/Al 2 O 3 /Au/Cu) [1]. However, the exact oxidation state of Cu and the hole transfer directionality between Au and Cu remain under debate. Here, we combine computational and experimental efforts to investigate the different oxidation states of Cu under unassisted photocatalytic operating conditions. Experimentally we found that the Cu nanoparticles are primarily composed of Cu 2 O and CuO, CuCO 3 .Cu(OH) 2 species, with no detectable metallic Cu present. The calculated bulk thermodynamics confirmed the high stability of CuCO 3 .Cu(OH) 2 which is also validated by its largest contribution in the Pourbaix diagram, consistent with experimental observations. To gain insights into the origin of charge transfer, we simulate material interfaces namely, Au/CuO, Au/Cu 2 O, and Au/CuCO 3 .Cu(OH) 2 . Our theoretical analysis supports experimentally observed light-driven hole transfer from Au to Cu. More recently significant progress has been made in understanding copper oxide (CuO) behavior at oxidizing electrochemical conditions (> 1.5 V) [2]. In our study, we show CuO transforms into the OER active phase CuOOH, as evident in the bulk Pourbaix diagram presented here. Our calculations show a novel square planar, non-magnetic CuOOH phase. This discovery is supported by calculated Raman spectroscopic analysis, revealing distinct features corresponding to Cu 3+ species at 567 and 585 cm -1 , closely matching experimental peaks at 587 cm -1 . These findings provide insights into the electrochemical properties of copper oxide phases and their relevance towards electrocatalytic OER.

Ongoing concerns over anthropogenic emissions, fossil fuel sustainability, and related geopolitical aspects point to an increasing need for cost-effective renewable fuel sources. A promising solution is the generation of hydrogen via the catalytic splitting of water, which can be achieved with the aid of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Notably, the anode material in current commercially available PEM electrolyzers is typically iridium oxide. Despite its effectiveness in facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the use of iridium oxide poses challenges due to the scarcity and high cost associated with this precious metal. As the quest for sustainable energy intensifies, ongoing research explores innovative approaches, such as the incorporation of alternative materials and catalysts, to enhance efficiency while addressing the economic and environmental concerns associated with iridium oxide. Studies have shown that incorporating mixed oxides and switching the supports for iridium oxide catalysts help lower the iridium loading while enhancing the OER performance. 1,2 In this study, we investigate a series of different sputtered, mixed iridium oxides (Ta, Ti, Ir). We use a rotating disk electrode system to benchmark the catalytic activity of different loadings of mixed oxides. To measure the intrinsic activity of each catalytic active site, we use a home-built operando UV-Vis system to quantify the populations of surface species as well as track the kinetics of different redox transitions during OER. We incorporate nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry to probe the migration of different mixed oxide species before and after electrochemical cycling and use kelvin probe force microscopy to estimate the conductivity through the different films. In this study, we show the importance of cooperative effects between neighboring iridium oxide species and the coordination of iridium that are responsible for enhanced OER performance. These results indicate that doping modulates coverage dependent interactions at the surface, which affects both the binding energetics and populations of rate limiting intermediates. We believe this study will serve as a steppingstone for future designs of more cost-efficient PEM electrolyzers. (1) Oh, Hyung-Suk, et al.

The current reliance on platinum group metals (PGMs) as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers, the current industry standard, presents a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. The scarcity and high cost of PGMs necessitate the development of alternative materials and technologies that offer comparable performance at a reduced cost. In this context, anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers have emerged as a promising alternative. This presentation addresses this imperative by focusing on the design and synthesis of nanostructured mesoporous multi-metallic catalysts for AEM water electrolyzers, leveraging earth-abundant materials as alternatives to the rare and expensive PGMs currently employed in PEM water electrolyzers. Transition metal oxides, sulfides, and phosphides are promising candidates to replace PGMs, given their abundance, low cost, and tunable catalytic properties conducive to high OER activity. The OER activity and durability of newly developed multi-metallic transition metal catalysts in an alkaline environment will be discussed in this presentation. Preliminary results demonstrate that the developed catalysts exhibit high OER activity, achieving a potential of <1.5 V versus RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² in 1.0 M KOH. Notably, this surpasses the performance of commercial OER catalysts in alkaline environments. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits superior durability, with < 0.5 mV/h potential loss over 100 h durability test at 10 mA cm⁻² in 1.0 M KOH.

Co 3 O 4 , an electrocatalyst with a spinel structure, exhibits promise for a range of applications including fuel cells, water splitting devices, metal-air batteries, and more. Its advantageous characteristics include durability and an extended longevity, among others. By altering the structure and electronic properties, an electrocatalyst makes it suitable for enhanced oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The application of 3d-transition metal dopants (e.g., Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cu) to modify the catalytic properties of a substance has become widespread. In this work, experimental evidence and DFT calculations are combined to provide insight into an OER process in acidic media, thereby enhancing the comprehension and performance of an electrocatalyst. Our investigation is conducted using a Co 3 O 4 (311)-surface model that is derived from our experimental analysis of the principal peaks in our XRD data. For electrocatalytic reactions that are significantly impacted by the solvent (water) molecules' interaction with the solid surface, the surface is additionally represented by an explicit layer of water molecules. The catalytic active site for the intermediate species (O*, OH*, OOH*) utilized in the adsorption reactions has been initially determined in this study. The DFT-derived energies (~25-30 kJ/mol) indicated that the octahedral (Co +3 ) site on the surface is the most favorable location for the reaction in each N-doped Co 3 O 4 system (N = Mn, Fe, Cu). The electronic characteristics of the surface are altered through doping, leading to distinct changes in the charge density, DOS, band gap, and d-band center. For instance, when Cu +2 is doped at the octahedral site, the d-band center (ε d ) of pristine Co 3 O 4 is estimated to alter by approximately ~0.7 eV. In acidic environments, OER is typically controlled by a four-electron reaction step/mechanism that ensues after water molecules divide, resulting in the production of O 2 gas and the adsorption of O*, OH*, and OOH* species. The adsorption energies for the majority of intermediate species are estimated using this mechanism. It is suggested that the active sites for Mn and Fe on the modeled 311-surface bound the species significantly more strongly than the sites for Co and Cu. The reaction is conducted utilizing DFT, and the enthalpies of each reaction phase in the (Mn, Fe, and Cu)-Co 3 O 4 (311) system are determined. The uphill and downhill slopes in Gibbs free energy diagram facilitate screening and comparison of the OER activity of the N-doped Co 3 O 4 surface. Moreover, an understanding of the mechanism underlying reaction kinetics can be attained through its rate-determining steps (RDS). The transition state (TS) is theoretically determined for each reaction step through the utilization of nudge elastic band (NEB) methods. The RDS of the reaction is anticipated to be the transition from O* to OOH*, given that it exhibits the greater barrier among all the reactions. Furthermore, an additional research is necessary to ascertain the stability and activity of the aforementioned electro-catalyst.

The efficient transport of gas poses a significant challenge in the design of high-performance gas evolving electrocatalysts. Inefficiencies due to mass transport limitations become more pronounced at the high current densities required in industrial electrolyzers, largely as a result of gas bubbles that obstruct a portion of the electrochemically active surface area of the anode and/or cathode, while also hindering electrolyte transport to the electrode surfaces. One promising approach to mitigate these sources of inefficiency is to engineer micro-to-nanoscale surface textures that promote the favorable growth and release of these bubbles. A range of structures have been shown to improve electrocatalyst performance under both stagnant and induced convection conditions, particularly in applications for hydrogen production via electrocatalytic water splitting in alkaline water electrolyzers. 1 Trends between surface texture and electrocatalyst performance have been observed for a range of features, such as pillars, 2,3 ridges, 4 dimples, 5 “cracked” structures, 6 and electrodeposited crystalline structures, 7 however substantial work is still needed to optimize the designs of these materials. These textured surfaces can influence bubble evolution in various ways, such as by altering the wetting properties of a surface, or by providing preferential nucleation sites. Previous studies have noted that surface structures that provide good control over bubble nucleation can often be adversely affected by increased bubble retention. 3–5 The present study investigates a method of fabricating patterned electrocatalysts that provides a fine, tunable control over the distribution of bubble nucleation sites on the surfaces of planar Ni electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These textured surfaces are designed to take advantage of so-called “non-classical nucleation” or “type IV nucleation”, a scenario in which gas is trapped at specific surface sites with an effective radius larger than the critical radius for classical nucleation, thereby allowing spontaneous bubble growth without being required to overcome an activation energy barrier. 8 The separation between these sites on the surface of the OER active material (i.e., Ni) is then varied to obtain the most favorable distribution of these non-classical nucleation sites. Chronoamperometry is used to compare the current densities achieved by these patterned Ni electrodes to that of a planar Ni electrode. High speed videography is used to directly measure how these textures influence processes such as bubble growth and detachment, and to determine how these processes influence performance. A better understanding of these gas evolution processes can help lower the energy requirements for electrolyzers and may have more general implications for the design of energy efficient gas evolving electrocatalysts relevant to a variety of industrially important reactions.

Transition metal chalcogenides have been found to be particularly effective in promoting electrochemical energy conversion due to their unique electronic structure that facilitates interfacial charge transfer through modulation of electron density around the catalytically active site. Transition metal chalcogenides are relatively inexpensive compared to precious metal based OER catalysts, which makes them attractive for large-scale applications. Moreover, metal chalcogenides exhibit excellent chemical stability, which is important for maintaining the activity of the electrode over time. This study delves into the impact of anion-tuning in metallic chalcogenides on their electrocatalytic efficacy for comprehensive water splitting. Specifically, copper-based chalcogenides (Cu 2 X, where X = O, S, Se, and Te) undergo systematic examination to investigate the influence of decreasing anion electronegativity and increasing covalency on electrocatalytic performance. Among the copper chalcogenides, Cu 2 Te has the highest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and can sustain high current density of 10 and 50 mA cm −2 for 12 h. The difference in intrinsic catalytic activity of these chalcogenide surfaces have been also probed through density functional theory calculations, which was used to estimate energy of the catalyst activation step. It was observed that the hydroxyl adsorption on the surface catalytic site is critically important for the onset and progress of OER activity. Consequently, it was also noted that the –OH adsorption energy can be used as a simple but accurate descriptor to explain the catalytic efficiency through volcano-like correlation plot. Such observation will have a significant impact on developing design principle for optimal catalytic surface exhibiting high performance as well as prolonged stability. By understanding the impact of anion electronegativity on catalytic performance, we aim to unravel the underlying principles governing OER and contribute to the rational design of highly efficient catalyst surfaces.

Hydrogen with high calorific content (150 MJ/kg) and environment-friendly combustion product (H 2 O) becomes the alternative fossil fuel. Catalytic electrolysis of water is one of the attractive routes for generating H 2 . Energy-efficient and cost-effective electrolytic production of H 2 has predominantly focused on lowering the overpotential for water splitting process by developing newer non-Pt group-based catalysts. This work demonstrates a new direction towards sustainable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by exploiting the fundamental interplay of electromagnetic forces. Introducing an external magnetic field (H ext = 100 mT) perpendicular to the heterogeneous electrocatalytic interface produces an unprecedented increase in rate of electrocatalytic OER in phosphate buffer with pH=7. Such electromagnetic catalysis is achieved with metal phosphides (NiCoP and NiCoFeP) with different morphology, leading 2.5 fold increase in the OER current density and concomitant lowering of overpotential by 10% (H ext = 100 mT). Thereby, 50% lowering of charge transfer resistance (R ct ) is achieved. This is substantiated by the lowering of the Tafel slope (by 5%) in the presence of H ext . Thus, we report two important observations influenced by the magnetic field: (a) direct effect of magnetic field on the catalyst surface to reduce the charge-transfer resistance, (b) spin-dependant OER process to get influenced under magnetic field and (c) indirect effect of magnetic field to sustain the magneto-electrocatalytic enhancement even after removing the magnetic field. The time-scale of magnetic relaxation is million times higher than conventional spin-lattice relaxation events in para/ferromagnetic systems. Such long-term stability of magnetized states is predominantly proposed to be originating from the NiCoP and NiCoFeP interface. So, we attribute the long-lived states to be additionally contributed from the volumetric expansion and active site expansion of the catalyst upon magnetization. Catalyst interface is arising due to the dendritic structure of catalyst. Such synergism of magnetization, is expected to increase the applicability of magneto-electrocatalysis as a more sustainable electrocatalytic approach towards a hydrogen-driven economy.

The cost of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is a hindrance to the large-scale utilization of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) provides a balance of high activity and stability; however, the high cost and scarcity of Ir necessitates the development of non-Ir OER catalysts. Ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) has higher OER activity and lower cost compared to IrO 2 , but RuO 2 is highly unstable in acidic media at high potentials and undergoes dissolution during PEMWE operation. We investigated incorporating zirconium (Zr) into RuO 2 to improve the electrochemical stability of RuO 2 OER catalysts. Ruthenium-zirconium oxides (Ru 1-x Zr x O 2 ) were prepared using different synthesis methods and with different Zr concentrations, and we studied the effect of Zr on the structure, morphology, OER activity, and electrochemical stability. The Ru 1-x Zr x O 2 catalysts were studied by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and rotating disk electrode electrochemistry, and metal dissolution was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results show that Zr can be incorporated into rutile RuO 2 via different synthesis routes, and the OER activity and stability are affected by the incorporation of Zr. The understanding of the effects of substituents on OER activity and stability furthers the development of OER catalysts with high activity, high stability, and lower cost.

Environmentally friendly strategies for energy conversion and storage are urgently needed to account for natural intensity variations of power generation by renewables and to ensure a stable electrical grid. Green hydrogen, produced by water electrolysis, can be considered as one of the most promising energy carriers since it can balance the energy demand in multiple energy sectors. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) are state of the art devices for on-site hydrogen production. Still, their upscaling is challenged by the corrosive acidic environment and sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which demand using noble metal based catalysts [1, 2]. Currently, Ir-based oxides are employed as OER catalysts in commercial PEMWE as they provide the best balance between activity and stability. Yet, the scarcity and high market price of Ir lead to poor cost-benefit factors. In the last years, Ir-Ru mixed oxides have attracted significant attention of the community due to their improved electrocatalytic activity [2, 3]. However, Ru degradation during the OER becomes challenging in conditions of long-term operation of the electrolyzer. Therefore, balancing stability and activity towards the OER at reduced Ir loading remains a significant challenge in PEMWE. Here, we examine the effect of low additions of Ti (1 to 6 at. %) on the catalytic activity and stability of Ru-Ir alloys towards the OER [4]. The catalysts are synthesized as ternary Ru-Ir-Ti thin film material libraries with Ir contents below 50 at. %. After the high-throughput screening of these libraries for desired electrocatalytic properties by online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the most promising alloy compositions are selected and tested in conditions of long-term electrolysis (Figure 1). The observed activity-stability trends are correlated with the electronic structure of the Ru-Ir-Ti catalysts derived from X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XAS). Furthermore, the structural changes in the near-surface regions of these catalysts induced by the OER, are investigated with the aid of atom probe tomography (APT). Our data reveal formation of Ir-Ru hydrous oxide layers in the course of the OER, providing high catalytic activity, while Ti additions promote stabilization of these reactive oxides in the near surface region. Our multidisciplinary approach of combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic and atomic-scale characterization methods provides insights on structure-function relationships in electrocatalysis, guiding the rational design of active and stable electrocatalysts.

Solid oxide cells (SOCs) are electrochemical devices that have garnered significant attention due to their high efficiency, fuel flexibility, and reversibility for operation in both fuel cell and the electrolysis modes. However, the relatively high operating temperature (typically > 800 °C) required presents various challenges such as fast degradation, high operating costs, and slow start-up. To overcome these issues, significant efforts have been made to decrease the operating temperature, but this causes a dramatic decrease in performance due to the low catalytic activity of typical electrode materials. One strategy to increase the catalytic activity is to introduce highly active nanoparticles onto a conventional electrode backbone, but while noble metals such as Ru and Ir have been utilized as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, their widespread application in SOECs is hindered by their high cost and limited availability. In this presentation, we demonstrate a highly effective approach to enhance air electrode performance through the deposition of an ultrathin layer of metallic Ru, as thin as ∼7.5 Å, onto (La 0.6 Sr 0.4 ) 0.95 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3-δ (LSCF) using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). The Ru-decorated cell exhibited a current density of 656 mA cm –2 at 1.3 V, significantly outperforming a bare cell (440 mA cm –2 at 1.3 V). The decorated cell also showed a largely enhanced cell durability, which is ascribed to the beneficial role of SrRuO 3 that emerges from the reaction between PEALD-based Ru and surface-segregated Sr species, in suppressing Sr segregation and maintaining favorable oxygen desorption kinetics. Further, the PEALD Ru coating on LSCF also reduces the resistance to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), highlighting the bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for reversible fuel cells. When the LSCF electrode of a test cell is decorated with ∼7.5 Å of the Ru overcoat and tested in fuel cell mode at 700 °C, this results in a current density of 656 mA cm -2 at 1.3 V in electrolysis mode and a peak power density of 803 mW cm -2 , corresponding to an enhancement of 49.1% and 31.9%, respectively, compared to the pristine cell.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEM WEs) has a potential to produce high-purity green hydrogen. PEMWEs have been commercialized with the use of high loadings of the noble metal Ir-based anode catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To lower the Ir loading amount, it is critically important to develop efficient catalysts with increased Ir utilization and higher OER activity. One-dimensional Ir oxide nanorod/nanoparticles catalysts supported on doped SnO 2 with a unique microstructure were invented to show their exceptionally high activity in the OER catalysis, with the Ir-mass specific activity being 10 times higher than that of commercial IrO x catalyst at 1.5 V vs. RHE.[1] The experiment also found that the OER activation energy was greatly lower than that of commercial Ir oxide. The interaction between Ir oxide nanorod/nanoparticles and doped SnO 2 support occurs a lower degree of Ir oxidation which allows the surface terminal oxygens to be closer together while allowing facile desorption of nonreactive oxygenated species. The electronic state of Ir oxide nanorod/nanoparticles catalysts could play an important role in facilitating the crucial step of the OER, thereby enhancing the OER activity. These priorities of the catalysts would promise the reduction of the Ir usage in PEMWEs. Reference [1] G. Shi, T. Tano, D.A. Tryk, T. Uchiyama, A. Iiyama, M. Uchida, K. Terao, M. Yamaguchi, K.

Overcoming the challenge of developing highly durable and conductive support materials for Ir-based electrocatalysts in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is difficult due to the highly corrosive conductions experienced during anodic process. In this research, we develop IrO x /Ba 3 TiO 7 electrocatalysts, which employ Ba 3 TiO 7 as a new support material, to minimize loading amount of iridium. We also try to fabricated Ba 3 TiO (7-x) support material with abundant oxygen vacancies for enhanced conductivity of the support material. As a results, the IrO x /Ba 3 TiO 7 electrocatalysts demonstrated remarkable OER performances and enhanced mass activity compared to unsupported IrO x electrocatalysts. Through a combination of physical and chemical analyses, It was elucidated that the excellent thermodynamic stability and electrical conductivity of Ba 3 TiO 7 effectively enhanced the mass activity of IrO x /Ba 3 TiO 7 electrocatalysts. These finding provide further insight into new category of anode support materials for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.

I will discuss how intercalation of O 2- under OER conditions can lead to lattice oxygen redox and chemo-mechanical coupling inside the crystal lattice of a perovskite electrocatalyst. Specifically, I will show that high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) can detect the oxidation state of oxygen in a perovskite oxide. The emergence of oxidized oxygen depends on the transition metal and the amount of intercalated oxygen. At the same time, oxygen dimerization has a direct relevance to the stress-induced structural disorder that takes place inside the electrocatalyst. At the end, I will also discuss our recent finding in which oxygen can intercalate spontaneously following a catalytic O 2 splitting at the surface and induce substantial transformations in the bulk of the perovskite.

Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have long been regarded as cost-substitutes for traditional noble metal electrocatalysts, exhibiting comparable activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, stability and activity remain crucial factors influencing the broader applicability of the catalysts. Therefore, enhancing the stability of transition metal chalcogenides is a key area of interest. This study delves into the development of carbon-based hydrochar support, serving as an alternative scaffold for depositing TMCs. Specifically, it aims to explore the application of scaffold for nickel-cobalt selenide (NiCoSe), a TMC exhibiting significant potential in accelerating the OER rate by increasing extrinsic activity through higher catalyst loading, enhanced porosity, and ensuring stability of the supported catalyst. The activity and stability of the NiCoSe/hydrochar are determined from cyclic voltammogram and chronoamperometric curves. Characterization of the synthesized NiCoSe on hydrochar show porous microstructure and well-dispersed electrocatalyst on hydrochar scaffold which allowed enhanced transport of species and aided electron transport through the electrolyte-electrode interface. SEM-EDS spectra show uniform distribution of NiCoSe which is advantageous for enhanced performance of the catalyst. This study elucidated the effect of hydrochar to enhance the extrinsic activity of NiCoSe towards the oxygen evolution reaction.

A “Non-Native” phase (NNP) differs from the thermodynamically most stable bulk Native in its discrete translational symmetry. The relative difference in surface and bulk energy with respect to the native phase (NP)determines the stability of NNP. The isomaterial hetero-structured NP-NNP composite provides a pathway to assemble structures that have optimal properties of NNP and NP. The surface and sub-surface energies can also be modulated by doping as the dopants may segregate and stabilize grain boundaries. This study demonstrates that the isomaterial heterostructure of the NP, β-N MnO 2 , and Ramsdellite, r-NN1 MnO2, known as γ-N-NN1-MnO 2 intergrowth, enhances the OER activity and stability. The hydrothermal route was used to synthesize isomaterial heterostructured γ/N-NN1-MnO 2 with varying concentrations of dopants (10%, 15%, and 20% Ni and Co). X-ray diffraction was used to characterize the material, and after Rietveld refinement, phase quantification revealed that as the dopant concentration increased, the amount of the thermodynamically stable β-N MnO 2 phase increased. Planes identified in XRD were also confirmed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and the analysis of selective area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. It appears that doping was successful based on the shifting of peaks in XRD and differences in unit cell volume and crystallite size calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation before and after doping. With an increase in dopant concentration and thus improved OER activity, the average oxidation state as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy followed a downward trend, which is known to improve OER activity. The peaks shifted to lower frequency values as seen by Raman spectroscopy, which implies a weakening of Mn—O bond strength, indicating that dopants Ni and Co may have replaced part of the Mn atoms in the MnO 2 intergrowth structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed spherical-shaped nanoparticles with spike-like overgrowths, which were further confirmed by HRTEM. The uniform dispersion of dopants was demonstrated by SEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Elemental quantification of the samples was done using EDS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Using HRTEM, the presence of grain boundaries was confirmed. The study of dopants segregating to the grain boundary is conducted through DFT simulations. In many instances, the dopants actively contribute to the OER activity, except for the case of Ni in the NN1 sub-phase of the γ-N-NN1-MnO 2 intergrowth, which is apparent by the slightly lower activity of Ni-doped samples compared to Co. This is because Ni remains in the bulk while Co segregates to the surface. A three-electrode setup (Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, Pt mesh as the counter electrode, and catalyst as the working electrode) was used in 1M KOH to conduct electrochemical experiments. To achieve 10 mA/cm 2 , the 15% Co-doped electrocatalyst used the least amount of overpotential, 320 mV. According to electrochemical measurements and analysis, the doped samples show low Tafel slope, high specific activity, roughness factor, and charge transfer resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, all of which suggest improved overall activity for the oxygen evolution process (OER) for the doped over undoped samples. DFT simulations rationalize the enhancement of OER using the Bader charge analysis, the associated Gibbs free energy of the Sabatier principle plotted as the volcano plot.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) show the fast response to a wide electrical load range, making them compatible to couple with intermittent renewable energy systems such as wind and solar power. However, the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely hinder the widespread deployment of PEMWEs. Hitherto, iridium-based catalysts still play an irreplaceable role for their trade-off catalytic activity and stability. To meet the scarcity of iridium, reducing the iridium loading and designing low iridium-based electrocatalysts have become the mainstream. Particularly, perovskite-type oxides possess flexible compositions, enabling them ideal material platform for the optimization of catalytic performance. In this work, several materials of iridium-based perovskite-type oxides were acquired by coupling iridium with various transition elements in B-site and regulating A-site cations, which both diluted the usage of iridium and utilized the multi-metallic synergistic effect to achieve high activity and stability. Evolution of the surface structure was monitored by in-situ Raman spectroscopy to identify the active site and to uncover the catalytic mechanism. Besides, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was used as an auxiliary tool to analyze the local structure and electrochemical behavior of the electrode surface for its cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) based on the optimum composition was assembled to evaluate the performance of novel electrocatalysts for PEMWEs. Results of this work provide a new perspective of designing low iridium content electrocatalysts for OER in PEMWEs.

In response to the growing energy and environmental challenges, considerable endeavors have been directed towards the development of sustainable and eco-friendly energy technologies as alternatives to fossil fuels. Moreover, rechargeable zinc-air batteries (RZABs) stand out due to their high energy density and environmental friendliness, although the sluggish cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics restrict RZABs performance. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), owing to their highly porous structure and tunable morphology, are often utilized as the precursors of the materials. Particularly, high-entropy PBAs (HEPBAs), formed by blending five or more metals in a random lattice, have achieved enhanced thermal and chemical stability via a robust structure with multiple transition metal ions. Meanwhile, transition metal carbides (TMCs) were investigated for ZAB applications due to their higher catalytic activity. Herein, we introduced CNT into HEPBA nanoparticles, followed by calcination processes, resulting in the synthesis of high-entropy metal carbides on CNT (HE-TMCs/CNT) which are effective for the bifunctional OER and ORR performance. HE-TMCs/CNT demonstrate superior activity towards the ORR (E 1/2 = 0.77 V) in a 0.1 M KOH solution and OER (η = 330 mV @10 mA cm −2 ) in a 1 M KOH solution. The ZAB with HE-TMCs/CNT as the cathode demonstrated an open-circuit voltage of 1.39 V, providing a high energy density of 71 mW cm -2 under a current density of 102 mA cm -2 . It exhibited the ability to be charged and discharged in cycles for up to 40 hours, revealing good stability under an applied current density of 5 mA cm -2 . These results offer a straightforward pathway for the development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for high-performance RZABs. Figure 1

In recent years, there has been a growing need for new renewable energy sources due to the rapid depletion of conventional energy sources and an escalating energy demand. Since environmental protection concerns are increasing, electrochemical processes are becoming increasingly essential [1]. Specifically, the focus has shifted towards storing energy in hydrogen and its subsequent conversion into on-demand electricity [2]. Here, hydrogen, generated via water electrolysis, serves as either an intermediary for generating energy carriers like liquid fuels or plays a key role as an energy carrier [3]. Despite significant efforts focused on enhancing electrolyzers for energy conversion, the progression towards practical application has encountered challenges stemming from differing catalyst development requisites in academic and industrial research. This study proposes a systematic approach for efficiently transitioning electrocatalysts from fundamental research to application readiness for alkaline oxygen evolution reactions. Herein, La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 was chosen as a catalyst and compared with the benchmark material NiFe 2 O 4 . Initially, the La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 catalyst was successfully synthesized by scalable spray-flame synthesis. Following this, various inks were formulated utilizing different binders (Nafion®, Naf; Sustainion®, Sus). The dispersion stability of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 and commercial NiFe 2 O 4 inks was investigated in the presence of Nafion and Sustainion using analytical centrifugation and transmittograms. Subsequently, these selected dispersions were applied onto nickel substrates via spray coating techniques, ensuring a homogeneous catalyst distribution. Finally, the La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 and NiFe 2 O 4 catalysts were subjected to extensive electrochemical evaluations, including glassy carbon rotating disk electrode, scanning droplet cell (SDC), compression cell, flow cell, and zero-gap cell, to evaluate the material performance. SDC findings highlight the excellent uniformity in La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 electrodes and NiFe 2 O 4 -Sustainion (standard deviation < 11%). However, the NiFe 2 O 4 -Sustainion film experienced delamination, exhibiting a standard deviation of 28%. SDC experiments offer advantages over various half-cell techniques by enabling the detection of any inhomogeneities or coating defects within the catalytic film. Additionally, complementary compression and flow cell experiments provide detailed information on the chemical and mechanical stress parameters resembling those in a full cell configuration. In assessing industrial applicability, the catalytic materials were undergone examination within a scalable full cell under industrial conditions (500 mA/cm² and 60 °C) utilizing a zero-gap cell setup. The observed trend in the full cell for the coated electrodes is as follows: La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 -Naf > La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 -Sus > NiFe 2 O 4 -Sus > NiFe 2 O 4 -Naf. These findings achieved through a well-structured coherent workflow, enhance our knowledge of the electrocatalytic system and offer essential insights for implementing novel materials in large-scale industrial applications.

Low-temperature water electrolysis can rapidly produce environmentally sustainable or green hydrogen, and is a prospective means of storing energy from renewable but intermittent power sources, such as wind and solar, in future clean energy infrastructure (1-4). Commercial water electrolysis either use liquid alkaline electrolyte or proton exchange membrane electrolyte (1). The proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) offers more advantages than the alkaline counterpart, such as higher purity of H 2 , lower resistance losses, more compact design, and what the most important is the compatible with the intermittent of the renewable energy (1-2). The grant challenge remaining in PEMWE is the development of the highly active, cost effective and stable catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is very sluggish requiring large amounts of precious metal as the catalysts, such as Ir, Ru and their oxides (1). In PEM water electrolysis cells, the catalysts should have high surface areas and high porosities that exposit sufficient active sites available to the reactants and electrolyte, as well as transferring the bubble out of the catalyst surface to ensure a fast mass transfer (5). Also, the OER is dependent on the inherent conductivity of the catalysts or the supports (1). For example, poor electronic conductivity within the catalyst layer will result in poor lateral conductivity across the catalyst layer, thus catalyst not in the vicinity of the porous transport layer will not participate in the reaction. To enable the widespread penetration of the PEMWE technologies, it is urgently to reduce the Ir loading to the sustainable level (~ 0.3 mg/cm 2 ) compared with the current commercial usage (2-6 mg/cm 2 ). Alternatively, to develop precious metal free catalyst with high efficiency and sustained durability (5). In this presentation, we will describe a method of preparing highly active yet stable synergistic electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction for PEMWE. The new catalysts contain IrCoOx/ RuCoOx cluster and La&Li co-doped Co 3 O 4 fiber which was derived from cobalt zeolitic imidazolate framework as precursor. The OER activities of the catalysts were first tested in O 2 saturated acidic electrolyte by ring disk electrode (RDE), which displayed high mass activity 26-50 times that of commercial Ir and RuO 2 . The catalysts were fabricated into membrane electrode assemble and measured under real PEM water electrolysis condition. The cells demonstrated 2 A/cm 2 @1.76 V @0.25 ± 0.05 mg Ir /cm 2 loading, and negligible degradation after ~250 h chronoamperometric measurements at 2 A/cm 2 (6), which meets the target set by US DOE for OER catalysts for PEMWE. The characterizations of the fresh and post-electrochemical samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and BET surface analysis. We also performed DFT simulation on the OER reaction pathways over Ir and Co sites of different facets parallelly on basis of the TEM results. The result reveals the synergy between Ir/Ru and Co resulting in the enhanced catalytic activities of both IrCoOx /RuCoOx and LaLi@Co 3 O 4 toward OER.

Finding clean, sustainable, and environmentally friendly technologies is especially crucial in addressing both energy and environmental challenges. Intending to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) which happens at the anode and and to decrease the energy consumption for water-splitting at a large scale, exploring high-performing electrocatalysts is an imperative undertaking essential to maximize the practical applicability of water splitting. Developing electrocatalysts through strategic surface modifications represents a significant approach to the deliberate creation of exceptionally active catalytic centers through rational means. Considerable attention has been focused on the advancement of mixed oxides based on transition metals as highly active electrocatalysts. In the present work, we have successfully synthesized electrocatalysts for the OER as elemental selenium incorporated hollowed NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO nanocages by employing precise control over the structure and composition of the material. The findings demonstrated that the surface reconstructed hollowed structure with plenty of thin nanocages enhancement of 5 wt% Se-NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO resulted in an increased quantity of corresponding edge active sites. This structural achievement further expedited mass transport and due to increased conductivity sped up the charge transfer processes within the system, exhibited remarkable activity for the OER, displaying a low overpotential (η=288 mV) at a current density ( j ) of 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope (66.7 mV dec −1 ) including better stability. This work offers a viable and versatile method for fabricating a range of functional coordinated MOF compounds that hold potential for utilization across diverse energy applications including storage, conversion, and environmental purposes.

Hydrogen starvation is still a big problem in PEM fuel cells [1]. In order to provide protons and electrons to the cathode during H 2 starvation, the carbon oxidation reaction (COR) takes place at the anode [2]. To solve this issue, there are three main strategies: (i) utilization of corrosion resistant support materials, (ii) integration of extensive and complex system mitigation strategies and finally (iii) the addition of co-catalyst to promote the oxygen evolution reaction(OER) instead of COR. [3, 4] In this work, platinum-iridium (PtIr) nanoparticles (NPs) have been designed as a novel bifunctional electrocatalysts to accelerate either the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) or the OER depending on the reaction conditions. Our catalyst concept is the combination of both functionality (HOR and OER) in single Pt-Ir alloy nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on the same support material. The Pt-Ir NPs with Pt:Ir ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 were prepared by two different (colloidal and wet-impregnation) routes. Very interestingly, the oxidation states of platinum and iridium as well as the particle size strongly vary depending on the synthesis route. More precisely, the wet-impregnation enables preparing Pt-Ir NPs of 3 – 4 nm size and mainly in the metallic state, while strongly oxidized NPs with ~2 nm size are produced by colloidal route. Despite the different oxidation states and particle sizes, the Pt-Ir NPs show considerable activity for HOR and OER compared to pure commercial Pt/C and IrOx catalysts. Very interestingly, the bifunctionality of these Pt-Ir is highly reversible and is robust during accelerated stress tests. Operando Quick-X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy were performed to provide fundamental insights into the reversibility and catalytically active states of these bifunctional catalysts under the working conditions by jumping with the potential between HER and OER within few seconds. The combination of operando XANES, RDE and MEA data show that the bifunctional approach is a promising way to improve the cell reversal-tolerant properties of anode catalyst materials compared to the state-of-the-art Pt-IrO x catalyst materials.

This paper reports on progress in development of electrocatalysts intended for use in seawater, which optimize the balance of competing reactions between chlorine evolution and oxygen evolution. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from H 2 O is thermodynamically more favorable due to a lower equilibrium potential [1]. However, chlorine evolution successfully competes with the OER due to faster kinetics. One of a few catalysts that demonstrates high selectivity towards the OER in the presence of chloride ions in the alkaline environment (i.e. pH 12) is γ-MnO 2 [2]. In this presentation, we (1) compare activities and selectivities towards the OER of electrodeposited and chemically synthesized γ-MnO 2 and (2) determine how pH affects selectivity in the pH range from 11 to 13. g-MnO 2 powder was synthesized using hydrothermal method. The synthesis resulted in fabrication of material with a flower-like morphology, characterized by a crystallite size of 5-15 nm and BET surface area of 75 m 2 /g. In parallel, MnO 2 films were prepared by electrodeposition on a Pt RDE substrate, following the procedure outlined by Tsagareli et al. [3]. The electrocatalytic activity of both γ-MnO 2 powder and electrodeposited MnO 2 was investigated by the thin-film RDE method. The thin films of γ-MnO 2 powder were obtained by drop-casting MnO 2 /VC ink [1] on glassy carbon substrates. We found that the shape of polarization curves on MnO 2 /VC films is strongly dependent on the Nafionä loading. At low Nafion loadings, we observe diffusion-limited currents, which we attribute to OH - diffusion through the Nafion. At higher Nafion loadings, neither diffusion-limited currents, nor the currents’ dependence on the rotation rate are observed. Our data indicate that at low Nafion loadings, MnO 2 /VC films selectively produce O 2 in 0.5M NaCl at pH 12 and 13 and current densities up to 15 mA/cm 2 . Because of the potential effect of Nafion on the permeability of Cl - ions to the catalyst’s active sites, a set of parallel experiments is being carried out on the electrolytically deposited MnO 2 films. The results of the latter experiments will be compared to those obtained on MnO 2 /VC films in the presentation. References [1] F. Dionigi, T. Reier, Z. Pawolek, M. Gliech, P.

Water splitting is a very hot research topic as a preferred source for green hydrogen, as a key vector to facilitate a transition into an environmentally friendly and sustainable energy economy in the mid-term. But it is still far from being economically competitive with respect to current hydrogen production technologies based on fossil fuels. One of the major economic hurdles to reduce electrolysis costs is the lack of low-cost catalysts for hydrogen evolution and, more importantly, for oxygen evolution. The water oxidation process is considered the main bottleneck in the advancement of water splitting devices, since it is the rate limiting process, and the main cause of poor long-term performance. Most recent advances in the field of water oxidation catalysis are based on transition metal oxides, operating exclusively in alkaline electrolysis conditions. Unfortunately, these excellent oxygen evolution catalysts in basic pH ( > 13) rapidly lose their activity when the pH is lowered, and are far away from the performance exhibited by noble metals in acid solution. McCrory et al. established in 2013 1 a benchmarking protocol to identify the potential of new OER electrocatalysts (and extended in 2015 2 to HER) comparing the initial activity and stability of the materials as a function of pH and showed how no other known catalysts at that time came close to the performance of IrO x -based materials. A simple processing technique using a partially hydrophobic binder has been proved to stabilize Co oxide, resulting in electrodes able to reach high current densities (> 10 mA cm -2 ) at competitive overpotentials and with long term stability for acidic OER catalysis 3 . Following this strategy, we have been able to conduct an extensive survey of the activity and stability of monometallic, binary and ternary earth-abundant transition metal oxides during electrocatalytic OER in 1 M H 2 SO 4 . Our results confirm the general validity of the strategy in using a partially hydrophobic electrode to confer high stability to common metal oxides under these harsh conditions. [1] C.C.L.

Proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzers, pivotal for sustainable hydrogen production, encounter challenges in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) marked by high overpotential and limited electrocatalyst stability. This study delves into the computational exploration of two metal substitutions, titanium (Ti) and zirconium (Zr), within ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ), aiming to enhance catalytic stability. The investigation encompasses nanoscale titanium-substituted and zirconium-substituted rutile RuO 2 , (Ru 1-x M x O 2 ) and evaluating their atomic and electronic structures, OER activity, and dissolution behavior. In the case of Ti substitution, varying concentrations (x = 0–50 at %) were systematically investigated. Our experiments and theoretical analyses elucidate concentration-dependent effects on the electronic structure, showcasing shifts in the d-band and O2p band centers. Titanium substitution induces electron accumulation and depletion regions on the surface, influencing OER activity and stability. Electrochemical testing corroborates the theory, demonstrating that lower Ti concentrations (12.5 and 20 at %) enhance catalyst stability and mitigate ruthenium dissolution. Specifically, Ti substitution influences reaction pathways, with penta-coordinated Ru sites exhibiting the lowest barriers for OER, while hexa-coordinated Ru sites facilitate lower energetic barriers for dissolution. Simultaneously, the study extends to the substitution of Zr within rutile RuO 2 . Computational and experimental analyses reveal anisotropic shifts in the rutile unit cell, dependent on Zr concentration. Zr substitution induces alterations in the electronic structure, impacting the surface density of states and electron density distribution. Experimentally, lower OER activity is observed for Zr-substituted RuO 2 compared to pure RuO2 , consistent with computational averages across all sites. However, specific sites with Zr substitution exhibit higher theoretical OER activity. Dissolution analyses underscore the complexity of interactions, with Zr affecting activation barriers for Ru dissolution, thus influencing OER stability. Notably, the dissolution behavior emerges as a critical aspect of this investigation. In Ti-substituted RuO 2 , experimental accelerated durability testing showcases enhanced stability and reduced Ru dissolution at low and intermediate Ti concentrations. Computational analyses corroborate these findings, indicating site-specific effects on both OER activity and stability. Conversely, Zr-substituted RuO 2 exhibits lower Ru dissolution compared to commercial RuO 2 , emphasizing the role of Zr in impeding Ru dissolution while contributing to surface restructuring. In conclusion, this comprehensive exploration of Ti and Zr substitutions within ruthenium oxide advances our understanding of their effects on atomic and electronic structures, OER activity, and dissolution dynamics. The intricate interplay between specific sites, metal concentrations, and substituents provides valuable insights for designing high-performance, cost-effective OER nanoscale electrocatalysts. The findings underscore the importance of considering both activity and stability in the pursuit of efficient and durable electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts is crucial for achieving a green hydrogen economy through electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we report an excellent catalyst, one-dimensional NiS2/NiS/Mn2O3 nanofibers prepared by electrospinning, which exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance in an alkaline solution. We explored effective strategies to construct one-dimensional nanostructures and composite oxides to promote the electrocatalytic performance of transition metal dichalcogenides. At a current density of 20 mA cm−2, it requires an overpotential of 333 mV for OER. Furthermore, NiS2/NiS/Mn2O3 nanofibers maintain good durability even after 1000 cycles. The long-term electrochemical stability test of the catalyst NiS2/NiS/Mn2O3 was implemented at 20 mA cm−2 for 12 h. The potential remained at 99.52%. Therefore, this study demonstrates that NiS2/NiS/Mn2O3 can serve as a viable green hydrogen production electrocatalyst.

Hydrogen is regarded as an ideal energy carrier owing to the highest energy density, presenting the possibility of substituting for traditional fossil fuels. Nowadays, water splitting is significant in producing large-scale hydrogen. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics during anodic OER, caused by the four-electron transfer, has hindered this energy conversion strategy. Although IrO 2 and RuO 2 are currently the representative OER electrocatalysts, their high cost and unsatisfactory performance limit their commercial application. Numerous electrocatalysts, including oxides, hydroxides, high-entropy alloy, metal organic frameworks, and their hybrids, have been developed to address this issue. Among them, layered double hydroxides (LDH) have demonstrated outstanding performance due to their highly adjustable structure, powerful host-guest interaction, and single-atomic-like active sites. NiCo LDH has attracted significant attention because of its appropriate atomic and electronic structure, intrinsic active sites and defects, compared with single-type Ni-based or Co-based catalysts. However, to meet the requirements of industrial production, a simple and scalable method to synthesize electrocatalysts with favorable OER activity and stability is imperative. We propose a facile and scalable strategy to synthesize Ag-decorated NiCo LDH (Ag/NiCo LDH) by electrodeposition and subsequent spontaneous redox reaction. A spontaneous redox reaction driven by the difference in standard redox potential of reactants can be applied to prepare heterogeneous catalysts in consequence of the facile process, tight combination between substrate and decorated materials, and no supplementary energy input. Silver metal, with its appropriate standard redox potential, good conductivity, and low cost compared to Iridium and Ruthenium, serves as a suitable decorated material. This strategy provides several advantages, for example, Ⅰ) optimizing the electronic structure of Ni and Co by the charge transfer from Ni, Co to Ag; Ⅱ) exposing more active surface area because of the heterogeneous structure, Ⅲ) improving the charge transfer capacity owing to the excellent conductivity of Ag nanoparticles, Ⅳ) increasing the stability of NiCo LDH due to the tight combination of Ag and NiCo LDH, Ⅴ) lowering the catalysts' price compared with Iridium and Ruthenium. The synthesized Ag/NiCo LDH exhibits enhanced OER performance in 1M KOH electrolyte, achieving an overpotential of 440 mV at a current density of 1000 mA cm -2 geo , surpassing that of NiCo LDH (722 mV at 1000 mA cm -2 geo ). Surprisingly, Ag/NiCo LDH demonstrates exceptional durability, lasting over 425 h at 1000 mA cm -2 geo , an improvement of nearly eight-fold compared to NiCo LDH (50 h). This study provides a promising approach for developing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution.

Water electrolyzers, such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEM) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM) are important technologies for sustainable electrochemical energy conversion. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is a pivotal half-reaction in these systems. Despite substantial progress over the years, OER kinetics remain a major source of inefficiency in these devices, necessitating the development of stable catalysts. Currently, precious metal-based catalysts dominate the landscape of OER catalysts for these devices. As non-precious alternatives, nickel-iron (Ni/Fe) catalysts have emerged as particularly promising in alkaline conditions. However, they exhibit dynamic behavior during electrocatalysis—for instance, oxidizing to an active oxyhydroxide phase during the OER. This dynamic nature makes it challenging to establish clear structure-activity-stability relationships. Incorporating cobalt (Co) into the catalyst composition has been found to influence the activity and material conversion of mixed Ni-Fe-Co oxides and (oxy)hydroxides. Methods for rationally activating and stabilizing Ni-Fe-based catalysts via electrochemical and chemical (e.g. composition) routes are necessary for enhancing scalability and accessibility in hydrogen production devices. Herein, our goal is to understand and exploit activation protocols to enhance the OER performance of as-synthesized nickel-iron-cobalt metal thin films, addressing three primary objectives: synthesizing and characterizing homogeneous metal catalysts, investigating the impact of different potential ranges and scan rates on catalyst oxidation and surface conversion from the metal, and assessing how the addition of cobalt influences conversion rates and current density of the catalyst. We use cyclic voltammetry to facilitate and disentangle conversion (integrated reductive peak for Ni and/or Co 2+ → 3+ transition) and OER performance (current density (mA cm -2 ) at η = 350 mV). For all compositions tested of (Ni 80 Fe 20 ) 100-x Co x , x = 0 - 5 % we observe that the most effective conversion requires both redox and oxygen evolution. To further investigate the relationship between conversion and performance catalysts were tested in varying electrolytes such as 1M KOH, 0.1M KOH, and an ionomer overlayer to understand how these impacted conversion. Subsequently, post-analysis techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) were conducted to gain insights into the surface composition and elemental distribution of the catalysts following potential cycling. Additionally, electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS) was employed to quantify the faradaic efficiency of oxygen, providing an understanding of at what point the catalyst begins converting and how much of the OER current is directed towards OER versus metal conversion. This project advances the fundamental understanding of NiFeCo catalyst conversion, shedding light on the critical role of catalyst composition and investigating the conditions that foster optimal conversion efficiency. The use of physical vapor deposition for thin film catalysts offers distinct advantages, making deposition and scaling processes facile. This capability, coupled with the gained insights into conversion dynamics, sets the stage for in situ optimization of the surface to achieve the active oxyhydroxide phase with the highest performance for AEM water electrolysis.

Developments in onset potential estimation for oxygen evolution reaction seeks to overcome several disadvantages in existing methods. For example, in the current tangent intersection method from the Nonfaradaic to Faradaic region, the electrocatalyst with large pseudocapacitance shows a negative slope near the onset potential in the Nonfaradaic zone. In such systems, the intersection of tangents from the Nonfaradaic to Faradaic region fails to give the onset potential. Similarly, onset potential determination from the fixed current density (10 mA/cm 2 ) can be inaccurate for electrocatalysts having a large pseudocapacitive current. In addition, the commonly utilized methods do not provide insight into the underlying physicochemical properties that modulate reactivity around the onset potential. We propose an approach based on reaction mechanism analysis integrated with electrochemical impedance to detect the onset potential via the capacitance variation generated from the intermediate species of OER. We demonstrate our proposed method via experiments on oxygen evolution reaction in the acidic medium on platinum as the model system. The impedance analysis of such a system from the Nonfaradaic to Faradaic region shows the capacitance generated from the intermediate species (S-OH) shows the maxima at the onset potential. Further, the Tafel analysis showed the S-OH step as the rate-determining step (RDS) in a low overpotential region. Additionally, the onset potential obtained from the tangent intersection from the Nonfaradaic to Faradaic region matches that obtained from the impedance analysis. We are in the process of extending the proposed approach to more complex systems with multiple product evolutions.

The development of non-noble metal electrocatalyst with high-efficiency and clear underlying of the related reaction mechanism towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for large-scale hydrogen production. In this study, tri-metallic Prussian blue analogue (PBA) of FeCoNi-PBA was synthesized using a facile and low-energy consumption co-precipitation method. The FeCoNi-PBA was found to be etched by the high-pH 1 M KOH electrolyte such that under anodic applied potential during electrolysis the formation of metal (oxy)hydroxide is accelerated. Operando Raman and post-mortem characterizations reveal that the applied anodic potential promotes the phase transformation so that the PBA undergoes self-reconstruction to form metal (oxy)hydroxide embedded in a carbon matrix with fully exposed active sites. The metal (oxy)hydroxide serves as the real active sites while the carbon matrix is believed to enhance the conductivity and hydrophilicity, which facilitates the electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion to improve the OER performance. In alkaline media, FeCoNi-PBA demonstrates excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 236 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , small Tafel slope of 43.8 mV dec -1 , and long-term durability.

Metal phosphide-containing nanomaterials have demonstrated remarkable efficacy as non-precious metal-based catalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While it is widely acknowledged that various OER catalysts undergo structural reconstruction under applied OER potentials, monitoring these changes is challenging because they are often rapid and require instrumentation not typically found in the typical lab setting. In this study, we utilize operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to determine the structural reconstruction of nickel-based metal phosphide catalysts during OER. We have developed the synthesis of nickel-based phosphide nanoparticles with a range of phosphorus incorporation. These nanoparticles are composed of metallic nickel and amorphous nickel phosphide phases as determined by XRD, TEM and XAS. At low levels of P incorporation, from 2% to 15%, the synthesis results in the mixture of metallic nickel and amorphous phosphide phases. At higher levels of phosphorus incorporation, from 20% to 30%, amorphous nickel phosphide is the predominant phase. Electrochemical characterization of this nickel phosphide series for OER revealed that the catalysts with 20% phosphorus incorporation exhibited superior OER activity. The phosphides with lower phosphorus content, such as 2%, had smaller Ni 2+ /Ni 3+ redox peaks which has been shown to suppress the conversion to Ni(OH) 2 , leading to lowered OER activity. Increased amorphous nickel phosphide phase led to greater activity, suggesting that the active component in the catalyst comes from the amorphous nickel phosphide phase. Meanwhile, higher phosphorus content (20-30%) where the amorphous phosphide is the predominate phase resulted in larger redox peaks, signifying greater conversion to Ni(OH) 2 . Operando XAS will be applied to investigate these metallic nickel/nickel phosphide nanocatalysts to elucidate their structural reconstruction during OER

ABSTRACT Ni, Fe‐based nitrides have been widely studied for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, displaying electrocatalytic activities similar to Pt and other noble metal electrocatalysts. The incorporation of small amounts of Mo or W on these Ni, Fe‐based nitrides is expected to have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance of these materials, especially for the HER activity. In this work, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) with the empirical formula Ni 1+ x Fe 3− x − y A y N (A = Mo, W), were obtained in two steps: synthesis of the transition metal oxide precursors by an easy, one‐pot sol–gel polymerization method followed by nitridation under ammonia atmosphere to obtain the final TMNs. Their HER and OER catalytic performances in alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH solution) were studied and it was observed that the incorporation of small quantities of Mo or W in these Ni, Fe‐based nitrides (Ni 1+ x Fe 3− x − y A y N, where y = 0.1) results in improved HER and OER activities, especially in the TMN that contains W (i.e., Ni 1+ x Fe 2.9− x W 0.1 N), where the overpotentials were 348 mV for OER and 269 mV for HER. These values are lower than those obtained for Ni 1+ x Fe 3− x N, which are 395 mV for OER and 368 mV for HER.

Abstract This study presents the synthesis and characterization of hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon (HCN-900), demonstrating remarkable electrocatalytic performance for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), outperforming traditional catalysts like RuO₂ and Pt/C. HCN-900 exhibits an onset potential of 0.98 V and a half-wave potential of 0.85 V for ORR, closely matching Pt/C performance while achieving an electron transfer number of 4.0, indicative of a four-electron pathway. For OER, HCN-900 achieves a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² at an overpotential of 223 mV, significantly lower than RuO₂ (288 mV) and Pt/C (363 mV). The material also shows a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec⁻¹, indicating rapid kinetics and efficient electron transfer. This impressive performance is attributed to the optimized structural and electronic properties of HCN-900, including its high surface area, hierarchical porosity, and nitrogen doping, which enhance active site density and promote electron transport. Furthermore, HCN-900 retains approximately 96.72% of its initial performance after 10 hours of continuous operation, demonstrating excellent long-term stability. The comprehensive analysis highlights HCN-900 as a promising bifunctional catalyst for advanced energy applications, providing a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to conventional catalysts. Its superior electrocatalytic properties make HCN-900 an excellent candidate for integration into next-generation energy conversion and storage systems.

Lactiplantibacillus (Lb.) plantarum is known as a benign bacterium found in various habitats, including the intestines of animals and fermented foods. Since animal intestines lack oxygen, while fermented foods provide a limited or more oxygen environment, this study aimed to investigate whether there were genetic differences in the growth of Lb. plantarum under aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions. Genomic analysis of Lb. plantarum obtained from five sources—animals, dairy products, fermented meat, fermented vegetables, and humans—was conducted. The analysis included not only an examination of oxygen-utilizing genes but also a comparative pan-genomic analysis to investigate evolutionary relationships between genomes. The ancestral gene analysis of the evolutionary pathway classified Lb. plantarum into groups A and B, with group A further subdivided into A1 and A2. It was confirmed that group A1 does not possess the narGHIJ operon, which is necessary for energy production under limited oxygen conditions. Additionally, it was found that group A1 has experienced more gene acquisition and loss compared to groups A2 and B. Despite an initial assumption that there would be genetic distinctions based on the origin (aerobic or anaerobic conditions), it was observed that such differentiation could not be attributed to the origin. However, the evolutionary process indicated that the loss of genes related to nitrate metabolism was essential in anaerobic or limited oxygen conditions, contrary to the initial hypothesis.

The development of efficient, durable and commercially competitive catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is undoubtedly a challenging task for fuel cell technology. In this context, for the first time, we developed a bi-metallic heterogeneous nanocatalyst (NC) comprising high-density atomic SnO x -clusters anchored Pt-nanorods (denoted as SnO x @Pt) via formic acid reduction method (FAM) as a bifunctional catalyst for ORR and HER (Fig.1). The as-prepared SnO x @Pt nanorods exhibit unprecedented high mass activity (MA) of 160 mAmg -1 (Pt) at 0.85 V vs RHE in acidic ORR (0.5M HClO 4 ), which outperformed the commercial J.M.-Pt/C (20 wt.% Pt) catalyst by 1.4 folds. Of special relevance, SnO x @Pt nanorods exhibit remarkable durability when operated up to 5000 cycles in accelerated durability test (ADT) and retain their 87% MA as that of the initial condition. Additionally, as-prepared SnO x @Pt nanorods demonstrated a notable lower overpotential (η) of 48 mV at the cathodic current density of 10 mAcm -2 and the Tafel slope of 33 mVdec -1 in acidic HER (0.5M H 2 SO 4 ). These overpotential and Tafel slope values are significantly lower compared to commercial J.M.-Pt/C catalyst (η = 60 mV and Tafel slope = 38 mVdec -1 ). Moreover, such material retained its 100% performance in the chronoamperometric (CA) stability test up to 6h, which shows its capability in potential commercialization. The cross-referencing results of physical inspections and electrochemical analysis reveal that such a high-performance of SnO x @Pt nanorods is attributed to the local synergetic collaboration between SnO x modifiers and neighboring Pt active sites. More specifically, the SnO x modifiers promote the H-OH bond cleavage during HER, while simultaneously promotes the desorption of oxygen species on Pt surface in ORR, which later triggers the reduction reaction performances. Meanwhile, SnO x provides a shielding effect to Pt during harsh reduction conditions and thus high stability of SnO x @Pt nanorods is achieved. Of utmost importance, this study not only unveils a novel geometric design but also provides the mechanistic understanding behind the superior electrochemical properties of the unique SnO x modifiers in ORR and HER. Hence, we envision that the proposed rationale will be a forwarding step for the development of high-performance low Pt content catalysts for fuel cells with superior electrochemical properties far beyond the physical nature of transition elements.

The solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) has garnered significant attention over the past decades for hydrogen generation integrated with intermittent renewable energy [1]. However, a major hurdle in the commercialization of SOEC is cell degradation when operated beyond 1000 hours [2]. SOEC degrades two times more quickly than the same cell operated in fuel cell mode [3]. Perovskite oxygen electrodes (OEs), such as La 1-x Sr x Co 1-y Fe y O 3-δ (LSCF), exhibit flexible oxygen stoichiometry [4-6] depending on the operating conditions. The delamination failure in perovskite OEs arises from a mismatch between the slower O 2 evolution rate at the surface and the rapid O 2 current in the bulk from the electrolyte (EL), which causes variations in oxygen stoichiometry. This variation in oxygen stoichiometry enhances bonding, contracts lattice volume, and leads to chemical stress at the OE/EL interface [7]. In this research, we aim to construct an electro-chemo-mechanically coupled model with synthetic microstructures (Fig.1a) to explore the intricate interactions between delamination at the OE/EL interface and oxygen ion transport pathway evolution. The Dream 3D software will be utilized for microstructure generation, Matlab for mesh preparation, and Comsol for Multiphysics simulation. We will examine two OE configurations known for achieving high electrocatalytic activity [8]: single layer and bilayer OEs . For the single layer configuration, La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.4 Fe 0.6 O 3 (LSCF) [9, 10] serves as the sole electrode material. For bilayer OEs, we incorporate SrTa 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3 (SCT) [11, 12] as the capping layer for electrocatalytic activity, with LSCF acting as the supporting backbone. The evolution of two transport pathways (Fig.1b&c), double phase boundary (2PB) and tripe phase boundary (3PB), in different configurations during long-term degradation tests will be evaluated by coupling the models with experimental polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra. The investigations will focus on the effects of delamination resulting from lattice volume variations on shifting of transport pathways (Fig.1d) in different OE configurations.

Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) has been suggested to be an effective measure to assess the oxygen metabolism and viability of tissue at risk. The preliminary results in a monkey model of stroke demonstrated progressive OEF reduction in both grey matter and white matter after pMCAO, in agreement with the neuron loss and fiber denegation as indicated by diffusion MRI indices following stroke. The findings suggest QSM derived OEF could provide additional information about the oxygen metabolism of the tissue and may be used to assess the ischemia-induced damage of the brain during acute stroke.

Due to scarcity of Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) widely used in low temperature water electrolysis as cathodes (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction; HER) and anodes (Oxygen Evolution Reaction; OER) a boosting interest to their substitution to Earth abundant elements is observed. It was successfully demonstrated that elements like iron, nickel, cobalt and other (in their oxide and hydroxide forms) can be effective OER catalysts when operate at high pH ranges from 12 to 14 [1-3]. This work is devoted to systematic investigation of influence of third element addition to NiFeO x system on a performance and stability of catalysts in alkaline OER. As a co-catalytic elements Mo and Co were selected, based on our previous experience [4,5]. A systematic study on an effect of NiFe-to-M ratio, concentration of precipitation agent and post-treatment temperature were evaluated in a wide range of parameters. Taking into account that mass loading of PGM-free OER catalysts is substantially higher than iridium/ruthenium once and can be up to several milligrams per cm 2 all experiments were designed to be scalable. In a laboratory scale reactor, a fascinating batch size of 25g was achieved, using minimal amount of water-based solvents in order to minimize a waste stream generated. Presentation will discuss characterization of obtained materials by SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD and other methods as well as their performance, stability and durability in alkaline conditions, studying Oxygen Evolution Reaction.

Structural degradation of oxide electrodes during the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a major challenge in water electrolysis. Although the OER is known to induce changes in the surface layer, little is known about its effect on the bulk of the electrocatalyst and its overall phase stability.

Hydrogen has been identified as a sustainable energy source for the future with the potential of replacing fossil fuels due to its high gravimetric energy density and zero carbon emissions. Water electrolysis is a promising approach to the clean production of pure hydrogen, however, the benchmark catalysts of the half reactions of water electrolysis are noble-metal based, which limit the application of this technique. 1 As well, the high energy barrier and sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction limit the efficiency of the system. Therefore, it is crucial to develop robust, stable, and cost-effective materials for water electrolysis to be scalable. Lanthanum transition-metal oxide electrocatalysts have been pursued in the past for water splitting due to the high abundance of lanthanum and transition metals. 2 However, these catalysts suffer from low conductivity and inherent instability towards oxygen evolution. Binary sulfides, selenides, and phosphides have also been pursued, 3 but the compositional space of these materials is limited. Ternary sulfides offer a wider compositional space that allows fine-tuning for optimal performance. As a result, we have pursued the synthesis and application of the relatively unexplored ternary chalcogenides, LaMS 3 (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn) towards water electrolysis. The efficiency of water electrolysis and stability of the materials have been tested with linear sweep voltammetry, galvanostatic measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We found these materials to be active towards both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively, with the catalysts exhibiting an activity trend where LaNiS 3 > LaCoS 3 > LaFeS 3 > LaMnS 3 . For HER, LaNiS 3 exhibits an overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mAcm -2 with a Tafel slope of 79 mV/decade. For OER, an overpotential of 373 mV at 10 mAcm -2 and a low Tafel slope of 48 mV/decade are observed. In addition, LaNiS 3 proved to be highly stable with minimal change in potential over a period of 18 hours. The high activity and stability of LaNiS 3 towards both half reactions of water electrolysis make it a promising candidate for a bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst.

Electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a pivotal role in the hydrogen economy. Optimizing materials for this reaction presents a significant challenge, as many highly active materials exhibit low stability during activation and/or operation. Therefore, operando methods capable of probing catalyst structure and morphology become key tools for monitoring transformations during operation. These transformations not only determine activity but also influence long-term stability. In this context, high-energy X-rays provide a valuable probe, easily penetrating electrolytes and cell walls, offering unprecedented insight into material behavior. This contribution presents several classes of OER catalysts operating in alkaline and acidic environments, with their structural transformations studied using high-energy synchrotron scattering techniques. Layered double hydroxides (LDH) represent an important class of catalysts functioning in alkaline environments. Notably, NiFe and CoFe serve as exemplary materials due to their high activity and stability. However, in many cases, the structure during the OER reaction differs from the as-prepared materials, undergoing an α-phase to γ-phase transition, where the latter is the active phase. This transition, at times reversible with potential, is challenging to observe without high-energy wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) techniques [1,2]. Another interesting example involves the origin of high activity in spinel-type Co 3 O 4 thin film catalysts, elucidated by high-energy surface X-ray diffraction (HE-SXRD). Here, the superior performance is attributed to the formation of a 3D CoO x (OH) y active phase skin layer during activation, and its thickness defines the final activity [3]. In the case of catalysts operating in an acidic environment, RuO x and IrO x are acknowledged as promising materials. While RuOx exhibits high activity, it is prone to instability, whereas IrO x , although stable, demonstrates lower activity and have significantly higher price. A prevailing trend is to create solid solution alloys of Ir and Ru to capitalize on the strengths of both materials [4]. This contribution details structural investigations of a series of IrRu alloys with varying compositions prepared through DC magnetron sputtering. The study investigates the unusual stability of these materials at high current densities using operando WAXS and a custom-built electrolyzer cell [5]. The findings reveal that these alloys undergo Ru dissolution upon activation, forming a thin amorphous IrOx layer that protects the alloy underneath. The stability is defined by this layer, while the activity is mainly determined by the electronic structure of the IrRu alloy core. The examples presented are a reminder that without operando characterization of the materials it is very difficult to ascribe origins of activity and stability, as the ex-situ characterization might be misleading regarding the structure and electronic structure of the active phase.

Hydrogen has the potential to revolutionise how we produce and consume energy. We can meet energy demands without compromising the environment by using renewable sources such as wind, solar and wave power producing low-cost electricity to split the water molecule into its constituent parts. We could then convert Hydrogen back to electricity using a fuel cell, as illustrated in Figure 1. The by-product in this entire process is water, giving a clean technology with no toxic or greenhouses gases. Currently the best performing electrocatalytic materials for water splitting are noble metal based, namely platinum for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Ruthenium for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The use of these materials is unsustainable and makes fuel cells too expensive for commercial applications. We must engineer sustainable, cost-effective alternatives. Nickel foam electrodes display desirable electrocatalytic properties such as a large surface area compared to volume with highly conducting, porous networks, while transition metal dichalcogenides show very good electronic properties with high surface areas and large active sites. In this work we show that it is possible to electrochemically and solvothermally produce CoSe x and CoSe x composites on a porous nickel foam electrode (NFE). The best performing materials were selected and evaluated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This analysis showed high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) values and good stability across the selected materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images reveal that the surfaces of the synthesized materials exhibit distinct morphologies and have been significantly modified. Further electrochemical evaluation of the materials reveals low overpotentials for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) thus showing promise as a potential bi-functional electrocatalyst in overall water splitting.

Water electrolysis is a highly promising technology for hydrogen production, generating green hydrogen with no greenhouse gas emissions. The water electrolysis reaction involves two half-reactions: hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. While oxygen evolution in water electrolysis involves a four-electron transfer requiring higher overpotential and thus leading to energy consumption. Urea electrolysis offers lower theoretical energy consumption than water electrolysis, making them a key technology in future electrolytic hydrogen production processes. Conventional anodic catalysts, such as Ir and Ru, exhibit good performance in oxygen evolution, but being precious metals, they face limitations due to high cost and limited abundance. Its is crucial to find an active, durable and cost-effective anode catalyst for realistic application. Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials, due to their high porosity, large surface area, and unique structural features, have emerged as promising materials for water electrolysis. However, their relatively poor stability is a drawback that needs to be overcome. In herein, we design the mixed ligand strategy for synthesizing the MOF materials. Ferrocene-based ligands, ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (Fd), combing with terephthalic acid (H 2 BDC) as the mixed ligands for this study. The MOF catalysts, namely Ni-BDC and Ni-BDC-Fd, was synthesized using a simple one-step hydrothermal method with ferrocenedicarboxylic acid and terephthalic acid. Raman spectra revealed the presence of Fe-O, originating from the iron in Fd, demonstrating a structural transformation during the hydrothermal process. XRD analysis also confirmed the existence of FeO. The SEM images showed nanosheets and nanoneedles morphologies for Ni-BDC, while a dense nanofiber structure for Ni-BDC-Fd demonstrating the effect of 2 nd ligand on the MOF structure. Electrochemical tests were conducted in 1 M KOH electrolyte and 1 M KOH + 0.5 M urea electrolyte, including oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The overall reaction comprising the same catalysts for the anode and the cathode side is performed to examine the real electrolysis performance. Results showed that the addition of Fd enhanced OER and UOR activity in alkaline and urea electrolytes. Ni-BDC-Fd achieved 1.483 V vs. RHE and 1.386 V vs. RHE at 65 mA/cm -2 driving potential for OER and UOR, respectively, requiring a smaller potential than Ni-BDC to achieve the same current density. To verify that the performance improvement was not solely due to iron, NiFe-BDC was synthesized by adding iron nitrate, showing inferior UOR performance compared to Ni-BDC-Fd but superior OER performance to NiFe-BDC. This indicated that the performance improvement resulted from structural changes rather than just the presence of iron atoms. Ni-BDC-Fd exhibited the lowest Tafel slope in OER, indicating a faster reaction rate due to the increased active surface area during OER. After continuous catalysis for 80 hours in the alkaline water electrolysis cell and urea electrolysis cell, a significant improvement in the loss of potential was observed. These results suggest that the addition of ferrocene dicarboxylic acid altered the structure of Ni-BDC, maintaining an appropriate interlayer distance. This not only enhanced its catalytic performance but also improved its catalytic stability, demonstrating a promising strategy for preparing metal-organic framework materials for electrocatalysis applications.

The rapid increase in global energy demands and environmental awareness regarding the excessive use of fossil fuel has spurred significant academic interest in the development of alternative energy conversion and storage technologies that prioritize both efficiency and environmental sustainability. Among all kinds of renewable energy, hydrogen energy holds the potential to create a carbon free clean society, and a possible solution to the environmental issues. 1 Electrochemical water splitting is considered as a greener approach for pure H 2 , which involved cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The anodic OER is kinetically sluggish and considered as a rate determining step of the water splitting reaction. Therefore, it is necessary to develop OER catalysts with high activities. Perovskite oxides knows as a promising oxygen electrode catalyst due to their low cost, flexibility, and tailorable properties. However, most perovskite oxides possess poor electrical conductivity at room temperatures, and this limits their oxygen catalytic activity. In our work Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co x Fe 1-x O 3-δ (BSCF) catalysts with different cobalt and iron amounts where X=0, 0.2, 0.8, 1 were synthesized and investigated by time zero analysis and flow rate infinitization analysis which are electrochemical testing method that uses pressure to remove generated oxygen gas bubbles and provides accurate activity of the catalyst. 2 We find the volcano plot of the Fe amount and the OER activities, showing samples with X=0.8 have the best OER activities as Figure 1 . Electronic structure of B-Site transition metal elements, oxygen vacancies, crystal structures and electrical conductivity are the key factors for determining the activities of Perovskite catalysts in OER. 3 Also it is quite important to determine the real active sites during the OER process by using advance operando techniques. Therefore, in order to investigate the in-depth mechanism of OER activities of Perovskite catalysts, the newly designed operando soft X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) cells was utilized to analyze the subtle change as shown in Figure 2 on the oxygen K -edge (531 eV - 532 eV). Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3-δ has the most obvious changes in integral surface area at the O K -edge pre-edge region, which leads to the best activity among other BSCF samples. According to the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy and Lattice Oxygen Evolution Mechanism, ions on the A sites (Ba 2+ ,Sr 2+ ) tend to dissolve and ions on the B sites (Co, Fe) are forming hydroxides (BOOH).

High-valent cobalt oxides play a pivotal role in alternative energy technology as catalysts for water splitting and as cathodes in lithium-ion batteries. Despite this importance, the properties governing the stability of high-valent cobalt oxides and specifically possible oxygen evolution pathways are not clear. One root of this limited understanding is the scarcity of high-valent Co(IV)-containing model complexes; there are no reports of stable, well-defined complexes with multiple Co(IV) centers. Here, an oxidatively robust fluorinated ligand scaffold enables the isolation and crystallographic characterization of a Co(IV)

Electrochemical water splitting on noble metal surface is an important reaction of both fundamental and application interest. It is well known that the bottleneck of this reaction is the poor kinetics for oxygen generation from water oxidation. Despite of years study, the mechanisms in terms of the roles of the thin oxides film that formed on the metal surface before/during oxygen evolution are still inexplicit. One of the main reasons is the lack of molecular level information about the oxide thin film structures. In this study, we investigated the electrochemical oxidation of gold and platinum in solutions with different pHs by employing surface specific vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) 1-3 . By analyzing the potential dependent behaviors of different types of adsorbed species, we could gain molecular level information regarding the structures and formation mechanisms of metal-oxides. The results of this study will provide essential data toward understanding the oxygen evolution mechanism and also suggest strategies for developing better water splitting catalysts. [1]. Zhang, I.

Rechargeable Zn‐air batteries offer the advantages of environmental friendliness, safety, low prices and high energy density, and are highly valued. However, the major challenge faced by rechargeable Zn‐air batteries nowadays is the low energy efficiency due to the slow reaction kinetics of electrocatalyst at the air cathode. Bifunctional catalysts are key to the development of Zn‐air batteries by improving their overall performance and long‐term cycling stability. Metal‐organic framework (MOF) materials have shown great benefits as oxygen electrocatalysts in promoting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This paper reviews the recent advances of three kinds of MOF materials as bifunctional catalysts for rechargeable Zn‐air batteries. Additionally, this paper also discusses the synthetic design strategy of MOF composite derivatives, and concludes by suggesting the application of MOF materials in the field of rechargeable Zn‐air batteries.

Designing high-entropy oxyhydroxides (HEOs) electrocatalysts with controlled nanostructures is vital for efficient and stable water-splitting electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel HEOs material (FeCoNiWCuOOH@Cu) containing five non-noble metal elements derived by electrodeposition on a 3D double-continuous porous Cu support is created. This support, prepared via the liquid metal dealloying method, offers a high specific surface area and rapid mass/charge transfer channels. The resulting high-entropy FeCoNiWCuOOH nanosheets provide a dense distribution of active sites. The heterostructure between Cu skeletons and FeCoNiWCuOOH nanosheets enhances mass transfer, electronic structure coupling, and overall structural stability, leading to excellent activities in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and water splitting reaction.

Water-splitting semiconductor photocatalysts require hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cocatalysts, the majority of which are robust metals and metal oxides. Metal complexes feature designability and reaction selectivity. This feature should be appreciated in the application as HER cocatalysts by suppressing unfavorable back reactions; however, low stability hampers their application. In this research, we demonstrate that a fully π-conjugated and conductive two-dimensional metal–organic framework (2D MOF), which possesses both virtues of metals/metal oxides and metal complexes, serves as an ideal HER cocatalyst candidate. NiBHT, a kind of 2D MOF, is deposited on the photocatalyst SrTiO 3 :Al with CoO x as an oxygen evolution cocatalyst to show long-term overall one-step water splitting with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 6.5% at 350 nm. In comparison to Pt as a representative HER cocatalyst, NiBHT turns out to be a suppressor of back reactions related to oxygen reduction reactions, which is proven both experimentally and theoretically.

The scarcity of fuels due to the growing energy demand has encouraged research into topics such as energy conversion with materials that can take advantage of solar energy. Such situations have promote the emergence of various new materials to assist reactions of special interest such as oxygen reactions. (Oxygen Reduction Reaction, ORR and Oxygen Evolution Reaction, OER). Thus, numerous materials are emerging with the photoelectrocatalytic activity towards OER and ORR reactions. To evaluate the photo-assisted OER requires technical conditions that a rotating disk electrode (RDE) does not satisfy. In this work we present an alternative technique to RDE by adapting a flow in a microfluidic platform to satisfy the limit current while it can be irradiated and thus evaluate the photoelectocatalysis of a semiconductor that has the characteristic of a photoelectrocatalyst. To make the comparison, a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was used using the Pt/C system in a three-electrode cell designed with a microfluidic channel where we found that the mass flow is comparable to rpm.

Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co‐corrole‐based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP‐2‐OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2 = 0.91 V vs RHE and OER with h10 = 255 mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

Water splitting is an area of research which is of pressing interest in addressing climate change. Water splitting provides oxygen and hydrogen as products, with hydrogen finding use as a potential high-density fuel to replace fossil fuels. Water splitting manifests as two half-cell reactions, namely the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction. The purpose of this project is to synthesise a bifunctional electrocatalyst to use in the water splitting reaction, replacing the rare and expensive transition metals catalysts currently in use such as platinum and ruthenium. The ideal material would exhibit strong performance for both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this project, Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) have been synthesised for use in water splitting. LDHs are a group of ionic compounds characterised by their layered structure of positively charged sheets and an interlayer region consisting of the corresponding anions. LDHs typically contain a bivalent and a trivalent metal as part of the generic formula [M 2+ 1–x M 3+ x (OH) 2 ][A n– ] x/n ·zH 2 O. In this project the bivalent metal in use is typically cobalt and the trivalent metal is typically iron. The synthesis developed is a simple, one pot hydrothermal synthesis which can be seen in Figure 1. In this synthesis, the process begins with the precursor materials dissolved in solution. These solutions are mixed and stirred until homogenous. The resultant solution is then heated to form an impure product. Following washing steps and centrifugation a purified powder product is obtained. A variety of metallic salts have been tested for their use in these LDHs with the optimum LDHs selected for further study. The metallic salts used to provide the metals for the LDHs are typically hydrated transition metal nitrates. The LDHs have been characterised and their structure confirmed by a variety of analytical techniques including X-Ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Simple qualitative analysis has been performed with FTIR spectroscopy. These LDHs have been immobilised on a variety of porous, high surface area materials, including nickel foam and copper foam, to enhance the properties seen in the screening study. These materials allow synthesis of high surface area, reactive electrocatalysts. To enhance the stability of the LDHs, carbon materials have been integrated with the LDHs. Examination of a variety of carbon materials involved post-synthesis mixing of the carbon material and the LDH product or inclusion of the carbon material in the LDH synthesis to form a composite. A variety of carbon materials have been analysed including graphene oxide, carbon black and carbon nanotubes. Figure 1

Electrochemical ozone production (EOP) is a promising green alternative route for ozone generation with applications in advanced oxidation processes and electro-organic synthesis. Nickel and antimony doped tin oxide (NATO) is a promising EOP active catalyst due to its high selectivity, low cost, and relative lack of toxicity. The origin of high EOP selectivity on NATO is disputed, given that the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is thermodynamically favored due to its lower thermodynamic potential. In this work, we build on previous reports to establish the mechanism of EOP on NATO electrodes and explain the role of dopants in the anode. Additionally, we attribute the lack of electrode stability to the corrosion of the catalyst. Finally, based on our results, we introduce and verify a design framework for inducing EOP activity in tin oxide electrodes.

Affordable nitrogen and fluorine co‐doped carbon nanostructure was prepared from the hazardous industrial waste of edible oil refinery, spent bleaching earth (SBE), and used as raw material for obtaining high‐performance non‐noble metal bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Waste SBE contains 35 per cent residue non‐saturated oil as a carbon source and the assistance of montmorillonite (MMT) as the template. This study converts waste SBE into a fluorine‐doped carbon nanostructure through a pyrolysis process followed by removing the aluminosilicate layers of the MMT by HF etching. Furthermore, the impregnation of the support with Co and Fe nitrates readily gives rise to N, F co‐doped carbon (NFC) electrocatalysts, as confirmed by XPS analysis. Electrochemical results evidenced that the Co‐NFC catalyst proved to be a valuable bifunctional competitor for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media, showing activity in both reactions and superior stability compared with the Fe‐NFC catalyst in accelerated tests. This work offers a straightforward, economical and eco‐friendly strategy for designing N, F co‐doped carbon‐based electrocatalysts for oxygen reactions in electrochemical devices.

Tailoring the structure of the electrified interface and the electrocatalytically active sites at the atomic and molecular levels is key to elucidating the design principles to develop advanced materials for sustainable energy conversion and storage. This talk will focus on recent strategies to tune the structure-activity-selectivity relationships for oxygen, carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide and methane electrocatalysis to produce renewable fuels. First, I will present our work toward understanding and tuning the structure-property relations for oxygen evolution for the production of green hydrogen in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers. Then, I will show our model studies on well-defined Cu-based surfaces to understand structure-properties relations for the electrochemcial CO 2 reduction reaction. We have investigated the effect of electrolyte, pH, and potential dependence for CO reduction on Cu single crystals as well as methods to evaluate the facet distribution on Cu-based catalysts. Finally, I will discuss some strategies for selective oxidation reactions such as partial oxidation of methane to produce liquid fuels such as methanol.

Renewable energy needs to be store in different energy forms for the energy transition away from fossil fuels. One of most promising forms is chemicals such as H 2 and C-based fuels obtained via electrochemical reactions. The common hinderance in such reactions is the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which causes low energy efficiency in conversion devices. Developing highly active, earth-abundant OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media is necessary to boost the performance of such devices. Fe ion content in electrolyte is known to influence the OER-activity of metal oxide electrocatalysts. For example, the Fe incorporation in NiOOH is a well-established and important effect for OER.[1] Here, we present the effect of absorbed Fe on the OER activity of the epitaxial Ni-surface terminated LaNiO 3 thin films. The correlation between surface species and OER activity of electrocatalysts was investigated using surface-sensitive low-energy ion scattering and X-ray photoemission spectroscopies. We observe more than an order-of-magnitude boost in OER activity during initial cycling, from 0.15 mAcm -2 to 3.40 mAcm -2 at 1.60 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The activity increase was mainly caused by the incorporation of up to 5 % Fe at the top surface of LaNiO 3 film (less than ~1 nm) even though only a very trace amount of Fe ion, 30 ppb, is present in the 0.1 M electrolyte of high purity KOH 99.99 %. Our results demonstrate that the disordered active surface phase, which develops even on single crystalline surfaces, is a complex interplay between the as-prepared (surface) crystalline structure, composition of the solid electrocatalyst and the liquid electrolyte, and has strong impact on the final OER activity, implying that we need to think differently about the crystalline electrocatalysts: crystalline bulk and dynamically changing surface layer.

The search of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline and acidic electrolytes is the key to enable the commercialization of electrolyzers and low hydrogen production price. However, there is a trade-off between activity and stability for catalysts due to the highly oxidative condition of OER, which induces the surface restructuring in electrocatalysts. This presentation will show couple of cases, including (Co, Ni)S x and SrIrO 3 -based catalysts, go through irreversible restructuring and form (metal)stable phases that exhibit higher activity (better than commercial standards IrO 2 and RuO 2 ) and better stability. Using in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and other characterizations, we reveal the true catalyst phases that all contain octahedral oxide clusters, which are responsible for the improved activity and stability. The strategy to design and scale up such active phases will also be discussed.

The design and synthesis of low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) photoelectrocatalysts endowed with high activity and durability is of utmost importance for sustainable energy generation via solar-assisted water splitting. In this regard, and in the framework of our recent activities, we have focused on the electrophoretic deposition of graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) specimens containing dispersed NiO nanoaggregates on carbon cloth substrates. In the present study, the attention is devoted to the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization of a representative gCN–NiO specimen. In particular, we provide an analysis of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ni 2p regions, discussing in detail the main spectral features. The obtained results, that provide evidence for a direct electronic interplay between the single material components, may serve as a useful comparison for additional research on analogous materials for energy and environmental applications.

Abstract Metal oxides with spinel structure have garnered increasing attention as promising alternatives to noble metal‐based electrocatalysts. However, these electrocatalysts often fail to simultaneously exhibit high activity and stability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), limiting their applications in electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, crystalline/amorphous heterogeneous interfaces are successfully introduced into spinel NiCo 2 O 4 nanosheets, which are grown in situ on carbon cloth (CC), denoted as NiCo 2 O 4 ‐B‐CC. The amorphous/crystalline heterostructures combine the advantages of both phases in electrocatalysts. The amorphous phase of the spinel NiCo 2 O 4 nanosheets modulates the electron density, provides abundant oxygen single vacancies as active sites, and enhances the corrosion resistance, while the crystalline phase improves conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate the influence of surface oxygen single vacancy (SV O ) on the activity of the OER and HER processes. The NiCo₂O₄‐B‐CC exhibits overpotentials of only 26 mV for HER and 215 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . It exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for water splitting, achieving a current density of 400 mA cm −2 at an applied voltage of 2.0 V. The construction of crystalline/amorphous heterogeneous interfaces in electrocatalysts provides novel approach for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of metal oxides in water splitting.

It is important to develop bifunctional catalysts with high activity and stability for reversible oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in lithium-oxygen (Li-O 2 ) batteries. Recently, the iron phthalocyanine (FePc) complex has been considered a promising candidate for bifunctional (ORR/OER) O 2 catalysts due to its low cost, high catalytic properties, and ease of preparation. In this work, two different structural types of FePc-based solution-phase catalysts as soluble redox mediators (SRMs) and solid FePc immobilized on pyridine-functional carbon supports (multi-walled carbon nanotube, MWCNT and graphene, GR) are investigated to evaluate the influence of FePc structural design on their catalytic activity and kinetics. Our work demonstrated that FePc (solid) /Py/MWCNT exhibited better bifunctional catalytic activity than FePc (solid) /Py/GR in the same electrolyte because of the stronger axial bonding between FePc (solid) and Py/MWCNT. The combination of FePc (solid) /Py/MWCNT and FePc (sol) displays the best cyclability, which can be attributed to the highly efficient solid-liquid interface. Moreover, FePc (solid) /Py/MWCNT without FePc (sol) shows the lowest overpotential owing to the surface-grown thin film Li 2 O 2 is structurally less order than the solution-grown toroidal Li 2 O 2 .

The scalable fabrication of cost-efficient bifunctional catalysts with enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance plays a significant role in overall water splitting in hydrogen production fields. MoSe2 is considered to be one of the most promising candidates because of its low cost and high catalytic activity. Herein, hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon networks were constructed to enhance the catalytic activity of the MoSe2-based materials by scalable free-drying combined with an in situ selenization strategy. The rationally designed carbonaceous network-encapsulated MoSe2 composite (MoSe2/NC) endows a continuous honeycomb-like structure. When utilized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER, the MoSe2/NC electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. Significantly, the MoSe2/NC‖MoSe2/NC cells require a mere 1.5 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH. Ex situ characterizations and electrochemical kinetic analysis reveal that the superior catalytic performance of the MoSe2/NC composite is mainly attributed to fast electron and ion transportation and good structural stability, which is derived from the abundant active sites and excellent structural flexibility of the honeycomb-like carbon network. This work offers a promising pathway to the scalable fabrication of advanced non-noble bifunctional electrodes for highly efficient hydrogen evolution.

The development of stable non-noble metal bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential for technologies such as reversible metal air batteries. We have shown that synthesis of high entropy alloy nanoparticles formed through a novel synthesis method where metal precursor containing aqueous nanodroplets freely diffusing in an emulsion solution, collide with an electrode surface and the metal precursors are reduced, thus forming a homogeneous particle containing the predetermined metal composition. Afterwards, the particles are annealed at a low temperature causing a phase separation of the metals, forming a metal nanoparticle that is surrounded by a stabilizing metal oxide. We have demonstrated that equimolar Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, and Mn solutions produce bifunctional FeNiCo metal nanoparticles surrounded by CrMnOx that are very active for both OER and ORR. The synthesis technique also affords the flexibility to tailor composition of the nanoparticles and potentially provide access to previously difficult to synthesize compositions and may alter the electrocatalytic reaction pathways and activities.

Water-in-salt electrolytes are a common technique used to minimize the amount of free water in solution by including high concentrations of salts, thus solvating the water molecules and lowering activity of the solution. This expands the electrochemical window in which deposition is possible and minimizes unnecessary hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in the electrodeposition system by reducing available protons. Lithium chlorine (LiCl) is a common salt for this purpose due to low costs. However, in the LiCl electrolyte, the necessary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) competes with chlorine evolution, which increases water activity and is visually identifiable with a color change from clear to yellow. When chloride ions are depleted, further deposition is no longer possible, and the electrolyte breaks down. A solution to this issue is using membranes to isolate the anode and cathode, thus preventing the chlorine evolution reaction from occurring. Since rhenium is a system with a small electrochemical window, possible oxide intermediates, and an overpotential for hydrogen evolution, the system requires the use of a stable water-in-salt electrolyte for elongated deposition. In this experiment, three membranes were examined to compare the impact on rhenium depositions in an H-cell. To compare the impact of each membrane, the change of pH of the DI side of the H-cell was monitored across time alongside the volume changes on both sides of the H-cell as a function of time due to LiCl inclusion. The quality and thicknesses of the coatings was examined by SEM as well as the impact on the morphologies of the rhenium of the deposits between each of the membranes.

Green hydrogen production through renewable energy-based water electrolysis is the most efficient technology for decarbonization, and demand has recently been rapidly increasing. Addressing this surge in demand requires the rapid development of reliable large-scale manufacturing methods for PEMWE membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs). For reliable large-scale manufacturing, it is necessary to optimize electrode components, including catalysts, binders, solvents, and additives, as well as their dispersion methods. Particularly, ensuring the homogeneity and stability of the electrode slurry is crucial. In this study, we enhanced the stability of the electrode slurry to twice and five times that of the existing standard by selecting an appropriate dispersion method for the metal-oxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst and by adjusting the OER catalyst (both support and particle size control), respectively. Additionally, we secured stable electrode coating characteristics by controlling the solvent composition and additives, based on the rheology of the slurry. By optimizing the composition, formulation, and preparation method of the electrode slurry to form an optimal catalyst layer, we achieved a 20% improvement in performance compared to commercial MEA products.

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has recently emerged as a highly promising and versatile electrocatalyst for water splitting, a pivotal process in the realm of renewable energy conversion. This review comprehensively explores the multifaceted aspects of PEDOT's electrocatalytic prowess, covering its intrinsic properties, synthetic methodologies, catalytic mechanisms, and practical applications in the context of water electrolysis. PEDOT, [C 2 H 4 O 2 C 4 H 2 S] n a conductive polymer, exhibits unique features that render it particularly suitable for electrocatalysis. With its excellent electrical conductivity, notable stability, and facile synthesis, PEDOT stands out among its counterparts. These attributes make PEDOT an attractive candidate for addressing the challenges associated with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the two half-reactions constituting water splitting. One of the key advantages of PEDOT lies in its high surface area, which allows for increased active sites for catalysis. The tunable redox states of PEDOT further contribute to its electrocatalytic versatility, enabling tailored catalytic performance through controlled doping and modifications. The efficient charge transport properties of PEDOT are crucial for facilitating electron transfer during the electrocatalytic processes, ensuring high catalytic activity. This review delves into the simple fabrication of PEDOT-based electrocatalysts. Researchers have explored various strategies, including morphological control, doping with heteroatoms, and integration into composite materials, to enhance the catalytic performance of PEDOT. The rational design of PEDOT structures has demonstrated the potential to surpass the limitations of traditional electrocatalysts and unlock new avenues for efficient water splitting. In elucidating the mechanistic aspects of PEDOT's catalytic activity, the review investigates the intricate interplay of surface interactions, redox reactions, and mass transport phenomena. Understanding the fundamental principles governing PEDOT's electrocatalytic behavior is essential for optimizing its performance and guiding further developments in this burgeoning field. Simple electrodeposition method is carried out to polymerize EDOT. Cyclic voltammetry method was used for synthesizing PEDOT on nickel foam. Then the sample was heated at differnet temperatures. Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) Overpotential: An overpotential of 170 mV at 10 mA/cm² is observed for the HER which indicates that PEDOT as an effective in catalyzing the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas. A lower overpotential implies that PEDOT facilitates the electrochemical reaction at a lower energy input, showcasing its efficiency as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen production. Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) Overpotential: The PEDOT exhibits an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA/cm² for the OER which suggests its enhanced performance in catalyzing the oxidation of water to produce oxygen gas. While this overpotential is higher than that for the HER, it is still within a range that indicates good catalytic activity for the challenging OER. Surpassing Many Catalyst Behaviors: PEDOT's performance, as indicated by its low overpotentials, exceeds that of many other catalysts commonly used for water splitting reactions. This could include traditional metal-based catalysts or other conductive polymers, highlighting PEDOT's potential as a superior electrocatalyst. More electrochemical studies have been taken to prove practical application for PEDOT while the reported overpotentials are promising, and additional research and experimentation are being conducted to validate and understand PEDOT's practical application in real-world scenarios. This involve studying its stability over time, scalability, and compatibility with alkaline electrolyte systems and operational conditions. Figure 1

Electrochemical water splitting is a promising way of generating hydrogen for future sustainable green energy source technology options to replace nonrenewable and environmentally pollutant hydrocarbon energy sources. However, due to its high overpotential in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and low-value product O 2 , some candidate anodic reactions with low potential should be proposed to replace OER, such as alcohol oxidation. Unlike fuel cell applications, partial oxidation is preferred to achieve high-value products rather than complete oxidation. For this purpose, we design a synergistic effect Pt 1 -W site on the dual-doped TiO 2 support (Ti 0.8 W 0.2 N x O y ) to catalyze alkaline methanol oxidation and gain 90% selectivity of formate production. Comparing the case of the Pt nanoparticles (69% selectivity of formaldehyde), the Pt single-atom catalyst controls selectivity and enhances the reactivity and stability attributed to the strong catalyst-support interaction. As a result, this work shows a novel strategy for electrochemical hydrogen production at far lower anodic potential by designing a stable and efficient Pt-based single-atom catalyst.

Ensuring the efficiency of an electrocatalyst under non-ambient conditions especially at high temperature, is crucial for their facile integration in industrial electrolysers. Varying temperatures governs the thermodynamic and kinetics aspects of water electrolysis by altering reactions rates, conductivity, and adsorption-desorption mechanism. This directly impacts the extent of hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). This study demonstrates that the Cu-doped trimetallic NiCoLDHs nanocatalysts shows significant improvement in overpotential ~20% and 10% for OER, and HER, respectively, compared to room temperature electrolysis. Further, to evaluate the effect of elevated temperatures on the kinetics of HER/OER, activation energies were calculated. For HER, the activation energy was found to be 14.4 kJ mol -1 , while for OER, it was ~23 kJ mol -1 . Density functional theory calculations were carried out to determine the electronic and band structure of the electrocatalysts. The results explains the reasons of increase in their electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity for HER/OER at elevated temperatures. References: Santos et al., ACS Appl. Mater.

High-temperature solid oxide water electrolysis is a highly efficient and carbon-free technology employed for energy conversion, offering numerous advantages over traditional low-temperature water electrolysis methods. These benefits include fast electrode kinetics without the need for Pt group metals and the potential to operate in reversible regimes (fuel cell/steam electrolysis), attributed to the elevated operating temperature (i.e., 600-800 °C). However, the high operating temperature imposes stringent material requirements. While recent attention has been directed towards developing and characterizing new materials for both electrodes and electrolytes, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms remains incomplete, hindering the further advancement of the solid oxide cells. Despite the emergence of more advanced materials in recent years, the lanthanum-strontium-manganite La 1-x Sr x MnO 3-δ (LSM) remains to be widely used for an oxygen electrode construction. This preference is due to its cost-effectiveness, high electrical conductivity, thermal and chemical stability, and compatibility with various solid electrolytes. Although LSM has been known for several decades, the reaction mechanism occurring on this oxygen electrode in a broad range of electrode potentials is inadequately described, with discrepancies arising among different authors. These inconsistencies are often linked to the evolving understanding of the non-stationary properties of the LSM lattice – the inner defect chemistry of LSM. Contemporary studies increasingly adopt the concept of ionic conductivity of LSM enabled by cathodic polarization to describe the oxygen reduction reaction. This shift from exclusive electron to ionic-electron conductivity enhances the performance of the LSM electrode, potentially causing discrepancies in the literature as experimental data may not align with theoretical descriptions. Conversely, for the oxygen evolution reaction during anodic polarization, a reversed reaction mechanism is considered without accounting for ionic conductivity of LSM under either stationary or non-stationary conditions. This approach may oversimplify the defect chemistry of LSM, particularly during transitions between operational regimes (i.e., fuel cell and electrolyser regimes). However, such changes are difficult to describe only by experimental approach. Here a combination with mathematical modelling seems to be promising approach allowing to gain deeper understanding. The primary objective of this study is to further investigate the impact of LSM defect chemistry on electrode performance, proposing a reaction scheme during both operating regimes and, crucially, during transitions between them. To address this goal, a series of experiments were conducted under both current-less and current-load conditions using laboratory button single cells. Various gas compositions and operating temperatures were used to determine whether LSM becomes a mixed ionic-electron conductor. Potentiostatic or potentiodynamic methods were used to clarify how this altered property influences individual operating regimes. The results indicate that cathodic polarization leads to a partial reduction of Mn 4+ to Mn 2+ in the crystalline lattice of LSM, creating oxygen vacancies through which oxide ions can be transported. Additionally, these lattice changes, though temporary, impact the oxygen evolution reaction region under certain conditions. A mathematical model incorporating parallel reaction pathways for both operating regimes supports these experimental results, predicting a cathodic potential at which ionic conductivity becomes viable and identifying conditions where partial reduction of Mn ions is no longer possible. This work contributes to understanding solid oxide cells, providing a solid foundation for more complex mathematical modeling of electrolysis cells. It underscores the necessity to fully comprehend the electrochemical behavior of electrode materials for the continued development of this technology.

Hydrogen stands as an attractive energy source, offering a way to meet increasing energy demands without the reliance on fossil fuels and thus harming the environment. Renewable energy sources such as wind, wave and solar power can be used to generate inexpensive electricity, which we can then use to power water electrolysis. 1 The generated hydrogen can then be converted back into electricity by using fuel cells, leaving only water as a by-product, rendering this technology clean and devoid of harmful emissions. The electrolysis cell can be operated at normal room temperatures without the need for high pressure rectors. At present, the practical application of hydrogen production using electrochemical water splitting is hindered by electrocatalyst limitations. Currently, the best electrocatalytic materials for water splitting are Platinum-based for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Ruthenium-based for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These materials are expensive and have limited reserves, 2 and therefore cost-effective alternatives must be developed. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are of particular interest due to their tuneable structures. 3,4 Herein we have chosen to investigate CoSe 2 as a potential electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (OWS). We describe both the electrochemical and solvothermal synthesis of CoSe x. The CoSe x was then combined with a carbon substrate to create a total of four electrocatalysts. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was employed as the carbon substrate and was synthesised via modified Hummer’s method, drop casted on to a GCE and electrochemically reduced to create a rGO modified GCE. The electrodeposited CoSe x /rGO composite (ED-CoSe x /rGO) was prepared by immersing a rGO modified GCE in an electrodeposition solution and deposited by holding the electrode at a fixed potential for a period of time (Figure 1). The solvothermal/rGO composite ST-CoSe x /rGO was prepared by drop casting the solvothermally prepared CoSe x ink on top of a rGO modified GCE. While most of the investigation on these electrocatalysts was done using simple glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the best performing material was then screened on a more porous electrode such as Nickel Foam (NF). Materials were characterised using a combination of HR-SEM, XRD, Raman and XPS, while cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry were employed to examine catalytic activity of the materials. SEM unveiled distinct morphologies, with the electrochemically formed CoSe x appearing as flower-like deposits, while sheet-like morphology was seen with the solvothermal synthesis. The solvothermally produced CoSe x was more crystalline, as evidenced from XRD. Despite the morphological differences, both CoSe x variants exhibited commendable electrochemical attributes. Materials also showed good stability over a period of 18 hours with the ED-CoSe x material showing the best performance over 18 hours. Interestingly, all materials showed improved HER performance when subsequently tested after 18 hours via polarisation curves. All materials exhibited high electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA), stability, and favourable low overpotentials for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the Oxygen evolution (OER) in alkaline media, however. It is worth noting that while the introduction of rGO significantly lowers the overpotential of electrodeposited and solvothermally synthesised materials, following chronoamperometry, it appears the beneficial effect of the rGO addition is less evident. These results underscore the potential efficacy of CoSe x and CoSe x composites in facilitating efficient water splitting for hydrogen production, with the potential to rival the performance of platinum-based electrocatalysts. The significance of this research lies in offering sustainable alternatives to platinum in electrolysers, a crucial step toward establishing a more accessible and eco-friendly hydrogen economy.

We report on in-situ electrochemical stress measurements of well-defined surfaces during electrochemical reactions in aqueous media. Electrochemical stress measurements during hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Pt surfaces shows distinct pH-dependent features which we assign to anion adsorption/desorption and hydrogen adsorption/desorption. Our surface stress analysis shows higher hydrogen induced stresses at alkaline environments than stresses observed at acidic pHs. This observation is consistent with the monotonic change in apparent hydrogen binding energy with pH, most likely due to the changes in water interactions with surface. However, H-induced surface stress shows a dramatic increase around neutral pH. We will present our analysis of how interfacial water may explain this effect. Additionally, we will show how in-situ underpotential deposition of Cu on Pt and Ni on Au changes H ad induced effects on these surfaces. We will also discuss the structural and compositional evolution of Sr 2 Fe 2 O 6-δ thin films during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Interestingly, in-situ electrochemical stress measurements show a tensile stress response during OER which is different from Au model surfaces. We will present our analysis of how potential controlled formation of iron (oxy)hydorxides may explain in-situ stress response and structural evolution of perovskite type structures during OER. In summary, our analysis shows how adsorbate-induced effects can be used to explain surface reactions, and particularly explain and provide insight into interfacial structural changes and water interactions at different pHs.

Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are gaining attention as a potent solution for large-scale energy storage, offering high capacity and an environmentally friendly profile. Utilizing zinc, an abundant and cost-effective alternative to lithium, ZABs capitalize on the plentiful oxygen in ambient air, presenting a more sustainable option than traditional lithium-ion batteries. In this work, we address the operational challenges of ZABs, primarily focusing on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that occur during the discharge and charge cycles. ORR, a three-phase reaction, necessitates efficient water management and high-performance electrocatalysts, while OER is a two-phase reaction prone to creating oxygen bubbles that can damage the electrode structure. A critical issue in ZABs is the instability of ORR catalysts during the OER phase, and vice versa. To counter this, we propose a tri-electrode cell structure that separates the ORR and OER electrodes, allowing each to be optimized independently. This design enhances the stability and overall efficiency of the batteries. In our study, MnO 2 /C deposited on nickel foam was employed as the ORR electrode, and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) deposited directly on stainless steel mesh served as the OER electrode. A graphite electrode was used as the common negative electrode. Our proposed system, tested at 100 mAh/cm² and 25 mA/cm², demonstrated remarkable durability, sustaining at least 100 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 98% and a 60% roundtrip efficiency. These findings offer valuable insights into the future design of stable, high-efficiency rechargeable zinc-air batteries, marking a significant step forward in sustainable energy storage technology.

Microsphere-like NiCo 2 O 4 /MnO 2 composite was synthesized via hydrothermal route as an efficient electrocatalyst with dual functionality, facilitating oxygen electrocatalysis reactions and serving as an air cathode in zinc-air batteries (ZABs) applications. The as-synthesized NiCo 2 O 4 /MnO 2 demonstrated adaptable kinetics for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, it displayed a half-wave potential of 0.692 V for ORR and an overpotential of 218 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA·cm -2 . The double layer capacitance for NiCo 2 O 4 /MnO 2 was experimentally calculated to be 31.67 mF.cm -2 , suggesting a substantial level of electrochemical activity in the synthesized composite. The ZAB device assembled with a NiCo 2 O 4 /MnO 2 cathode in a 6 M KOH electrolyte achieved an open circuit voltage of 1.48 V. It demonstrated a maximum power density of 127.04 mW·cm –2 at a current density of 190.64 mA·cm -2 and exhibited a notable specific discharge capacity of 756.62 mAh·g -1 at a current density of 5 mA·cm -2 . The ZAB exhibited remarkable stability over 200 hours (equivalent to 600 cycles) of charge-discharge cycling at 5 mA·cm -2 , with an almost negligible decrease in voltaic efficiency (~1.58%). Moreover, the practical applicability of Zn//NiCo 2 O 4 /MnO 2 battery was assessed by powering a 2 V light-emitting diode for 20 hours employing two ZAB devices connected in series. This study establishes a foundation for the feasible application of ZABs incorporating cathodes based on Ni-Co-Mn.

Layered materials, such as TMDCs, exhibit various electronic structures attributed to their polymorphism and can be further modificated at the atomic level through chemical treatments. TMDCs in the metallic phase (1T or 1T’ phase) have gained attention as efficient electrocatalystic materials, due to their exceptional transport properties compared to TMDCs in the semiconducting phase (2H phase). TMDCs with the metallic phase have been prepared by atomic-scale post-treatments, such as an intercalation and single-atom doping. However, the precise role of these post-treatments in the catalytic performance of TMDCs is still ambiguous, as it is uncertain whether the enhanced properties arise from charge transfer kinetics in metallic phase or electrochemical properties induced by the post-treatment. Herein, we present a straightforward approach fabrication for fabricating metallic WSe2 nanosheets, which serve as an excellent support for single-atom Pt doping. The incorporation of single-atom Pt into WSe2 nanosheets was achieved using a simple solution method at room temperature. Extensive measurements were conducted, including XAS, XPS, and XPDF to investigate the local coordination structure of Pt-WSe2. These measurements confirmed the presentce of single-atom Pt doping within WSe2 layers. The introduction of single-atom Pt significantly enhanced the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), leading to improved performance of Li-O2 batteries. Experimental measurements and DFT calculations provided evidence that the enhanced catalytic abilities of Pt-WSe2 originated from the improved interaction between oxygen and the Se vacancy on basal planes of WSe2. Consequently, the Li-O2 battery incorporating the Pt-WSe2 catalyst exhibited a stable discharge and charge cycle for up to 350 cycles, demonstrating its superior durability.

Advances in the theoretical understanding of electrochemical systems have, over the past decade, led to growing use of periodic Density Functional Theory studies to treat a surprisingly large ensemble of electrocatalytic reactions, ranging from carbon dioxide electroreduction to oxygen evolution. Many such studies have employed simplified models of the electrochemical environment to determine reactivity trends across a broad space of catalytic materials, while other efforts have focused on developing detailed descriptions of electrochemical phenomena, such as the structure of electrochemical double layers, on model catalyst structures. An emerging challenge is to combine these approaches to ultimately enable theoretical design of electrocatalysts for reactions of significantly expanded chemical and materials complexity. In this talk, I will begin by discussing how we have applied strategies from computational heterogeneous catalysis to design enhanced electrocatalysts for the classic oxygen reduction reaction. In such treatments, we have effected highly detailed analyses of the catalyst surface structure and have employed machine learning-based methods to describe interactions between the various ORR reaction intermediates that are present at significant surface coverages. I will then explore challenges in obtaining more detailed descriptions of the electrocatalytic reaction environment, including the structure of catalysts with solid/solid interfaces, the distribution of charges in electrochemical double layers, and the structure and entropy of solvents near the electrocatalyst surface. I will conclude with some perspectives on how these complexities may be incorporated into traditional computational catalyst screening approaches to identify improved materials for more complex electrocatalytic systems.

Computationally, often the energetics of intermediate reaction steps differentiate the efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts for product evolution. Yet, when compared to experiment, kinetic models are applied. For example, a material’s activity measured by one rate of product evolution is plotted as a function of the calculated formation energies of intermediate chemical forms. A critically important reaction for which this dichotomy between experiment and theory exists is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water. In the laboratory group, we employ time-resolved optical and vibrational spectroscopy to deconstruct OER into its individual reaction steps on an electrode surface. In the presentation, I will describe the experimental methodology and the chosen model system, the n-doped SrTiO 3 /aqueous interface. I’ll show how these experiments identify both the rates and energetics of the first reaction step, the release of a proton and electron from an absorbed water species, denoted by OH* or O*. A recent success was to isolate a Langmuir isotherm of the intermediate population arising within < 2 ps on the SrTiO 3 surface. The intermediate population is of trapped holes measured by emission from the conduction band into unoccupied states in the middle of the semi-conductor bandgap. The isotherm is tuned by the pH of the electrolyte. The pH-dependent formation of these intermediates are connected to their pH-dependent decay at microsecond timescales, presumably related to later reaction steps of OER. I'll also present work on the side of vibrational spectroscopy that looks at how the potential energy surface of a particular trapped hole, the terminal oxyl radical, arises in time through the spectral kinetics of its normal mode. A growing area is to apply the particular experimental methodology to a surface of similar electronic structure but diverse crystal geometries, namely polymorphs of TiO 2 .

Hydrogen is a basic energy carrier for numerous valuable industrial products. Green hydrogen produced using renewable electricity and water electrolysis is pivotal in advancing a decarbonized sustainable energy ecosystem. Two primary electrolysis technologies, alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) and polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), have demonstrated a viable commercial perspective. AWE is particularly well-suited for large-scale deployment, especially at the gigawatt scale, due to low capital cost and long lifetime. [1]. The performance of AWE is largely determined by the effectiveness of nickel-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts and PGM-based or PGM-free hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. To enhance the catalyst activity and cell performance, we meticulously control morphology and chemical composition of the catalysts. Cell testing was conducted in cells of various active areas (5, 25, and 50cm2) to demonstrate the result consistency and scalability. An innovative cell design, incorporating a reference hydrogen electrode in both cathode and anode, enabled the real-time acquisition of half-cell polarization curves during tests. This configuration proved valuable information to identify performance limitations in the single cells, thus guiding effective cell design and optimization. Furthermore, a cell comprising Ni-based anode and PGM cathode demonstrated remarkable stability. 1. Schalenbach, Aleksandar R. Zeradjanin, Olga Kasian, Serhiy Cherevko, and Karl J.J. Mayrhofer, Int.

Overall water splitting is a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, but the primary challenge is removing bubbles from the electrode surface quickly to increase hydrogen production. Inspired by the directional fluid transport properties of natural biological surfaces like Nepenthes peristome and Morpho butterfly's wings, here a strategy is demonstrated to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting by a bubble-guidance electrode, that is, an anisotropic groove-micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE). Gradient groove micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high-speed bubble transmission channels and exhibit superior bubble-guidance capabilities. The synergistic effect of the asymmetric Laplace pressure generated between microscale porous structure and groove patterns and the buoyancy along the groove patterns pushes the produced bubbles directionally to spread, transport, and detach from the electrode surface in time. Moreover, the low adhesive nanosheet arrays are beneficial to reduce bubble size and increase bubble release frequency, which cooperatively improve mass transfer with the microscale structure. Notably, GMPE outperforms planar-micro/nanostructured porous electrode (PMPE) in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions, with GMPE||GMPE showing better water splitting performance than commercially available RuO

Green hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable electricity is essential to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Present water electrolysis technologies are uncompetitive with low-cost grey hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, limiting their scale-up potential. Disruptive processes that decouple the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and produce them in separate cells or different stages emerge as a prospective route to reduce system cost by enabling operation without expensive membranes and sealing components. An elegant and innovative electrocatalytic-catalytic process was suggested for continuous high-current H 2 production via membraneless decoupled water splitting (Schematic 1). H 2 as the desired product is evolved on the cathode of the electrolytic compartment in near-neutral conditions, Br - is electrochemically oxidized on the anode side to Br 2 , which reacts in the bulk of the aqueous electrolyte to form bromate anions (with hypobromous acid and hypobromite anions as the intermediate products), whereas a catalytic transformation of the soluble redox couple (BrO 3 - /Br - ) mediates O 2 evolution in the catalytic compartment. Bromate-mediated decoupled water splitting system offers decoupling of the H 2 and O 2 gases as a safety measure, a membraneless architecture as a cell design simplification, continuous operation mode at low temperature of 60 °C and less corrosive environment along with the potential use of abundant (electro)catalytic materials. The use of the redox mediator also allows bypassing the energetically unfavorable oxygen evolution reaction and, by doing so, decreasing the cell voltage. The concept of the new electrocatalytic-catalytic system was verified experimentally in batch-to-batch mode, resulting in long-term Faradaic efficiency of 98±2% and voltage efficiency of 62% at 1 A cm -2 already at its infancy stage [1]. Nevertheless, the merging of the electrolytic and catalytic parts into an integrated continuous flow system is still in process. In this work, a variety of possible system part designs were suggested and discussed, with an emphasis on integrating the electrolytic and catalytic parts into a continuous flow system. The first iteration of the laboratory scale experimental setup was designed in a continuous stirred reactor mode, using Pt as the cathode material for HER, DSA as the anode material for BER, and RuO 2 Adams powder as the catalyst for bromate decomposition, and aiming for a high bromide utilization (BrO 3 - /Br - ratio) level at the cell voltage of 1.6 V and the current density values above 0.2 A cm -2 . The system was designed to automatically control the electrochemical parameters of the electrolytic process, to adjust the electrolyte flow rate through the electrolytic cell and the bromate/bromide mixture residence time in the catalytic cell, to control the H 2 evolution rate, and to detect undesired O 2 evolution (if any) in the electrolytic cell, and to optimize and maintain the temperature and pH values. A set of the key parameters affecting Faradaic efficiency, cell voltage and voltage efficiency are analyzed in detail. Some light was also shed on the development of a new type of solid-buffer PGM-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in near-neutral conditions, as well as on deciphering the mechanism of bromate decomposition process and the development of novel PGM-free catalyst materials as more affordable alternatives for RuO 2 in the catalytic cell.

A still unexplored class of heterostructured bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and reduction (ORR) reactions is investigated: Ni‐Fe sulfides deposited onto a N,S‐co‐doped zeolite‐templated carbon (ZTC) substrate achieved upon the impregnation of a ZTC with thiourea and Ni and Fe precursors (Ni/Fe atomic ratio of 1). By heat‐treating the impregnated ZTC substrate at 700 °C under N2 atmosphere the efficient bifunctional catalyst is generated. A difference of only 0.76 V is measured between the potential required to drive an OER current density of 10 mA cm‐2 and the ORR half‐wave potential. Using electrochemical measurements and physico‐chemical characterizations, it is evidenced that OER activity results from the presence of a sulfide containing both Fe and Ni whereas the ORR activity originates from the N,S‐doped ZTC substrate. The selectivity of the ORR process is improved through the presence of sulfide phases. Compared to more conventional carbon substrate such as N,S‐co‐doped reduced graphene oxide, high specific surface area ZTC favors high ORR performances. The functional ZTC material was further successfully implemented as bifunctional air electrode in a coin‐type Zn‐air battery.

Electrochemical water splitting has received tremendous attention as an eco‐friendly approach to produce hydrogen. Noble metals and their oxides are commonly used as electrocatalysts to reduce activation energy barriers for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in high‐performance electrodes, but their cost, scarcity, and limited stability hinder widespread adoption of electrochemical water splitting. Further advancements are therefore needed to reduce reliance on noble metals and improve the long‐term stability. Herein, solution‐processed 2D van der Waals (vdW) p–n heterostructures as an interfacial layer between catalysts and the electrode are introduced to enhance the catalytic performance. These heterostructures are formed by sequentially assembling electrochemically exfoliated black phosphorus and molybdenum disulfide nanosheets into electronic‐grade p‐ and n‐type semiconductor thin films, with the scalability extending across tens‐of‐centimeter scale areas. Benefiting from the charge distribution and built‐in electric field developed upon heterojunction formation, the vdW heterostructure interfacial layer increases both the catalytic activity and stability of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts compared to when these catalysts are directly loaded onto electrodes. Additionally, the vdW heterostructure also serves as a template for synthesizing nanostructured Pt and Ir catalysts through electrodeposition, further enhancing the catalytic performance in terms of mass activity and stability.

Electrocatalytic reactions are key to decarbonizing the world economy, but progress in understanding electrocatalytic systems is often hindered by the diversity of conditions under which experiments are run and calculations are performed. This diversity is most often a result of experimental innovation to achieve better electrocatalyst performance, but nonetheless makes it difficult to establish clear baselines for electrocatalytic performance and to understand the fundamental factors that govern changes in performance. In order to make clear comparisons between different electrochemical configurations routine, we have constructed BEAST DB: the Beyond-DFT Electrochemistry with Accelerated and Solvated Techniques database. BEAST DB contains the most promising electrocatalysts for CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). For each electrocatalyst and chemistry, we have computed the adsorption energies, 𝛥 G ads , and electronic properties for the most relevant catalyst facets and applied potentials. In this talk, we discuss general trends observed from this high-throughput database approach, and examine a few catalysts and chemistries in detail. Additionally, we describe our delta learning approach to learn high-fidelity reaction energetics from less expensive, lower-fidelity DFT calculations and applications of it to electrocatalytic systems. We illustrate how calculations of potential-dependent reaction energetics, as well as observables such as oxidation state and vibrational frequencies, allows for detailed comparisons to experiments such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), and cyclic voltammetry. BEAST DB provides a wealth of information for both computationalists and experimentalists in the field of electrocatalysis, and provides a foundation for exploration of the underlying factors that govern electrocatalytic performance across a wide range of catalysts and chemistries.

In the pursuit of a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy future, water electrolyzers emerge as indispensable players in the landscape of renewable energy storage. At the core of their significance lies the ability to convert surplus renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, into hydrogen - a clean and versatile energy carrier. Through the process of electrolysis, water molecules are split into hydrogen (via Hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) and oxygen (via Oxygen evolution reaction, OER) using electricity, typically derived from renewable sources. However, current hydrogen production is still heavily relying on fossil fuels, with natural gas reforming as the primary source. Despite its high cost, iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) is the most commonly used catalyst for the sluggish OER. Combining Ir with other non-noble metals is one strategy to reduce Ir loading, while maintaining and even increasing catalyst activity. Bimetallic alloying of Iridium-based nanomaterials has the potential to enhance its intrinsic catalytic properties towards acidic OER than that of the single element doped catalyst. The mechanisms include providing more reaction active sites, tuning the electronic structure of the matrix, and synergistic effects that promote the catalytic reaction by facilitating the formation and stabilization of active oxygen intermediates. Although many transition metals, such as Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, W, Sn, Nb, and Ti, have been doped into Ir to from bimetallic and trimetallic catalyst structures, no studies have explored the fundamental relationship between dopant and catalyst activity. This work systematically investigates the effect of doping Iridium-Cobalt matrix with a third, fourth-period transition metals including Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, towards acidic OER activity. A facile one pot chemical reduction synthesis is used to synthesize the trimetallic nanomaterials. Half-cell measurements are conducted to evaluate the electrochemical performance and stability of the catalysts. Lastly, physio-chemical methods are used to characterize the composition and structure of the catalysts. At the ECS meeting, we will share our results to provide new insight into structure-function relationships of our bimetallic-doped Ir catalysts.

Accelerating hydrogen (H2) deployment via renewable electricity is a key G7 strategy for sustainable transitions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors (e.g., circular-plastics, -steel, -fertilizers,shipping, and aviation) therefore, Alkaline (AWE) and Polymer Electrolyte Membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) play a crucial role amongst low-temperature power-to-X technologies for establishing a hydrogen network. Assuming all hydrogen will be green by 2030 (with ca. 150 million metric tons), a significant increase in electrolyser capacity to 3,000 gigawatts is necessary, given the current capacity of 0.3 gigawatts. However, the adoption of electrolysers faces a bottleneck due to scarce platinum group materials (PGMs) used as catalyst, specifically Iridium and Platinum. The commercial PGM loading per membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is at 3 mg/cm2, requiring substantial efforts to redesign electrocatalyst materials through a nano-architecture, necessitating a thousandfold increase in surface area (µm to nm scale) and a tenfold reduction in mass loading (mg to µg). The realization of this objective is conceivable through innovative surface engineering and manufacturing techniques, exemplified by. VSPARTICLE is actively advancing its manufacturing technology for green H2, bridging academia and industry . We developed a unique nano-printing technology which utilizes spark ablation for generating nano-porous electrocatalyst thin films across diverse elements and alloys. Unlike traditional methods, it eliminates the need for chemical precursors or binders, reducing waste and extra pre- / post-process steps. The VSP-P1 nano-printer serves as a crucial R&D tool for dry-synthesis, enabling both the production of complex electrocatalyst layers and also sample arrays high-throughput screening. This accelerates the discovery of new catalysts, fostering the creation and application of novel nanomaterials in specialized setups. Our oral presentation will unveil the latest findings concerning oxygen evolution electrodes, employing Ir-based and Ni-based catalysts produced through the innovative VSP-P1 nano-printing technology, which exhibit notable activity in acidic and alkaline water electrolysis, respectively, even at low loadings, such as 0.4 mg/cm2. Therefore, our oral presentation aims to show the latest findings on accelerated electrocatalysts discovery concerning oxygen evolution reaction (OER) produced through the innovative VSP-P1 nano-printing technology. In parallel to comprehensive flow-cell experiments, meticulous control tests and characterization techniques (XRD, XRF, HR-SEM) on proxy samples were conducted, leveraging the versatility of VSP-P1 to create identical nano-porous films on various substrates such as Si-wafer, conductive glass, and glassy carbon disks. The scalability of this dry manufacturing process, coupled with the rapid iteration capability for tuning material parameters and test-beds, promises a tenfold acceleration in electrocatalyst utilization. In summary, this presentation intends to reveal a methodology that not only shows an efficient strategy for catalyst utilization through nano-printed layers, but also shortens the time required to bring novel materials to market.

Hydrogen has been regarded as an energy source with a potential to be used in various sectors, including transportation, power generation and industrial processes 1-3 . Producing hydrogen via water electrolysis using green electricity will be necessary for a sustainable future. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one of mature and leading electrolysis technologies, while anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is regarded as a new, emerging technology 4 . However, PEMWE system suffers from their expensive cost and scarcity of iridium-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, having no alternative OER catalysts. Compared to PEMWE, AEMWE can be pursued with non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) thanks to its alkaline environment 4,5 . Here, non-PGM Co-based catalyst coated anodes were prepared using a simple hydrothermal reaction followed by heat treatment. Different phases and crystallinity of cobalt-based anodes were prepared and tested in pure water-fed AEMWE devices. To investigate the catalyst-ionomer/membrane interfaces at the anodes, the loadings of Co 3 O 4 catalyst and ionomer topcoats were controlled. The cell performance in polarization curves was correlated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The comparison of anodes operated with pure water feed and with supporting electrolyte was made to highlight the importance of catalyst-ionomer interface in pure water-fed AEMWE. Lastly, our self-supported Co 3 O 4 anode outperformed a commercial Co 3 O 4 NP ink-based anode, projecting a potential of direct growth of catalyst materials on PTLs in pure water-fed AEMWE.

Hydrogen production from water, a key element in the renewable energy portfolio, offers a solution to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production, using light-absorbing semiconductors and catalysts, offers a clean and cost-effective method for harnessing solar energy. To enhance the efficiency of PEC, this study explores the use of anatase TiO 2 thin film photoelectrodes as an alternative to expensive and rare catalysts, aiming to generate hydrogen as a clean fuel with oxygen as a byproduct. Anatase titanium dioxide is a well-established functional material widely applied in the fields of environment and energy. Recognized as one of the premier materials for photocatalysis and a promising photoanode material for water splitting, titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) finds use in diverse applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells, perovskite-based solar cells, and cleaning devices. Its band gap of 3.2 eV, stability, strong absorption in the UV region, and energetics of the valence and conduction band edges make anatase particularly suitable for PEC water splitting, especially for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our research focuses on the development of anatase thin films with strong [001] texture and (001) facets at the surface of the film. The (001) facets are known to accumulate photogenerated hole states while the [001] orientation imparts a negative flat band potential. We hypothesize that these two properties, (001) facets and [001] texture, are ideal for OER. This study combines these two structural characteristics within the semiconductor TiO2 layer to enhance PEC performance and maximize the efficiency of hole collection during water oxidation. Anatase TiO2 thin films with (001) facets and [001] orientation were hydrothermally synthesized on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and annealed at 500°C. The films exhibited [001] orientation and (001) faceting as shown by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Photoelectrochemical measurements via cyclic voltammetry in a 0.1 M KOH and Na 2 SO 3 solution demonstrated the films' hole collection efficiency under a 365 nm UV light source. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) characteristics of anatase thin films were observed both under dark and light conditions. Prior to illumination, only the Ti 3+ /Ti 4+ redox couple was observed with an onset potential of 0.01 V (RHE) and negligible OER at anodic potentials. When UV irradiated, the TiO 2 thin films exhibited a photocurrent that increased through the anodic scan. The onset potential of photocurrent, measured in the presence of the hole scavenger, exhibited a negative shift ranging from -100 to -200 mV compared to the KOH onset potential. This shift is attributed to the film surface's limited efficiency in collecting holes for water oxidation at low potentials, as rapid recombination kinetics compete with water oxidation. Interestingly, the photocurrent observed with Na 2 SO 3 electrolyte was 0.15 to 0.3 times more than what we saw with KOH electrolyte. Our preliminary results indicate a current density of ~2.0-2.5 mA cm -2 at 1.8 V and a hole collection efficiency of ~84 % at 1.23 V vs RHE, the thermodynamic water oxidation potential. In summary, we have made significant progress toward enhancing the PEC activity of anatase TiO 2 thin films by optimizing the film structure for both reactivity and charge transport.

Urea is a common waste specie in agricultural runoff water and has been considered as a promising oxidizable molecule for substitution of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to save energy. However, the overpotential of electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is still high due to the complicated six-electron transfer process on most metal catalysts and the competition with OER further limits catalyst options for UOR. The most promising and studied catalysts for UOR are Ni-based catalysts. Previous theoretical and experimental research works have focused on NiOOH step-edges as active sites for UOR. In this work, we focus on gaining atomic-level insight into the role of basal-type sites in UOR, which represent the largest surface area of NiOOH catalysts. We study the effects of vacancies as well as metal doping on the transformation from Ni(OH) 2 to NiOOH active phase and the UOR pathway using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By investigating various Ni(OH) 2 and NiOOH (001) surfaces with vacancies and dopants such as Fe, Co and Cu, we are able to examine how the active sites influence the Ni-catalysts transformation and the urea oxidation. This work sheds light on the structure-property relationship of Ni(OH) 2 /NiOOH in urea oxidation and offers design principles for functional Ni-based materials, which will help accelerate the development of efficient UOR catalysts.

Low temperature zero-gap PEM water electrolyzers are promising devices which are still in development. Water electrolyzers have the potential to be a critical part of the energy transition as a method to use renewable electricity to produce hydrogen which can feed into the hydrogen economy. When paired with renewable sources of electricity, electrolyzers will be subjected to variable power loads, which places a large stress on the systems. This stress causes increased degradation of many components, including the catalyst layers. It can be challenging to study the impact of degradation of the catalyst layer in an electrolysis cell, due to the many coupled degradation phenomenon occurring in the full cell system. Microelectrodes can be used to investigate the catalyst layer under electrolysis operating conditions, but in a simplified system which can more easily isolate the catalyst layer and kinetics. One of the limiting factors in water electrolyzer performance is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the sluggish kinetics. If the OER kinetics could be improved, it would greatly reduce the cost of the electrolyzer system. The ionomer forms a thin film in the catalyst layer, and controls the local conditions surrounding the catalyst. The local conditions and interactions of the ionomer with the active catalyst sites still aren't well understood, as well as the contribution of the ionomer to catalyst degradation. In this study, cavity microelectrodes will be used to investigate the impact of ionomer on IrOx catalyst OER performance and durability.

Beyond composition, the morphology of catalyst particles is a key-parameter to allow for a high accessibility to catalytic sites but it is also of paramount importance to manage gases and water transport within catalyst layers in membrane-electrode assembly based devices. Besides their electrochemical activity, fabricating high performance catalysts and catalyst layers that are compatible with industry fabrication processes is critical for their implementation in commercial electrochemical devices. Considering these requirements, we are developing green, cheap and scalable solution synthesis techniques to prepare hierarchically structured catalysts that can be readily incorporated into catalyst layers. Two strategies will be discussed. We have recently introduced an aerosol synthesis technique for the preparation of highly porous iridium pure and mixed oxides that are highly active and stable towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in acidic media. Beside beeing ideally suited for the preparation of highly porous catalyst layers, the hierarchical morphology can also be used for fundamental studies [1] or used as a probe to follow the catalyst degradation in PEM water electrolysis devices.[2]We also implemented the well-known polyol process [3] to prepare heterofunctional catalysts with ultra-low PGM content that are active towards another challenging reaction in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer: the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in alkaline media. The structure-properties relationship in these materials is assessed by a large set of techniques including SEM, XRD, XRF and STEM-EDX as well as surface (XPS) and bulk (XAS) characterizations, including operando XAS.

While non-precious metal catalyst materials are crucial for AEMWE systems, catalyst substances possessing both adequate hydrogen molecule adsorption ability and suitable electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity are still in the developmental stage. Ni-Mo alloy metals are known as those that have appropriate hydrogen molecule adsorption binding energy, making them excellent electrochemical catalysts for the cathode. However, they suffer from a high content of oxide, which hampers electrical conductivity, and the formation of a high oxidation state of Ni molecules, making hydrogen molecule detachment challenging. On the other hand, Ni-Fe alloys are recognized for their excellent -OOH group adsorption ability and high electrical conductivity, and that has a low oxidation state Ni phase for high hydrogen desorption ability. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to synthesize NiMoFe-based alloy catalysts to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Ni-Mo group catalysts while simultaneously increasing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Using a hydrothermal synthesis method for NiMoFe catalysts we employed a high-temperature thermal reduction process to minimize the oxide layer that has poor conductivity. Evaluation of the catalyst activity through half-cell experiments demonstrated low overpotentials in both Overall water electrolysis reactions. Furthermore, an MEA-type experiment was conducted to evaluate the applicability of single-cell. Furthermore, Stability tests confirmed a stable voltage. Finally, when compared to the combination of precious metal catalysts, this exhibited superior performance. Therefore, this study suggests that non-noble catalysts could serve as a crucial stepping stone, surpassing PGM metal catalysts in alkaline media.

The water splitting via renewable energy is one of the sustainable process to generate the future clean energy in form of hydrogen. One of the key challenge for the large-scale water electrolysis is the availability of pure water. The sweater can be consider as an alternate feedstock for the large-scale water electrolysis. However, the presence of undesirable components like chlorides, bromides etc. are the potential challenge to make the use of seawater as a facile feedstock. As per the electrochemical potentials, chlorine evolution reaction (CER) along with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is one of the primary existing challenge in seawater electrolysis. Where thermodynamics favour OER and kinetic benefits, the CER process with two-electron transfers reaction. As of now, precious noble metal catalysts such as ruthenium and iridium-based oxides have been explored as a catalyst for seawater electrolysis. However, their high cost does not recommend the use of these catalysts for the large-scale production and limits its commercialization. Here, we are exploring the non-precious Mn based catalyst for OER vs. CER and make make seawater electrolysis as a commercial favourable process. We have explored various polymorphs of MnO 2 , such as α, β, γ, and δ-MnO 2 , considering the MnO 2 as diffusion blocking layer for the selective OER process during the seawater electrolysis. The polymorphic engineering provide the window to tune the catalytic properties to make it selective towards the OER. Further, the results suggest that α- and β-MnO 2 are OER selective however, the γ-, and δ- MnO 2 are CER selective. We have identified the reaction mechanism using various electrochemical tools and shown the structure-activity-selectivity trends for the polymorphic structure of MnO 2 .

Despite the promising potential of non-platinum group metal electrocatalysts for anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis, their practical application remains a challenge. 1 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives have gained significant attention due to their high surface area, 3D periodic porous structure, large porosities, diverse composition, and well-defined metal centers as potential OER electrocatalysts in AEM electrolysis. 2 However, there is a limited research report that MOFs could be used in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) test due to the inherent limitations, such as poor stability in water, especially under basic/acidic conditions and low electrical conductivities. 3,4 To address these challenges, we present a novel approach involving the introduction of boron atoms into an aromatic carbon framework. In this study, we have successfully fabricated micro-nano flower-like bimetallic NiFe-MOF-74 doped with boron. These innovative materials exhibit exceptional catalytic activity, boasting an impressively low overpotential of 318 mV for OER at a laboratory-grade current density ranging from 10 to 100 mA/cm 2 . Moreover, they demonstrate rapid reaction kinetics, as evidenced by a small Tafel slope of 89 mV dec -1 in 1.0 M KOH solution. In addition, our research highlights the outstanding performance of boron-modified NiFe-MOF-74 as a robust anode material for AEM water electrolysis. This significant development paves the way for a promising electrocatalyst in the realm of anion exchange membrane water electrolysis. Our findings hold great potential for advancing the field and overcoming the existing challenges associated with non-platinum group metal electrocatalysts in AEM electrolysis.

In the recent few decades, the demand for green sources of energy that are clean and sustainable became very essential to reduce the greenhouse and global warming problems. Consequently, there is an increasing demand to identify nonprecious, cheap bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. Herein, nanosheets of different earth-abundant Ni, Co, Mn, and Fe combinations are electrodeposited over commercial Ti mesh and tested for the overall water splitting. The bare Ti mesh requires overpotentials of −486.6 mV at −10 mA cm –2 and 534.5 mV at 10 mA cm –2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. However, the electrodeposited catalysts show much higher catalytic activity for both HER and OER with overpotentials of −300 and 279 mV at −10 and 10 mA cm –2 , respectively, lowering the overpotential needed to drive the OER by 50%. Nevertheless, to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the fabricated catalysts, they are phosphidized using different phosphorous precursors. The resulted NiCoMnFe–P catalysts exhibit much lower HER overpotential (−200 mV at −10 mA cm –2 ), which is 40% lower than that needed by the bare Ti mesh. For the overall water splitting, a cell voltage of 1.71 V is recorded to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm –2 . Lastly, the stability test of the overall device reveals very high stability with current retention of 90% over 22 h of continuous electrolysis. Furthermore, the synergy between the metallic components in the absence and presence of P is elucidated using density functional theory calculations, revealing optimized G H* and G H2O* for the HER reaction over the P-top site of the MnFeCoNiP catalyst. In addition, the calculations explain the superiority of the NiCoMnFe catalyst over the NiCoMnFeP counterpart for the OER.

The demand for electrochemical energy storage (ESS) systems and their market size has drastically increased in many applications ranging from portable devices through electric vehicles to large-scale grid systems over the past decades. Yet, a more advanced ESS is required due to the safety issues and limited energy density of currently commercialized lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for wide and matured applications. As a solution to this challenge, zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have gained tremendous attention due to their high energy density, low cost, environmental friendliness, and much lower fire risk characteristics. ZABs utilize oxygen from the atmosphere at their cathode during discharge, where the atmospheric oxygen is reduced to hydroxide via an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). On the other hand, hydroxide is released as oxygen via oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charge. The fact that oxygen is drawn directly from the air enables high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of ZABs compared to those of commercial LIBs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the four-electron transfer steps in ORR and the mass transport of oxygen in OER remain major challenges for the practical application of ZABs. Meanwhile, precious metal-based catalysts such as Pt/C and RuO2 are known to have good catalytic activity towards ORR and OER. However, the integration of different catalysts into the same cathode is very difficult. Additionally, the high cost and natural scarcity of novel metals limit their usage for practical applications. We synthesized a bifunctional CoO/Mn 3 O 4 heterostructure (CMH) OER/ORR electrocatalyst which was derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) for excellent activities in ZABs. The CMH cathode exhibited high ORR and OER performances, as demonstrated by the higher ORR current density than that of the Pt/C catalyst as well as the low OER overpotential exceeding those of the RuO2 catalyst. Remarkably, atomic structures of the CMH were elucidated using global optimization of genetic algorithm integrated with the machine learning force field. By adopting first-principles electronic structure calculations, we further revealed the charge transfer and active sites for both reactions in the identified heterojunction. Furthermore, assembling CMH cathode and Zn metal anode into a ZAB full-cell configuration achieves a ~5.5-fold higher energy density of 879 Wh kg -1 exceeding those of commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), a high-discharge outstanding power density that is 1.39 times higher than novel metal catalysts, and robust cycle stability with negligible voltage decay which is far superior to that of benchmark Pt/C+RuO2 electrocatalysts.

Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) have garnered attention as a next-generation, environmentally friendly energy solution to address issues like the climate crisis and depletion of fossil fuels resulting from excessive usage. Nevertheless, the commercialization of PEMFCs faces challenges due to the use of expensive platinum catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). In contrast, Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (AEMFCs) offer advantages by utilizing cost-effective non-platinum catalysts, making ongoing research on non-platinum catalysts for AEMFCs essential. Numerous studies have been conducted to develop M-N-C catalysts in nanoparticle units using transition metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni for AEMFCs. Notably, Fe-based catalysts with FeNx active sites are considered representative candidates for AEMFCs. Moreover, recent research aims to advance Fe catalysts by incorporating single-atom active sites to enhance mass transfer and improve reaction efficiency at the atomic level. We have developed a straightforward method for synthesizing an Fe catalyst. The catalyst, synthesized through a redox reaction between aniline and a metal ion, followed by pyrolysis, exhibited remarkable durability and activity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). Notably, it possesses an active FeN x site crucial for ORR. Furthermore, by simply altering the solvent during the synthesis process, we observed a variation in the Fe-to-N ratio. Particularly noteworthy was the synthesis of Fe 4 N, which demonstrated activity for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). This synthesis method allows for the controlled manipulation of the catalyst's chemistry by varying the solvent, resulting in the production of Fe-based catalysts with either FeN x or Fe 4 N active sites, active for ORR and OER, respectively. To understand the catalyst's characteristics based on the solvent used during synthesis, we conducted a comprehensive characterization using techniques such as Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical activity was investigated through a half-cell test, and efforts were made to interpret the results based on the catalyst's properties.

The PEM (Proton-Exchange Membrane or Polymer Electrolyte Membrane) cell concept [1] is used in fuel cells and water electrolysis cells. PEM water electrolysis is a compact, efficient and flexible technology for the production of “green-hydrogen” from renewable (intermittent) energy sources. The unit cell (Figure 1) is made of several adjacent functional layers: (i) the proton-conducting polymer membrane (1); (ii) two catalysts layers (CLs) for hydrogen/oxygen evolution containing platinum group metals or PGMs (2;2’); (iii) a porous transport layer used for mass transport of reactants/products and electricity distribution (3;3’); (iv) water flow fields for water circulation (4;4’); bipolar plates (5;5’). From a practical viewpoint, the CLs can be deposited on either side of the interfaces formed between the polymer membrane and the porous transport layer: (i) on the supporting porous transport layers to form catalyst-coated electrodes which are then hot pressed against the bare membrane to form membrane – electrode assemblies; (ii) directly onto the membrane to form catalyst-coated membranes (CCM). The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency and durability of both concepts, drawing on recent advances in manufacturing techniques to reduce the loading of PGM catalysts. [1] W.T.

Low temperature electrolysis (LTE) is the most promising method for fully renewable hydrogen production. However, to compete with current hydrogen production methods (which produce CO 2 ), substantial cost reductions and efficiency improvements are necessary. Of the various LTE technologies, liquid alkaline (LA) electrolysis is the most mature. It has proven large scalability and can operate with all earth-abundant materials. However, most conventional LA electrolyzers are limited to lower current density operation than newer LTE technologies. Most LA electrolyzers operate with uncatalyzed Ni anodes, despite the existence of many highly active catalysts for oxygen evolution in alkaline conditions. This is because catalyzed systems require constant operation, as the catalyst layers degrade and delaminate rapidly upon exposure to the reverse polarization conditions experienced during system shutdown. This limitation prevents the integration of catalyzed electrodes, as even a single unexpected plant shutdown causes significant efficiency and cost losses. Further, this prevents fully catalyzed LA electrolyzers from directly operating with renewable power sources with large power fluctuations. Therefore, the development of reverse-current tolerant catalyst layers is essential to enable high-efficiency renewable energy powered LA electrolyzers. This talk will detail the mechanisms of electrode degradation during electrolyzer system shutdown. Our findings reveal anode catalyst layers fail through a combined electrochemical and mechanical degradation mechanism. I will discuss key differences in the cathode versus anode operating environments that explain the difference in reverse current tolerance. Considering these results, I will highlight priority research and development directions for developing anode and cathode catalysts for renewable-powered LA electrolyzers.

Whether surface reconstruction of LaNiO 3 and the related Ruddlesden-Popper oxide La 2 NiO 4 occurs during the oxygen evolution reaction has only recently emerged as a topic of rigorous study despite the implications this would have for its activity and stability at scales from the three-electrode cell to electrolyzer stacks. Correlation of structure to reconstruction propensity is much needed, but not well-understood. Building off of our work suggesting that these oxides do electrochemically reconstruct to the thermodynamically stable, amorphous, Fe impurity-sensitive, nickel hydroxide, we extend our observations to materials doped with alternative rare earth and alkaline earth metal cations at the La-site. First, we find that undoped La 2 NiO 4 has a higher tendency to reconstruct, forming almost twice as much Ni(OH) 2 for a given electrochemical treatment as LaNiO 3 which we attribute to differences in Ni valence state between the two materials. This leads to a higher current density when exposed to Fe impurities by formation of more NiFeO x H y , the highest activity catalyst for OER known. Yet, the intrinsic activity of the Fe sites formed are equivalent within experimental error suggesting a convergence in surface composition despite different bulk composition. We find this reconstruction also occurs for doped materials, extending the library of materials expected to have dynamic surfaces during OER. Further, we use XPS coupled with argon ion sputtering to connect differences in reconstruction extent to the bulk and surface composition, with particular emphasis on the valence state of nickel as a possible descriptor.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a family of highly porous materials, which are composed of metal-based nodes and organic ligands. Thanks to the large surface areas and tunable chemical functionalities, MOFs are emerging as excellent catalysts for the sector of renewable energy. Of particular interest, the structures of certain MOFs are highly flexible, allowing for reversible structural transitions upon the stimuli from various external sources. Such stimuli-responsive behaviors of MOFs create new opportunities to design functional materials for switchable catalysis. Nevertheless, the exploration of the flexible MOF-based catalysts is still at a nascent stage. Herein, to advance the fundamental understanding of how the dynamic behaviors of flexible MOFs could affect the catalytic performance, first-principles calculations were carried out using the density functional theory, where a bimetallic MOF, MIL-88B(Fe/Co), was selected as a model structure. Results showed that the lattice contraction can result in twisted ligands as well as the rotary metal nodes, which subsequently lead to variations of the free energy diagrams for the oxygen evolution reaction, demonstrating the critical role of structural flexibility in determining the energy barriers during the elementary steps. Further analysis using the pair distribution function and electron localization function confirmed the rigid short-range order of MOFs during the structural transitions, as well as the tunable guest-host interactions upon lattice contraction/expansion, which could be responsible for the observed differences in the energy barriers during catalysis. Overall, the findings from this work offer new insights into the catalyst design for the modulated production of renewable fuels. Reference: CrystEngComm, 2023, 25, 6441 - 6448

Electrochemical water splitting is a promising pathway for the renewable production of hydrogen as an alternative fuel and chemical feedstock. Yet, the process is plagued by slow kinetics of the essential oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Further, large-scale hydrogen production from such devices will require reduced platinum group metal (PGM) loadings (often iridium-based anodes) and/or new materials due to factors such as PGM scarcity, cost and loss during operation. In the hopes of enabling progress of rational design for OER catalysts, effective characterization of the electrode-liquid interface is crucial. Synchrotron-based X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) offers a versatile way to obtain surface chemical and elemental characterization of these materials. The use of X-rays in the ‘tender’ regime (~2-6 keV) allows for deeper probing than the conventional ‘soft’ x-ray (< 2000 eV) set up that is common at synchrotrons and lab-based sources. The photoelectrons generated from tender x-rays have enough energy to penetrate tens of nanometers through low density components such as a layer of liquid or polymeric electrolyte. This opens the door to access the chemistry at the interface of liquid and ionomer electrolyte-electrocatalyst materials. With the use of a fully operational two-electrode system, we are able to study these membrane electrode assemblies under active water splitting conditions. My talk will explain our specific approach, which is often crucial for successful collection of accurate data, highlighting elements of cell design and experimental setup that are helpful for this process. I will also show recent AP-XPS results on iridium-based polymer electrolyte membranes for water splitting. With application of elevated potential, we can correlate the iridium valency and surface species with the appearance of product traces in a mass spectrum. Figure 1

Hydrogen, known for its high gravimetric energy density and low environmental impact, is widely regarded as a promising low-carbon energy carrier. The production of hydrogen via water electrolysis offers a valuable opportunity to efficiently utilize renewable energy resources – both as a storage and transport medium and to produce hydrogen that is a crucial feedstock for multiple industrial and manufacturing applications. Among various water electrolysis technologies, anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are notable for their distinct and advantageous features. Their alkaline operational environment significantly reduces corrosion, allow for the possibility to use catalysts and cell component materials that are earth abundant and cost effective. Moreover, the use of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) as the electrolyte and zero-gap design enhance operational efficiency and hydrogen production rates compared to traditional alkaline electrolyzers. These benefits position AEMWEs as a compelling solution for efficient, cost-effective large-scale hydrogen production. To date, the development of lower-cost AEMWEs has been hindered by several challenges. A critical issue is the activity and durability of catalysts, particularly those that are platinum group metal (PGM)-free. This leads many researchers and electrolyzer manufacturers to lean on PGM catalysts at both the anode and cathode. These catalysts, while effective, significantly increase the cost and complexity of the system, posing a barrier to widespread adoption and commercialization of AEMEL technology in the burgeoning hydrogen economy. PGM-free anodes have been demonstrated for the AEMWE, but there have been fewer PGM-free options for the cathode. This study assessed the performance and durability of various low-PGM and PGM-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. We focused on Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt (LSC), Nickel Ferrite (NiFeOx), and Lead Ruthenate (PbRuOx) for the OER at the anode, and Nickel Molybdenum (NiMo), Nickel Rhenium (NiRe), and a low-PGM PtNi for the HER at the cathode. Furthermore, the performance of the NiMo HER catalyst was enhanced by optimizing the physical properties of both the catalyst powder and the electrodes. These experimental results offer crucial insights into developing PGM-free AEM water electrolyzer systems, marking a progressive step towards their commercial feasibility.

The energy transition stands as one of the greatest challenges of today’s society. In this context, electrocatalyst materials at the heart of electrochemical energy conversion devices such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers are expected to play an increasing crucial role in the near future. The urgent bottleneck to be overcome in electrocatalyst materials development to allow the widespread deployment of electrochemical systems is thus reaching combined high activity and long-term stability at low cost. Despite the diversity in electrocatalyst materials, the latter being largely imposed by the various types of electrochemical systems (noble vs. non-noble metals in acidic vs. alkaline media for example) and the prerequisites of the different electrochemical processes (oxidation or reduction reactions of various species at different electrode potential ranges), most activity and stability properties of electrocatalysts directly derive from their (surface) chemistry and structure [1]. Such properties (and their temporal evolution) can thus be directly investigated by means of in situ or operando high energy X-ray scattering (XRD) technique [2]. In this presentation, the versatility of in situ and operando XRD technique in addressing key bottlenecks in electrocatalyst materials development, notably by probing adsorption and oxidation trends [3], will be showcased. After an overview of previous contributions from the literature, the talk will focus on our ongoing works which encompass the study of Pt-based nanocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) anode, carbon-capped Ni@C catalyst for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) anode and IrCu unsupported aerogel catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) anode. Finally, the ability of operando XRD to provide device-relevant insights at the macroscale (such as ionomer hydration in PEMFCs or water distribution in AEMFCs) beyond electrocatalysts microstructural properties will be presented.

In pursuing cost-effective green hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the high expense of the iridium (Ir)-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts poses a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, researchers have focused on developing active OER catalysts and catalyst layers (CLs) with minimum uses of Ir. However, they frequently encountered performance problems at the single-cell level that originate not only from the kinetic polarization but also from the ohmic polarization. In this aspect, we have focused on identifying the reasons for the poor performance of low IrO x -loaded anodes, with loadings as low as 0.10 mg cm -2 . We pinpoint the cause of the poor performance of the low loaded anodes to an electron transport problem within the native oxide on the Ti porous transport layer (PTL). Our analysis, grounded in the metal-insulator band model, reveals that the primary factors contributing to electron conductivity loss in the Ti oxide are the upward band bending induced by the Schottky contact with high work function IrO x and by the pinch-off effect from the extensive ionomer contact. Based on the above understanding, we propose an anode CL composed of a one-dimensional iridium catalyst, fabricated by electrospinning and calcination processes. Our nanofiber-based CL effectively mitigates the electron transport problem of the native Ti oxide. This improvement stems from the low work function of the Ir nanofiber catalyst and the highly porous structure that reduces the ionomer contact with the Ti oxide. Furthermore, the highly porous nature of the nanofiber-based CL enhances two-phase mass transport, facilitating the high current operation. These findings underscore the critical role of the CL/PTL interface of the PEMWE anode and present the necessity of a well-structured CL to achieve efficient and cost-effective water electrolysis.

As the proportion of energy supplied by renewable sources continually rises, the intermittent nature of these sources necessitates efficient energy storage to meet the demand of the grid. Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier for grid-scale storage due to its capacity for months-long storage without energy loss or self-discharge.(1) Reversible fuel cells generate power for the grid in fuel cell (FC) mode during periods when renewable power production is lower than demand, utilizing stored H 2 generated by water electrolysis (WE) during periods when renewable power production exceeds demand from the grid. Unitized reversible fuel cells (URFCs) efficiently integrate WE and FC operation in a single electrochemical device, potentially reducing costs and providing higher energy density. In constant gas URFC operational configuration, both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for WE and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for FC occur within the same electrode.(2) The contrasting electrode requirements for FC and WE have constrained the round-trip efficiency (RTE) of URFCs, highlighting the crucial need to improve RTE for greater competitiveness and widespread commercial adoption. This presentation will discuss the results from development of novel bifunctional catalysts, electrode architectures, and porous transport layers (PTLs) aimed at enhancing efficiency and durability of URFCs. This talk will present the development of bifunctional catalysts and their supports to boost OER and ORR performance. Additionally, we will present insights into innovative electrode architecture designed for optimal utilization of the catalysts, thereby maximizing efficiency. The development of specialized PTLs featuring amphiphilic wettability and intricately engineered microporous layers will be presented emphasizing their role in increasing the performance and durability of URFCs.

Decarbonizing sectors that are challenging and economically demanding to electrify, such as heavy-duty ground transportation, aviation, and industries like ammonia, steel, petroleum refining, synthetic fuels, and cement production, is crucial in addressing climate change and environmental pollution. The key strategy for reducing the reliance of these sectors on fossil fuels and cutting emissions involves utilizing hydrogen with low carbon intensity. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) play a vital role in this transition due to their high efficiency, rapid response time, and capability to electrochemically compress hydrogen. However, despite making encouraging progress, significant improvements in catalyst activity and utilization are necessary to lower loadings to levels that meet ambitious cost targets. One critical aspect of enhancing catalyst performance for achieving high currents at efficient low voltages is minimizing overpotential losses. These losses result from electron, proton, and water transport to the oxygen evolution catalysts. Additionally, there are secondary current-induced loss mechanisms, including membrane and electrode dry-out and ionic contaminant polarization. In this presentation, we will delve into the relevant transport mechanisms and the fundamental limits of reducing these overpotentials through modeling. We have evaluated the transport properties of electrodes that are challenging to directly probe due to their micrometer and sub-micrometer length scales using ultra-high-resolution three-dimensional imaging with X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) and plasma-focused ion beam cross-sectioning with scanning electron microscopy (pFIB-SEM) for image-based simulations. Subsequently, we will briefly review existing methods for experimentally diagnosing transport limitations, as well as highlight new methods currently under development in our laboratory. These new diagnostics include a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) for electrolyzers and a limiting-current diagnostic for PEMWEs. The presentation will conclude by highlighting fresh insights into the significance of two-phase transport, electrode and membrane dry-out, all enabled by these diagnostics and modeling.

For the sustainable society, hydrogen production has received much attention during decades. The alkaline water electrolysis process has been recognized as one of the important processes for hydrogen products. For the achievements of an effective water electrolysis system, the decrease of the overpotential on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the four-electron and proton transfer process. These complex 4-electron sluggish processes lead to the large energy losses in the whole water electrolysis. Although the noble catalysts such as IrO2 or RuO2 exhibit high OER activity, their large-scale applications are limited due to cost problem. From this point of view, the low-cost transition metal materials, especially Ni-based catalysts, have been extensively studied. And also, it has been reported that the well-defined layered double hydroxide (LDH) structures can promote water oxidation through the interlayer anion effects. Despite this fact, the specific procedures for the preparation of Ni-based LDH structures have not been well established. Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the preparation of Ni-based LDH structures in the aqueous solution at room temperature, the so-called liquid phased deposition (LPD) method. Through the LPD method, we have synthesized various types of Ni-based LDH structures. As an example, the Ni-Al LDH structures were synthesized on the conductive substrate. It was found that our synthesized Ni-Al LDH exhibited relatively high OER activity and durability against electrochemical potential cycling [1]. In addition, the dependencies of the OER activity on the interlayer anion species were clearly demonstrated. In addition, the other types of Ni alloy LDHs were also prepared and their OER activity was investigated. Through the electrochemical measurements, we have confirmed the advantages of our materials prepared by LPD methods as an anode for alkaline water electrolysis. References [1] H.

Water electrolysis, a key process for hydrogen production, holds immense potential in mitigating carbon dioxide emissions when powered by renewable energy sources, thereby contributing to a sustainable and clean energy future. Commercially available and widely recognized technologies for water electrolysis include the proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) and the traditional alkaline water electrolysis (AWE). In order to use the benefits of both systems, the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) method is proposed, enabling the utilization of non-noble catalyst materials and achieving high current densities at low cell voltages [1]. In the present work, the influence of a spray-drying approach compared to a co-precipitation method on the bimetallic non-noble NiFe 2 O 4 catalysts on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is systematically investigated. State of the art catalyst for OER is Iridium oxide and so far, the best non-noble catalyst has not been found yet. A widely used non-noble catalyst is NiFe- layered double hydroxide but it suffers from low electric conductivity [2]. Another promising catalyst is the NiFe 2 O 4 , which also provides low OER overvoltage. However, amorphous oxides are said to have a higher activity than crystalline [3]. Furthermore, the use of a spray drying approach is highly reproducible, with which the crystallinity can be set very easily [4, 5]. The experimental study of the catalysts was carried out in a commercial Baltic-Fuel Cell with a geometrical area of 25 cm² at 60 °C in 1 M KOH electrolyte and a contact pressure of 1.25 MPa. The electrodes were prepared by directly spray coating the desired amount of catalyst onto the anode and cathode substrates. A Bekipor® 2NI 18-0.25 nickel felt was used as the substrate for the anode, while AvCarb MGL370 carbon paper was employed for the cathode. As cathode catalyst Pt/C from Tanaka (TEC10E40E, 37.2 % Pt) was used, while a loading of 0.5 mg cm -2 Pt was targeted during the spraying procedure. On the anode, the NiFe 2 O 4 loading was set to 2 mg cm -2 . Both electrodes were separated by a Sustainion® X37-50 Grade T membrane. For determination of relevant catalyst activity data chronopotentiometry (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out. Figure 1 reveals that the spray-dried NiFe 2 O 4 (amorphous, red curve) has a superior performance compared to the precipitated NiFe 2 O 4 (green curve) , which is partly crystalline. With the spray-dried catalyst, a reduction in overvoltage of approx. 60 mV at 1 A cm -2 can be achieved. With a cell voltage of less than 1.7 V at a current density of 1 A cm -2 , our recently developed catalyst ranks among the most outstandingly described in the literature to date [6]. These findings can contribute to a further development of amorphous catalysts with even higher activity. [1] Cossar, E., Murphy, F. and Baranova, E.A.

Water electrolysis is a crucial process for hydrogen production, providing a clean and sustainable method for H2 production. Iridium-based catalysts are particularly effective in promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that takes place at the anode of electrolyzers. The unique properties of iridium make it well-suited for this purpose, but its high cost becomes a bottleneck in making water electrolysis economically viable on a large scale. Manganese-based electrocatalysts have emerged as promising candidates for the OER, mainly due to their earth abundance, low toxicity, and activity. It has been shown that manganese oxide can operate stably in acid, in a restricted potential window, where the formation of permanganate ions is avoided. Thus, for practical application, the stability must be improved, so a larger potential window can be employed. To address this challenge, some approaches have emerged from combining a catalytically active, but instable oxide, with the one that is stable, but inactive for the OER. In the presentation, we will show the results of activity, stability, and faradaic efficiency (FE) for O 2 formation for water electro-oxidation on manganese oxide, and on manganese oxide combined with antimony, tin, titanium, niobium, and silicon oxide. The faradaic efficiencies, determined via EC-MS (Electrochemistry coupled to mass spectrometry) measurements revealed that manganese antimonate and pure manganese oxide have the highest values for O 2 formation, with the former presenting higher stability at high overpotentials. We will discuss the obtained trends in stability and FEs for the other synthesized oxides. Additionally, for these two most efficient electrocatalysts, EC-MS measurements were conducted for the electrochemical oxidation of some small organic molecules, such as formic acid, methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol (electrochemical reforming for H 2 production). The results showed that the selectivity for the electro-oxidation of water and/or of the organic molecule (monitoring the formation of CO 2 ) strongly depends on the catalyst composition and on the number of carbon atoms of the molecule. We will further discuss, in the presentation, the factors that govern the selectivity and stability for each case. The obtained results of this study may be helpful for developing more efficient, selective and, mainly, more stable earth-abundant electrocatalysts for electrolyzers.

Water electrolysis generating green hydrogen will play a vital role in achieving the net-zero 2050 goal; however, freshwater electrolysis will further strain an already strained supply of clean freshwater. 1 If seawater electrolysis can be scaled successfully, it would provide an important source of green hydrogen. Current research on untreated, direct seawater electrolysis is limited, and only recently have studies emerged analyzing catalyst performance at near-neutral pH. 2 At industrially-relevant current densities, the formation of corrosive hypochlorite must be considered as a secondary reaction. 3 Hypochlorite forms through the chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR), which competes with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater electrolysis. 2 In this work, we discuss the limitations of the current methods for determining anodic catalyst selectivity between OER and ClOR. The short lifetime of hypochlorite can cause faradaic efficiency measurement methods such as titration or oxygen gas capture to become unreliable, as these tests require that the hypochlorite remain stable. Using a rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE), we measure the selectivity of common OER catalysts in-situ (Figure 1a). Real-time hypochlorite sensing overcomes the challenge of measuring catalyst selectivity posed by the short lifetime of hypochlorite. Remarkably, a PtRu catalyst outperformed more common OER catalysts with the best in OER selectivity and low overpotential, a novel development in the field of near-neutral water electrolysis. We also determine that elevated heat and low chlorine concentration are conducive to improved OER selectivity on an IrO 2 catalyst (Figure 1b). We hope this work will set the standard in catalyst benchmarking for seawater electrolysis catalysts and could lead to the development of catalysts for efficient, scalable, and sustainable hydrogen production from seawater.

Introduction The composite catalyst comprising perovskite and carbon has been extensively studied as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the oxygen electrode in alkaline media. However, the competitive corrosion of carbon under harsh OER potential necessitates additional caution when determining OER activity from the overall oxidation current. The use of a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) is acknowledged for its ability to quantitatively determine the faradaic efficiency of the OER. [1] However, for practical applications, the generation of oxygen bubbles can cause unpredictable disturbance, leading to the erroneous collection efficiency. In this study, we aim to establish a dynamic current-response collection efficiency during the generation of oxygen bubbles. This was achieved by modelling with an Au/Au RRDE, well-known for its electrochemical stability under harsh conditions. In addition, using this calibrated collection efficiency, we investigate the influence of perovskite catalysts on the degradation behaviors of carbon materials at OER potentials in alkaline media. Materials and electrochemical measurements Measurements of oxygen gas collection efficiency were conducted using a modeled RRDE comprising an Au disk electrode and an Au ring electrode. The RRDE served as the working electrode, with a Pt wire as the counter electrode, a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as the reference electrode, and a solution of Ar-saturated 1 mol dm -3 KOH as the electrolyte. The disk electrode underwent a 5-minute chronopotentiometry with varied oxidation currents, while the ring electrode underwent chronoamperometry at 0.3 V (vs. RHE). The collection efficiency was calculated from the ring current attributed to the oxygen 2-electron reduction reaction. Two kinds of perovskite catalysts, namely Sr 2 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 Cl [2] (hereafter SCFOC) and LaCoO 3 (hereafter LCO), and two carbonaceous materials, namely graphitized carbon black (TOKABLACK#3845, hereafter TB) and ketjen black (EC-600JD, hereafter KB), were used to evaluate the influence of perovskite on the carbon degradation behavior. Four composite catalysts, each comprising perovskite and carbon with a weight ratio of 5:1, were loaded on a disk electrode of the glassy carbon disk/Au ring RRDE. A cell analogous to the aforementioned design was assembled. Electrochemical measurements were conducted through chronoamperometry, employing various potentials at the disk electrode, and maintaining a potential of 0.3 V vs. RHE at the ring electrode, for a duration of 5 minutes. Results and discussion Figure 1 illustrates a three-dimensional representation of the oxygen gas collection efficiency of the Au/Au RRDE as two functions of disk current density and measurement time. It was evident that the oxygen gas collection efficiency varied significantly from the theoretical value (25.6 %) and was dependent on the disk current density and measurement time. The constrained solubility of oxygen in aqueous solution and the hydrophobic nature of the PTFE between the ring and the disk might cause a decrease in the collection efficiency due to the partial retention of oxygen bubbles on the electrode as the oxygen generation current increased and the measurement time elapsed. This suggests that, unlike typical solution reactions, the dynamic determination of the oxygen gas collection efficiency is essential, considering current density and measurement time. Figure 2 illustrates the computation of faradaic oxygen efficiency, utilizing dynamic oxygen collection efficiency. The composite catalyst composed of TB and SCFOC was taken as an illustrative example. The variation in collection efficiency, synchronized with the shape of disk current density, was employed in determining the faradaic oxygen efficiency. This dynamic collection efficiency yielded a comparatively smooth faradaic oxygen efficiency. Utilizing the calibrated faradaic oxygen efficiency, we proceeded to assess the capacity of carbon degradation by integrating the current density of the carbon oxidation reaction (COR) calculated by subtracting the OER current from the overall current. As depicted in Figure 3, the COR capacity as a function of the potential suggested that the components of the composite catalysts had distinct impacts on carbon degradation. Specifically, SCFOC appears to enhance degradation, whereas LCO exhibits a comparatively less pronounced effect.

Water electrolysis is an important route for production of green hydrogen and remains a field of active research in pursuit of improved electrocatalytic activity and durability. Operating with a near-neutral feed is critical for this technology to be more widely adapted, because it allows the direct use of various water sources and imposes less stringent requirements on the components of the electrochemical cell. During water electrolysis, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving protons and hydroxides can experience a significant change in local pH at the surface of the catalyst, especially in near-neutral bulk conditions. This change in local pH is usually dictated by the reaction conditions such as electrolyte composition and mass transport within the system. Notably, there has been an increase in development of catalysts for water electrolysis with the ability to modulate their local pH in recent years. 1–6 However, comparing and quantifying the local pH modulation effects of these catalysts is challenging due to varying experimental techniques and protocols. The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with a potentiometric pH sensing ring has been presented as a promising and facile tool for in-situ local pH detection. 3,4,7,8 The local pH at the disk is estimated from the ring pH through solving the convective-diffusion equation under the well-defined mass transport conditions of an RRDE system. 8 In this study, we have investigated the local pH of iridium oxide during OER in both unbuffered and buffered electrolytes under near-neutral to alkaline bulk conditions using the RRDE technique. Our results provide benchmarks for future studies on the local pH modulation effects of catalysts and insights into the impact of electrolyte composition on local pH. In combination with mass transport modelling, we further examined the limitations of this technique and provide suggestions for best practices. References X. Liu et al., Appl. Catal.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology is especially advantageous for green H 2 production as a clean energy vector. During the water electrolysis process, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires a large amount of iridium (2-3 mg Ir cm −2 ) as catalyst. This material is scarce and expensive, representing a major bottleneck for large-scale deployment of electrolyzers. Recently, Retuerto et al. have synthesized different Ir double perovskites (Sr 2 CaIrO 6 ) with the Ir atoms in a high oxidation state (Ir 6+ / 5+ ) 1 and their catalytic activity was extensively investigated. Specifically, a Ca-based double perovskite (Sr 2 CaIrO 6 ) has showed the highest OER activity similar to those of Ir or Ir oxides-based catalysts while being stable for the OER in half cell measurements. We report the development of a membrane electrode assembly taking advantage of the high activity of the Sr 2 CaIrO 6 catalyst that has only 0.2 mgIr cm −2 , around 10 times lower compared to what it is used in the anodes of commercial PEMWE, showing superior performance and stability. The morphology/structure of the developed anode and Sr 2 CaIrO 6 catalyst, before and after operation in PEMWE, were extensively characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). We discuss in this contribution how the finding of this work can provide a strategy to lower the Ir content in commercial PEMWE. Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) combines the advantages of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), i.e., high current density while maintaining high efficiency and fast dynamic response with the advantages of alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), i.e., low-cost materials. However, AEMWE technology is still depends on a supporting electrolyte and its durability is low. In this regard, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is developing novel approaches and cell components. Raney-nickel electrodes were developed via vacuum plasma spraying, reaching performance and stability comparable to SoA MW size PEMWE. The electrodes were further refined, switching to lower cost atmospheric plasma spraying while maintaining high performance. Studying the effect of supporting electrolyte concentration it was found, that lowering the ohmic resistance is by far the largest challenge for high performance AEMWE, especially at low KOH concentrations and electrode kinetics are less impactful. Moreover, a 17% efficiency uplift was achieved by applying a carefully tuned, thermally sprayed, nickel-based macro porous layer (MPL) onto a traditional mesh porous transport layer. Both ohmic and mass transport resistances were found to be lowered by the MPL. FIB-SEM and µCT analysis revealed an ideal structure, i.e., 30-40% porosity, almost exclusively open pores, and a broad pore size distribution 2 . In a fundamental study 3 , the mechanism of the OER activity was investigated as well as the effect of trace amounts of iron in Ni(OH) 2 . X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) TGA analysis lead to the conclusion, that iron stabilized the α-Ni(OH) 2 which is the most active. CV analysis showed that an important redox switching step is also accelerated by Fe-doping. M. Retuerto, L. Pascual, J. Torrero, M. A. Salam, Á. Tolosana-Moranchel, D. Gianolio, P. Ferrer, P.

Introduction. Green H 2 production by water electrolysis at low temperature has some bottlenecks mostly dealing with the anodic reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), given its thermodynamic and kinetic limitations [1]. One strategy to reduce the energy requirements for this H 2 production route is the replacement of the conventional OER (with a thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V vs. Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE)) by a less-energy intensive reaction like the electrooxidation of organic molecules (in some cases presenting a thermodynamic potential as low as c.a. 0 V vs RHE). This approach also addresses the possibility of converting organic wastes into value-added chemicals avoiding the CO 2 emissions derived from conventional treatments (e.g., incineration) [2, 3]. Our research group is focused on the electrochemical valorization of several organic wastes like polyethylene glycol (PEG) or poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA). Both are commonly found in urban and industrial water effluents and concern has been raised about the true fate of these polymers in the environment. Herein, the possibility of generating H 2 and value-added organic molecules from these plastic wastes has been explored. Experimental. A binary solvent strategy was followed to dissolve the PMMA polymer, by using 1 M H 2 SO 4 in 80% v/v 2-propanol/water electrolyte. Then the electrooxidation of PMMA was studied in a 2-electrode batch cell at 70ºC with different PMMA concentrations (0.1-2 wt.%). On the other hand, the electrooxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) and PEG with various molecular weights (from 200 to 4000 g mol -1 ), which are soluble in water, was carried out in aqueous solutions (PEG concentrations from 1 to 20 g/L) between 30 and 80 °C by using a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) reactor. Pt/C electrodes were used in all cases. A commercial Pt cathode was employed and the anode material was prepared by the spray-deposition of a Pt(20 wt.%)/C catalyst powder onto a carbon paper gas-diffusion layer. The liquid products at the anodic compartment were analysed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy while the production of hydrogen in the cathodic compartment was online monitored with a mass spectroscopy. Results and discussion. In the case of PMMA electrooxidation, despite the dissolution challenge, polymer macromolecules showed to partially block the accessibility of the Pt active sites on the electrode and strongly degraded its electrochemical performance [4]. In the case of PEG, it was much more easily electrooxidised, at low cell voltages, from around 0.4 V at 80°C (Figure 1a), near to values recorded with EG, suggesting a first step linked with the electrooxidation of the terminal groups of the macromolecules chain. Current densities larger than 100 mA.cm -2 at 0.8 V and 80°C were achieved for low molecular mass molecules (200 and 400 g/mol). A decrease of the PEG molecular weight in the anodic solution was demonstrated by SEC, confirming that the electro-oxidation process likely follows two main mechanisms, involving the consumption of terminal –OH or intermediate -C-O-C- bonds cleavage (Figure 1b), depending on the polymer molecular weight. This study demonstrates the proof-of-concept of the low-temperature electro-oxidation of polymers containing C-O bonds in their main chain. Conclusions. With a further macroporous electrode enegineering and catalyst development, the electrolysis of plastic wastes stands as a promising technology not only for the production of hydrogen from macromolecules by electrochemical means, but also as a potential pathway to depolymarize plastic wastes, thus increasing their degradability.

The discovery of high-performing catalysts for the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and related oxidative reactions is critical for the development of energy-efficient hydrogen fuel cells and electrolyzers. To achieve this goal, affordable and abundant alternatives to precious metal catalysts with sufficient stability and catalytic activity must be discovered. Ab-initio catalytic simulations combined with machine learning (ML) methods can play an important role in screening a larger search space of potential electrocatalysts materials of higher structural and compositional complexity, such as class of transition metal oxides (TMOs). In this talk, we will show how electronic and structural descriptors derived from bulk DFT calculations can improve ML models for the OER and ORR on transition metal oxides. In our previous work [1] we demonstrated that the electronic structure of the bulk TMOs, obtained as the crystal orbital Hamiltonian populations (COHP) of the metal-oxygen bond, is an accurate descriptor for O and OH adsorption. Here, we will discuss our extended model for O* and OH* adsorption across crystal structures and oxidation states, utilizing a new dataset of adsorption on binary (AxOy) oxide surfaces spanning the entire transition metal series. Building on our recent work, we extend the COHP-based model to a ML-based prediction of adsorption across multiple oxidation states to obtain a MAE < 0.2 eV for the O-OH and OH adsorption energy descriptors. These results can enable a more efficient screening of catalysts on the bulk level of DFT computation to significantly reduce the computational cost [2]. Furthermore, we will discuss how the COHP analysis can be directly applied to oxide surfaces to understand the impact of metal valency, structural reorganization, and magnetization on adsorption energetics [3]. Our prediction models of stability of bulk phases from COHP and oxidation state beyond binary alloys will also be highlited [4]. Lastly, we will discuss recent progress on collecting and accessing computational and underlying experimental data on catalysis-hub.org.

Electrochemical alcohol oxidation is an attractive reaction for renewable-energy driven production of value-added chemicals, like precursors for acrylic (acrolein from glycerol) and nylon (adipic acid from cyclohexanol). Implementing selective, earth-abundant catalysts for alcohol oxidation can improve electrolyzer efficiency and economics. For example, replacing the energy intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in CO 2 electrolyzers with alcohol oxidation can decrease operating voltage by about 0.85 V and reduce electricity requirements up to 53% while also reducing carbon emissions from chemical production. 1 Electrochemical alcohol oxidation catalyzed by as synthesized nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) is hypothesized to proceed through two pathways, a chemical, redox pathway preferred by aldehydes (geminal diols in alkaline electrolyte), and a potential dependent pathway preferred by alcohols. 2 Many studies have focused on understanding reaction mechanisms and device performance, however, transition metal alcohol oxidation catalysts, such as NiOOH, are known to undergo reduction/oxidation, phase changes, and even dissolution in the same potential window as alcohol oxidation. 3 It is still unclear how these processes affect catalyst material stability and electrochemical performance. In this work, we probe the performance stability and material stability of Ni(OH) 2 for alcohol oxidation in alkaline media through electrochemical cycling and chronoamperometry. We use a rigorously Fe-free environment to mitigate performance impacts from Fe-contamination common in non-purified alkaline electrochemical studies. 4 We show that the rate of change of alcohol oxidation current density (mA cm -2 ) depends on reaction pathway (redox vs. potential dependent), alcohol concentration, and side chain structure. Using EC-MS and NMR, we also probe changes in performance in yield and selectivity by quantifying oxidation products, including oxygen gas. These changes in performance are correlated to material changes through monitoring dissolution with on-line ICP-MS. Furthermore, to disentangle the role of potential and reactant (e.g. alcohol or water) on stability, we elucidate oxidation state and local structural changes using in situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Insights from this rigorous model system are directly translatable to the broader goal of developing efficient, long-lasting catalysts for industrial deployment of electrochemical organic reactions powered by clean energy.

Porous electrodes are advantageous for a variety of applications to enhance surface area per volume. Hydrogen templating is one well-known method to generate a porous metal, where metal deposits around generated gas bubbles from the same electrode surface. The technique has been demonstrated with noble (e.g., Au, Ag, Cu) and less noble (e.g., Ni) elemental deposits, but few alloy system. 1 Ni-Fe-Co is of interest due to its electrocatalytic ability towards the oxygen evolution reaction for alkaline water splitting. Rafailović et al. 2 galvanostatically electrodeposited an alloy at very high current density at pH 2 having 20 micron pore size with nano scale dendritic features, and Li and Podlaha 3 potentiostatically electrodeposited Ni-Fe-Co alloys at pH < 0.5 into polycarbonate templates along with hydrogen templating to create pores in nanowires. There was a large distribution of pore size between 10 and 100 nm with the largest percentage between 20 and 40 nm. To better understand the control of pore size in the Ni-Fe-Co alloy system an inverted rotating disk electrode was used to control the limiting current of the proton reduction reaction during alloy electrodeposition. A boric acid, simple salt electrolyte was used with a three-electrode system to generate polarization curves and electrodeposits at different electrode rotation rates. The influence of mass transport and hydrogen bubble formation at different rotation rates were examined and affected porosity. Porosity was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the inspection of current during ferri/ferrocyanide polarization. Porous films were observed for deposits galvanostatically fabricated at current densities above the proton reduction limiting current density, but before water reduction, producing pore sizes on the order of 10s to 100s of nm, but below a micron. The ratio of the applied current density to proton reduction limiting current density was an important factor. J. Plowman, L. A. Jones, and S. K.

Using fossil fuels as a main source of energy has resulted in various environmentally hazardous effects, including global warming, climate change, and environmental pollution. Consequently, the development of a sustainable and clean source of energy became of urgent need. Water electrolysis has captured considerable attention as the main technology of hydrogen fuel production. It is particularly enticing due to its eco-friendliness and sustainability. Self-supported electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have prominent roles in water electrolysis. Growing self-supported metal oxides, hydroxides 1 , phosphates 2 , sulfides 3 , etc. that possess high electrical conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and structural stability have attracted attention lately. FeNi-based catalysts are considered one of the most promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis in alkaline solutions. However, improving their catalytic activity and stability is one of the research targets before further practical applications. Nickel foam is widely used as a self-supported electrocatalyst due to its high surface area, low cost, and exceptional catalytic activity, with several studies focused on the deposition of nickel-iron materials on nickel foam for the development of a bifunctional catalyst for water electrolysis 4 . However, very few studies used NiFe mesh or foam to grow a self-supported catalyst material 5 . In this study, surface-engineered NiFe foam electrodes were developed by facile control of the Ni/Fe surface ratio via chemical leaching and oxidation with NaOH and NaClO 4 followed by electrochemical activation, aiming to design a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both OER and HER. Results revealed that varying the ratios of NaOH and NaClO 4 induced significant alterations to the surface composition (different Ni/Fe), and hence the active sites for OER and HER. The physicochemical and structural properties of the NiFe foam were characterized using glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Further, the catalytic activity of the modified electrode was assessed utilizing cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Transition metal borides, carbides, pnictides, and chalcogenides (X-ides) are a new class of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, which have become a relevant topic for electrocatalytic energy conversion and storage research. This is because of their earth abundance, high electrical conductivity, and resultant high OER performance. Furthermore, some X-ide electrocatalysts demonstrate various degrees of oxidation resistance under OER potentials due to their differences in chemical composition, crystal structure, and morphology. Interestingly, there are three possible post-OER electrocatalyst models: a fully oxidized oxide/(oxy)hydroxide material, a partially oxidized core@shell structure, and an unoxidized material. 1 In the past ten years (from 2013 to 2022), over 890 peer-reviewed research papers have focused on X-ide OER electrocatalysts. Recently, several topical reviews have been published. However, typically these literature reviews have provided limited conclusions targeted at only certain X-ides. Additionally, certain reviews omit key points, especially regarding the “catalytically active species” in X-ide OER electrocatalysts. In this work, we provide a comprehensive summary of (i) the experimental parameters (e.g., substrates, electrocatalyst loading amounts, electrocatalyst shapes, geometric overpotentials, Tafel slopes, etc.) and (ii) the details of the electrochemical stability tests and following post analyses used in all the X-ide OER electrocatalyst publications from 2013 (the birth of this research area) to 2022. 2 In particular, based on the reported post-OER analytical results, we attempt to exhaustively classify all the X-ide electrocatalysts into four groups: no oxidation, partial oxidation, full oxidation, and unknown, which is relevant to the nature of the “catalytically active species” in X-ide OER electrocatalysts. After investigating the simpler X-ide systems, transition metal-based polyanion compounds/composites are also surveyed. Finally, we introduce the reported novel and special analytical techniques employed for observing X-ide reconstruction (i.e., oxidation and other phase transformations) during OER testing, which can be useful in selecting the analytical technique of maximum utility for the researchers’ purpose. Additionally, for each material sub-group (e.g., borides, carbides, nitrides, phosphides, sulfides, selenides, and tellurides), we also point out further challenges to be addressed and propose further questions yet to be answered, which may provide clues pointing to future research tasks.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) operated at high pressures have advantages such as lower energy consumption, reduced noise, and absence of component slippage. They have a more robust potential for commercial applications than other electrolyzers. The transport characteristics of two-phase flow within the porous transport layer (PTL) and channels are not well understood, especially under high-pressure conditions. The gas bubbles generated in the catalyst layer (CL) pass through the PTL and reach the flow channel. However, oxygen evolution reaction in the anode CL may be limited if these bubbles block the pathway of liquid water, causing reactant starvation. The interaction between electrochemical reactions and gas bubbles thus directly impacts a PEMWE's efficiency. This study aims to investigate the coupling between the two-phase flow and electrochemical reactions under high-pressure conditions. A two-dimensional (2D) CFD model was developed to simulate the bubbly flow through a reconstructed PTL. The volume of fluid (VOF) method was employed to capture bubble growth, movement, and detachment, as illustrated in Figure 1. The coupling of bubble transport and electrochemical reactions was achieved through the application of a weighted averaging method. A cross-section of a stochastically reconstructed titanium felt model was generated as the computational domain; see Fig. 1(a). The computation domain consists of a liquid water channel, a PTL, and a simplified CL interface at the bottom. The CL's reaction rate is modeled as a function of local bubble coverage on the CL interface. Transient simulations of the two-phase flow of the PEMWE anode side were carried out for pressures ranging from 1 bar to 200 bar. The simulation results elucidate the flow characteristics of liquid water in the PTL under high-pressure conditions and quantitatively reveal the coupling between two-phase flow and electrochemical reactions. The behavior of the two-phase flow in PEMWE is found to be sensitive to operating pressure. As the operating pressure increases, the size of bubbles generated on the CL interface decreases, resulting in a higher permeability of liquid water than that under low pressures. When the flow rate of liquid water in the channel is sufficiently high, bubbles do not fully develop and are rapidly removed from the domain. This phenomenon significantly shifts the two-phase flow regime within the channels,. Furthermore, the activation overpotential is substantially reduced under high-pressure conditions. The present study demonstrates a numerical simulation tool for high-pressure PEMWE. A future study of a full 3D PTL model is currently underway. Figure 1

Single-atom decoration represents cutting-edge technology for enhancing heterogeneous catalysis by utilizing the unique capabilities of catalysts at the atomic level. However, the high surface energy of single atoms often causes them to aggregate, forming nanoparticles [1]. To address this challenge, we first modify the surface structure by synthesizing nanostructured support layers, such as TiO 2 nanotubes, TiO 2 nanosheets, and NiO nanosponge. Especially TiO 2 nanotubes and NiO nanosponge pose relevant support layers due to their favorable attributes, including a high surface-to-volume ratio, abundance, and excellent chemical stability, while TiO 2 nanosheets serve as model system. Vertically aligned, well-ordered, self-organized oxide nanostructures can be conveniently fabricated through anodization, allowing precise control over the geometry of the nanotubes and nanopores [2,3]. Well-defined atomic-scale defects on the surface of the supports are generated to immobilize single-atom co-catalysts. Therefore, defect engineering techniques typically require high-temperature thermal reduction. We present more gentle defect-engineering approaches, including room-temperature sonochemical treatment or UV-light irradiation. By combining these approaches, we are able to effectively trap Pt and Ir single atoms. We present a direct method utilizing UV-light radiation to induce point defects, specifically Ti 3+ and oxygen vacancies (V O ) onto the surface of TiO 2 nanosheets and efficiently decorate them with Pt single atoms [4]. Our findings demonstrate that sonochemically treated TiO 2 nanotubes provide a remarkable substrate for single-atom decoration from dilute solutions, resulting in promising performance in H 2 evolution catalysis and renewable energy conversion. Additionally, the role of V single-atom decoration in ultrasonic treatment of support materials is investigated. Thermal annealing in a reductive atmosphere induces the formation of numerous defects, facilitating the anchoring of single Ir atoms onto the surface of annealed NiO nanostructures. Additionally, the novel ultrasound-driven method stabilizes these Ir atoms within the porous structure. By employing both approaches, we effectively trap Ir single atoms, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalysis [5]. The characterization of the electrodes is conducted using microscopy techniques (FESEM, TEM, and HAADF-STEM) and spectroscopy (XPS and ToF-SIMS) [6]. Gas chromatography is employed to evaluate the H 2 photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 electrodes, while linear sweep voltammetry is utilized to assess the H 2 and O 2 electrochemical activity of NiO electrodes [5]. Our findings highlight the significant enhancement of photo- and electrocatalytic efficiency of nanostructured oxide electrodes modified with highly stable single-atom co-catalysts by gentle treatments.

To mitigate climate change caused by the use of fossil fuel energy sources, there is an urgent need to decarbonize our energy systems. Developing fuel cell and water electrolysis technologies to support a green hydrogen infrastructure is a promising strategy for this transition. In both hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolyzers, platinum-group metal (PGM) materials such as Pt and IrO x are benchmark electrocatalysts, exhibiting high activity and stability for kinetically-hindered reactions including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and alcohol oxidation reactions (AOR; alternative anodic reactions to OER). Despite their remarkable performance, the high cost and low abundance of PGMs is a key factor limiting the widespread adoption of these technologies. Cobalt- and nickel-based metal and oxide catalysts have emerged in the literature as a promising PGM-alternative class of low-cost, high-performing ORR, OER and AOR catalysts. Substituting oxides with nitrides or other chalcogenides could be a favorable method to improve activity, selectivity, and stability; however, the material stability of these non-oxides as a function of reaction, potential window, and pH is not well-understood. Furthermore, the most active of these materials tend to be carbon-supported nanoparticles with complicated and heterogeneous active sites, which makes deconvoluting the role of the cobalt and secondary element(s) (e.g. N, C, etc.) difficult. With the goal of developing fundamental activity-stability relationships for non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts, we have developed a synthesis procedure for well-defined Co- and Ni-based thin film materials. Focusing on Co, using physical vapor deposition followed by thermal treatments with ammonia and an Sb-based precursor, we have synthesized Co x Sb y N z thin films of varying compositions. These synthesis methods can be extended to synthesize a broad class of metallic (Co, Ni, Fe, etc.) or bimetallic X-ide (X = N, S, etc.) thin film materials. We evaluate ORR, OER, and AOR activity with cyclic voltammetry, demonstrating that activity depends on composition and electrolyte pH. Specifically, for Co-based thin films for ORR, we see improvement in activity with the incorporation of N, and improvement in acid-stability with the incorporation of Sb. In addition to ex situ post-characterization with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we utilize in situ techniques to evaluate catalyst stability in real time. We monitor time- and potential-dependent cobalt dissolution with an on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) as well as nitride degradation with electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS). In acidic media, the stability of Co x N is limited by Co dissolution, while in alkaline media stability appears to be limited by nitride degradation. With highly active non-oxide materials it is typically too complicated to disentangle the role of each individual element within an electrocatalyst. With our stepwise material synthesis platform and multifaceted characterization techniques we are able to individually probe the material stability and product-specific activity of each element. These results provide new insights to guide the strategic design of electrocatalysts across a range of reactions and applications.

Hydrogen production through water electrolysis is a crucial technology to enable the transition to a carbon neutral, hydrogen-based economy. One of the primary types of electrolyzers is the low-temperature proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). As with the analogous proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, platinum group metal electrocatalysts are utilized due to their activity and stability in acidic environment. Electrocatalysis R&D efforts for PEMWEs primarily focus on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) since it is several orders of magnitude kinetically slower than the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). 1 Iridium-based metal oxides (IrO x ) are regarded as the best PEM electrolyzer electrocatalysts as they balance activity and stability. 2 However, improvements are needed in both areas to enable minimization of Ir loading to meet system cost targets while also meeting challenging performance and lifetime targets. 3 An understanding of the factors affecting both the activity and stability of Ir-based OER catalysts is needed to develop strategies to enable both high OER activity and long-term stability of the PEMWE anode catalyst. This presentation will describe our studies of the effects of perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) binder on the OER kinetics and the factors influencing the stability of two commercial Ir-based OER catalysts, one comprised of IrO x only and the other also containing TiO x . Measurements of OER kinetics as a function of ionomer to catalyst ratio utilizing rotating disc electrode and cavity microelectrode methods in an acidic aqueous electrochemical environment will be described. Dissolution and loss of Ir under the operating conditions of the PEMWE anode is considered to be one of the main PEMWE anode degradation mechanisms. 4 To understand the factors affecting this phenomenon, the potential and time-dependence of Ir (and Ti) were determined using an electrochemical flow cell system connected to an inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) capable of detecting trace concentrations (<ppb) of dissolved elements in solution. The electrochemical data combined with the ICP-MS data have been used to evaluate the influence of various factors such as potential, potentiodynamic profile parameters (e.g., scan rate, upper and lower potential limits) on the dissolution processes in acidic aqueous electrolyte at room temperature.

The utilization of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) electrochemical conversion showcases the promising potential for stable and scalable industrial applications in fuel production, attributed to efficient gas diffusion and minimized system resistance. The electrochemical performance of MEA-based CO2 electrolyzers relies on the chemical reactivity and product selectivity optimization which is dependent on three factors: CO 2 mass transport, charge transport, and ionic transport. Elevating the overall system temperature benefits the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Furthermore, the elevated temperature enables higher conductivity of anion exchange membranes (AEM), thereby further diminishing cell voltage. However, the downside emerges as CO 2 solubility decreases at higher temperatures, fostering a scenario where the catalytic reaction leans toward hydrogen evolution, thereby undermining product selectivity. Herein, we propose an innovative approach involving thermal management for separate temperature control for the anode and cathode, forming a non-isothermal MEA by maintaining an elevated anodic temperature while cooling the cathode. This approach simultaneously addresses the need for a high-temperature anode and a low-temperature cathode. This study exhibits a temperature gradient of approximately 20°C between the anodic and cathodic planes achieved through efficient thermal modulation of water cooling and heating within the electrode plates. We showcase the benefit of non-isothermal operation with an Ag-based cathode and IrO2-based anode using 1 M KOH as the anolyte for CO2 conversion into CO. The non-isothermal condition, i.e., maintaining an anodic temperature of 80°C and a cathode temperature of 60 o C, demonstrated a 65% enhancement in CO partial current density ( j co ), 195.6 mA cm -2 , compared to the isothermal 80°C condition, 118.6 mA cm -2 . The optimal performance across all temperature regimes is found to be the non-isothermal condition with anode temperature at 60°C and cathode temperature at 40 o C, yielding a j co of 243.5 mA cm -2 at 3.25 V, marking a 13.3% improvement over the isothermal 60°C condition ( j co = 214.9 mA cm -2 ). The increase in the j co can be attributed to the lower temperature at the cathode (40 o C for the non-isothermal condition vs. 60 o C for the isothermal ccondition) resulting in higher CO faradaic efficiency.The CO faradaic efficiency remained above 80% (cell potential < 2.7V) for the non-isothermal 60°C condition, whereas it dropped below 80% throughout the entire region cell potential range for the isothermal 60°C condition. This study presents a novel non-isothermal operation for advanced thermal management for MEA-based CO 2 electrolyzers for simultaneous enhancement in anode activity as well as cathode selectivity. We believe this thermal management strategy is promising for engineering high-performing MEA-based CO 2 electrolyzers at industrial scales.

The transition to renewable energy, vital for a sustainable future, frequently encounters challenges such as low energy density and intermittency. A promising solution lies in converting renewable energy into chemical bonds, notably hydrogen, through electrochemical water splitting. This process, however, is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Consequently, this necessitates the use of rare and expensive iridium-based catalysts. Given that iridium is the only metal resilient enough to withstand the harsh anodic conditions of OER, reliance on it poses significant economic challenges, making water electrolysis less competitive compared to fossil fuel-based technologies. In response to these challenges, our research has two main objectives. First, we aim to understand the often observed trade-off between iridium OER activity and stability. (1) Second, we intent to enhance our understanding of catalyst-support interactions by explore the use of conductive and potentially durable materials as supports for iridium to improve efficiency, a critical yet largely unexplored area. To achieve these goals, we employ advanced techniques, including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry coupled with scanning flow cell. This method enables us to perform detailed potential and time-resolved stability analyses. Specifically, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the impact of pH across a range from acidic to alkaline environments. Furthermore, we explore a variety of backing electrodes, investigate accelerated stress tests (AST) parameters, (2) and assessing how catalyst loading and Nafion content affect the performance and stability of iridium catalysts. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of iridium’s stability during OER and highlight the importance of catalyst-support interactions. (3, 4) By addressing the key challenges associated with iridium-based catalysts, this knowledge is crucial for the development of more cost-effective catalysts with minimized use and hence sustainable water electrolysis technologies, marking a step closer to realizing more efficient and economically viable methods for harnessing and storing renewable energy.

Using Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Effect for Enhancing Electrochemical reactions has been reported earlier both in terms of direct electron injection/transfer (DET) in outer-sphere reductive processes as well as charge injection into semiconductors via plasmon-induced resonant electron transfer processes (PIRE). While the former (DET) is mainly influenced by the lifetimes of the ejected hot electrons and their rapid cooling at the interface. For inner sphere reductive processes via the LSPR phenomenon, direct charge injection into the LUMO states of the adsorbed species is required. In this regard, it is imperative to distinguish between the inter-band charge transfer of the adsorbed species because of exposure to photons. In contrast to these charge injections into semiconductors via plasmon-induced resonant electron transfer processes (PIRE), they must be more understood and complex. In this presentation, we will use the well-known endothermic anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline pH to showcase the fundamental aspects of charge injection and its effect on the hole-driven OER mechanism. For this well-known OER catalyst, layered double hydroxides of Ni with Fe and Co dopants will be used. The electrochemical enhancement of OER will be explained based on detailed structural motifs of the semiconductors, its band structure, and the resonance effect of Au induced by the LSPR effect. Direct and indirect bandgaps will be discussed in the context of three possible mechanisms: (i) Charge carriers are directly injected into the semiconductor via LSPR. The semiconductor's conduction band is usually (-0.1 to 0.0 eV vs. NHE), and the valence band is between (2.00 and 3.5 eV), corresponding to electron energy between -2.00 to 3.5 eV vs. NHE. For LSPR nanoparticles, SPR energy is between 1.0 and 4.0 eV. Also, the Fermi energy of LSPR is usually 0.0 vs. NHE. Hence, LSPR only enables energetic electrons to be transferred from metals to semiconductors. It is the interface between LSPR and the semiconductor which is important. Charge injection is more prevalent when metal LSPR is of lower energy than the semiconductor—direct electron transfer (DET). (ii) Transfer does not involve direct electron injection but via (a) near-field electromagnetic and (b) resonant photon scattering mechanism. This has been shown to work by adding a thin dielectric material between the LSPR and the semiconductor. This would be most likely in the case of OER, where surface-localized plasmons will be the most important determinant instead of recombination events in the bulk of the semiconductor. This is most important for OER as it depends on the surface hole concentration. It should be noted that larger nanoparticles (>50 nm) have increased resonant photon scattering. Such a mechanism is more prevalent when we overlap metal LSPR and semiconductor bands, leading to plasmon-induced resonant electron transfer (PIRET). (iii) When metal LSPR is in direct contact with the semiconductor, all three phenomena could be active.

With the ever-increasing global energy demand, the development of renewable energy technologies is crucial to fulfilling the energy requirements in a sustainable manner. Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy carrier that can provide emission-free energy for end-use applications. Among the several pathways of hydrogen production, green hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting using renewable energy is an emission-free, efficient energy conversion technology. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occur at the cathode and anode, respectively. Water splits into hydrogen and oxygen at the thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V; however, overpotentials are observed experimentally due to the kinetic barriers, which increases the required potential for water splitting. Catalysts lower the required overpotentials, making the process more energy efficient. A significant issue with large-scale hydrogen production by water electrolysis is that the state-of-the-art catalysts for HER and OER are based on precious metals and thus are limited by their high cost and net production capacity. Thus, there is a lot of interest in developing noble-metal-free electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant materials that can efficiently lower the associated overpotentials for the two halves of the water-splitting reaction. A large number of late transition metal-based ternary complex oxides have been investigated for their catalytic performance towards water splitting, where fine-tuning of the properties using compositional engineering has been demonstrated. Binary sulfides, selenides, and phosphides have also been explored as candidates for water splitting. Recently, early transition metal-based ternary complex materials have emerged as a novel class of electronic materials with applications in infrared optics and photovoltaics. However, similar chalcogenide compositions based on late-transition metals remain underexplored. We have synthesized a series of LaMS 3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) materials by high-temperature sulfurization of corresponding ternary oxides, using carbon disulfide (CS 2 ) as the sulfurizing agent. The LaMS 3 compounds are isostructural and crystallize in the hexagonal P 6 3 space group. When tested for catalytic performance towards water splitting, they demonstrate good activity towards both HER and OER, with LaNiS 3 (LNS) being the most active material, and a periodic activity trend is observed, where LNS > LCS >> LFS > LMS. For OER in alkaline electrolyte, LNS demonstrates an overpotential of 373 mV at 10mA/cm 2 in 1.0 M KOH, and a low Tafel slope value of 48 mV/dec. The long-term stability was tested using chronopotentiometry measurements, and LNS shows excellent stability, with negligible change in overpotential over several hours. For HER testing in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte, LNS again seems to be the most active material, and a periodic activity trend in the HER activity of LaMS 3 materials, similar to the OER activity trend, is observed. LNS has an overpotential of 340 mV in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 and 362 mV in 1.0 M KOH, indicating that LNS is catalytically active over a wide range of pH levels. LNS also shows excellent long-term stability towards HER in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte. We also compared the activity of LaMS 3 materials with their ternary oxide counterparts from which they were synthesized, and the LaMS 3 compounds outperform the LaMO 3 compounds, demonstrating lower overpotentials and Tafel slope values for both HER and OER, with the HER overpotentials for LaMO 3 materials being > 250 mV higher compared to LaMS 3 , for both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The catalytic activity of the LaMS 3 series towards both HER and OER, along with their excellent long-term stability, makes these materials promising candidates for bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting while offering a wide compositional range that allows for further optimization of their performance.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) will contribute substantially towards decarbonization efforts and is expected to make up 40% of the green hydrogen market. 1 A primary barrier for PEMWE scale-up is the detrimentally high usage of iridium for the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst. To achieve large-scale PEMWE deployment, loading reductions from 2-3 mg Ir cm -2 to 0.10 mg Ir cm -2 must occur. 2 Such a feat can only be achieved through significant improvements in activity and durability. However, there exists a lack of fundamental understanding in how catalyst properties correlate to performance, thus hindering optimization efforts. The phenomena of catalyst activity/durability are frequently treated with purely empirical approaches, and thus the foundational knowledge needed for improved catalyst design—such as understanding how crystallinity and oxidation states impact performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA)—has not been well investigated. 3 This work serves to bridge this gap in knowledge by correlating extensive structural characterization data with MEA activity and durability for six commercial IrOx catalysts. Properties such as oxidation states, chemical composition, local atomic/electronic configuration, crystallinity, surface area, and particle size distribution were elucidated for each catalyst in powder and/or MEA form. Following MEA conditioning, catalyst activity was benchmarked via polarization curves and Tafel analysis. Lastly, durability was evaluated by performing a 500h accelerated stress test (adapted from the H2New consortium), with electrochemical characterization conducted every 100h. The presence of amorphous character and the Ir 3+ oxidation state was the best determinant of activity. Durability, on the other hand, was associated with greater crystalline character and more redox-stable cyclic voltammogram profiles. Correlations regarding chemical composition, local atomic/electronic configurations, particle size, and surface area will be discussed as well.

Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis plays a key role in the global decarbonization scheme by coupling the intermittent renewable energy sources to the production of high-purity hydrogen. Its deployment onto a GW scale, however, is hindered by the cost and availability of the precious metal catalysts utilized in today’s commercial systems, primarily by that of Ir used as the anode catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With the continuous increase in the demand for carbon-free hydrogen, drastic reductions from the current Ir loading of 1 – 2 mg Ir cm -2 by at least an order of magnitude, without compromising the overall electrolyzer performance, are of crucial importance. 1 In the recent years, significant efforts have been focused on understanding PEM electrolyzer degradation mechanisms and developing the necessary mitigation strategies, with a special focus being placed on the anode catalyst layer (CL). 2-4 Recent results from our group showed that there are two main pathways for Ir to be removed from the anode CL: dissolution into the anode water line and transport through the membrane and the cathode CL. 5 In the present work, we aim to shed light onto the effects influencing Ir dissolution under intermittent operation by quantitative analysis of the main Ir sinks within an electrolyzer and the determination of the charge of the dissolved Ir species. 5, 6 Various accelerated stress tests with square-wave configuration aimed at accelerating Ir-based anode CL degradation were performed and the results were compared to those obtained during steady-state operation of the electrolyzer cell, which was used as a reference point. The influence of electro-diffusion, electroosmotic drag and Ir redeposition back to the ACL onto Ir dissolution were analyzed in detail to obtain deeper understanding on the Ir degradation processes.

Alkaline water electrolysis is carried out at 60 to 80 o C using nickel-based electrode materials and highly concentrated KOH solutions, which make highly corrosive environment against the electrodes, the separator, the current collector, and the others of the cell. Reduction in operating temperature would be preferable to suppress corrosion, although it would also make the catalytic activity for OER and HER down, making the cell voltage up. Since oxygen evolution is known as a high overpotential reaction which is more than 400 mV with nickel-based oxides at 60 o C or more, and alternative materials with lower overpotential and higher stability for OER in AWE have been needed. This paper presents a novel oxygen catalyst nano-particles based on bismuth ruthenium oxide, in which ruthenium at the B site in the pyrochlore structure is partly replaced with manganese 1) . Mn-doped bismuth ruthenium oxide (MBRO) was prepared by precipitation of metal hydroxide precursor, which had been obtained by addition of NaOH solution into the metal salt solution containing Bi(III) and Ru(III) with Mn(II), followed by calcination at 600 o C. XRD, EDX, EXAFS, ICP-AES, and RBS were used for structural and compositional analyses of MBRO. The obtained oxide was added into distilled water and the solution was treated by ultrasonic vibration to make a suspension, which was then dropped on a titanium disk (4 mm diam.) and dried at RT for 24 h, resulting in oxide particles-coated titanium disk, in which no binders or ionomers were used in the process. The disk was mounted in a commercial rotating disk electrode and was used as the working electrode with a platinum counter electrode, an Hg/HgO reference electrode, and 0.1 mol/L KOH solution. Polarization curves were measured by LSV for OER, of which the results were analyzed to obtain the onset potential, Tafel slope, exchange current density. All measurements were performed at RT (25 o C). EDX and EXAFS studies of MBRO showed that Ru(IV) was replaced with Mn(IV) at the B-site of pyrochlore structure, and this doping made a single phase of pyrochlore structure oxide without sub-product up to 30 at% replacement . Linear sweep voltammetry revealed the overpotential of MBRO for OER was less than 200 mV and the Tafel slope analysis of the LSV curve gave 40 mV/dec or less. The onset potential and the Tafel slope were almost the same when Ru:Mn atomic ratio of MBRO was changed from 100:0 to 70:30 at%. Further analysis of the polarization curve indicated the exchange current density slightly decreased with increasing Mn ratio. These results suggest that Ru is the active site for OER but Mn is as well. The Tafel slope of OER catalysts reported in literatures is mostly 60 mV/dec or more, including more than 200 mV/dec of nickel-based oxides 2,3) . Therefore, MBRO is a hyper catalytic oxide for OER in alkaline media and can significantly reduce the overpotential of the anode in AWE even at ambient temperature. Ref. 1) M.

Due to rising energy demand, renewable energy sources integrated processes have gained great interest in the recent years. Water electrolysis powered with renewable energy have potential to contribute to the development of sustainable hydrogen economy enormously. Despite the fact that “green” hydrogen is produced in the water electrolyzers with eco-friendly product O 2 , the excess energy input still hinders this technology to replace the fossil fuel-based technologies. Even with tremendous attempts and considerable contribution to the electrocatalyst development/optimization/improvement over last decades, there is a continued massive endeavor on the way of noble-metal based catalyst replacement for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). From this point of view, transition metal-containing intermetallic compounds with well-defined electronic and crystal structures, are considered as promising electrocatalysts or precursors for them [1, 3]. Up to now, Mo-Ni and Mo-B systems have been explored for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and noticeable HER activities have been demonstrated for the binary compounds in these systems [4-6]. The chemical behavior of ternary borides Mo 2 FeB 2 , Mo 2 CoB 2 and Mo 2 NiB 2 under hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions is investigated. Material synthesis and electrode manufacturing include the arc melting of elements in 2:1:2 atomic ratio, homogenization annealing at 1300-1400 °C and densification of grinded powder into cylindrically shaped electrodes via spark plasma sintering (SPS). The electrochemical measurements are carried out in 1M KOH and ambient conditions. Electrocatalytic activity and stability are monitored with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and 2-hour chronopotentiometry (CP) measurements performed at reducing current density of 10 mA cm -2 , which are considered as conditions of standard benchmarking HER experiment. Furthermore, long-term stability of HER activity at elevated reducing current densities such as 50, 100, 200 mA cm -2 are essential to prove the preserved catalytic performance under harsh reaction conditions. For the comprehensive pre- and post-characterization of the electrode materials, bulk and surface-sensitive techniques are utilized. The pristine Mo 2 FeB 2 , Mo 2 CoB 2 and Mo 2 NiB 2 in HER region outperform their constituent TM components and indeed, their HER activity is close to that of the state-of-art Pt catalyst (Figure). During short-term CP experiment, Mo 2 NiB 2 and Mo 2 FeB 2 show continuing activation during the measurement, whereas Mo 2 CoB 2 maintained its stability. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXS) of electrochemically treated areas indicate an enrichment in Fe, Co and Ni due to the noticeable leaching of Mo into electrolyte. Also, chemical analysis via ICP-OES reveals only Mo among all three constituent elements in the exploited electrolyte solution. As a conclusion, Mo 2 TM B 2 intermetallic compounds show outstanding HER activity and its stability over 2h of CP with respect to corresponding reference materials. Long-term chronopotentiometry in alkaline media were carried out and will be extensively presented. Figure.

Environmental and societal pressures are demanding a transition from fossil-based resources to renewable and sustainable feedstocks for the production of materials. In this context, biomass streams emerge as scalable candidates for creating sustainable chemicals. Electrocatalytic transformation of biomass can facilitate the production of chemicals under mild conditions and can be easily integrated with renewable energy sources. These transformations could lead to the production of sustainable monomers and polymers from biomass, significantly enhancing the sustainability of plastics production. Amongst a large number of plastics manufactured by the chemical industry, Nylon 6,6 is one of the most important fossil-derived polymers for the production of high-performance textiles and structural materials. Central to Nylon 6,6 production is adiponitrile (ADN), predominantly synthesized via energy-intensive thermochemical processes. An alternative route, electrochemical hydrodimerization of acrylonitrile (AN), although successful, still depends on fossil feedstocks. A promising sustainable source for ADN is renewable glutamic acid, derived from hydrolysis of waste proteins. 1,2 This process involves transforming glutamic acid to 3-cyanopropanoic acid (CPA) and then to ADN through Kolbe electrolysis, a reaction with a historical background and multiple pathways. Our study utilizes an electrochemical reaction engineering approach to examine the Kolbe electrolysis of CPA to ADN and AN, focusing on a hierarchical research methodology. This approach allowed us to simultaneously accelerate the exploration of numerous reaction parameters while also conducting detailed studies under optimal conditions. This method has enabled us to gain deeper insights into the factors controlling reaction selectivity. We discovered that platinum electrodes favor ADN formation, with selectivity increasing at higher current densities. Optimal CPA concentrations, the presence of larger alkali cations, solvent composition, and controlled pH levels significantly influence ADN production, reducing side reactions such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When using graphite electrodes, an increase in AN production was observed, with the solvent composition playing a crucial role in determining the rate of ADN formation. Our investigation has led to a deeper understanding of the electrochemical conversion of CPA to ADN, revealing key parameters that influence reaction selectivity and rate. The insights obtained from this study are not only pivotal for the specific case of ADN production but also have broader implications for a range of electrochemical decarboxylation reactions. The hierarchical research approach employed here demonstrates its potential for speeding the development of sustainable electrochemical processes. Our insights and methodology used for the electrosynthesis of ADN from biomass-derived feedstocks can be deployed to the deployed to the development of other biomass transformations advancing our ability to produce essential chemicals sustainably.

Organic electrosynthesis is a long-known technique for diverse product development and efficient synthesis. With the recent rise of biomass as an alternative carbon and energy source, electrochemistry is further gaining popularity due to its inherently green and environmentally benign operating conditions. Electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) reactions are particularly attractive for biomass conversion due to their ability to abstract hydrogen from water, tolerate biogenic impurities, and utilize Earth-abundant base metal electrodes. Moreover, the rate and selectivity of the reaction can be tubed by controlling the electrode material, operating potential/current density, and reactor design. However, the implementation of this decarbonized technology for chemical production is still hampered by low productivity and, as a result, unfavorable economics. cis,cis -Muconic acid ( cc MA), a bioderived C6 diunsaturated diacid platform molecule, can be converted into commodity chemicals like caprolactam, adipic acid (AA), and terephthalic acid, with AA being of particular interest for the synthesis of nylon 6,6. 1 Apart from various drop-in chemicals, cc MA can also be electrochemically upgraded to trans -3-hexenedioic acid ( t 3HDA), a potential bio-advantaged substitute for AA as the additional C=C bond in t 3HDA can be leveraged to synthesize performance-advantaged polyamides. 2,3 In this work, we investigated the electrohydrogenation of cc MA to t 3HDA over Pb cathodes. We demonstrate that the reaction follows a radical-based pathway involving sequential electron transfer and hydrogen addition in solution to selectively produce t 3HDA (100% selectivity). Next, we contacted the cathode with carbon felts (CF) to increase productivity. CF are often used in fuel cells and H 2 O 2 electrolyzers due to their excellent conductivity, porosity for enhanced turbulence, and ability to tune the gas-liquid-solid three-phase interface. Following similar principles, we placed a CF (3mm. thickness) in contact with the Pb cathode to lower the charge transfer resistance (~3Ω) at the interface. The surface functionalities of carbon allowed us to further tune the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of our hybrid electrode. Molecular dynamics (MD) calculations provided critical insights into the role of surface functionalities and guided the optimal functionalization of CF’s surface. Combining reactor configuration with fine-tuning of the electrode’s microenvironment, we were able to achieve a 50x increase in t 3HDA productivity reaching up to 20 g/cm 2 /day at a current density of 200 mA/cm 2 . We further replaced the kinetically sluggish oxygen-evolution reaction with the glucose oxidation reaction at the anode, allowing us to operate the electrolyzer at a lower cell potential. Overall, ECH represents a valuable alternative to thermochemical transformations for biomass upgrading. This work provides critical insights into reactor modifications for the scaled-up synthesis of bio-derived performance monomers via hybrid microbial electrosynthesis (HMES).

The production of hydrogen (H 2 ) by electrochemical water splitting [Green Hydrogen (Green H 2 )], if driven by green electricity, has attracted considerable interest as an alternative sustainable energy carrier, e.g., in fuel cells for electricity or power and heat generation [1]. However, the lack of satisfactory and cheap electrocatalysts (ECs) to drive the vital electrochemical reactions of hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) in water splitting is the biggest challenge for this technology. Currently, the most advanced electrocatalysts for the two half-reactions of water electrolysis (HER and OER) are noble metal-based materials [2]. Despite the excellent catalytic properties of these noble metal catalysts, their high cost, and scarcity make their commercial use both uneconomical and impractical in low temperature water electrolysis (LT-WE) systems at industrial scale for green H 2 as a clean energy alternative to cheaper fossil fuels[3]. In addition to addressing this issue by the development of precious-material-based with a low-loading of precious metal elements, the development of desirable and high-efficiency electrocatalysts (ECs) based on earth-abundant metal elements materials is paramount. However, their catalytic activity is often limited by poor electron transfer, low conductivity, low stability, and small surface area of these materials. Thus, it is crucial to develop earth-abundant metal elements-based materials that are more cost-effective to reduce the high cost of active catalysts for water electrolysis. Although several low-cost materials have already been designed, the potential required for the practical application of water splitting is still very high compared to the theoretical potential (1.23 V), which means that much energy is consumed, which theoretically could be reduced. Due to their remarkable advanced charge transfer and durability for water oxidation in alkaline media, electrocatalysts derived from metal borides-based materials have received a lot of attention as new high-performance catalysts for water oxidation.[4] These properties stem from the multi-dimensional covalent bonding of the metalloid with the surrounding metal atoms. We present here an approach to tune the OER of transition metal borides (TMBs) using the cost-effective and less energy-consuming method that is nevertheless a highly efficient material for OER (Fig. 1). We have developed a low-cost, rational and easily scalable method to enhance the catalytic activity of nickel boride (Ni–B), which requires an annealing process to optimize the catalytic activity. However, this method may have limited applicability on a large scale as it requires a highly inert environment and high-temperature treatment of Ni–B catalysts. We also elucidate a structure-activity relationship using scale-bridging techniques such as TEM and electrochemical characterization. The developed based on non-noble electrocatalysts are prepared by a simple method of chemical reduction of transition metal elements with boron in aqueous solution. The production is a one-step process and the material does not require any further treatment, yet this material shows comparable activity to the state of the art (precious metal-based materials) for OER in alkaline solution at a selected current density. This improved catalytic performance is further corroborated by the microstructural investigations in the TEM. The nanoparticles obtained have an improved porous structure compared to Ni–B and thus provide more available sites for the surface reactions and hence for the catalytic performance of the material. Furthermore, it is shown that activation enables the morphological and structural changes, while some transition metal elements act as sacrificial elements to provide more accessible and stable sites for oxygen-forming centers. This paves the way for a better understanding of metal boride-derived electrocatalysts for water oxidation, a crucial chemical reaction in water electrolysis and other electrochemical energy technologies.

As search for novel electrochemical energy storage systems continues, metal-air batteries are one of the possible solution. Consisting of a metal anode and an air-breathing cathode, by design, they achieve much higher gravimetric energy density in theory. However, s-orbital metals suffer passivation issues and poses safety threats due to their reactivity with air and humidity. As a solution to this issue, safer d-block metals are being studied as an alternative. Zinc air batteries (ZABs) utilizes earth-abundant and cost-effective zinc as its anode, and has high theoretical capacity. At its cathode, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occur during charging and discharge processes. Sluggish kinetics of ORR degrades the discharge performance, and is the bottleneck in commercial application of the zinc air battery. Additionally, irreversibility of the cathode reaction results in dissatisfactory retention of battery capacity. Current state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts achieves nearly 80% of the theoretical capacity. However, its cycling stability is severely limited to less than 200 cycles despite low discharge rate applied. Herein, we present a nitrogen plasma-enhanced copper sulfide/oxide catalyst (referred to as N-CuS) that exhibits good catalytic activity for its application as the air-breathing cathode for ZABs. The material is grown directly on metal foam surface using anodization, which is then treated using nitrogen plasma. Anodization creates defect-rich flakes of copper sulfide on the oxide surface, highly increasing surface area and creating the active sites. The material has good electrical conductivity and highly open porous structure that alleviates mass transport issues. Additionally, nitrogen plasma treatment further increases the surface area about 80%, and is expected to introduce nitrogen dopants to the surface, enhancing conductivity of the material. ECSA estimated by measuring C dl shows that each process increases the ECSA by over 40 times and about 1.8 times, respectively. LSV of CuS and N-CuS half-cells have been performed to measure and compare catalytic performance of the material. N-CuS shows far higher current density and better catalytic activity (35mV less overpotential) than CuS, and higher output voltage is observed with N-CuS cells with the same current density. By assessing the GCPL (potential limited galvanostatic cycling) results, it was concluded that N-CuS requires lower charging voltage and exhibits higher discharge voltages than CuS. The overall performance was evaluated in a stack cell configuration, utilizing thin zinc foil as its anode to minimize mass error. The measured specific capacity of the cell was 789.3 mA·h·g -1 , which approximately is 85% of the theoretical specific capacity of zinc-air cells (820 mA·h·g -1 ). This cell yields gravimetric energy density of about 666 Wh·kg -1 . It is notable that these ZAB characteristics are comparable to Pt/C, the state-of-the-art catalyst as of now. N-CuS may be a viable replacement for the Pt/C electrode, resulting in the cost-saving effect. The cycling stability of both N-CuS and Pt/C-based ZAB has been assessed to show that N-CuS-based ZAB has much prolonged (more than twice the cycles) cyclability compared to Pt/C-based ZAB (Fig. S11). Additionally, ZAB constructed using N-CuS can operate in oxygen-deficient environments. As the counter reaction it utilizes redox reaction of copper oxides (Zn-Cu mode) in the substrate when operating in anaerobic conditions. The reduction of divalent and monovalent copper oxides appears as plateaus at 1.1 V and 0.8 V versus the zinc anode during GCPL. Due to this alternate reaction, the cell can operate even at low concentrations of oxygen or even in its absence. DFT calculations have been performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the intrinsic catalytic activity of the material, and shows nitrogen dopants improve reactivity of the active sites, thus reducing the overpotential. In summary, we have synthesized N-CuS as the OER/ORR catalyst for ZAB. Through anodization the catalyst was directly grown on the substrate and nitrogen plasma treatment further enhances the catalyst properties to render it higher surface area, conductivity, and better stability. This allows better reversibility in the OER/ORR and results in enhanced cyclability of the overall cell. The constructed RZAB exhibited high specific capacity of 789.3 mA·h·g -1 , which, has higher capacity than the analogue using Pt/C catalyst. In addition, N-CuS based RZAB is capable of operating under oxygen-deficient conditions utilizing the metal oxide substrate. This allows the dual mode operation of zinc-air and zinc-copper modes, and results in a more consistent output from the RZAB, as short-term air supply issues could be buffered by this effect.

Anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) present a multitude of advantages, particularly in the utilization of non-platinum group (non-PGM) catalysts. While diverse catalysts have demonstrated notable electrocatalytic activity in alkaline conditions, the integration of the ionomer with the electrocatalyst at the active catalyst layer is crucial for enhancing overall AEMWE performance in practical device demonstrations by improving mass transport. However, the intrinsic instability of polymeric ionomers, leading to physical detachments or alkaline (chemical) degradation, poses a challenge that can potentially diminish performance. In this study, drawing inspiration from the aforementioned ionomer chemistry, we introduce non-PGM NiFe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating quaternary ammonium (QA) cation moieties covalently functionalized to benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) ligands as promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. Three specifically designed functional groups with varying ion exchange capacities (IEC) and alkaline stability—trimethylamine (TMA), N-methylpyrrolidine (C 4 N), and N-methylpiperidine (C 5 N)—were directly tethered to BDC ligands. The alkaline OER activity of Ni 2 Fe 1 -QA-MOF was meticulously assessed using rotating disk electrodes and AEMWE devices. These directly tethered QA groups markedly facilitated improved ionic transport of OH - ions at the catalyst/electrolyte interfaces compared to BDC ligands, ultimately leading to a significant enhancement in half-cell activity and AEMWE performance. In-situ IR/RAMAN spectroscopy revealed that QA moieties highly promoted local ionic transport at the interfaces, as evidenced by characteristic peaks indicating a robust interaction between QA and OH - ions. Unexpectedly, QA moieties not only contributed to ionic transport in local environments but also induced oxidation states of Ni metal sites, while Fe sites exhibited no changes during the applied potential in the OER region, as comprehensively revealed by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). In comparison with conventional NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) structures, we posit that the substantial structural transformation of Ni moieties can be attributed to an increased degree of M-O bond interaction, enhanced by the local interaction between QA and OH - ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also validate the balanced adsorption of OER intermediates on QA-MOFs. Finally, QA-NiFe-MOF was directly synthesized on a porous transport layer (PTL), and its AEMWE performance was evaluated without the use of any ionomer. At 1.0 M KOH, C 4 N, C 5 N, and TMA-based NiFe MOFs exhibited current densities of 9.35 A/cm 2 , 9.11 A/cm 2 , and 7.6 A/cm 2 , respectively. These current densities surpassed those of bare BDC-NiFe MOF and commercial IrO 2 anode catalysts, which exhibited only 7.39 A/cm 2 and 6.4 A/cm 2 , respectively. Consequently, we emphasize that the facilitation of local ionic transport could yield remarkable AEMWE performance, even in the absence of conventional polymeric ionomers.

Water electrolysis is a green means of producing hydrogen gas to be used as a fuel or reactant in key industrial processes such as ammonia production. The conventional system of oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) suffers from slow kinetics at the anode and a high cell voltage limited by thermodynamics. One solution is to replace OER with another reaction such as an organic oxidation reaction that has a lower equilibrium potential and produces a valuable organic byproduct at the anode. Recent work has demonstrated that biomass-derived aldehydes such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural can be selectively oxidized to their corresponding carboxylates and H 2 on Cu-based anodes at low potentials (~0.1 V RHE ) in alkaline media. In alkaline media, a hydroxide ion adds to the carbonyl carbon of an aldehyde molecule forming a gem diolate in solution phase. It is argued that dehydrogenation becomes more facile due to the weaker C-H bond of the gem diolate compared to the aldehyde form of the molecule. This may enable oxidation without the need for coadsorbed-OH. Additionally, aldehyde oxidation is only active on Au, Ag, and Cu electrodes at higher pHs. The aim of this work is to identify the conditions under which low potential oxidation of aldehydes and high anodic Faradaic efficiency to H 2 occurs, namely, electrode material and applied potential. To avoid polymerization side reactions of furans in alkaline media, we studied benzaldehyde as a model compound which has also been shown to exhibit low potential oxidation and anodic H 2 . The activity (rate of aldehyde consumption) and selectivity (to anodic H 2 versus H 2 O) were compared for the group Ib metals (Au, Ag, Cu), each of which demonstrates a relatively early onset potential (<0.4 V RHE ) and generates anodic H 2 at certain potentials. Rotating disk electrode studies with Koutecky-Levich analysis were conducted to separate mass transfer effects from kinetic current to compare the intrinsic activity of each electrode. Additionally, the average number electrons transferred per aldehyde molecule consumed was estimated from Koutecky-Levich analysis; the one-electron pathway combines the aldehyde hydrogens to H 2 while the two-electron pathway requires an additional electron per aldehyde molecule to oxidize the hydrogen from the surface to form H 2 O. Rotating ring disk electrode studies were used to further validate the anodic H 2 generation as a Pt ring was still able to oxidize H 2 despite the presence of benzaldehyde. This was used as an additional means of estimating the selectivity to H 2 as a function of potential. CVs for benzaldehyde oxidation on each metal are shown in Figure a. Peak current followed the order of Au > Ag >> Cu. Au reached a mass transfer limiting current, and Ag also showed an RPM dependence but did not reach full mass transfer limitations. Cu was the least active and did not show any mass transfer dependence. On the other hand, Cu has the earliest onset potential followed by Ag then Au. The average number of electrons transferred per aldehyde molecule according to RRDE measurements is shown in Figure b, where one electron represents H 2 and two electrons represents H-oxidation to H 2 O. Cu had 100% selectivity to H 2 over its entire potential window of activity (up to 0.45 V RHE ). Au and Ag have high selectivity to H 2 at low potentials but decreases to near zero H 2 production in the range of 0.6-0.8 V RHE ; the decrease in selectivity to H 2 on Ag occurs slightly earlier than Au (~0.1 V). H 2 selectivity is related to the inability of each metal to oxidize H to H 2 O at low potentials. Figure 1

Hydrogen (H 2 ) has been spotlighted as ideal energy carrier due to its relatively higher energy density compared to fossil fuel and no carbon emissions during the energy generation. However, most of current produced H 2 comes from as byproducts in fossil fuel reforming processes. To reduce dependence on fossil fuel in the H 2 production process, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is considered as promising strategy for producing H 2 using sustainable resources. Nevertheless, the insufficient efficiency in PEC water oxidation oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has limited overall PEC water splitting system efficiency due to its relatively high oxidation potential and sluggish catalytic kinetics. Furthermore, the low value of generated oxygen has been pointed out as obstacle from an economic perspective. To overcome these challenges, glycerol, byproduct of biodiesel, has been attracted numerous attentions as PEC oxidation resource since it has three hydroxyl groups and relatively lower oxidation potential than OER. Furthermore, glycerol oxygenated value-added products like dihydroxyacetone (DHA) can improve economics of PEC hydrogen production system. Upon these strengths, PEC glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) provides improved strategy that generates value-added products in anodic part and green energy source (H 2 ) in cathodic part simultaneously, which can replace PEC water splitting. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) is one of the most promising transition metal oxide based catalyst for PEC GOR due to its relatively narrow bandgap, high theoretical photocurrent density and deep positive valence band maximum (VBM) position. Additionally, although the surface kinetics of BiVO 4 for OER has been sluggish, it potentially would be advantage for GOR with high production rate. However, the relatively instability of BiVO 4 in acidic electrolyte during operation and lower selectivity of oxygenated products has hindered their practical application in PEC GOR. To solve these problems, introduction of nanoparticles as cocatalysts has been much studied for ameliorating surface kinetics and passivation the surface of photoanode. However, the interface between nanoparticles and photoanode with poor chemical interaction can induce the higher interfacial resistance and slow charge transfer efficiency rather. In this study, we present in-situ vanadium oxide (VO x ) nanoparticle decoration on the surface of BiVO 4 (VO x /BiVO 4 ) via selective etching process using alkaline treatment for enhancing PEC GOR and we report the world best photocurrent density based on BiVO4 photoanode for GOR with high selective DHA production. VO x nanoparticles with an average size of 5 nm by selective etching process using alkaline treatment is decorated on the surface of BiVO 4 . The VO x promotes the surface reaction kinetics via modulating the fermi level and enhanced photovoltage of BiVO 4 and improves long-term stability for GOR by compensation of V 5+ and Bi 3+ , which combines both efficiency and stability. Furthermore, the surface decorated photoanode presents a 6.82 mA/cm 2 (1.34-fold improvement) photocurrent density at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under 1 sun illumination, which has been attributed enhanced catalytic kinetics with upshifted fermi level and photovoltage of BiVO 4 . Moreover, the long-term stability of VO x /BiVO 4 has been exhibited over 10 hours and the high selectivity for DHA is achieved. This study presents insight into the role vanadium of selective etched VO x on the surface of BiVO 4 with low valence state than that of BiVO4 and improving the potential of BiVO 4 based catalyst as GOR photoanode for high selective value-added DHA production using solar energy.

Transition-metal-based solid-state electrocatalysts undergo dynamic phase transformation governed by the local electrochemical environment during operation, e.g., oxygen evolution/reduction( 1,2 ), hydrogen evolution( 3 ), and carbon dioxide reduction( 4 ). Electrochemical active species, often hidden before operation, can become evolved due to the applied electrochemical potential and/or surrounding chemicals. These species are stabilized under the local environment dynamically generated by the reaction product, e.g., proton (H + ) or hydroxyl (OH - ) group( 5,6 ). Active species often account for a small fraction (i.e., minor motif) of the entire catalyst volume, and the nanoscale morphology and chemical composition of the electrocatalyst are inhomogeneous and continuously change during the electrochemical reaction. Thus, capturing the active species remains a major challenge. Spatiotemporal observation of the structural/chemical changes of the electrocatalyst and the correlation with the local electrochemical environment may reveal the active species and elucidate the governing step toward their formation. Furthermore, identification of the key intermediate step of catalyst phase transformation allows the redirection of low- to high-active catalysts; however, this remains challenging. During electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECR), (hydr)oxide-derived Cu electrocatalysts experience significant phase transformation and show high activity and selectivity for carbon dimerization (C–C coupling)( 7,8,9 ). The location and chemical composition of the active species evolving during electrochemical phase transformation may be strongly heterogeneous; however, these species have not been clearly determined. Recent studies have employed operando characterization techniques, e.g., fluorescence hard/soft X-ray( 4,10 ), X-ray photoelectron( 11 ), and Raman spectroscopy( 6 ), to elucidate the active species responsible for high C–C coupling activity. However, although these techniques could track the changes in chemical composition of the electrocatalysts during operation, they did not reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of the active species or existence of minor motifs, owing to their inefficient chemical sensitivity. Thus, it is imperative to develop an operando analysis technique that can probe the nanoscopic chemical composition with high spatial/temporal resolution and sufficient detection limit. By observing the chemical and morphological evolution of highly efficient ECR catalysts during operation, we identified the key intermediate species toward highly active surfaces and significantly enhanced the C–C coupling activity. Operando transmission soft X-ray microscopy( 1,12,13 ), which visualizes the nanoscale chemical composition distribution of Cu-based catalysts during ECR, revealed that partially evolved Cu + phases and surface Cu 2+ phases are responsible for the dynamic dissolution–redeposition process( 4,8 ) and improvement of C–C coupling activity, respectively. We further demonstrated that the dissolution–redeposition process is electrochemically triggered by inducing Cu + phases, which are redirected to copper-carbonate-hydroxide species( 6,14,15 ) even under high cathodic potentials. DFT calculations suggest that these cationic Cu species potentially serve as active species and/or assistive sites for enhancing C–C coupling activity. (1) Mefford, J. T., et al.

As the global focus shifts towards a zero-emission society, hydrogen has emerged as a critical element in various industries, particularly in green hydrogen production. A promising method for this is Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE), which uses pure water and electricity to produce high-purity hydrogen. However, the efficiency of PEMWE is highly dependent on the effectiveness of its catalysts, particularly in the context of the catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) employed in these systems. Conventional preparation of these CCMs involves multiple steps, including synthesis and application of a catalyst ink, which often leads to catalyst agglomeration and requires high Ir (Iridium) loadings to maintain uniformity and performance. In our latest study, we have developed a novel approach using ultralight conductive IrO 2 nanostructured textiles (NST) as a catalyst layer for PEMWE. This innovative method successfully circumvents the issue of electrically isolated inactive catalysts, a common problem with lower Ir amounts in traditional catalyst layers. By employing a process of sputtering IrO 2 onto water-soluble polymer nanofibers, we have achieved facile CCM preparation and demonstrated unprecedented long-term hydrogen evolution with ultra-low Ir mass loadings at high rates. Our study revealed that the high performance of these CCMs is derived from their low resistivity and unique porous three-dimensional structure. The preparation of NST involves dissolving polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in methanol, followed by electrospinning this solution onto a metal-foil collector. The resulting PVP nanofibers then undergo a sputtering process to deposit IrO 2 , forming the nanostructured textiles. This method eliminates the need for wet chemical routes and labor-intensive processes typically associated with conventional catalyst layer preparations, thus offering a more environmentally friendly and scalable alternative. Our performance evaluations of these NST CCMs, with varying Ir mass loadings, have shown significant advancements. The operational cell voltages of CCMs containing as little as 0.05 mg-Ir cm −2 were suppressed across all investigated current densities compared to conventional CCMs. Notably, operational voltages remained below 2 V even at the highest current density of 7 A cm −2 . This level of performance is unprecedented for CCMs with such low catalyst amounts. Additionally, the long-term stability of these CCMs was remarkable, with operational times exceeding 1500 hours without significant increases in voltage, showcasing their potential for practical applications. An essential aspect of our study was the analysis of the electrical properties and the surface structure of the IrO2 NSTs. We observed that the electrical conductivity of these textiles was significantly higher than that of conventional catalyst layers. This high conductivity, coupled with the unique interconnected structure of the textiles, ensures efficient electrical contact between nano catalysts and the current collector, thus avoiding the formation of isolated catalysts. Our analyses revealed that the IrO 2 NSTs have unique surface terminations and a high number of undercoordinated surface Ir atoms, contributing to their high intrinsic catalytic activity. Further insights were gained through operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, which showed that the IrO2-nanostructured textiles possess a large number of D-band holes and are intrinsically highly active. This finding is crucial as it links the unique chemical state of the textiles to their high activity in oxygen evolution reactions (OER), a key process in PEMWE. Our recent developments in nanostructured textile catalysts for PEMWE mark a significant leap in hydrogen production technology. By demonstrating high-rate hydrogen production at low operational voltages and with significantly lower Ir mass loadings compared to conventional CCMs, we have addressed major challenges in the field. These advancements not only enhance the efficiency and sustainability of hydrogen production but also open avenues for applying this technology to other electrochemical conversion cells, paving the way for broader applications and further research. In this talk, we discuss the latest activity on NST, and highlight the challenges and opportunities for hydrogen production.

Hydrogen (H 2 ) is well-known for its potential to become the future fuel and bring a more sustainable energy system [1] . The selective electrooxidation of organic compounds from biomass appears to be a possible substitute for the kinetically slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which increases the electrical energy input for a conventional water electrolysis in alkaline media [2] . However, this approach is currently impeded by limited fundamental knowledge of the different active sites of electrocatalysts. The latter can be used to control selectivity at low potential and high current density to co-generate value-added products at the anode instead of CO 2 by complete oxidation. Nanostructured gold-based multi-metal electrocatalysts can meet such objectives. Particularly in the electro-valorization of cellulosic biomass at electrode potentials unfavorable to C-C bond breaking and high overall cell voltage. To develop such electrocatalysts, we have initiated a multivariate methodology to study the dynamics of galvanic replacement between silver and gold. This procedure allows us to control nanoporosity and nanoalloying in the resulting gas diffusion electrode (GDE): GDE-Ag 1-x Au x . GDE-Ag represents the electrode upon which Ag particles were electrochemically grown prior to reaction with Au(III). Thermodynamically, silver with E°(Ag + /Ag) = 0.8 V vs SHE (standard hydrogen electrode) can be replaced by gold with E°(AuCl 4 – /Au) = 1.0 V vs SHE according to: 3Ag + xKAuCl 4(aq) → 3xAgCl + xKCl + Ag 3-3x Au x . [2,3] From a kinetic point of view, the challenge is to capture in real time the formation of metal cages of Ag-Au alloys after a '3by1' atomic exchange that introduces nanoporosity and electronic strain as silver and gold have a similar atomic radius. To interrogate the driving force behind this redox process, we have also established an electrochemical methodology to extract quantitative data, allowing detailed capture of the mixed electrochemical and mass transport (diffusion) kinetics. As the precipitation product AgCl leads to pore fouling, we have developed an efficient methodology to trigger its instant dissolution as soon as it is formed, thus promoting the production of a high-quality alloy. As shown in Figure 1, upon injection of a KAuCl 4 solution into a degassed solution in contact with the GDE-Ag electrode, the open circuit potential (OCP) begins to change. This evolution is due to the modification of the electrochemical interface as silver atoms are progressively replaced by gold atoms. Thereby, leading to a regulated potential defined either by the Ag(I)/Ag redox couple, or by the Au(III)/Au pair. Interestingly, we found that the OCP variation logically depends on initial conditions such as Ag loading on the GDE, KAuCl 4 concentration, Ag particle size, etc. This fundamental knowledge has led to the synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxidation of cellulose subunits in alkaline media with an onset electrode potential much lower than OER (E < 1 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode)). Indeed, the formation of an alloy phase, the creation of nanoporosity within it and the free-standing nature amplify, through synergistic and electronic effects, the electrocatalytic efficiency.

Green hydrogen production through proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis offers a viable renewable energy storage and transport solution. The Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) are central to this technology, with the latter’s slow kinetics posing a significant bottleneck. Despite research efforts, iridium (Ir) is the only element which currently meets the stability and activity needs of OER, challenging the search for alternatives and shifting focus towards enhancing catalyst stability [1]. Recent studies have identified metal migration, particularly of Ir, as a critical factor in the degradation of PEM water electrolyzers [2]. This finding has highlighted the importance of understanding metal migration mechanisms and the need to investigate the contribution or interaction of less studied elements such as platinum (Pt), titanium (Ti), and iron (Fe) to the degradation process. This study investigates the migration of both catalytically active (Ir, Pt) and inactive (e.g., Ti, Fe, Ca) metals within PEM water electrolysis membranes, using ex-situ 2D X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping (s. Fig. 1). Tests were conducted on PEM water electrolysis single cells (active area: 4 cm 2 ) with a Nafion TM 115 catalyst-coated membrane, with anode and cathode loadings of 2.0 mgIr/cm 2 and 1.0 mgPt/cm 2 , respectively. The study entailed varying operating times (10 h, 100 h, 500 h, 1500 h) under constant load, different load profiles (e.g., open-circuit voltage (OCV) and accelerates stress test (AST) phases) for 500 h, and the introduction of specific impurities like iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) through the anodic feed water. Complementary ICP-MS analysis of the anode and cathode waters was also performed. Selected segments of the catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) were investigated using synchrotron radiation-based XRF at microXAS beamline (X05LA) of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) at 11.0, 11.4, and 11.7 keV (below and above the Ir L 3 - and Pt L 3 -edges, for IrO 2 , see e.g. ref. [3]). The beam was focused using a Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirror system. The spatial resolution of the measurements was approx. 1 μm, allowing selective identification and relative concentration of elements to be mapped within the entire cell cross-section (electrodes and polymer layer). Through our XRF analysis, it is possible to detect migration of the catalytically active materials (Ir, Pt) through the Nafion membrane depending on the degradation time. Interestingly, while impurity tests with Ca led to its accumulation in the membrane, Fe impurities introduced similarly did not show significant accumulation. These results, demonstrating the intricate details of metal migration and their varying behaviors under different operational conditions, underscore the value of high-resolution XRF mapping with synchrotron radiation in providing critical insights. This understanding is vital to unraveling the complex degradation mechanisms of PEM water electrolyzers. Further experiments may in principle allow for precise quantification of metal migration, with measurement of appropriate elemental standards. Figure 1. Schematic overview of the study: Catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) at various stages of degradation are investigated using synchrotron radiation-based X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping. This method provides a 2D elemental distribution map, as demonstrated with Iridium (Ir) in this example. Analysis of the cross-sectional distribution of the element within the membrane allows for inferences regarding its migration. We thank the SLS for providing beam-time through an accepted proposal (20221749) and appreciate the micro-XAS beamline team’s help during measurements and data processing. References [1] C.

Water electrolysis using renewable electricity is a key process for generating green hydrogen, a crucial element in the pursuit of a sustainable society. To make substantial strides in lowering the cost of green hydrogen, it is imperative to address not only the expense of the electricity involved but also the cost associated with the electrolyzer itself [1]. The current challenge lies in the materials chosen for electrolyzers operating under extreme acidic or alkaline conditions, which necessitate the use of costly corrosion-resistant components. A viable solution involves considering non-extreme pH water as an electrolyte, allowing for the utilization of affordable and readily available materials, such as iron or stainless steel, in key electrolyzer components like the frame or bipolar plate [2]. Despite the reported inferior performance of non-extreme pH electrolysis compared to extreme pH conditions, primarily due to inevitable pH shifts (resulting in concentration overpotential) and elevated solution resistance, advancements in technology and research hold the potential to overcome these challenges. Our research group has been actively engaged in the exploration of electrolyte engineering , a concept centered on optimizing the diffusion flux of buffer ions to mitigate the previously mentioned challenges in non-extreme pH conditions [3,4]. Our approach involves leveraging a dense buffer solution to maximize the flux of buffer ions, resulting in a significant reduction in concentration overpotential. This strategy becomes even more impactful when the operating temperature is elevated to the commercially viable range of 80-100 °C [5]. The synergistic effect of employing a dense buffer solution, combined with elevated temperatures, proves to be a promising avenue for advancing electrolyte engineering and optimizing the performance of electrolysis systems in non-extreme pH conditions. In this presentation, we will delve into our discoveries concerning non-noble metal electrocatalysts, specifically focusing on their efficacy in both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our research has led us to identify transition metal-based electrocatalysts that demonstrate exceptional efficiency in catalyzing OER within a carbonate buffer electrolyte at near-neutral pH [6]. Among the diverse materials we explored, the iron-nickel composite, coupled with copper or gold on electrochemically activated Ni (ECA-Ni) substrates [7], stands out as a superior performance. Notably, these electrodes exhibited a remarkable OER catalysis rate of 1 A cm −2 and an overpotential of approximately 330 mV, becoming competitive with highly alkaline counterpart. Next, our research has uncovered noteworthy electrocatalysts based on copper and molybdenum, demonstrating exceptional efficiency in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) within a carbonate buffer electrolyte at pH 10.5 [8]. The most promising sample achieved a current density of 1 A cm −2 at an overpotential of approximately 0.2 V, a performance comparable to previously reported HER results in highly alkaline conditions. Detailed characterization of these electrocatalysts unveiled that the addition of copper resulted in a rougher surface structure, contributing to the largest double-layer capacitance. These characteristics are indicative of an enlarged active surface area, which is pivotal for enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, the introduction of copper element correlated with a decreased apparent Tafel slope, suggesting a tailored nature of the active sites. These insights not only shed light on the structural modifications induced by copper but also underscore its role in optimizing the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, we integrated the previously developed HER and OER catalysts with a carefully selected polyether sulfone (PES) diaphragm [8]. This strategic combination resulted in a notable enhancement of overall cell performance within a 3.0 mol kg − 1 K-carbonate solution at pH 10.5 and a temperature of 353 K. The resultant cell performance, factoring in the series resistance, achieved a 1 A cm − 2 at a voltage of approximately 2.0 V. This achievement stands competitively against the top-class commercial alkaline electrolyzers. These findings not only highlight the feasibility of non-extreme pH electrochemical electrolyzers in industrial applications but also underscore the potential for further advancements and optimizations. The demonstrated success serves as a compelling indicator of the viability of our approach and opens avenues for refining non-extreme pH electrolysis for even greater efficiency and applicability in industrial settings.

Green hydrogen from low-temperature water electrolysis has received significant attention with a projected thousand-fold global capacity expansion by 2030. 1 Electrocatalyst research is crucial for water electrolysis technologies and has garnered substantial attention. However, despite a surge in publications centered on promising electrocatalytic materials, often claiming "outstanding" performance, few studies have scaled these materials to more realistic setups. This gap primarily stems from the inadequacy of testing environments and operating conditions in academic research. The prevalent use of three-electrode cell configurations fails to mimic practical electrolyzer conditions accurately. 2,3 Electrocatalytic performance in these setups does not effectively represent real electrolysis devices operating in zero-gap configurations. Therefore, implementing stability tests in realistic device configurations is essential to assess compounded instability from all components, including the catalyst. 2,4 Our group has developed and optimized a lab-scale electrochemical flow cell for alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), refined over four years of dedicated research ( Figure 1a ). 4–7 This work outlines the operation of this device in a laboratory environment, focusing on accelerating the evaluation of electrocatalytic materials and their durability in alkaline conditions. We examined the performance of this lab-scale electrolyzer under industrially relevant conditions, including varying temperatures ( Figure 1b ). We examined the stability of three standard electrocatalytic materials to demonstrate the electrolyzer performance under fluctuating current conditions, including a benchmark NiFe anode for the oxygen evolution reaction ( Figure 1c ) and nickel nitride (Ni 3 N) precatalyst ( Figure 1d ). Furthermore, we propose a standardized protocol for assessing electrocatalysts under fluctuating and reverse currents, contributing to the understanding of catalyst deactivation. This initiative marks a significant advancement in AWE electrocatalysis research. Our goal is to establish an effective and straightforward protocol for evaluating and validating electrocatalysts in AWE, fostering accurate performance comparisons. References: 1 J. C. Ehlers, A. A.

The quest for highly efficient durable and cost-effective electro catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a pivotal focus in the advancement of renewable energy conversion technologies. Transition metal-based alkaline media electrocatalysts have emerged as promising candidates due to their versatile electronic structures and cost effectiveness. Among these, magneto-electrocatalysts, integrating magnetic properties with electrocatalytic functionalities, represent a novel frontier in OER research. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to enhance OER performance via the utilization of pre-magnetized multi-metallic (Fe-Ni-Co ) doped electrocatalysts, harnessing electron spin polarization. We tailored the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the catalyst, promoting and validating the principle of spin polarization for augmenting OER activity. Through a comprehensive experimental study, we have investigated how the inclusion of magnetic components influences the catalytic activity, stability, and overall efficiency of the electrocatalyst during OER. Experimental methodologies involving material synthesis, characterization techniques (XRD,FE-SEM, VSM study) and electrochemical analysis are employed to assess the structural, magnetic, and electrocatalytic properties of the synthesized pre-magnetised electrocatalyst. We employed the Fe-modified Nickel foam (NF) substrate as a catalyst support. Three distinct electrocatalysts (EC) [NF/Fe-Ni, NF/Fe-Co, and NF/Fe-NiCo] were electrodeposited in two different types: (electrodeposition without magnetic field) and (electrodeposition with applied magnetic field 0.6 T). Observations revealed that for all three electrocatalyst, the electrocatalysts [which were synthesized by applying a magenetic field during eletro deposition and later on OER activity was measured in the absence of magnetic field ] exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity towards OER compared to its counterparts . The highest electrocatalytic activity is provided by NF/Fe-NiCo of 0.5 mA/cm 2 ECSA in the absence of a magnetic field and 0.533 mA/ cm 2 ECSA in the presence of magnetic field. This is superior to that of the precious metal Ru, which has a specific activity of 0.49 mA/ cm 2 ECSA at 1.5V (versus RHE). After analysing the OER performance of the catalyst, we found that the activity of NF/Fe-NiCo improved from 69.15 to 89.55 mA/ cm 2 when a magnetic field was applied. Capacitance measurements (15.16% increase) and ECSA measurements (22.1% increase) also corroborated this. The overpotential measurement decreased from 243.03 mV to 239.1 mV at 100 mA/ cm 2 . As a result, for both sets of catalysts, the magnetic field improved the current density. Comparatively OER performance in absence of magnetic field of the electrocatalyst which was synthesized by electrodeposition with applied magnetic field was better than (for the second catalyst OER activity studied under applied magnetic field. This suggests that rather than applying a magnetic field during long-term electrolysis, one may opt to apply a magnetic field during electrocatalyst production. When we compared the OER performance of these two, we discovered that NF/Fe-NiCo exhibits the greatest activity of all catalysts at 1.5V, with 91.3 mA/ cm 2 , although the percentage rise is lower than that of the other catalysts. However, compared to the rise in activity, the ECSA data reveals a significant increment of 56%. The data on capacitance and overpotential likewise correspond with the current density trend. With the lowest overpotential of 236.35 mV when measured at 100 mA/cm2, the NF/NiCo catalyst performed the best overall among all the catalysts. Our findings underscore the significance of electron spin polarization in boosting electrocatalytic performance, offering a promising avenue for the design and development of advanced catalysts for sustainable energy applications and in the context of their commercial viability and integration into industrial-scale electrochemical devices.

Local adaptation is a key evolutionary process that generates global biodiversity and is promoted by environmental heterogeneity. Most of the existing knowledge on adaptive capacity is focused on sexual organisms, while the adaptation potential of asexually reproducing eukaryotes as well as their vulnerability to environmental change remains unclear. Cyclical parthenogens of the keystone freshwater grazer Daphnia are known to be locally adapted with genetic differentiation related to environmental conditions even between neighbouring ponds. Similar patterns have been found in obligate parthenogenetic congeners, however studies on their local adaptation potential are rare. Here, we use respiration rate and whole genome sequencing to test the local adaptation of Arctic asexual polyploid Daphnia from lakes with contrasting oxygen environments. The genomic data revealed the presence of two genetic clusters which differed significantly in respiration rates, suggesting molecular evolution as an adaptive mechanism. Functional enrichment pointed to differences in metabolic processes between the two genetic clusters. Our results, combining phenotypic and whole genome sequencing data, suggest that these clones are locally adapted to low oxygen concentrations and provide support for local adaptation by evolution in an obligate parthenogen.

Developing a single electrocatalyst that can facilitate both rechargeable aqueous metal-air batteries and water splitting has become a crucial focus in renewable-energy technologies. This necessitates addressing the three distinct electrocatalytic reactions: the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Despite significant efforts, the creation of a alkaline medium based trifunctional catalyst with high activity at a low cost has proven to be a considerable challenge. Currently, Pt and its alloys have been considered as the most active catalysts for the ORR and HER, whereas noble-metal oxides such as IrO 2 and RuO 2 are considered as the golden standards of OER catalyst. However, noble-metals based catalyst have been suffered from their high cost, limited reserves in the Earth’s crust, and poor electrocatalytic stability. Moreover, these noble metals face challenges in simultaneously exhibiting trifunctional catalytic activity for ORR, OER, and HER. In recent study, Transiton metal sulfides(TMSs) have great attraction as trifunctional catalyts due to their eqrth abudance, tunnable band structure, and crystal structure. especially, one of widely used TMCs is MoS 2 because of their Pt-like high catalytic activity for HER as well as thermodynamic electrochemical stability and rich catalytic sites in the planar nature. However, the most stable 2H (hexagonal) phase MoS 2 suffers from poor electrical conductivity, low wettability, and aggregation indced reducing active catalytic sites and resulting high resistance. 2H MoS 2 also shows poor activity for OER and ORR, thereby hampering its practical applications as trifunctional catalyst. To overcome this threshold, various strategies have been conducted to improve their electrochemical charateristics, such as defect engineering, heterojunction foramtion, phase transform and integrating porosity control. However, commonly considered method to synthesis requires complex multi-steps with high temperature, vaccum system, explosive gas, and toxic etchant. In this study, we successfully synthesized the homogeneous growth of a Co-based nanometer-scale metal-organic framework (MOF) on graphene oxide at room temperature. Furthermore, a facile one-pot solvothermal method was employed to synthesize Co-MoSx/Graphene, which consists of a hollow, heterogeneous bimetallic sulfide (Co 3 S 4 /MoS 2 with Co-S-Mo bonding) within a sandwiched graphene/MoS 2 layer, demonstrating superior trifunctional activity and stability. Incorporating a conductive graphene layer between MoS 2 layers is an effective strategy for not only realizing high electrical conduction to MoS 2 layers, but also increasing MoS 2 interlayer spacing for high ion accessibility. Besides, a variety of techniques, including Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (Cs-STEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), are used to confirm the atomic configurations of Co-MoSx/Graphene structure and morphologies. Also, Raman, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were conducted to investigating the binding structure and chemical states. Furthermore, The internal electric field (IEF) within heterojunction, which induced from the differing electron density of the bimetallic species and the sandwiched graphene are contribute not only electron density structure optimization for enhancing reaction kinetics but also accelerating electron-hole exchange. The IEF in the microporous-heterostructure accelerates the diffusion of reaction intermediate with sufficient mass transport and facilitates a Graphene/MoS 2 -to-Co-MoSx pathway for enhancing redox kinetics of sluggish OER and ORR. Consequently, the OER and ORR-inactive MoS 2 , HER, and ORR-inactive Co 3 S 4 , along with less catalytically effective graphene, demonstrate outstanding performance when combined in the bimetallic sulfide based highly active heterojunctional structure. To investigate the electrochemical catalytic properties of Co-MoSx/Graphene, Rotating disk electrode(RDE) was used with three electrode measurment. The presence of MoS 2 /Graphene on Co 3 S 4 and Co-MoSx bonding species in Co-MoSx/Graphene enhances the alkaline electrochemical catalytic activity by reducing overpotential and Tafel slopes(220 mV, 110 mV dec -1 in HER and 320 mV, 55.8 mV dec -1 in OER) under 1M KOH solution. Moreover, the ORR performance was evaluated by using Koutecky-Levich (K-L) Plot with different rotating speeds under 0.1M KOH. The electron transfer number (n) is closed theoretical value of 4.0 also shows outstanding performance of the onset potential, half-wave potential and kinetic current density (0.88 V, 0.67 V, and 10.4 mA cm -2 ), which is comparable that of Pt/C (0.92 V, 0.8 V, and 10.3 mA cm-2). Furthermore, Co-MoSx/G based rechargeable Zinc-Air battery achieve over 85% of theoretical zinc utilization efficiency and 1.4 times higher power density than a Pt/C + RuO 2 air cathode based system. We believe that this work could provide a rational strategy for achieve trifunctional electrocatalyst and high performance self-powered hydrogen production system.

Introduction Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis (WE) is a promising technology for hydrogen production. However, the local environment of the anode in PEMWE is highly acidic and high potential due to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER; 2H 2 O → O 2 + 4H + + 4e - ), and the available anode materials are limited to precious metal elements such as Pt, Ru and Ir. In the current technology, Ir-based materials are the mainstream anode catalysts, and Ir loading of 1-2 mg/cm 2 is necessary to achieve both activity and durability. On the other hand, the annual production of Ir is said to be only 5-7 tons. The demand for hydrogen is expected to increase to the GW scale in the future. For example, if water electrolysis is operated at 2 A/cm 2 and 2 V with Ir loading of 2 mg/cm 2 (0.5 mg Ir /W), it is difficult to meet the demand with the existing Ir resources. Tosoh have been engaged in the electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) business. EMD is synthesized thorough anodic oxidation of Mn 2+ ion (Mn 2+ + 2H 2 O → MnO 2 + 4H + + 2e - ) under acidic conditions, therefore it is potentially suitable for the anode environment of PEMWE. In this study, a very small amount of Ir (<0.1 mg/cm 2 ) was successfully composited with EMD. The resulting composite consisting of Ir and EMD showed more active than commercial Ir oxide with the same Ir content, and operated stably for at least 1000 h. Experiment EMD thin film was electrodeposited anodically on Pt-coated Ti fibers (Pt/Ti) thorough electrolyzing a mixed solution of MnSO 4 and H 2 SO 4 . The obtained EMD-coated Pt/Ti were immersed in an Ir-containing solution, and then annealed to obtain Ir-containing EMD (hereinafter referred to as "Ir-EMD"). The Pt-coated Ti fibers are used as a porous transport layer (PTL) in PEMWE cells, and our developed material serves as both an OER catalyst and a PTL. OER property was evaluated using a PEMWE cell at 80°C in a two-electrode system. Pt-supported carbon was used as the cathode catalyst and Nafion®-115 as the PEM. See Fig. 1 for PEMWE cell construction flow. Result and discussion The Ir content in Ir-EMD was determined to be 0.1 mg/cm 2 by ICP-AES. This Ir content is 10-20 times lower than that used in current PEMWE electrolyzers. The OER activity of Ir-EMD was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 2). For comparison, EMD (with no Ir) and Ir oxide (commercial product) with an Ir content of 0.1 mg/cm 2 were evaluated in the same way. The slow OER property of EMD was improved dramatically by introducing Ir into EMD. Also, at the same amount of Ir, Ir-EMD exhibited higher OER activity than that of Ir oxide. The inset in Fig. 2 shows Tafel plots corresponding to LSVs, and the slope of the linear region (Tafel slope) can be used to predict which elementary reaction is the rate-limiting step in the OER. The Tafel slope of Ir-EMD is 58 mV/dec., which is close to the Tafel slope of Ir oxide, 50 mV/dec. This suggests that OER on Ir-EMD proceeds by the same mechanism as Ir oxide. The durability of Ir-EMD and Ir oxide was tested at a current density of 2 A/cm 2 (Fig. 3). Ir oxide was deactivated within only 8 days, and it is confirmed that Ir have disappeared after electrolysis. On the other hand, Ir-EMD has operated stably for more than 42 days (≈1000 h), with a degradation rate of only 13 μV/h. In other words, Ir-EMD has practical durability while reducing the amount of Ir by more than 10 times compared to current technology.

In memory of Prof. Sri Narayanan, this presentation will showcase the electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction in the context of oxygen depolarization cathode (ODC) for electrolyzer applications. Fundamentals of HER/HOR in alkaline pH will be presented in the context of various theories proposed to rationalize pH, cations, and structure effects. It will be shown that none of them can effectively explain all observations. In this presentation, four schools of thought for HER/HOR will be discussed, focusing on the strengths and shortcomings of each hypothesis and highlighting the magnitude of electrochemical interface structure in hydrogen electrocatalysis. Translation of these fundamental concepts into a durable electrocatalyst will be presented as a functionalized mono-metallic Ni catalyst concept. Durability results will be presented from both steady-state operation and uncontrolled shutdown conditions. These will be presented in conjunction with anion exchange membranes such as VersogenÒ, OrionÒ. Another cathodic process in the context of electrolysis is the oxygen-depolarized cathode, typically paired with anodic processes, such as chlorine generation. ODC cathode using coordinated Fe-N-C catalysts will be presented in the context of hydrochloric acid recovery, where activity and durability in the context of both fundamentals of oxygen reduction reaction mechanism and effects of uncontrolled shutdown will be presented.

The onset of Darwinian evolution represents a key step in the transition of chemical systems into living ones. Here, we show the emergence of Darwinian evolution in two systems of self-replicating molecules, where natural selection favors replicator mutants best capable of catalyzing the production of the precursors required for their own replication. Such selection for protometabolic activity was observed in a system where trimer and hexamer replicators compete for common resources, as well as in a system of different hexamer replicator mutants. An out-of-equilibrium replication-destruction regime was implemented in a flow reactor, where replication from continuously supplied dithiol building blocks needs to keep up with “destruction” by outflow. Selection occurred based on the ability of the mutants to activate a cofactor that photocatalytically produces singlet oxygen which, in turn, enhances the rate by which dithiol building blocks are converted into disulfide-based replicator precursors. Selection was based on a functional trait (catalytic activity) opening up Darwinian evolution as a tool for catalyst development. This work functionally integrates self-replication with protometabolism and Darwinian evolution and marks a further advance in the de-novo synthesis of life.

Over the last decades, several studies have reported the effect of traces of iron species on the improvement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics for nickel-based anode materials in alkaline media. [1] However, the effect of iron impurities on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still a subject to debate. For instance, at low iron concentrations (0.03 – 0.5 ppm) a loss of the HER activity for Ni surface is observed due to the electrochemical deposition of less active Fe. [2,3] Other studies showed less deactivation behavior of the Ni cathode at 3 and 14 ppm iron ion concentration over time. [2,4] This improvement of the lifetime of the Ni electrode in the presence of iron cations is very likely related to the increased surface roughness by Fe electrodeposition and thereby the decrease in the formation of inactive NiH species. [2] Systematic investigations on Fe sputtered Ni surfaces with different coverages showed that ≥ 60% of Fe coverage stabilizes the Ni cathode by preventing hydrogen diffusion through the Ni lattice at constant current density of -100 mA cm -2 . [5] Generally, the role of Fe impurities on the HER activity for nickel cathode surface in alkaline environments is still unclear to date. In this work, we comprehensively evaluated the influence of the iron ion concentration on the long-term HER performance for a polycrystalline Ni electrode by using rotating disc electrode (RDE) setup. The changes in HER activity as a function of the iron ion concentration was correlated with resulting surface roughness and layer thickness/coverage of the electrodeposited iron. Highly purified 0.1 M KOH was used as basic electrolyte solution and mixed with iron ion concentrations in the range of <1, 6 and 14 ppm. The initial HER activity on the Ni surface is unchanged irrespective of the iron ion concentration added into the electrolyte. However, at iron ion concentrations of <1 ppm and 6 ppm, the chronopotentiometric (CP) experiments at -10 mA cm -2 for 24 hours show a potential drop of ~70 mV and ~53 mV, respectively, resulting in a deactivation of the Ni surface by forming NiH species. Very interestingly, high iron ion concentrations (e.g. ~14 ppm) lead to an almost constant potential (~ 1 - 7 mV drop) during the CP experiment, by reducing the formation of inactive NiH. The electrochemically treated Ni electrodes were then characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy in combination of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The SEM micrographs show iron particles electrodeposited uniformly on the polycrystalline Ni surface after the CP experiments with < 1, 6 and 14 ppm of iron ion concentrations in 0.1 M KOH. The analysis of the EDX maps reveals a coverage of 17, 54 and 58 % on the Ni surface at iron ion concentrations of < 1, 6 and 14 ppm, respectively. Obviously, iron ion concentrations of 6 and 14 pm show very similar coverages on the Ni surface, indicating their minor role on the HER activity. We suggest that during the HER the hydrogen bubbles suppress the formation of a dense and complete iron layer on the Ni electrode surface. The spatial distribution and thickness of the electrodeposited Fe particles were also evaluated after 1 h and 24 h of CP experiments with < 1, 6 and 14 ppm iron ion concentrations by using micro-XRF equipped with a polycapillary lens of 20 µm. Thicker iron layers after 24 hours are formed at high iron ion concentrations, preventing the hydrogen diffusion into Ni lattice to form inactive NiH species and to maintain the HER activity over time under alkaline conditions. In summary, we show that traces of iron impurities have a huge impact on the long-term durability of polycrystalline Ni electrodes for HER in alkaline environments. A critical iron ion concentration is required to suppress the formation of inactive NiH species during the HER at -10 mA cm -2 for 24 h and/or to electrodeposite enough iron for maintaining the HER kinetics on the polycrystalline Ni electrodes in alkaline environments.

Reversible Solid Oxide Cells (RSOCs) stand out as highly efficient and cost-effective devices for energy storage and conversion. However, the pursuit of high-performance and durable RSOCs is impeded by the lack of efficient and stable oxygen electrodes. The conventional trial-and-error approach used for the development of oxygen electrodes is resources and time-consuming. In this presentation, we introduce a novel "two-stage machine learning" approach designed to expedite the discovery of optimal oxygen electrodes for efficient oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) in SOCs. In the initial stage, we employed a high-throughput calculation approach to generate four ORR/OER related descriptors (energy above the convex hull, p-band center, d-band center, and vacancy formation energy) for a set of 4455 perovskite oxide candidates. Subsequently, we successfully predicted these descriptors using machine learning techniques based on the fundamental physico-chemical features of the candidates. Moving to the second stage, we measured the polarization resistances - directly related to ORR/OER activity - of 142 oxygen electrodes and employed them as prediction targets. Through our machine learning method, we accurately predicted experimental results based on the fundamental physico-chemical features of the candidate materials. Notably, among the 4455 candidates studied, a specific oxygen electrode material is predicted to exhibit both high activity and stability. When applied to an RSOC based on a proton-conducting electrolyte operated at 600 °C, a high peak power density of >1.5 W cm −2 is demonstrated in the fuel cell mode, and a high current density of >2.5 A cm −2 is achieved at a cell voltage of 1.3 V in the water electrolysis mode while maintaining stable operation for 500 hours.

In recent decades, the high-energy demand has generated interest in renewable energies and has become a more pressing issue for the development of cost-effective and eco-friendly conversion and storage technologies. 1 Solar conversion systems are very attractive to address this problem, either in photovoltaic systems or in systems that store solar energy in chemical form ("solar fuels"). 2-3 However, there are challenges in terms of functionality, such as (1) finding suitable materials for photon absorption and (2) developing materials for the water electrolysis reaction to produce hydrogen as a solar fuel. 4 Materials include catalysts and catalyst supports that allow a stable operation of a cell. Sb-doped tin oxide (ATO) has recently been used as an electrocatalyst support under acidic conditions and proposed as an alternative to F-doped tin oxide (FTO). In this talk, we will address our studies in acidic media of the fundamental electrochemistry of ATO to determine the potential window corresponding to the operation of the material in acid solutions. Experimental. The experiments were performed in a 3-electrode cell. A glassy carbon electrode of 0.0706 cm 2 surface area was used as working electrode (WE), a graphite rod of 0.618 cm diameter as counter electrode (CE), and an Ag/AgCl as reference electrode (RE). The RE was placed in a double junction, and the electrolyte used was a 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution (Ultrex® II Ultrapure Reagent). Electrochemical measurements were made on a CH instruments electrochemical workstation potentiostat (CHI 760D). Open circuit potential (OCP) and cyclic voltammograms (CV) were collected. The electrolyte was deoxygenated with Ar, and an Ar blanket was kept on top of the electrochemical cell surface. Cavaliere and coworkers had synthesized an antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) with microwaves 5 and carried out different studies regarding the applications of ATO as support toward proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) 6 . Our studies of ATO were mainly focused on the electrochemical activity of anodic potentials. Figure 1 shows two oxidation peaks: one at 0.147 V and the other at -0.253 V both vs NHE. We have assigned the peak at 0.147 V to tin dissolution because of the potentials for SnO 2 reduction: 7 The material exhibits a potential window of more than one volt in acidic media, which we propose corresponds to the thermodynamic stability of ATO. The anodic and cathodic limits, and the effect of Sb doping on the SnO 2 material will be discussed in detail in the presentation.

Heterostructures of visible light-absorbing semiconductors were prepared through the growth of ZnIn2S4 crystallites in the presence of CdS nanostructures. A variety of hybrid compositions was synthesized. Both reference samples and heterostructured materials were characterized in detail, regarding their morphology, crystalline character, chemical speciation, as well as vibrational properties. The abovementioned physicochemical characterization suggested the absence of doping phenomena, such as the integration of either zinc or indium ions into the CdS lattice. At specific compositions, the growth of the amorphous ZnIn2S4 component was observed through both XRD and Raman analysis. The development of heterojunctions was found to be composition-dependent, as indicated by the simultaneous recording of the Raman profiles of both semiconductors. The optical band gaps of the hybrids range at values between the corresponding band gaps of reference semiconductors. The photocatalytic activity was assessed in both organic dye degradation and hydrogen peroxide evolution. It was observed that the hybrids demonstrating efficient photocatalytic activity in dye degradation were rather poor photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide evolution. Specifically, the hybrids enriched in the CdS component were shown to act efficiently for hydrogen peroxide evolution, whereas ZnIn2S4-enriched hybrids demonstrated high potential to photodegrade an azo-type organic dye. Furthermore, scavenging experiments suggested the involvement of singlet oxygen in the mechanistic path for dye degradation.

In pursuit of enhancing the photostability of chlorophyll, a novel organic-inorganic hybrid pigment has been synthesized via a supramolecular intercalation assembly method, incorporating cerium-ion-doped hydrotalcite as the host matrix and chlorophyll as the intercalated guest molecule. This innovative pigment amalgamates the vivid coloration properties of organic dyes with the robust stability characteristic of inorganic substances. Determined from the detailed investigation of the structural evolution of chlorophyll during photodegradation, the dual physicochemical protection mechanism is critical to the advancement of chlorophyll photostability. It leverages the oxygen barrier attributes of the hydrotalcite's laminate structure and the ultraviolet light absorption and scattering capabilities of CeO

The coexistence of a viral and tuberculous respiratory infection increases mortality and the transition to a severe form in both directions. We report an observation for a 55-year-old woman with untreated diffuse interstitial pnuemopathy, investigated by immunological and infectious tests, and found negative for pulmonary tuberculosis. Bronchial biopsies revealed non-specific inflammation, responsible for chronic dyspnea. Having presented ten days previously with myalgias, fatigue, dry cough and fever, with worsening of basic dyspnoea, without digestive or neurological manifestations, she was referred to the emergency department, where physical examination showed SpO2 at 80% on room air, reduced to 92% under 15 L/mn delivered via a high-concentration mask, polypnoea at 40 cycles per minute with bilateral diffuse crackling rales on auscultation, scattering just the anterior quadrants. The initial evolution was favorable, with clinical improvement in oxygen saturation to 94% on two liters per minute of oxygen delivered by nasal cannula, with respiratory rate at 23 cycles per minute with modest effort tolerance. On day 18 of hospitalization, she presented with a febrile peak of 38.3°C, polypnoea at 33 cycles per minute, increased oxygen requirements with a flow rate of 6l/m by face mask to reach an oxygen saturation of 92%, tachycardia at 130 beats per minute, and was therefore readmitted to intensive care with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with imipenem and amikacin. Multiplex PCR showing no germ, and a PCR test for pulmonary tuberculosis on a sputum sample which was positive, prompting the introduction of antibacillary treatment based on a fixed quadric-association of rifampicin, isoniaside, pyrazinaamide and ethombutol. Non-specific antibiotic therapy was discontinued after improvement of the inflammatory syndrome, and antibacillary treatment is still ongoing. Conclusion: Through this observation we discuss the difficulties in terms of diagnosis, management and outcome of a coinfection by SARS-COV 19 and mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Water electrolysis (WE) is a promising route for carbon-free production of green hydrogen, which is increasingly considered to be an important energy carrier. Among the low-temperature WE technologies, anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) has the potential advantages of high operating current densities and low cost due to the use of zero-gap assembly and platinum group metal (PGM)-free components, respectively [1]. However, significant challenges remain for this technology, including low efficiency, insufficient durability, and poor performance in pure water operation. Recent efforts have yielded improvements in the individual components, particularly the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts and anion exchange polymers; however, to further improve the performance of the AEMWE, it is also necessary to understand and improve the integration of these materials into the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Within the MEA, the anode and cathode catalyst layers (CLs) incorporate catalyst and ion-conducting and/or binding polymers, which are deposited onto either the membrane or the porous transport layer. The material properties of each component, as well as the loadings of the catalyst and ionomer and methods of dispersion and deposition, have significant impact on the catalyst layer morphology and uniformity [2]. These CL properties affect the transport of electrons, hydroxide ions, and evolved gases, ultimately controlling the accessibility and utilization of catalyst active sites, with significant consequences for both the performance and durability of AEMWEs. Most of the effort in catalyst development for AEMWE has focused on the OER, aiming to improve sluggish kinetics and improve stability at the highly oxidizing operating potentials. A number of PGM-free catalysts have shown promising activity in rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests, particularly oxides with varying ratios of Ni, Fe, and Co. The activity improvements with tuning the composition are often attributed to the increase in surface area and shift in redox potentials for the in-situ conversion to higher valence sites with higher intrinsic OER activity. However, these activity trends do not always translate into device-level performance because of differences in the operating environment, e.g. hydroxide concentration, reaction rates, etc. In the AEMWE, where typically an order of magnitude higher loadings and current densities are required, the challenges of conductivity and mass transport to allow for full site access are exacerbated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a valuable tool for understanding the origin of voltage losses in the AEMWE, typically broken down into ohmic, kinetic, and mass transport losses. Recently, a transmission line model has been applied to non-Faradaic EIS to isolate another contribution to voltage loss: the catalyst layer resistance (CLR), which corresponds to in-plane and through-plane electronic and ionic resistances in the catalyst layer [3]. Using this approach, the roles of intrinsic catalyst activity and catalyst layer properties can be decoupled, helping to guide materials integration efforts. In this study, we investigate two types of OER catalyst materials, NiFe- and Co-based oxides. Within each composition, the catalysts have similar active sites but vary in electronic conductivity, crystal structure, and surface area. By comparing the AEMWE performance at different catalyst loadings, we are able to determine the role of catalyst properties in determining active site utilization and electronic resistance within the catalyst layer. Figure 1 shows the trends in performance and ohmic and catalyst layer resistance as a function of loading for high-conductivity (Co@Co 3 O 4 ) and low-conductivity (Co 3 O 4 ) catalysts. Despite nominally having the same surface chemistry and similar particle morphology, they display both different performance and different trends with loading. Using in-situ EIS diagnostics and ex-situ characterization of the catalyst layer morphology, the relationship between catalyst utilization, CLR, and the physical properties of the catalyst and catalyst layer is elucidated. This work provides insight into the catalyst properties that most strongly affect AEMWE performance, as well as how materials integration strategies must be tailored based on these properties.

Layered oxides exhibiting anionic redox activity have gained attention as a promising material in both Na-ion batteries owing to their additional capacity provided through oxygen redox chemistry. However, unfavorable side effects such as irreversible phase transformation, hysteresis, and gas evolution, usually arise during the stabilization process of the unstable electron holes generated by the redox reaction of oxygen. To address these challenges, we co-dope Cu and Ca in the pristine Na x [Mg 0.28 Mn 0.72 ]O 2 (NMMO) and propose the P2-type Na x Ca 0.03 Mg 0.22 Cu 0.11 Mn 0.67 O 2 (NCaMCMO) Na-deficient cathode material which demonstrates high specific capacity with minimal phase change. In this work, we employed the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the synergistic modification strategy in both transition metal and alkali metal layers. The substitution of electrochemically active Cu induced variations in the electronic structure near the Fermi level, indicating an inherent change in redox chemistry. The computational results of the local structure provide a deeper understanding of the oxygen-stabilizing effect of Cu. Furthermore, we analyze the nature of the Ca insertion as a pillar in an alkali-metal layer, which mitigates phase transformation to the kinetically unfavorable O2 phase through phase energy comparison. The calculations manifest that Ca doping effectively extends the P2 phase into a deeper charging state.

Abstract Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R‐PCECs) have garnered significant attention owing to their proficiency in efficiently converting and storing energy. The performance of R‐PCECs is largely limited by the activity and durability of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions in air electrodes. Herein, an Nb and Y doped cobalt‐based double perovskite of PrBaCo 1.8 Nb 0.1 Y 0.1 O 5+δ (denoted as PBCNY) is reported. The perovskite is however in situ assembled into a deficient‐PrBa 1−x Co 1.8 Nb 0.1−x Y 0.1−x O 5+δ parental phase and a Ba 2 YNbO 6 secondary phase during operation, accordingly demonstrating a low area‐specific resistance of 0.24 Ω cm 2 at 600 °C. The high activity is attributed to the enhancement in oxygen vacancy concentration, oxygen surface exchange, and bulk diffusion coefficient, confirmed by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrical conductivity relaxation. At 700 °C, when the PBCNY cathode is applied as air electrodes for R‐PCECs, a peak power density of 1.99 W cm −2 and a current density of −5.20 A cm −2 (at 1.3 V) are achieved in fuel cell (FC) mode, and electrolysis (EL) mode with appropriate Faradaic efficiencies. Furthermore, R‐PCECs with PBCNY air electrodes display promising operational stability in FC mode (over 100 h), EL mode (over 200 h), and reversible cyclic testing (29 cycles for 120 h).

Abstract One of the central issues in the understanding of early cellular evolution is the characterisation of the cenancestor. This includes the description of the chemical nature of its genome. The disagreements on this question comprise several proposals, including the possibility that AlkB-mediated methylation repair of alkylated RNA molecules may be interpreted as evidence of a cenancestral RNA genome. We present here an evolutionary analysis of the cupin-like protein superfamily based on tertiary structure-based phylogenies that includes the oxygen-dependent AlkB and its homologs. Our results suggest that the repair of methylated RNA molecules is the outcome of the enzyme substrate ambiguity, and doesn´t necessarily indicates that the last common ancestor was endowed with an RNA genome.

In‐situ construction of active structure under reaction conditions is highly desired but still remains challenging in many important catalytic processes. Herein, we observe structural evolution of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) into highly active molybdenum carbide (MoCx) during reverse water‐gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Surface oxygen atoms in various Mo‐based catalysts are removed in H2‐containing atmospheres and then carbon atoms can accumulate on surface to form MoCx phase with the RWGS reaction going on, both of which are enhanced by the presence of intercalated H species or Pt‐dopants in MoOx. The structural evolution from MoOx to MoCx is accompanied by enhanced CO2 conversion, which is positively correlated with the surface C/Mo ratio but negatively with the surface O/Mo ratio. As a result, an unprecedented CO formation rate of 7544.6 mmol·gcatal‐1·h‐1 at 600 °C has been achieved over in‐situ carbonized H‐intercalated MoO3 catalyst, which is even higher than those from noble metal catalysts. During 100 h stability test only a minimal deactivation rate of 2.3% is observed.

Rechargeable batteries are reliable and highly efficient energy storage devices providing high energy density at high voltages with the lead of the Li-ion technology since the early 1990s. Despite these promising advantages, the strongly limited abundance of Li and also that of other elements contained in a Li-ion battery (LIB) leads to the search for low-cost and more abundant alternatives. Especially for stationary storage devices alternative battery technologies are required. Alternative chemistries, such as those based on lithium conversion or alloying, can actually lead to higher energy density compared to the lithium (de)intercalation one.Among them, the lithium-sulfur (Li/S) conversion process appeared as one of the most promising candidates to achieve a lithium battery with enhanced performances compared to the state-of-art. In fact, sulfur electrode can deliver in lithium cell a theoretical capacity and energy density as high as 1675 mAh g S −1 and 2600 Wh kg −1 Unfortunately, soluble polysulfides can migrate and directly react with the lithium anode or shuttle between anode and cathode throughout a continuous process without any charge accumulation. This leads to efficiency decrease, active material loss or even to short circuits and cell failure, whilst insoluble polysulfides can precipitate into the cell and cause resistance increase and capacity fading. The characteristic electrochemical process involving at the cathode side the electro-deposition/dissolution of soluble species focused the attention on the nature of the current collector. Hence, flat and thin metal supports ( e.g ., bare Al current collector) may lead to poor performances due to high overall impedance of the cell and modest ability in allowing the complex multi-step reaction pathway, whilst thicker porous supports ( e.g ., gas diffusion layer, GDL) can enhance the cell response, reduce the impedance and actually boost the kinetics of the Li/S process, but suffer from its higher thickness, lowering down the volumetric energy density of the overall cell.In this view, graphene-based materials can actually allow the thinnest configuration of a carbon-coated metal support and hold, at the same time, a suitable Li/S process due to their characteristic morphology, mechanical stability and enhanced electronic conductivity. In regard to this, research activities are going to be presented about an exploited binder-free few layer graphene (FLG) thin carbon-coated Aluminum support for application in a Li/S cell with excellent characteristics in terms of stability, efficiency and delivered capacity. Conversion electrodes play also an important role for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) being a promising alternative, since Na cells show similar properties to the Li analogues in many cases, while they are based on more environmentally friendly and/or more abundant materials. The use of SIBs often results slightly lower energy densities and cell voltages than those of LIBs, but they still provide significantly better values than lead-acid batteries, which are currently dominating the market in terms of annually manufactured capacity. Tin (Sn) and its compounds are well investigated alloy electrodes for SIBs as tin provides a very high theoretical specific capacity of 847 mAh g −1 . Sn is an example that shows even better capacity retention when used in SIBs compared to its use in LIBs. Moreover, transition metal compounds containing phosphorus (P) and/or sulfur (S) are promising conversion electrodes as well, since these elements enable high specific volumetric and/or gravimetric capacities in LIBs and SIBs. In addition to LIBs and SIBs, zinc batteries are also attracting research interest due to their environmental friendliness and their applicability with aqueous electrolytes. However, especially zinc-air batteries are well established for use as primary cells, but when considered for use as secondary cells, they suffer from their low rechargeability. Despite great research efforts to solve these problems, no established system has yet been able to achieve reasonable rechargeability in the context of using the commonly considered alkaline electrolytes. However, Sun et al. (2021) found a promising approach using Zn(OTf) 2 salt in a small amount of water as an electrolyte. This approach enables the formation of zinc peroxide (ZnO 2 ) instead of formation the irreversible zinc oxide (ZnO) in alkaline electrolytes, which deposits on the gas diffusion layer electrode, blocking the oxygen evolution reaction. ZnO 2 , on the other hand, has been shown to be highly reversibly malleable. In our current project WaZABi, we are trying another approach using a freeze-cast zinc anode, which enables high porosity, and the application of a hybrid electrolyte under participance of a polymer for rechargeable high performance zinc air batteries.

In pursuit of realizing a hydrogen-based economy, the challenge lies in enhancing the efficiency of crucial water electrolysis technologies. Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) holds promise as an ecologically friendly method for H 2 production, primarily due to its capacity for employing non-precious metals as electrocatalysts, in contrast to more costly options which can only switch to noble metals such as ruthenium or iridium. However, this technology faces a significant challenge arising from the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which constrains the overall efficiency. [1] Furthermore, the limited stability of many OER catalysts alternatives developed at lab scale and less harsh conditions poses a substantial obstacle to the commercialization of this technology.[2] To overcome this issue, the development of highly active OER catalysts that maintain their activity under industrial conditions is of major importance explaining the growing attention that this topic is gaining in literature. Nevertheless, most of the reported systems are tested at low current densities under easily manageable conditions in the laboratory (≤ 100 mA cm -2 , 1 M KOH, RT). Without disagreeing that this approach is necessary to identify promising options among the numerous catalyst systems, it is not sufficient when competing with existing technologies that already achieve high current densities. In this context, we investigate a low-cost, abundantly available non-precious metal based OER-catalyst under industrially relevant conditions (≤ 1.2 A cm -2 , 30 wt.-% KOH, 80 °C). The synthesis is based on a multistep galvanic deposition method introduced by Wu et al [3], receiving a highly porous NiFeOOH catalyst. Addressing the complexity of the multiphase process of AWE that involves gas-liquid-solid interfaces, the catalyst system is transferred to numerous nickel electrodes with different 3D geometries (plain woven mesh, knitted mesh, expanded metal mesh) for the investigation of their impact on bubble formation and detachment. To further optimize the catalyst system a variation of the iron content with respect to its’ molar fraction relatively to nickel has been carried out from x(Fe)=0 to x(Fe)=0.75, which after synthesis were first examined using SEM and EDS. The structure can be considered as pompom-shaped particles, forming a porous framework, as can be seen exemplarily in Figure 1a) on a knitted nickel-wire mesh coated with NiFeOOH. Observing variations in iron content, it becomes evident that a higher iron content results in larger particle sizes, thereby altering pore sizes. However, the surface morphologies of each catalyst until a molar fraction x(Fe)=0.5 is reached, can be considered as very similar. When comparing the SEM images of the mesh with a molar fraction x(Fe)=0.75 to the other molar fractions, a secondary phase becomes apparent on the surface. Notably, the porous structure persists within the crystalline phase. It could be shown by EDS that the target values for the molar fractions set in the galvanic bath and the actual molar fractions nearly show no deviations. Further, a uniform dispersion of Ni, Fe and O is observed. The electrochemical investigation of the prepared catalysts was done in a 3-electrode PTFE beaker cell setup in 30 wt % KOH and at 80 °C. The measurement protocol we introduce consists of galvanostatic steps between 0-1.2 A cm -2 . The stability is tested chronopotentiometrically as well by maintaining a current density of 500 mA cm -2 for 100 h. It becomes apparent that no optimum is reached in the tested range of iron content and that the potential continues to drop as the molar fraction of Fe increases, achieving the lowest potential with 1.38 V vs. RHE at 50 mA cm -2 and 1.42 V vs. RHE at 750 mA cm -2 with x(Fe)=0.75. It could be further proved that the NiFeOOH catalyst with x(Fe)=0.75 is a highly stable catalyst, resulting in a potential increase of 27 mV over 100 h of testing at 500 mA cm -2 , making it to an appropriate OER catalyst for the application in the AWE. The highly porous structure is maintained after testing, proved by SEM imaging. The iron contents after testing are also very similar, which means that there is almost no iron loss in the coating. For the different tested electrode geometries coated with NiFeOOH (x(Fe)=0.5), similar activity is observed, shown in Figure 1b) with a ranging potential between 1.38 V to 1.41 V vs. RHE at 50 mA cm -2 and 1.42 V to 1.45 V vs. RHE at 750 mA cm -2 .

In the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction system, the bubble will cover the reaction area on the photoelectrode surface, affecting the reaction impedance and gas-liquid mass transfer. A laser irradiation system was built and coupled with an electrochemical workstation and high-speed microscopic imaging system. The evolution behavior and mass transfer characteristics of single O<sub>2</sub> bubble on the TiO<sub>2</sub> photoelectrode were studied at different electrolyte concentrations (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1-2.0 mol/L). With the increase of electrolyte concentration from 0.1 mol/L to 2.0 mol/L, the solution resistance and bubble additional resistance decrease, and the overpotential in the stable growth stage of bubble decreases from 0.113 V to -0.089 V. The bubble will cause the fluctuation of overpotential in the nucleation, growth and detachment stages, which is consistent with the impedance change caused by the change of dissolved oxygen concentration in the liquid phase. By analyzing the correlation between gas evolution efficiency and bubble coverage, it is found that the increase of electrolyte concentration would lead to the simultaneous decrease of bubble coverage and gas evolution efficiency. By calculating the Sherwood dimensionless number, the results show that the total convective mass transfer coefficient increases with the electrolyte concentration. Single-phase natural convection plays a dominant role in the process of gas product transfer, and its mass transfer coefficient is one order of magnitude larger than that of bubble-induced convection. In summary, by adjusting the electrolyte concentration, the bubble on the gas evolution photoelectrode surface can be effectively removed and the mass transfer of the system can be optimized, which is of great significance for improving the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Introduction Plastic photoreforming using photocatalysts is a solar-powered technology that facilitates the generation of hydrogen (H 2 ) from water while simultaneously breaking down plastic waste into valuable organic products. While the focus in the past few decades has predominantly centered on enhancing the H 2 production efficiency, recent attention has shifted towards selective plastic oxidation reactions (U. Nwosu, et al . Renew. Sust. Energ. Rev. , 2021, 148, 111266). However, the investigation of effective cocatalysts for selective oxidation of plastic compounds has not been well studied. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) system offers a promising approach by segregating the anodic and cathodic processes, thereby enabling a more concentrated focus on the oxidation reaction in the design of reactions. In this study, we evaluate the BiVO 4 photoanode modified with various cocatalysts, for example, cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) for the oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), a crucial component in the formation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Additionally, we introduce acetonitrile (MeCN) into the reactant mixture to suppress the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which otherwise competes with the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR), creating a more conducive reaction environment for enhanced efficiency. Materials and Methods The BiVO 4 photoanode on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was fabricated as previously reported (V. Andrei, et al. Adv. Energy Mater , 2018, 8, 1801403). Briefly,BiOI precursor was electrochemically deposited on the FTO glass and then drop-casted a vanadyl acetylacetonate [VO(acac) 2 ] solution onto the surface and heated at 723 K for 60 min. The deposition of the Co-Pi cocatalyst onto BiVO 4 was achieved by photoassisted electrodeposition method. The obtained photoanodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). PEC measurements were carried out using a three-electrode configuration under simulated solar irradiation (100 mW cm − 2 , AM 1.5G). The experiments were performed in various solutions containing 1 M EG: 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 in H 2 O, 0.1 M NaClO 4 in MeCN, and the mixed solution of MeCN and H 2 O. Product analysis was performed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR). Results and discussion According to the XRD and SEM results, the formation of nanoporous BiVO 4 film on FTO glass was confirmed. To assess the PEC performance for EGOR using BiVO 4 electrode, we carried out the experiments under conditions with and without the EG substrate ( Figure (a) ). With the addition of EG, a notable shift of the onset potential from 0.6 V RHE to 0.5 V RHE was observed. In addition, the photocurrent density at 1.2 V RHE increased from 0.67 mA/cm 2 to 0.92 mA/cm 2 . This result indicates that EGOR is more favorable on the BiVO 4 surface compared to OER. The Co-Pi cocatalyst deposition on the BiVO 4 notably increased the current under both conditions, with and without the EG substrate. Although Co-Pi is commonly recognized for its catalytic role in OER, our experiment surprisingly revealed its positive impact on EG performance as well. The Co-Pi/BiVO 4 photoanode exhibited a negative shift of the onset potential to 0.3 V RHE and an enhancement of photocurrent density to 2.04 mA/cm 2 at 1.2 V RHE for EGOR compared to bare BiVO 4 . Additionally, the Co-Pi/BiVO 4 photoanode showed 16.9% and 2.7% faradaic efficiencies (FE) for formate and glyoxal production, respectively, while bare BiVO 4 exhibited 10.6% FE for formate and no glyoxal production. Under aqueous conditions, the FE for EGOR is currently low due to the competition between OER and EGOR. To overcome this challenge and enhance the EGOR efficiency, we introduced MeCN into the aqueous solution because MeCN has higher (more positive) anodic oxidation potential than the aqueous medium (L. M. Reid, et al . Sustainable Energy Fuels , 2018, 2, 1905-1927). In the MeCN-water mixed solution (MeCN:water = 9:1), OER was effectively suppressed to 0.33 mA/cm 2 , while EGOR was significantly enhanced to 2.50 mA/cm 2 at 1.2 V RHE potential ( Figure (b) ). This MeCN-water mixed solvent created a more favorable environment for EGOR on bare BiVO 4 , resulting in a notable increase in FE for formate to 19.8% and FE for glyoxal to 13.2%, which represents a 1.87 and 4.89 times improvement, respectively, compared to the pure aqueous condition. Conclusions The deposition of Co-Pi cocatalyst on the BiVO 4 film improved the photocurrent density and FE for formate production. Moreover, the introduction of MeCN in the solvent created a more favolable reaction condition for EGOR, suppressing OER and increasing the EGOR activity. Figure 1

Abstract Coupled electrolyzer is a desirable way to realize efficient energy conversion from electricity to chemical energy. Using coupled electrolyzers highly valuable chemicals (e.g., H 2 , CH x COO − , nitrile, S, NH 3 , CO) can be obtained at low voltages, environmental pollutants can be alleviated, and wastewater (e.g., ammonia, urea, hydrazine) can be recycled. They are even helpful to realize the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Compared to traditional chemical methods, small molecule‐based coupled electrolyzers are more cost‐efficient. This review summarizes state‐of‐art of coupled electrolyzers, mainly the replacement of oxygen reduction reaction with oxidation reactions of small molecules and their further coupling with cathodic reduction reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), N 2 reduction reaction (NRR), and other reduction reactions of matching small molecules. In terms of oxidation reactions of small molecules, two types of reactions are covered: sacrificial agent oxidation reaction (SAOR) and electrochemical synthesis reaction (ESR). After detailing the design principle of coupled electrolyzers and several oxidation reactions of small molecules, construction, characterization, and performance of coupled electrolyzers are systematically overviewed along with discussion and outline of current challenges and prospects of this appealing strategy.

Solar saline water splitting is a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production, harnessing abundant solar energy and the availability of brine resources, especially in the Atacama Desert. Bischofite (MgCl2&middot;6H2O), a naturally occurring salt, has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications and the challenges associated with efficient hydrogen production in arid or hyper arid locations. This work discloses the electrochemical performance of Mn2O3 electrodes using a superposition model based on mixed potential theory and evaluates the superficial performance of this electrode in contact with a 0.5 M nature Bischofite salt solution focusing on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), that occurs during saline water splitting. The application of the non-linear superposition model provides valuable electrochemical kinetic parameters that complement the understanding of Mn2O3, this being one of the novelties of the manuscript.

Abstract Despite the importance of the stability of the 2D catalysts in harsh electrolyte solutions, most studies have focused on improving the catalytic performance of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) catalysts rather than the sustainability of hydrogen evolution. In previous studies, the vulnerability of MoS 2 crystals is reported that the moisture and oxygen molecules can cause the oxidation of MoS 2 crystals, accelerating the degradation of crystal structure. Therefore, optimization of catalytic stability is crucial for approaching practical applications in 2D catalysts. Here, it is proposed that monolayered MoS 2 catalysts passivated with an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h‐BN) layer can effectively sustain hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and demonstrate the ultra‐high current density (500 mA cm⁻ 2 over 11 h) and super stable (64 h at 150 mA cm⁻ 2 ) catalytic performance. It is further confirmed with density functional theory (DFT) calculations that the atomically thin h‐BN layer effectively prevents direct adsorption of water/acid molecules while allowing the protons to be adsorbed/penetrated. The selective penetration of protons and prevention of crystal structure degradation lead to maintained catalytic activity and maximized catalytic stability in the h‐BN covered MoS 2 catalysts. These findings propose a promising opportunity for approaching the practical application of 2D MoS 2 catalysts having long‐term stability at high‐current operation.

A catalytic system based on iron phosphide (Fe 2 P) has exhibited electrocatalytic activity toward N 2 -reduction reaction in alkaline medium (0.5 mol dm -3 NaOH). Based on voltammetric stripping-type electroanalytical measurements, Raman spectroscopic and spectrophotometric data, it can be stated that the Fe 2 P catalyst facilitates conversion of N 2 to NH 3 , and the process is fairly selective with respect to the competing hydrogen evolution. A series of diagnostic electrocatalytic experiments (utilizing platinum nanoparticles and HKUST-1) have been proposed and performed to control purity of nitrogen gas and to probe presence of potential contaminants such as ammonia, nitrogen oxo-species and oxygen. On the whole, the results are consistent with the view that the interfacial reduced-iron (Fe 0 ) centers, while existing within the network of P sites, induce activation and reduction of nitrogen, parallel to the water splitting (reduction) to hydrogen. It is apparent from Tafel plots and impedance measurements that mechanism and dynamics of nitrogen reduction depends on the applied electroreduction potential. The catalytic system exhibits certain tolerance with respect to the competitive hydrogen evolution and gives (during electrolysis at -0.4 V vs. RHE) the Faradaic efficiency, namely, the selectivity (molar) efficiency, toward production of NH 3 on the level of 60%. Under such conditions, the NH 3 -yield rate has been found to be equal to 7.5 µmol cm -2 h -1 (21 µmol m -2 s -1 ). By referring to classic concepts of electrochemical kinetic analysis, the rate constant in heterogeneous units has been found to be on the moderate level of 1-2 * 10 -4 cm s −1 (at -0.4 V). The above mentioned iron-phosphorous active sites, which are generated on surfaces of Fe 2 P particles, have also been demonstrated to exhibit strong catalytic properties during reductions of other electrochemically inert reactants, such as oxygen, nitrites and nitrates. Supplementary diagnostic experiments have also been carried out to control purity of nitrogen gas and to identify potential contaminants. To comment on general catalytic activity of Fe 2 P during electroreductions in alkaline medium, we have performed additional comparative measurements using such redox probes as O 2 , CO 2 , NO 3 - and NO 2 - .

With urgency and incentives to cut CO2 emissions, alongside increasing demand for steel, there is a need for technologies that use solely electricity for iron ore reduction, eliminating the role of carbon as a reductant. Herein, we propose the electrolytic production of liquid cast iron using a novel sulfide route, molten sulfide electrolysis (MSE). The process operates using sulfide chemistry and an inert anode. Sulfides are well known from non-ferrous metallurgy1 and the exclusion of oxygen supports a virtual elimination of green-house gases(GHG) emissions from the reduction step. The electrolytic decomposition of iron sulfide into iron and elemental sulfur gas operates in a multi-component molten sulfide electrolyte. The underlying thermodynamics suggests the absence of trivalent iron species (Fe3+) in such conditions, supporting the reduction of only divalent iron (Fe2+) and reducing the energy need proportionally, as compared to other oxide-based routes. Iron sulfide deposits or tailings, as well as conventional iron oxide ores after sulfidation 2 are some of the suitable feedstocks for MSE. Both thermal only, and galvanostatic electrochemical experiments were carried out on electrolyte droplets (~200mg) in a thermal imaging furnace, to confirm the electrolytic deposition of Fe and the evolution of sulfur in a 2-electrode set-up. Faradaic efficiency estimates based on mass-loss measurements – i.e. with respect to gaseous sulfur anodic evolution – are of the order of 90%. Key electrochemical attributes of MSE to be reported include impedance measurement at various fixed DC potentials, measurements at various current densities up to 2A/cm2, and the role of the total charge passed, to highlight the potential limitations observed in such an experimental set up. Characterization of the electrochemical deposits are also presented.

The exceptional resistive switching characteristics of complex oxides make them promising for use in memristors to mimic biological synapses in neuromorphic computing architectures in an energy-efficient manner. Specifically, the electrical conductance of complex oxides can be controllable switched across multiple orders of magnitude by either (a) electroforming a conduction channel (e.g., in tungsten oxide), or (b) inducing Mott-Hubbard transition (e.g., in rare-earth nickelates)– both via controlled migration of defects (such as oxygen vacancies) under applied bias. However, development of accurate neuromorphic computers (i.e., low variability) remains extremely challenging due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the atomic-scale processes that underlie migration and spatiotemporal evolution of oxygen vacancies (and other extended defects) over nano-to-mesoscopic length/timescales under applied electric field. Here, we demonstrate that a synergistic integration of density functional theory (DFT) calculation, ab initio /classical molecular dynamics (AIMD/CMD) simulations, precision synthesis, and multi-modal X-ray imaging experiments provides an effective route to address this knowledge gap. First, we use a combination of multi-modal X-ray imaging (with chemical/structural sensitivity) and CMD simulations to show that the intrinsic randomness of electroforming process in tungsten-oxide memristors can be minimized by careful introduction of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap. We find that sharp protrusions confine the electric field, which yields a reproducible distribution of oxygen vacancies over several switching cycles; and reliably form conduction channel in a specific location in the memristor. Next, we employed a large dataset of data from DFT calculations and short AIMD trajectories to develop deep neural network (DNN) models to accurately capture energetics, atomic forces, atomic charges, and maximally localized Wannier centers in rare-earth nickelates (RNO). CMD simulations based on these newly developed DNNs show that metal-insulator transition (MIT) in RNO occurs via a local structural distortion in the extended nickel structure, which facilitates the electronic instability and causes a sharp concomitant Ni-O bond and Ni-charge disproportion with decreasing temperature; this MIT is also strongly influenced by applied pressure and rare-earth ion. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal the correlations the oxygen stoichiometry, OV distribution (including different NiO x motifs), OV transport, and electron-lattice coupling in perovskite nickelates. These results will be discussed in the context of controlling defect-induced transitions to design accurate and reliable memristive devices for neuromorphic computing platforms that are vital for artificial intelligence technologies.

Introduction For carbon neutrality, organic synthesis should utilize renewable electricity. Alkyne semi-hydrogenation has been researched for a long time to prevent a side reaction: over-hydrogenation to produce alkane. Although the Lindlar catalyst, composed of Pd/CaCO 3 added with lead acetate and quinoline, has been a dominant catalyst for stereoselective Z -alkene synthesis, lead toxicity is a concern. In contrast, PEM electrolysis enables synthesis under mild conditions without lead and hydrogen gas as a reactant, unlike the Lindlar catalyst. Our previous research revealed that Pt1Pd99/C (at%) catalyst had high activity and selectivity towards the semi-hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene (DPA) to form cis -stilbene due to the high proton reduction activity of Pt even with a small amount and the selective hydrogenation of DPA at Pd sites. 1,2) It also qualitatively figured that electrolysis conditions that reduce residence time in the catalyst layer (low catalyst loading, high flow rate, high temperature) enhance selectivity. 3) This study conducted essential quantitative kinetic analyses to evaluate performance under specific conditions and develop practical conditions. Experimental DSE ® (De Nora Permelec Ltd) was used for the oxygen evolution as the anode and Nafion ® 117 (DuPont) as the PEM, respectively. Carbon paper (39BB, SGL Carbon), loaded with 0.14 mg -PtPd cm −2 of Pt1Pd99/C (ISHIFUKU Metal Industry Co., Ltd.) and cut into 3.3 cm × 3.5 cm, was employed as the cathode. The cathode was hot-pressed on the PEM at 120 ℃, 6 MPa, for 3 min to make a membrane cathode assembly. In the anode compartments, 1 M (= mol dm −3 ) sulfuric acid circulated, and 1 M cyclohexane solution of DPA in the cathode compartments either flowed once-through or circulated. As electrochemical measurements, chronoamperometry at 1.3―2.1 V for once-through experiments and chronopotentiometry at 18 mA cm −2 for batch electrolysis were conducted. The concentrations of cis -stilbene and dibenzyl in electrolytes were quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after collection during the last 2 min out of 5 min of electrolysis at 80 ℃. The partial currents were calculated by eqns. 1, derived from Faraday’s laws of electrolysis. Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows Tafel plots of the total and each partial current density derived by eqns. 1 at a 1 M DPA once-through flow rate of 2 mL min −1 and 80 ℃. The kinetic parameters, i 0 and α , were determined by the fitting lines of mass transport corrected Tafel equation (eqns. 2), shown in Table 1. The solid lines in Figure 1 represent the calculated partial current densities from the parameters, describing their behavior well. Figure 2 shows concentration-time profiles of 12-h batch electrolysis of 1 M DPA 30 mL at 18 mA cm −2 and 80 ℃. Initially, the concentration of DPA steeply decreased as the semi-hydrogenation to form cis -stilbene proceeded mainly. As a result, cis -stilbene at 65% concentration was produced with approximately 80% selectivity. The reactivity significantly changed around 9 h of electrolysis since the concentration of DPA became deficient, and thus the semi-hydrogenation rate dropped and the over-hydrogenation rate increased. The solid lines in Figure 2 were simulated from the estimated once-through partial current densities of 1 M DPA at 18 mA cm −2 in total by Figure 1, using eqns. 3. The rate constants k 1 and k 2 were respectively obtained by dividing the estimated once-through partial current density i 1 and i 2 by 2 Fc A and 2 Fc B . The computed kinetic parameters are shown in Table 2. The parameters derived by once-through electrolysis data described the concentration profiles in Figure 2 until 7.5 h of the batch electrolysis, when sufficient DPA existed. The high selectivity was quantitively explained by the high k 1 / k 2 value at 18 mA cm −2 . In addition, this simple kinetic model would predict products under a variety of operating conditions. Conclusion The kinetic analysis quantitively described the once-through partial current densities and the batch electrolysis concentration profiles. The high k 1 / k 2 enabled cis -stilbene formation at 65% concentration with approximately 80% selectivity with the batch electrolysis. The suggested concise kinetic model would be beneficial to estimate the compositions in a batch electrolysis with once-through data.

The future of our planet critically depends on the introduction of new or improved strategies for developing non-polluting energy production. Leading approaches are the electrocatalytic production of hydrogen gas, development of fuel cells relying on efficient reduction of oxygen and either gaseous or liquid fuels, as well as efficient reduction of carbon dioxide. Metal complexes chelated by N4 macrocycles serve as excellent catalysts in many of these processes, performed at both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. Our contributions to those aspect focused on introducing metallocorroles as catalysts for reduction of protons, oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as for water oxidation [1-5]. The common motif in these and other publications was to take advantage of the relatively easy functionalization of the macrocyclic periphery for the tuning of properties and reactivity. A significant game changer was the recently reported synthetic access to corroles with meso -CF 3 substituents and even to the parent corrole with no substituents whatsoever [6]. These developments allow for a focus on the size effect, which according to both hypothesis and fast accumulating results has a very strong effect (“smaller is better”) on the performance of electrodes modified by the corresponding metal complexes [7-9].

The choice of counter electrode has emerged as an important topic in our search for non-platinum group metal (PGM) materials that can catalyze reactions that are important for fuel cells and electrolyzers such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), H 2 evolution reaction (HER), and the CO 2 reduction reaction. Recent investigations on the stability of Pt materials have revealed that significant dissolution occurs during O 2 evolution, making the use of Pt as a counter electrode unsuitable for developing non-PGM materials for ORR and HER, in particular. That has led to increased use of carbon as the counter electrode, which can also oxidize at high voltages and generate partial oxidization compounds such as CO and other small organic molecules, which in turn, are detrimental to metal surfaces. Therefore, developing a stable counter electrode material is key for artifact-free electrocatalytic measurements. In this work, we will discuss the synthesis and application as a counter electrode of a proton-exchange anthraquinone-based reversible redox pair that was covalently grafted onto a high-purity (e.g. 99.99995%) carbon rod. The anthraquinone-grafted counter electrodes were evaluated in aqueous electrolytes using metal single crystals such as Pt(111) and Ir(111) surfaces as the working electrodes, given their extreme sensitivity to impurities in the electrochemical cell. Our results show that the counter electrode voltage is far more stable and centered around the proton-exchange process happening at the anthraquinone centers. This is in contrast to the wide-range voltage changes observed when using the un-grafted carbon rod. There were no differences in the single-crystal surface cyclic voltammetry profile, even after performing HER or OER, which typically causes the biggest swings in the counter electrode voltages. Lastly, there were no detectable amounts of grafted material leaching or exfoliated carbon, confirming that the use of a known redox pair such as from anthraquinone is an effective strategy to prevent artifacts in electrocatalysis research.

Over the past decades, the demand for semiconductor memory devices has been steadily increasing, and is currently experiencing an unprecedented boost due to the development and expansion of artificial intelligence. Among emerging high-density non-volatile memories, resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is one of the best recourses for all kind of applications, such as neuromorphic computing or hardware security [1]. Although many materials have been evaluated for RRAM development, some of them with excellent results, HfO 2 is one of the established materials in CMOS domain due to its compatibility with standard materials and processes [2]. The main goal of this work is to study the switching capability and stability of HfO 2 -based RRAMs, as well as to explore their ability in the field of analogue applications, by analyzing the evolution of the resistance states that allow multilevel control. Indeed, analogue operation is a key point for achieving electronic neural synapses in neuromorphic systems, with synaptic weight information encoded in the different resistance states. This research has been carried out over a wide temperature range, between 40 and 340 K, as we are interested in testing the extent to which performance is maintained or modified, with a view to designing neuromorphic circuits that are also suitable in the low-temperature realm. We aim to prove that these simple, fast, high integration density structures can also be used in circuits designed for specific applications, such as aerospace systems. The RRAM devices studied in this work are TiN/Ti/8 nm-HfO 2 /TiN metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors. Dielectric layers were atomic layer deposited (ALD). It has been demonstrated that the Ti coat in the top electrode acts as a scavenger that absorbs oxygen atoms from the HfO 2 layer, and facilitates the creation of conductive filaments of oxygen vacancies [3]. In fact, the oxygen reservoir capability of Ti is well known, as it is able to attract and release oxygen atoms from or to the HfO 2 layer during the RRAM operation [4]. The clustering of vacancies extends through the entire thickness of the oxide and, after an electroformig step, it joins the upper and lower electrodes and the device reaches the low resistance state (LRS). By applying adequate electrical signals, the filaments can be partially dissolved, which brings the device into the high-resistance state (HRS), with lower current values. The set process brings the device to the LRS state, while the reset one brings it to the HRS. The dependence of electrical conductivity on external applied electrical excitation allows triggering the device between the both states in a non-volatile manner [5]. The experimental equipment used consisted of a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer and a Lake Shore cryogenic probe station. Fig.1 shows current-voltage cycles measured at different temperatures; the averages values at each temperature, both in logarithmic and linear scale, are also shown. The functional window increases as temperature decreases. The evolutions of set and reset voltage values with temperature are depicted in Fig.2, whereas the current values (measured at 0.1 V) corresponding to the LRS and HRS can be seen in Fig.3. LRS resistance decreases as temperature increases, in agreement with semiconductor behaviour, probably due to a hopping conduction mechanism. Both set and reset voltages decrease as temperature increases; the reset process is smoother at high temperatures. The reduction in reset voltage variability as temperature increases is very notable. Finally, Fig. 4 shows a picture of the transient behaviour; in the right panel of the same figure, the amplitudes of the current transients in the reset state have been included in the external loop. To sum up, the resistive switching phenomena is studied in a wide temperature range. The LRS shows semiconducting behavior with temperature, most likely related to a hopping conduction mechanism. Switching voltages decrease as temperature increases, with a notable reduction in reset voltage variability. An excellent control of intermediate resistance state is shown through current transients at several voltages in the reset process. REFERENCES [1] M.

The emergence of high brilliance synchrotron sources and the availability of more sophisticated infrastructure have opened doors to advanced material characterization, enabling a profound understanding of new processes and mechanisms in battery research. [1] More specifically, non-resonant Valence-to-Core X-ray emission spectroscopy (VtC-XES) and X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) stand out as complementary photon-in/photon-out X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The unique capability of these techniques lies in their access to soft X-ray edges using a hard X-ray beam, providing comprehensive information on both the electronic and local structure, due to their high sensitivity to local structure and coordination. [2,3] In this work, two different families of materials with different compositions and crystal structures are studied using XES and XRS. The first part focuses on the detailed study of oxygen substituted KVPO 4 F 1-x O x (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) using VtC-XES combined to ab initio theoretical calculations. The average working potential increases with increasing oxygen content by activating the V 3+/4+ and V 4+/5+ redox couples and replacing the VO 4 F 2 “ionic” entity by {V=O}O 5 unit with a highly “covalent” vanadyl-type bond. [4] VtC-XES allowed us to distinguish the contributions of V-F, V-O, and V=O bonds in the local environment, with spectral intensities highly correlated to the F - and O 2- anionic composition. In addition, specific spectral evolutions are also associated to the presence of highly covalent V=O bonds, strongly influencing the electrode potential of the material. The second part examines a series of electrochemically obtained Li y NiO 2 layered oxide materials (y = 0.02, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 1.0). VtC-XES performed at the Ni Kβ emission line allows to study the local structure evolution around Ni, whereas XRS spectroscopy at both the O K-edge and Ni L 2,3 L-edges gives an access to the interplay between Ni and O through the hybridized states of Ni 3 d and O 2 p . [5] This work provides a survey on both the cationic and anionic redox processes, and unveils the underlying phenomena related to the charge compensation processes occurring in this material. Overall, we present a comprehensive study of different polyanionic and layered oxide positive electrode materials using complementary X-ray spectroscopic techniques to probe both the local and electronic structures. We demonstrate that they allow to follow and understand evolution and changes in the local structure in materials of intricate crystal structures.

We report the detection of a population of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Sunburst Arc, a strongly gravitationally lensed galaxy at redshift $z=2.37$. As the brightest known lensed galaxy, the Sunburst Arc has become an important cosmic laboratory for studying star and cluster formation, Lyman alpha (Lyalpha ) radiative transfer, and Lyman continuum (LyC) escape. Here, we present the first results of JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the Sunburst Arc, focusing on a stacked spectrum of the 12-fold imaged Sunburst LyC-emitting (LCE) cluster. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the Sunburst LCE cluster is a very massive, compact star cluster with $M_ dyn M_ odot $. Our age estimate of 4.2–4.5 Myr is much larger than the crossing time of $t_ cross 9 $ kyr, indicating that the cluster is dynamically evolved and consistent with it being gravitationally bound. We find a significant nitrogen enhancement of the low ionization state interstellar medium (ISM), with \( 0.09\), which is \( 0.8\) dex above typical values for H\ ii regions of a similar metallicity in the local Universe. We find broad stellar emission complexes around He\ ii 4686$ and C\ iv 5808$ with associated nitrogen emission; this is the first time WR signatures have been directly observed at redshifts above $ 0.5$. The strength of the WR signatures cannot be reproduced by stellar population models that only include single-star evolution. While models with binary evolution better match the WR features, they still struggle to reproduce the nitrogen-enhanced WR features. JWST reveals the Sunburst LCE cluster to be a highly ionized proto-globular cluster with low oxygen abundance and extreme nitrogen enhancement that hosts a population of WR stars, likely including a previously suggested population of very massive stars (VMSs), which together are rapidly enriching the surrounding medium.

The invention of CMP by IBM in 1983 represents an inflection point in the evolution of semiconductors. It was a bold and risky idea to mechanically apply abrasives to the surface of a wafer, but this new process for restoring a wafer to a planar state was the key to continued areal scaling and increased device complexity. Initially applied to a simple application for filling trenches with insulator, the potential of this technique was evident. Through understanding of material properties and subsequent manipulation of slurry chemistry, CMP was applied to enable the more challenging and technically critical processes for Shallow Trench Isolation and Tungsten contacts. The late 1990’s saw the introduction of copper interconnects. IBM was first to market this technology which continues to support conductors down to lines widths on the order of 10 nanometers! The CMP process required for copper interconnects demanded a thorough understanding of the materials present and potential surface phenomena for exploitation. For this need, a new and complex mechanism for copper planarization was invented. Equally challenging was the need for a subsequent non-selective barrier removal step. For this a unique, self-balancing approach was also invented, borrowing some elements from previous STI technology. Device architecture has progressed from planar geometry to FINFETs to Gate All Around, or Nanosheet technology. This evolution has required increasingly more CMP process steps with a concurrent demand for increased process control. Gate height control for Nanosheeets is currently paramount for performance, affected by many CMP steps in the process flow. A typical requirement is less than 1nm added variability per CMP step! Looking forward, CMP continues to be tapped to enable technology evolution. Polish steps are becoming part of the patterning process to enable pitch splitting for upcoming nodes. A VTFET integration approach can enable further area scaling but presents integration challenges; CMP is being asked to enable “third color” schemes for the protection of NFET vs PFET devices which is necessary at various points in the in the VTFET process flow. Heterogeneous Integration is demanding nanometer control of topography across large contact pads and large lateral distances. Finally, extreme scaling is creating fundamental challenges for metal polish at the contact and interconnect levels. CMP tool architecture currently does not provide for control of ambient conditions at the wafer surface during wet transport and post CMP cleaning. Subsequently, unwanted metal dissolution is observed. New tool designs will be needed to control wafer surface conditions, and particularly oxygen exposure through all steps within the CMP tool. This talk is dedicated to the special session in honor of Professor S.V. Babu

Lithium-air batteries (LABs) represent a promising future battery technology due to their high energy density, although several challenges hinder them from achieving their theoretical performance. These challenges include clogging of the porous air cathode by insoluble discharge products and high overpotentials during cycling [1, 2]. A recent proposal to address these issues involves the reversible formation and oxidation of LiOH in nonaqueous LABs. Of course, LiOH-based LABs require a proton source to form LiOH from the electrochemical reaction of oxygen and lithium ions [3]; humidity in air is an obvious choice for the proton source, making the relative humidity of LAB feed gas an important parameter to control and monitor during LAB electrochemical analysis. For LABs, galvanostatic charge/discharge coupled with quantitative gas evolution/consumption measurement is essential to understand the electrochemical processes during battery operation. Here, we report an advanced operando pressure measurement system that allows the control and monitoring of humidity in the cell headspace while also tracing overall gas consumption and evolution. Our gas handling system generates humid air using a water-containing chamber with a temperature control vessel to generate water vapor. A mass flow controller mixes dry air with humid air to generate specific relative humidity and send it to the cell. Using various low-volume in-line sensors, our system can track headspace humidity, temperature, and pressure within a custom-modified Swagelok-type cell. The total headspace volume must be small (~mL) since gas consumption occurs on a μmol scale in our lab-scale cells. To minimize headspace and dead volume within the Swagelok-type cell, a digital humidity and temperature sensor with exceptional accuracy was integrated into a customized printed circuit board (PCB). This PCB is attached to the small dead-volume Tee connection. To control the humidity inside the cell and achieve sensor data simultaneously, all sensors in the monitoring system are controlled by a LabVIEW program (National Instruments). To show the utility of this new system, we will present analyses of nonaqueous and solid-state LAB cells that operate at various humidities and current rates, while employing various known 2 e - and 4 e - oxygen reduction catalysts.

The potential of zero-charge (PZC) is an important property of the electrochemical double layer (EDL) that has been shown to correlate with changes in the activities of several important reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) 1 . This property was historically measured on droplet mercury electrodes (DME) where surface tension was measured vs potential, an experiment difficult to perform with other metal electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanic discharge have been widely used to elucidate double layer capacitance but make several assumptions about the ideality of the double layer, measurement system, physical model employed, and have suffered from irreproducibility. The potential of maximum entropy (PME), where the solvent molecules are most disordered, has been measured via the laser induced temperature jump (LITJ) technique which works well when there is no specific adsorption 2 . A multiple approach mode of scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) has also been used to measure local PZCs of polycrystalline 3 and high-entropy alloy electrodes 4 . The SECCM approach is similar to an older immersion method that is not often used 5 . In this work we create a simple droplet type cell with a pneumatic sample stage to enable a simplified and less expensive version of the SECCM approach/immersion experiments and compare the results to those obtained via the LITJ method.

Abstract Perovskite-like oxides present huge chemical variability and a wide range of applications as catalysts for oxidation reactions. The interaction of several small gas molecules with the surface of LaCoO 3 and LaMnO 3 perovskite-like oxides was studied by Near Ambient Pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and CO Temperature Programmed Desorption (CO-TPD). Surface chemical changes such as the O surf /O lattice and cation B oxidation state ratios were analyzed as a function of temperature (400 K, 450 K, 500 K, 550 K, and 650 K) under different gas atmospheres like Ar, CO, H 2 , and O 2 . It was found that there was a partial surface reduction when H 2 and CO were used in the reaction, and therefore, the cation B oxidation state (Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ and Co 3+ /Co 2+ ) ratio decreased. Under the CO stream, carbonate species were formed, presenting a C1s signal between 284.5 eV and 287 eV. The CO 2 evolution during the reaction at temperatures greater than 500 K was associated with CO activation over or near to surface oxygen species. A Mars-van Krevelen mechanism was proposed for the process, finding significant differences between LaCoO 3 and LaMnO 3 perovskite-like solid catalysts behavior. Graphical Abstract

Solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cells (SOFC/SOECs) are promising and environmentally-friendly technologies for meeting ever-increasing electricity and energy storage demands. Nanostructuring of SOFC/SOEC electrodes can enable improvement of the reaction kinetics and reduction of the operating temperature, owing to factors including the enlarged surface area, short diffusion lengths, and unique surface & interface properties. While the kinetic benefit is apparent, the effect of nanostructuring on other device-relevant physico-chemical properties cannot be neglected. Especially, the coefficients of chemical expansion (CCEs) are an important metric for mixed ionic-electronic conductors that can undergo changes in oxygen stoichiometry with variations in the surrounding atmosphere, temperature, and voltages during processing/operation. Chemical strains can cause cracking of monolithic parts during fabrication and delamination of electrodes from electrolytes in operation. CCEs are typically measured on bulk, polycrystalline materials with large particle or grain sizes. Therefore, it is important to understand the coupled transport and chemical expansion behavior in nano-ionic materials with large interface/surface density. This work aims to uncover the role of microstructure and nanoscale effects on the chemical strain and transport properties, through the lens of defect chemistry, with the goal of ultimately developing design principles for zero-strain materials with improved device lifetime and performance. Pr 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 2- δ (PCO20) was selected as a model system and prepared as nanoparticles by a surfactant-free, low temperature co-precipitation method. (Pr,Ce)O 2-δ compositions are valuable model oxide ion conductors to study, since both Pr and Ce can undergo changes of valence states under different temperature and pO 2 regimes to accommodate oxygen stoichiometry excursions. Prepared nanoparticle samples were first in-situ sintered in the dilatometer at three different temperatures (600 ⁰C, 725 ⁰C, 850 ⁰C) to induce and evaluate microstructure evolution. The chemical strain and electronic/ionic conductivity were then studied on stable microstructures with different average particle sizes at lower temperatures by simultaneous in-situ dilatometry and electrochemical impedance measurement (EIS) upon changing pO 2 at different isotherms (550 to 400 ⁰C). At each isotherm, all the samples expand as pO 2 decreases. From the conductivity vs. pO 2 measurements, the maxima at certain pO 2 indicate the dominant polaron mechanism of the electronic transport, consistent with the measured conductivity activation energy. However, samples with lower sintering temperatures exhibit less pO 2 dependence of the conductivity, which implies a transition in the mixed ionic/electronic conduction behavior toward higher ionic transference numbers as particle size decreases. Correspondingly, the chemical strains associated with losing oxygen monotonically decrease with the decrease of the sintering temperature, and hence the particle size. The chemical strain vs. oxygen stoichiometry dependence and corresponding CCEs were quantified as function of particle size and temperature by combining thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with the dilatometry results and in-situ X-ray diffraction. The particle size, chemical composition, valence states, and morphology of samples after CCEs measurements were also compared using XRD, SEM, and S/TEM-EELS, with the latter indicating the expected differences between bulk and surface defect chemistry. Implications of the results for size-dependent defect chemistry and its influence on chemical strains and redox CCEs will be further discussed.

Hydrogen is becoming the center piece in the global de-carbonatization efforts in multiple industrial sectors. Gaseous hydrogen at high pressures in gas tanks is the most common approach for H2 storage, transportation and hydrogen refueling for fuel cell vehicles. Gaseous hydrogen at high pressures is also heavily used in the Haber process for ammonia production and hydro-cracking of heavy petroleum. In the long term, low-cost high pressure H2 will also play a critical role in the future long-duration grid storage for deep decarbonization and improved resilience. In this talk, I will share some recent development on a hybrid electrochemical/catalytic approach for direct generation of high-pressure H2 in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The hybrid system oxidizes water to oxygen at the anode, reduces V3+ to V2+ at the cathode, and stores proton in the catholyte during the “electrochemical charging” step. We demonstrated that the charged catholyte is then capable of generating H2 at >350 bar in the subsequent “catalytic discharging” step without any additional energy input. This concept leverages the electrochemical Nernst potential difference between the redox couple (V2+/3+) and the hydrogen evolution reaction and delivers a unique system that is capable of generating H2 at demand and at high pressure without any mechanical or electrochemical compression. We estimate a cost of <$0.19/kg-H2 for compression, representing >80% of the cost reduction compared to the traditional multi-stage compressor approach.

Recently, discovering high-performance electrocatalytic materials for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) has been one of the most crucial tasks. This paper successfully fabricates low-cost plate-like bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) material through a simple one-step hydrothermal route, employed as an electrocatalyst to adorn the graphite felt (GF) for use as the negative electrode in VRFB. The experimental results show that BiVO 4 -3h exhibits the optimal electrocatalytic activity and reversibility for the vanadium redox couples among all samples. The energy efficiency of the VRFB cell assembled with BiVO 4 -decorated GF as the negative electrode is found to be 75.42% at 100 mA cm −2 , which is about 10.24% more efficient than that of the cell assembled with heat-treated graphite felt (HT-GF) electrode. The possible reasons for the activity enhancement can be ascribed to the existence of oxygen vacancies in the BiVO 4 lattice structure and the relatively high surface area of BiVO 4 , which provide more active sites for facilitating the vanadium redox reactions. Furthermore, the BiVO 4 -GF electrode obstructs the competitive irreversible hydrogen evolution reaction on the negative side of the cell, and it also has better wettability. Impressively, BiVO 4 -GF as the negative electrode shows good stability over 100 cycles.

Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites are poised to revolutionize the next generation of photovoltaics with their exceptional optoelectronic properties and compatibility with low-cost and large-scale fabrication methods. Since perovskite tends to degrade over short time intervals due to various parameters (oxygen, humidity, light, and temperature), advanced characterization methods are needed to understand their degradation mechanisms. In this context, investigation of the electrical and optoelectronic properties of several perovskite mini-modules was performed by means of photo- and electroluminescence imaging as well as Dark Lock-In Thermography methods. Current–voltage curves at periodic time intervals and External Quantum Efficiency measurements were implemented alongside other measurements to reveal correlations between the electrical and radiative properties of the solar cells. The different imaging techniques used in this study reveal the changes in radiative emission processes and how those are correlated with performance. Alongside the indoor optoelectronic characterization of perovskite reference samples, the outdoor monitoring of two perovskite modules of the same structure for 23 weeks is reported. Significant performance degradation is presented outdoors from the first week of testing for both samples under test. The evolution of the major electrical characteristics of the mini-modules and the diurnal changes were studied in detail. Finally, dark storage recovery studies after outdoor exposure were implemented to investigate changes in the major electrical parameters.

Abstract Poly(lactide)/poly(butylene adipate‐ co ‐terephthalate) (PLA/PBAT) blends containing different amounts of polyethylene wax (PEW) were fabricated via melt‐blending, and the effects of PEW on the interfacial morphological evolution and properties of the PLA/PBAT blends were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs show that the compatibility between PLA and PBAT is obviously improved by addition of low contents of PEW. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results indicate that PEW can simultaneously enhance the crystallization ability of PLA and PBAT. Rheological behavior of the blends indicates that PEW has a significant plasticizing effect and can promote the mobility of polymer chains in the blends. More importantly, it is revealed that PEW can effectively improve the mechanical and barrier properties of the blends. Even with a PEW content of only 1 wt%, the elongation at break and notched impact strength of the blend reach 344.1% and 12.55 kJ/m 2 , respectively, which are 54% and 140% higher than the blend without PEW. Meanwhile, the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the films containing 1 wt% PEW are decreased from 87.34 to 67.40 g m −2 ·24 h −1 and from 118.26 to 80.94 cm 3 m −2 ·24 h −1 , respectively, which are 22.8% and 31.5% lower than those of the PLA/PBAT film.

The continued rise in global energy consumption, along with the associated environmental hazards, pose a significant risk to our society’s infrastructure unless the main source is changed. Electrocatalysis involving hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), provide a pathway for energy storage and conversion due to their enhanced environmental friendliness and efficient energy input compared to their thermocatalytic counterparts. Currently, the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts suffer from scarcity and high cost. MXenes, a novel family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbide and nitride materials, show potential as cost-efficient and highly abundant electrocatalysts with limited knowledge on their electrocatalytic mechanisms. This is especially true when considering the often-overlooked nitride family of MXenes. Herein, we investigate the electrocatalytic performance of a Ti 2 N nitride MXene under different electrocatalytic conditions. The effect of surface phenomena is investigated through manipulation of the surface passivation layer, as evidenced by Raman and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Successful decoupling of the bulk and surface phenomena is achieved through Raman laser power attenuation. Under acidic medium, the surface reactivity towards HER is poor but the bulk reactivity for NRR is favored, making it an optimal NRR catalyst. Under alkaline medium, the surface reactivity of the pristine Ti 2 N MXene for ORR is high, but also leads to surface passivation and thus hinders the electrocatalytic activity. Overall, these results provide fundamental insights into future optimization strategies of the Ti 2 N nitride MXene, along with other MXene electrocatalysts, towards electrocatalytic applications.

Advancing electrochemical reactors for nutrient recovery from wastewater requires an integration of continuum modeling alongside experimental investigations to appropriately capture transport effects on electrode performance. This continuum modeling approach facilitates the comprehensive evaluation and optimization of electrochemical reactor performance, especially with respect to intricate phenomena that may be challenging to observe solely through experimentation. The optimization process not only enhances the efficacy of existing batch reactors but also lays the foundation for designing and scaling up continuous electrochemical reactors for nutrient recovery [1]. A key transport phenomenon in electrochemistry is hydrodynamics because flow dynamics around electrodes dictate mass transport magnitude and uniformity, thereby impacting current distribution, efficiency, and electrolytic energy consumption during electrolysis. Achieving homogeneous velocity fields while avoiding undesirable flow features is essential to prevent non-uniform potential and current density distributions along the electrodes, mitigating side reactions and ensuring the overall efficacy of the electrochemical processes [2]. In this study, a two-dimensional model of an electrochemical batch reactor was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics software to investigate reactor hydrodynamics, electrochemical reactions, and mass transfer of species. Employing the finite element method, the model incorporated the k-epsilon turbulence model for hydrodynamics simulation, widely used in literature for simulating fluid flow and mixing behavior [3]. Electrochemical reactions at the cathode (oxygen reduction) were modeled using the Butler-Volmer equation, while the Tafel equation was applied at the anode (hydrogen evolution). Boundary conditions were a grounded counter electrode (anode) and a potential of -1.1 vs Ag/AgCl(sat.) applied to the working electrode (cathode). Fick's second law diffusion-convective equation was employed to model the mass transfer of species, including hydroxide and oxygen. Preliminary findings indicate that while impellers contribute to turbulence and affect local conditions around electrodes, the impact on the backside of the modeled electrodes is relatively weak (Figure 1). This observation may adversely influence mass transfer rates and electrochemical reactions, underscoring the significance of integrating these results with electrochemical reactions for a comprehensive understanding of reactor behavior. Additional results will be presented at the meeting. References: [1] Kody D. Wolfe, Ardavan Zanganeh, Richard N. Arthur, Jason P. Trembly, and Damilola A.

The electrification of chemical manufacturing is an important pathway toward reduced CO 2 emissions. Direct electrochemical CO 2 reduction can thereby become a key technology. CO 2 electrolyzers produce cathodically platform chemicals as CO, format, ethanol or ethylene. The state-of-the-art anode process is the oxygen electro evolution which suffers from high over potentials and moderate valorization. An alternative is the anodic oxidation of biomass to valorized carbonaceous products, such as the oxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to the biopolymer precursor 2.5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). In this work we report the design of electrolyzers flow cells with paired valorization of biomass and CO 2 . NiNC cathode GDEs are used for CO 2 reduction to CO and NiFe-LDH anodes for the HMF oxidation in a zero-gap membrane electrolyzer flow cells. We used a bipolar membrane to separate and optimize either half-cell reactions. Inside the membrane, water is dissociated and the protons will neutralize carbonates on the cathode which is beneficial for a higher CO 2 utilization and single pass. So, we can report close to 95% FE and 100% utilization efficiency towards CO. On the other hand, the hydroxide will stabilize the anode pH and enable PGM-free anodes compared to AEM CO 2 electrolyzer. State-of-the-art HMF oxidation is a semi-batch setup, in which the HMF containing anolyte is recycled to complete HMF depletion and utilization. This design suffered from severe mass limitations. Therefore, we modified the semi-batch process into a continuous process and made tradeoffs between faradaic efficiency and utilization. As HMF is not stable in alkaline solutions we decided that a high utilization is beneficial because the intermediates are stable and could be recycled. We can report a single pass conversion of around 70 % towards FDCA at 200 mA cm -2 at a total utilization of 90%. Figure caption: Paired continuous HMF/CO2 electrolyzer with performance parameter.

The effort made in recent years in the development of new memories has led to a significant advance in emerging technologies, which have proven their usefulness not only in the field of memories, but also to obtain devices that perform an artificial synapse and thus emulate biological neurons. Among the novel concepts, resistive-switching random access memory (RRAM), or memristive device, has attracted a great deal of interest for its ability to store multiple states. In fact, its operation is based on the so-called resistive switching, which consists of the formation of conductive filaments through a dielectric that separates two metal electrodes, allowing current to flow between them. The conductive filaments can be partially dissolved and re-formed, which explains the variation in conductivity and thus the existence of several different states, opening up possibilities for analog applications and brain-inspired computing systems. In the field of memories, two clearly differentiated states are used, called low resistance (LRS, when the filament is formed) and high resistance (HRS, when the filament is partially dissolved and does not completely join the two electrodes). The set process takes the structure to the LRS state, while the reset takes it to the HRS. Since the resistance of the memristor is not constant but depends on the previous states it has gone through, this device is non-volatile, i.e., it remembers its history [1]. At the present time, when artificial intelligence-based applications are experiencing considerable momentum, there is a call for intensified research into memristive devices-based neuromorphic computing systems [2]. To achieve efficient, high-performance neuromorphic circuits, it is not enough to be able to switch the device resistance between two distinct values. In addition, the specific value of the conductivity at each time instant must be properly controlled so that the synaptic weights can be encoded. For this purpose, it is necessary to focus on the analysis of the dynamic evolution of the internal variables of the memristive devices, which necessarily implies a deeper understanding of the underlying physical processes that cause the variation of their resistance [3]. In this work, a thermoelectric analysis of memristive devices is carried out, with special emphasis on time response and multilevel control. The studied structures are TiN/Ti/HfO 2 /W and TiN/Ti/HfO 2 /Pt/Cr metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, with several HfO 2 -thickness values varying between 8 and 20 nm. Dielectric layers were atomic layer deposited (ALD). It is known that in the case of hafnium oxide layers sandwiched between these specific electrode materials, the resistive switching phenomenon is related to the distribution of oxygen vacancies inside the dielectric film, which occurs when oxygen atoms are drawn to the electrodes [4]. Fig.1 shows the control of intermediate states in multilevel behavior, both in terms of I-V and small signals (conductance and capacitance measured at 500 kHz). The current evolution in the reset process after applying -0.8 V height-voltage pulse trains can be seen in Fig.2, which also shows the schematic of the experimental setup. On the other hand, Fig.3 depicts some results of the transient analysis; the amplitude of the current transients in both set and reset states have been superimposed on the external I-V loop. An example of the study of set and reset dynamics performed by applying variable speed voltage ramps is shown in Fig. 4, together with the experimental setup, this analysis has been carried out at different temperatures, between 77 and 350 K. All results shown in Figs. 1-4 correspond to a TiN/Ti/10 nm-HfO 2 /W structures, being TiN the top electrode and W the bottom one. Bias voltage is applied between top and bottom electrodes. The influence of the dielectric thickness on the resistive switching modes that the structures can exhibit is also addressed. Finally, some results on the physical and geometrical morphology of the conductive filaments, obtained from the analysis of the conduction mechanisms, are discussed.

The redox flow batteries (RFBs) can be tuned to allow mining of surplus energy capacity and supplement green hydrogen economy as a one-stop station [1, 2].With this concept, an RFB can undergo two sequential discharging modes: i) electrochemical discharge of redox active species, and ii) chemical discharge to produce hydrogen gas, when surplus electricity is available, on the surface of electrocatalysts contained in additional external tanks (i.e., dual circuit RFB) [3, 4]. Herein, electrolytes with Mn 3+ /Mn 2+ (RFB catholyte ~ 1.5 V vs. SHE) and V 3+ /V 2+ (RFB anolyte ~ −0.26 V vs. SHE) redox species are flown to spatially separated external catalytic reactors to drive redox mediated water electrolysis. The fully charged V 2+ redox mediator in the anolyte provides electrons to achieve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and thereby itself gets discharged to V 3+ redox state before circulating back to flow battery tanks. Considering the additional layer of redox-mediated water electrolysis, it is imperative to identify benchmark cycling performance for a robust dual circuit RFB operation. In the first phase of our study, electrochemical behavior of Mn 3+ /Mn 2+ redox couple in the favorable presence of V 5+ as an additive was elucidated using ultramicroelectrode voltammograms. Despite significant performance enhancement, capacity fade during galvanostatic cycling could not be fully eliminated owing to Mn 3+ disproportionation reaction and manganese crossover. Also, charge/discharge cycling profiles suggest that the inevitable Mn 3+ disproportionation affects the true state-of-charge in electrolytes which in turn hinders their potential to generate hydrogen gas. Working towards hydrogen generation, our recent efforts have been to evaluate kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on different carbon substrate – electrocatalyst combinations in acidic V 3+ /V 2+ environment. Overall, this study aims to provide a profound understanding of reliable operating conditions to establish a synergy between Mn 3+ disproportionation during the conventional energy storage mode and the total volume of hydrogen gas produced during the secondary mode.

Solid-state magneto-ionic (MI) effects have shown promise for energy-efficient nanoelectronics, where ionic migration may be used to achieve atomic-scale control of interfaces in magnetic nanostructures. To date, magneto-ionics have been mostly explored in oxygen-based systems [1-4], while there is a surge of interest in alternative ionic systems due to their different ionic migration mechanisms and characteristics [5-7]. We have recently demonstrated effective MI control of magnetic functionalities using a variety of ionic species, particularly nitrogen. In nitride-based Ta/CoFe/MnN/Ta films, the chemically induced MI effect is combined with the electric field driving of nitrogen to electrically manipulate exchange bias [8]. Upon field-cooling the heterostructure, ionic diffusion of nitrogen from MnN into the Ta layers occurs. A significant exchange bias is observed, which can be further enhanced by ~ 20% after voltage conditioning (Figs. 1a-1e). This enhancement can be reversed by voltage conditioning with an opposite polarity. Nitrogen migration within the MnN layer and into the Ta capping layer causes the enhancement in exchange bias, which is observed in polarized neutron reflectometry studies. We have also achieved all-nitride-based magneto-ionic systems [9]. Thin films of (001)-ordered Mn 4 N are grown by sputtering Mn onto Mn 3 N 2 seed layer on Si (100) substrate. Nitrogen ion migration across the Mn 3 N 2 /Mn layers leads to a continuous evolution of the layers to Mn 3 N 2 /Mn 4 N, Mn 2 N/Mn 4 N, and eventually Mn 4 N alone (Figs. 1f-1g). Furthermore, we have demonstrated MI control of the exchange bias effect in an all-nitride Mn 4 N/MnN x system, where the field-trained exchange field can be varied up to ten times by introducing or extracting nitrogen from the nitride system. This is achieved by adjusting the nitrogen gas partial pressure during deposition or varying annealing temperature after deposition. These effects demonstrate contrasts with oxygen-based MI effects in terms of operating principles, switching speed, and reversibility. Such MI systems are valuable platforms to gain quantitative understanding at buried interfaces. They also offer potentials for device applications based on electric modulation of magnetic functionalities.

Continued efforts towards the decarbonization of the power sector through an uptake of renewable energy generation, namely solar and wind, play a key role in the fight against climate change. However, due to their variable nature, the simultaneous implementation of energy storage solutions capable of ensuring a reliable delivery of energy at any time of day is of the utmost importance. Aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (RZIBs) are a promising technology for this end. Offering several advantages over lithium-ion batteries in terms of cost, environmental impact, and material abundance, the investment in RZIB research continues to grow. However, the realization of commercial RZIBs is currently hindered by the lack of cathode materials with adequate performance for long-term storage solutions. This is the case for manganese ( e.g., MnO 2 , Mn 2 O 3 , Mn 3 O 4 ) and vanadium ( e.g. , V 2 O 5 , VO 2 ) based oxides, which exhibit considerable capacity fade during realistic charge and discharge times. While simple transition metal oxides (M y O x , M=transition metal) are one of the most studied classes of materials for RZIB cathodes, a literature survey shows that there are still many unexplored redox active elements and redox pairs which may be employed in next-generation RZIBs. Therefore, to accelerate the discovery of these novel cathode systems, we mapped the theoretical Zn intercalation potential for simple oxides from 12 different transition metals using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculated thermodynamic properties. The screened elements were chosen upon considering their commercial availability, toxicity, price, and existence of previously reported structures containing zinc. During the present analysis, the feasibility of Zn intercalation for each system was accounted for by analyzing the atomic arrangement in the charged and discharged phases. Experimentally obtained Pourbaix Diagrams were also used to probe the electrochemical stability of the cathodes in aqueous solution, with the possibility of electrolyte degradation (oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction) and competing reactions (metal dissolution or solid phase change) also considered. Experimental validation of the computationally predicted potentials was also done for select materials. The result for the 35+ redox pairs evaluated in this study provides a clear roadmap for the future development of RZIBs cathodes.

Cobalt is an important additive within commercially available energy devices including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and portable devices, and electrolyzers for water splitting. Regarding devices that include a proton exchange membrane (PEM), such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), cobalt-based materials are commonly used to perform the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. However, given the acidic environment induced by the PEM (pH = 1), cobalt is thermodynamically unstable at ORR and HER relevant potentials, which results in cobalt dissolution and consequently decreases in device performance and lifetime. Minimizing electrode degradation of cobalt-based materials in acidic environments therefore requires a holistic understanding of cobalt’s degradation mechanisms, as it would be necessary to simultaneously monitor electrochemical output (current/voltage), cobalt dissolution, and product formation, which is not possible with one technique alone. To gain such an understanding, in this presentation I will discuss our work on developing comparable time-resolved techniques such as on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS) to investigate the relationship between applied potential, time, cobalt dissolution, and product formation. With usage of EC-MS, it was observed that cobalt is active for HER in 0.1 M HClO 4. and undergoes little to no cobalt dissolution (< 1 ng s -1 ) at potentials where cobalt is evolving H 2 per ICP-MS measurements. This suggests that cobalt stability in acid strongly coincides with hydrogen evolution. In addition, when comparing cobalt’s material stability from the on-line ICP-MS experiments with its thermodynamic stability from its Pourbaix diagram, there is little to no cobalt dissolution at potentials outside its thermodynamic stability window. This is unexpected, as cobalt is projected to be thermodynamically stable only at potentials less than -0.277 V RHE (Co 2+ /Co = -0.277 V RHE for a dissolved total metal ion concentration of 1 M at pH = 1), whereas our data shows that cobalt dissolution is suppressed until -0.05 V RHE . Through combining findings from both EC-MS and ICP-MS, we have postulated a stability mechanism related to surface hydrogen coverage on cobalt that can be used to explain why cobalt is stable during HER and at potentials it is thermodynamically expected to be unstable. In addition to cobalt being HER active, we also uncovered its activity for ORR in O 2 saturated 0.1 M HClO 4 . Cobalt dissolution under O 2 versus N 2 saturated 0.1 M HClO 4 was then compared, and it was observed that in the presence of O 2 , cobalt dissolution occurs faster (~3x more dissolution), likely due to O 2 induced chemical dissolution. However, after 3 cycles, the observed cobalt dissolution rates under both gas types are equivalent (~225 ng s -1 ), indicating an important relationship between time, potential, and electrochemical environment. Altogether, this work showcases how time-resolved techniques such as ICP-MS and EC-MS can be connected to unravel stability mechanisms of materials and motivative future studies to apply a holistic approach when evaluating material stability.

Converting chemical processing to carbon-free or to closed carbon cycle processing (e.g. carbon neutral) will require large quantities of sustainable, and likely electrically produced, fuels and processes. Hydrogen is both a chemical fuel alternative, but also an important commodity for chemical manufacturing e.g. ammonia production for fertilizers. Water electrolyzers (WE) and hydrogen fuel cells (H2FCs) for either making or converting hydrogen to electrical energy will require cheaper and more readily available catalyst materials than the current platinum or iridium based state-of-the-art. Alkaline zero-gap devices (anion exchange membrane, AEM WE or H2FCs) offer a promising landscape for earth abundant materials, however they have traditionally underperformed due to large scale component instabilities, e.g. membranes, ionomer, catalysts, etc. With recent advances in alkaline membrane technology it is imperative that commercializable catalysts are developed. Due to a variety of architectural differences, the dissimilar microenvironments and catalyst-electrolyte-gas interfaces between classical fundamental (e.g. three electrode cell measurements with a rotating disc electrode (RDE) and device studies makes it difficult to translate materials to industrial readiness. It is imperative that these trends translate from the small lab-scale (mA), an environment that engenders rapid catalyst evaluation, to industrial-relevant scales (> A) in multi-variable devices. Herein I will discuss work we have done both on developing a robust a platform for measuring performance trends across length scales and microenvironments and expanding tools for characterizing in situ material stability related primarily to WE and H2FCs. For H2FCs, I will discuss our teams’ recent work translating Ag-Pd catalysts from first principles with density function theory (DFT), to classic fundamental studies with RDEs, and finally to H2FCs with a max ~ 10 W/mgPGM on the cathode. 1,2 I will discuss the thin film, ionomer-free system that extended across length scales and microenvironments and how we are currently using this platform to develop Ag-based fully non-platinum group metal catalysts. Comparing both H2FCs and WEs, I will go on to discuss one large component of performance, stability, and our ongoing efforts to develop tools for in situ characterization. On-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (on-line ICP-MS) and electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS) are emerging tools for monitoring material dissolution and product production, respectively, in real time. By coupling these techniques, looking at Co-based metals we have identified degradation mechanisms as well as windows of stable hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction catalysis in highly acidic electrolytes. A focus on catalyst activity and nature of the active site across microenvironments and in situ material stability provides insights that could enable the next generation materials and stabilization techniques, e.g. in situ, synthetic, morphology, etc. for improving overall performance across technological length scales.

(1) Background: Supercritical water-cooled reactors (SCWRs) and their smaller modular variants (SMRs) are part of the ‘Generation IV International Forum’ (GIF) on advanced nuclear energy systems. These reactors operate beyond the critical point of water (tc = 373.95 °C and Pc = 22.06 MPa), which introduces specific technical challenges that need to be addressed. The primary concerns involve the effects of intense radiation fields—including fast neutrons, recoil protons/oxygen ions, and γ rays—on the chemistry of the coolant fluid and the integrity of construction materials. (2) Methods: This study employs Monte Carlo simulations of radiation track chemistry to investigate the yields of radiolytic species in SCWRs/SMRs exposed to 2 MeV neutrons. In our calculations, only the contributions from the first three recoil protons with initial energies of 1.264, 0.465, and 0.171 MeV were considered. Our analysis was conducted at both subcritical (300 and 350 °C) and supercritical temperatures (400–600 °C), maintaining a constant pressure of 25 MPa. (3) Results: Our simulations provide insights into the radiolytic formation of chemical species such as e−aq, H●, H2, ●OH, and H2O2 from ~1 ps to 1 ms. Compared to data from radiation with low linear energy transfer (LET), the G(e−aq) and G(●OH) values obtained for fast neutrons show a similar temporal dependence but with smaller amplitude—a result demonstrating the high LET nature of fast neutrons. A notable outcome of our simulations is the marked increase in G(●OH) and G(H2), coupled with a corresponding reduction in G(H●), observed during the homogeneous chemical stage of radiolysis. This evolution is attributed to the oxidation of water by the H● atom according to the reaction H● + H2O → ●OH + H2. This reaction acts as a significant source of H2, potentially reducing the need to add extra hydrogen to the reactor’s coolant water to suppress the net radiolytic production of oxidizing species. Unlike in subcritical water, our simulations also indicate that G(H2O2) remains very low in low-density SCW throughout the interval from ~1 ps to 1 ms, suggesting that H2O2 is less likely to contribute to oxidative stress under these conditions. (4) Conclusions: The results of this study could significantly impact water-chemistry management in the proposed SCWRs and SCW-SMRs, which is crucial for assessing and mitigating the corrosion risks to reactor materials, especially for long-term operation.

In recent years, a growing interest has been paid in developing new and more efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting [1]. This study focuses on the synthesis of amorphous and nanocrystalline Ni-Co alloys through a one-step electrodeposition technique in pure ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), a protic ionic liquid. The use of ionic liquid prevents from the formation of oxide film during the electrodeposition of the metal [2]. However, only few studies involve protic ionic liquids and the use of EAN, in particular, the electrodeposition of Ni/Co-based materials is still scarce. In this work, the physicochemical properties of EAN with different concentrations of Ni 2+ and Co 2+ salts were investigated, along with the electrochemical behavior of these metal cations in the protic ionic liquid in an aerated atmosphere. Moreover, the redox reversibility of electrochemical systems involving Ni and Co ions were examined by cyclic voltammetry, revealing the formation of an oxide film or side-reactions in the presence of air during electrodeposition, showing the need to prepare these materials in an oxygen-free environment. The deposits have then been characterized by TEM (Figure 1). Nanocrystalline Ni-Co alloys with different atomic ratios were obtained depending on the deposition potential and ion concentrations. We showed that when a higher cathodic potential is applied (-1.3 V/Ag/Ag + ), the amorphous Ni 51.9 Co 48.1 alloy could be electrodeposited, instead of nanocrystalline alloys. The XRD and SEM analyses exhibited different morphologies and atomic structures of the synthesized alloys. The electrocatalytic properties of the synthesized materials were investigated towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results showed that the addition of Co in Ni-based alloys could enhance the HER, and notably, amorphous Ni-Co alloys exhibited lower overpotential, indicating better reaction abilities and faster reaction rates. The deposited Ni-Co alloys on Cu board also demonstrated good stability during the recycle measurement. This study provides a new pathway for preparing nanocrystalline and amorphous Ni-Co alloys with different ratios using protic ionic liquid, which can have practical applications and good performances in electrocatalysis such as water splitting.

The markets for modern low-cost electrochemical gas sensors have been growing for longer than sensors have been around. Energy markets for gas sensors include the oil, gas and electricity industries as well as the new developing and fast growing green energy sectors. The primary gases to detect include combustible hydrocarbons, oxygen, and toxic gases. Specifically, we are interested in methane (blue and green), ammonia, and H 2 for the renewable energy sectors but include hydrocarbon fuels and CO 2 as a greenhouse gas emission. The reasons for monitoring crosscut all areas of the energy business and include applications in production, transport, storage and use. Primary sensor uses include: 1) health and safety (people and assets), 2) leak detection and isolation to help mitigate product losses, 3) monitoring to protect the environment and 4) measurements for process control and efficacy. Each of these areas of sensing have special requirements and demand cost-effective and time efficient sensor performance in many and varied real world scenarios. Electrochemical gas sensors have a long and rich history starting with the commercialization of the first practical potentiometric CO 2 gas sensor by Severinghaus in 1954 and the O 2 amperometric sensor by Clark in 1956 that launched the modern blood gas analysis industry. Additional milestones include the introduction of the “diffusion electrode” in 1968 creating the modern amperometric sensor which has produced a large array of sensors for toxic and hazardous gases including H 2 , ammonia, and other energy gases. Progress has been made in the field of electrochemical gas sensors, not only in improving performance, sensitivity, selectivity, response time, and stability, but also in logistical properties including miniaturization, lower power consumption, low cost as well as communication and computation to make automated-operational systems. New high-volume production has contributed to lower costs commensurate with a chip-based sensor mentality. The evolution of one of the gas sensor technologies is given below (the room temperature AGS or amperometric gas sensor) and similar progress has been seen in mixed potential and solid state gas sensors. The growing understanding of the sensor’s fundamental electrocatalytic reactions has led to tailored designs of electrode-electrolyte combinations and packages for the various applications. Often ignored in sensor publications of performance, the fundamental electrocatalytic studies are poised to make significant advances in energy gas sensor selectivity and sensitivity. The additional implementation of intelligent algorithms (AI/ML) to make “smart” sensors and sensor arrays complements advanced nano-materials and designs for improving sensor performance. One major improvement is our understanding of the sensor response mechanisms at the electrocatalytic level. This new research will enable new electrochemical sensor advances that are poised to impact the health and wellbeing of both people and the planet. Ideas and concepts that significantly contribute to the safe and efficient rollout of the newest green energy platforms are presented. Figure 1

In response to the global rise in energy demand, extensive research has spurred the development of batteries with high energy density, affordable cost, and safety. The present Li-ion batteries are attractive due to their high energy density, but their cost and geopolitical accessibility of raw materials, along with safety-related issues, have led researchers to shift their attention towards aqueous batteries. 1,2 In aqueous systems, zinc metal has been regarded as the most promising candidate due to its high specific capacity, low redox potential of Zn-metal, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, challenges such as the dendritic growth of zinc, hydrogen evolution, corrosion, structural degradation and dissolution of oxide cathodes, and poor coulombic efficiencies (CEs) limit their scope. To address these issues, various studies demonstrate the usage of organic co-solvents and additives such as DMSO 3 , DMC 4 , etc. at different concentrations in the electrolytes. However, the overall efficiency of the battery performance is hindered due to the large amount requirements of these additives. Along this line, we have studied the electrochemical properties of a hybrid water-highly polar propylene carbonate-based electrolyte, which suppresses water-derived parasitic reactions occurring at both the Zn anode and the V 2 O 5 cathode. 5 We have observed a significant enhancement in the battery characteristics, such as high coulombic efficiency and stable capacity, merely by tuning the solvation structure of the electrolyte. Upon a small addition of PC (20 wt.%) in 1M Zn(OTf) 2 electrolyte, water molecules solvating Zn 2+ ions are replaced by carbonate and triflate anions. The solvated Zn-ion species were further electrochemically reduced to form a ZnF 2 -rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), as demonstrated by post-cycling XPS studies. Moreover, the spectroscopy studies suggest the strong interaction of highly basic carbonyl oxygen of PC with water molecules, which in turn suppresses the dissolution of the cathode, enabling exceptional capacities of ∼300 mAh g −1 over 900 cycles at 1 A g −1 . We further demonstrate the significance of the dielectric constant and polarity of an additive or cosolvent in the aqueous zinc ion battery electrolyte by contrasting the performance of cyclic propylene carbonate with acyclic dimethyl carbonate.

Transition to a decarbonized society will rely on clean energy resources, in particular on "green” hydrogen—a renewable energy carrier that can be generated via water electrolysis [1]. Unlike proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) enable the use of earth-abundant transition metals in both the cathode and anode [2]. In addition, unlike liquid alkaline water electrolyzers, which use a highly concentrated alkaline media (6 M KOH), AEMWEs can operate with low-concentrated electrolyte, and even pure water [3]. Developing active and durable platinum group metal-free (PGM-free) electrocatalysts is crucial for the large-scale implementation of the AEMWE technology. Ni-based electrocatalysts have shown good activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media [4]. Herein, carbon supported Ni-derived NiO nanosphere electrocatalysts are synthetized via a sol-gel method followed by thermal treatment under reducing atmosphere. We explored several synthesis parameters, i.e., Ni-to-carbon ratio, annealing temperature, and annealing time. We also investigated the impact of these synthesis variables on the HER activity in alkaline electrolyte. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, and EDS. The formation of Ni metal particles with a thin oxygen-rich layer on the surface was demonstrated by microscopy and crystallographic characterization. Following optimization, the HER overpotential of the best performing electrocatalyst at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 was reduced to ca. 130 mV. The catalyst durability was tested over 100 h in KOH solutions at different electrolyte concentrations using various testing protocols such as constant current hold and potential cycling. The catalyst showed higher HER activity (100 mV lower HER overpotential) and better durability behavior (0.15 mV/h lower degradation rate) compared to a commercial Ni supported Vulcan XC-72 electrocatalyst.

Hydrogen is an essential commodity for achieving cleaner and greener energy. 1,2 Due to its high gravimetric energy density, hydrogen is favored as a carbon-neutral fuel. 2,3 Moreover, the electrochemical accessibility of hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions enable hydrogen to be used as a reversible fuel, as in hydrogen battery anodes and unitized reversible fuel cells. 4,5 Platinum group metals (PGMs) are excellent catalyst for hydrogen chemistry, as they exhibit negligible activation barrier for HER and HOR, but they are costly and the upstream processes for mining and purification are unsustainable. 6 A promising alternative to PGM catalysts would be nonprecious transition metal alloys/composites in form of nanoparticles. These materials are more readily available and lower in cost. Nonetheless, non-precious catalysts developed to date have never met the benchmarks set by PGMs in terms of catalytic activity and stability. Our lab is continuing a long-running effort to develop and improve nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) composites, which stand as one of the strongest candidates for non-PGM HER and the HOR. In prior work, we developed a method to synthesize Ni–Mo nanoparticles supported on oxidized carbon, which increases catalyst dispersion and significantly reduces losses due to interfacial resistivity. 7 The catalyst composite has a core@shell structure, where in the core is mainly nickel-rich alloy and the shell is primarily molybdenum-rich oxide. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggest the addition of Mo in the catalyst subsurface weakens hydrogen binding to surface Ni sites, thus increasing the overall activity toward HER/HOR. 8 In ongoing work to further develop Ni–Mo/C composites, we are focusing on catalyst degradation under storage and operating conditions. To examine catalyst durability upon extended storage, we measured activity toward hydrogen evolution progressively for a single batch of catalyst powdered retained at room temperature in an aerobic environment over 850 hours. We observed a monotonic decrease in catalytic activity culminating in a >90% decrease in activity. Post-mortem analysis via XRD showed the increased peak intensities corresponding to NiO and MoO 3 . We further observed that the catalyst remains active over extended periods when stored under a dry, oxygen-free atmosphere. Finally, exposing the degraded catalyst to thermal reduction increased catalytic activity. Together, these results strongly suggest aerobic oxidation as the primary degradation mechanism under shelf-storage, with straightforward mitigations steps readily available by excluding air and water. This finding further suggests that oxide component of the synthesized catalyst is not an active site for hydrogen chemistry, although we speculate that some surface oxide is beneficial for enhancing the rate of water dissociation. 9 We also studied the impact of the ionomer chemistry on the catalytic activity of Ni–Mo composites for alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer applications. Surprisingly, we observed an ~80% reduction in catalytic activity for Ni–Mo composites formulated into thin film HER catalysts using poly(aryl piperidinium) (PAP) carbonate AEM ionomers relative to control samples based on Na-exchanged Nafion ionomer binders. Further work showed this result was specific to the carbonate form of the ionomer, as HER activity was fully recovered when we used halide forms of the PAP ionomer. Work is ongoing to establish the physicochemical basis of this poisoning effect. Based on these findings, we developed functional AEM electrolyzer assemblies with IrO x anodes and Ni–Mo/C cathodes, where the cathode composition was formulated based on our best results from RDE studies. These MEAs yielded electrolyzer performance properties that were indistinguishable from MEAs we tested using Pt–Ru/C cathodes that were otherwise identical in composition. 8 This leads us to conclude that advanced Ni–Mo/C catalyst composites can indeed achieve performance parity with PGM catalysts on the basis of initial catalytic activity, whereas significant work remains to characterize durability under extended operating conditions.

Among all positive electrode materials for K-ion batteries (KIBs), KVPO 4 F offers a high theoretical capacity of 131 mAh·g -1 and an average working potential reaching above 4.3 V vs K + /K, resulting in a theoretical energy density of up to 520 Wh·kg -1 . [1] The anionic substitution of fluorine by oxygen in KVPO 4 F 1-x O x (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) induces an increasing working potential by activating the V 3+/4+ and V 4+/5+ redox couples and replacing the VO 4 F 2 “ionic” entity by {V=O}O 5 unit with a highly “covalent” vanadyl-type bond. [2] The accurate prediction of the electrode potential as well as the understanding of the mechanisms involved upon cycling requires the determination of how the coordination environment of the transition metal ion influences the ionicity/covalency of the metal-ligand bonds and thus the electronic structure. Nevertheless, discriminating these ligands remains a challenge due to the limited sensitivity to light elements of common characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Despite the valuable information from these techniques, fundamental concerns still need to be addressed which include: i) the implication of the covalent V=O vanadyl bond in the electronic structure; ii) the difference of V cis and V trans , the two different sites for V, in the electronic configuration of the material; and finally, (iii) the impact of F/O ligands on the electrochemical mechanism upon battery cycling. To address this issue, we employed valence-to-core Kβ X-ray emission spectroscopy (VtC XES) combined with ab initio modelling and conducted a systematic investigation of KVPO 4 F 1-x O x : two distinct regions were identified in the spectra, Kβ" and Kβ 2,5 , which are critical to probe the electronic structure close to the Fermi level and to discriminate different ligands coordinated with the vanadium atoms. [3] Our approach allows distinguishing in KVPO 4 F 1-x O x the contributions of V-F, V-O, and V=O bonds, with intensities at the Kβ" region highly correlated to the F - and O 2- anionic composition. Additionally, the evolution of the features at the Kβ 2,5 region is highly associated to the presence of short V=O bonds, strongly influencing the electrode potential of the material. Overall, we present a detailed and reliable approach for understanding the occupied electronic states of the electrode material, proving valuable for a thorough comprehension of the structural and redox mechanisms involved in batteries.

Carbon-supported nitrogen-coordinated single-metal site catalysts (i.e., M−N−C, M: Fe, Co, or Ni) are active for the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. (1) We comprehensively engineered FeN 4 and NiNx sites for electrochemical CO 2 reduction to CO considering the particle sizes of the catalysts, metal content, and the M−N (M: Fe or Ni) bond structures. (2, 3) The unique M-N-C model allows us to elucidate each factor′s role exclusively regarding the promotion of CO 2 reduction. (4) Optimal particle sizes and Fe content provide favorable external factors to improve mass activity. Structural changes of M−N bonds controlled by thermal activation temperatures can intrinsically enhance CO selectivity and kinetic activity. Notably, the NiN 3 active sites with optimal local structures formed at higher temperatures ( e.g. , 1200 °C) are intrinsically more active and CO-selective than NiN4, providing a new opportunity to design a highly active catalyst via populating NiN 3 sites with increased density. Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N−M bond structures and coordination is limited. We further expand the coordination environments of M−N−C catalysts by designing dual-metal active sites. (5) The Ni-Fe catalyst exhibited the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N-coordinated dual-metal site configurations are 2N-bridged (Fe-Ni)N 6 , in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual-metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single-metal sites (FeN 4 or NiN 4 ) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.

The integration of a silicon-based light emitter into existing CMOS technology has long been intriguing due to its optoelectronic compatibility with microelectronics [1]. However, the indirect band gap nature of bulk silicon has hindered its effectiveness as a light emitter. In addressing this limitation, rare earth ions have emerged as significantly interesting candidates owing to their unique optical and electronic properties. Rare earth-doped silicon structures have earned special attention as they exhibit sharp light emission in different spectral regions [2] . This notable feature is attributed to the effective excitation of rare earth ions within the host matrix. Efficiently excited rare earth ions can produce visible emissions ranging from infrared to ultraviolet, presenting possibilities in diverse applications such as solid-state lighting, displays, lasers, photovoltaics, and optical communication. The incorporation of rare earth-doped silicon structures presents a promising solution to overcome the challenges posed by silicon's intrinsic properties, thereby paving the way for improved performance across a diverse range of optoelectronic applications. Europium is a attractive rare earth material with two optically active states, Eu 2+ and Eu 3+ , enabling it to generate a diverse range of color emissions extending from blue to red depending on the surrounding matrix [3]. In this study, we investigated the optical properties and compositions of europium (Eu)-doped thin films including silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, and silicon carbonitride. For this purpose, thin films were fabricated by electron cyclotron resonance plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ECR-PECVD) with in-situ magnetron sputtering on p-type 3" Si (100) substrates. In-situ Eu doping was performed by a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering gun, using a 0.25 in. thick, 2 in. (diameter) 99.9% pure Eu sputtering target. Precursor gases, including silane (diluted in 90% argon), oxygen (diluted in 90% argon), nitrogen (diluted in 90% argon), and ethane were utilized. Annealing was performed on the as-deposited films over a broad temperature range, from 600° to 1100°C, in a nitrogen (N 2 ) environment. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) was performed to determine the atomic concentration of the film constituents. Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) analysis was conducted to investigate the optical properties of the films. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) experiments were performed using a laser diode excitation source operating at a wavelength of 375nm. Notably, bright visible emission was observed in some of the thin films. Finally, we discuss the influence of the atomic concentration of Eu and the annealing temperature on the emission properties observed in the photoluminescence experiments. [1] F. Azmi, Y. Gao, Z.

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) has emerged as a promising technology to support the shift away from fossil fuels in the chemical industry. When coupled with renewable energies it allows for an overall carbon-negative process, while enabling CO 2 as a carbon source for the production of commodity chemicals. Efficient eCO 2 R requires gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) that provide a large wetted surface area inside the porous system, while also preserving gaseous diffusion pathways for CO 2 mass transport through their hydrophobicity. Under the high cathodic overpotential in eCO 2 R, electrowetting diminishes the hydrophobicity of the GDE and can lead to excessive flooding of the porous system [1]. This severely hinders the CO 2 mass transport and thus gives rise to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), lowering the Faradaic efficiency of the process. Therefore, understanding the flooding behavior of GDEs is of major interest for further development of the process. Mathematic models can be applied here to describe the flooding state under the influence of electrowetting and elucidate its influence on the gas transport through the GDE. The validation of such models requires direct experimental measurements of the electrolyte saturation during eCO 2 R, which can be accomplished with the use of synchrotron radiation [2]. In this work, experimental results for the direct measurement of the electrolyte saturation during eCO 2 R in sprayed silver GDEs are presented. In a first, these measurements were obtained in operando synchrotron tomography experiments, utilizing a high beam energy to penetrate through the 3 mm diameter GDE in the in-plane direction. The results indicate a higher beam absorption towards the gas side of the GDE, as well as higher absorption at increased current density. Key to the interpretation of these results is the disentanglement of the effects of concentration increase due to migration in the electric field and the actual increase in electrolyte saturation. The experimental results are used to validate a continuum model for a sprayed silver GDE in eCO 2 R which includes the effect of electrowetting on flooding behavior by introducing capillary pressure – saturation and contact angle – potential correlations [3]. A good agreement between model and tomography results is reached, showing an interplay between concentration increase and flooding effects. [1] Bienen, F., Paulisch, M.

Abstract The Tongbai-Hong’an-Dabie orogenic belt (THD) contains over 3 million tonnes (Mt) of metal Mo. At least 10 porphyry Mo deposits developed in small to giant scales, forming a significant Mo mineralized belt in China. Ore genetic models of these porphyry Mo deposits have been widely discussed; however, key factors responsible for forming the large to giant porphyry Mo deposits still remain unclear. In this study, we investigated samples from three small deposits (Wangwan, Mushan, and Bao’anzhai) and two large to giant deposits (Tangjiaping and Shapinggou) in the THD. Comprehensive characterization of whole-rock compositions and in situ geochemical analysis of apatite, plagioclase, and biotite from these deposits were conducted to provide potential distinguishable indicators for evaluating the prospectivity of a given magmatic suite in continental collisional settings. The data show that the productive granites from the large to giant Tangjiaping and Shapinggou deposits are characterized by higher Nd-Hf-O isotopes than those in the small ones, as well as magma temperatures of 832° and 860°C. It is also noteworthy that a significant number of mafic igneous rocks were intruded in the THD, such as in the Tangjiaping deposit, coeval with the formation of the Mo deposits. Apatite within the contemporary mafic enclaves of the Lingshan granitic pluton is anticipated to demonstrate the key geochemical characteristics of these mafic rocks, with the apatite displaying high SO3 contents ranging from 0.45 to 0.91 wt %.These observations suggest that the formation of large to giant porphyry Mo deposits could be linked to the replenishment of the hotter mafic magma in the deep magma chamber in extensional tectonic settings, which might provide sufficient heat and sulfur in parent fertile magmas. The reverse zoning and complex core-to-rim variations in the plagioclase crystals from mafic enclaves provide further evidence for magma mixing processes in the deep magma chamber in the THD from the regional perspective. Magma oxygen fugacity in the Tangjiaping and Shapinggou deposits derived from biotite chemistry is comparable to that in the small ones, implying minimal controls on the large to giant Mo mineralization. The application of plagioclase-based hygrometer reveals that fertile magmas from Tangjiaping and Shapinggou are less hydrous with H2O contents of 3~4 wt %. However, estimates of absolute sulfur and fluorine contents in these mineralization-related melts from apatite SO3 and F contents using available partitioning models suggest that they are indeed significantly richer in S and F, with contents of 45 to 301 and 2,100 to 2,852 ppm, respectively. Moreover, these magmas are also characterized by lower magma viscosity with log ƞ values of 6.0 to 6.4 Pa s, as calculated from whole-rock and apatite compositions. In contrast to primary fertile chlorine-rich fluids responsible for porphyry Cu deposits, the primary ore-forming fluids in the Tangjiaping and Shapinggou in equilibrium with biotite are enriched in fluorine with intercept values (IV[F]) of 0.75 to 1.23. Also, log(fHCl/fHF) and log(fH2O/fHF) values derived from biotite and XF/XCl, XCl/XOH ratios and SO3 contents in apatite record that hydrous volatile exsolution from melts occurred earlier during the magmatic-hydrothermal evolution in the Tangjiaping and Shapinggou deposits. In detail, our modeling illustrates that primary fluids initially developed at high temperatures exceeding 765°C. Meanwhile, S and Cl were extracted from the melts into primary ore fluids, leading to a reduction in their concentrations within the melts, decreasing from 0.03 to 0.005 wt % for S and from 0.030 to 0.005 wt % for Cl. This process accounts for the generation of high-temperature, low-Cl, and S-rich ore-forming fluids.

Emerging memory devices play a major role in implementing artificial neural networks as basic types of neuromorphic hardware. They provide extra functionality to conventional CMOS technology, such as the ability to implement non-volatile memory within a nanoscale region on the chip. Among 2-terminal devices, the resistive switching random access memory (RRAM) devices are very promising for these applications. However, the mechanisms of resistance changes depend on the oxide and metal electrode material and are still debated. Under an applied stress bias, MIM devices experience changes in their resistance from relatively large, in the high resistance state (HRS), to relatively low, in the low resistance state (LRS). These effects have generally been attributed to defect generation and aggregation in the oxide and depend on the chemical nature of metal electrodes. Using multiscale modelling, we investigate the role of electron injection and hydrogen incorporation inside amorphous (a) oxide films of SiO 2 , HfO 2 , Al 2 O 3 and at interfaces with Si and TiN electrodes in creation of new defects, oxide degradation, and resistance change. The initial models of a-SiO 2 , a-HfO 2 and a-Al 2 O 3 structures are created using classical force-fields and the LAMMPS package. The volume and geometry of all structures are fully optimized using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the CP2K code with the range-separated hybrid PBE0-TC-LRC functional, as described in detail in [1]. The results demonstrate that hole injection into amorphous SiO 2 , HfO 2 and Al 2 O 3 leads to hole localization at low-coordinated O sites in the amorphous network [2]. Injected extra electrons localize in amorphous SiO 2 and HfO 2 in deep states about 3.0 eV below the mobility edge [2]. Trapping of up to two electrons at intrinsic sites results in weakening of Si-O and Hf-O bonds and emergence of efficient bond breaking pathways for producing neutral O vacancies and interstitial O i 2- ions with low activation barriers [2]. These barriers as well as barriers for migration of the O 2- ion (< 0.5 eV) are further reduced by bias application. Simulations of SiO 2 /TiN interfaces [3] explain how, as a result of electroforming, the system undergoes very significant structural changes with the oxide being significantly reduced, interface being oxidized, and part of the oxygen leaving the system. Creation of O vacancies facilitates trap-assisted tunnelling through oxide films and is responsible for oxide charging and leakage current. Hydrogen and metal incorporation from metal electrodes leads to creation of additional defects in the oxide. DFT calculations of the incorporation and diffusion of Ag in Ag/SiO 2 /Me (Me=W or Pt) RRAM devices [4] show how the interplay between Ag + ion diffusion, electron injection and vacancy creation lead to the formation of Ag clusters and filaments. Atomistic simulations of defect creation in amorphous oxide films are combined with kinetic simulations of trap assisted tunnelling of electrons and ionic diffusion through oxide [5,6]. They provide the mechanisms and time evolution of oxide charging and degradation. These mechanisms are used to simulate the kinetics of dielectric breakdown in devices and explain the mechanisms of set and reset in RRAM devices. [1] A-M. El-Sayed et al., Phys, Rev.

Rechargeable Zinc-air batteries (RZAB) emerge as highly promising solutions for electrochemical energy storage (EES) applications. Nevertheless, a noteworthy drawback in the existing generation of these batteries lies in the air gas-diffusion electrode (GDE). This component grapples with issues related to both efficiency and durability. In response to this challenge, our research is concentrated on the creation of a novel GDE, accompanied by an in-depth examination of its electrochemical, structural, and compositional characteristics. The primary objective is to comprehensively assess the physico-chemical factors that exert an influence on its efficiency and durability. In the case of the present research, two different catalysts were chosen for the ORR (discharge) and OER (charge) electrocatalysis, namely α-MnO 2 nanorods (NR) and Ni nanoparticles (NP), respectively. The GDEs were produced by applying a water-based catalyst ink, augmented with PTFE and C-black, through spray-coating onto a carbon paper support, which serves as the gas diffusion layer (GDL). Initially, the ideal proportion of OER/ORR catalyst was determined by conducting electrochemical tests on both the individual material (via RRDE studies) and the gas diffusion electrode using a rapid screening protocol. The material extracted from the GDEs, in pristine state and after ageing under operating conditions, was then characterized with electrochemical methods, SEM microscopy, HRTEM/SAED microscopy/electron diffraction, as well as with direct- and Fourier-space soft x-ray transmission microscopy (STXM) at the Mn, Ni and Zn L-edges. The electrochemical tests conducted in this study demonstrated a progressive improvement in performance as the nickel nanoparticle content increased, until a plateau is reached after 23% wt. Specifically, lower overpotentials were observed alongside increased cyclic stability for the combined ORR/OER processes. These assessments were conducted in two distinct electrolyte environments: pure KOH and KOH with the inclusion of Zn 2+ . The inclusion of Zn 2+ aimed to replicate and understand the potential impact of anode chemistry on the cathode's overall performance. The investigation employed HRTEM and SAED analyses to meticulously monitor alterations in the crystal structure of the α-MnO 2 electrocatalyst under diverse aging conditions. Notably, during ORR cycling, the manganese nanorods underwent amorphization. However, cyclic processes between oxygen OER and ORR revealed the recovering of the original crystalline phase. The introduction of Zn 2+ into the system resulted in the formation of a partially amorphous Zn-Mn mixed oxide. To delve further into the nuanced changes, soft-X ray hyperspectral imaging, both in direct and Fourier space was employed. By spectral imaging at the Mn and Ni L-edges, we could assess the space-dependent valence alterations of Manganese and Nickel at different stages of aging with space resolution down to a few tens of nanometers. The integration of diverse analytical techniques, including electrochemical assessments, STXM, HRTEM/ SAED imaging, along with space-resolved structural analyses, has provided a comprehensive, molecular-level understanding of the performance and degradation of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts within the realistic context of gas diffusion electrodes. Of particular significance is the capability of this combined approach to meticulously trace and correlate the changes in the chemical state of the manganese ORR electrocatalyst. This shift, notably away from the optimal 3+/4+ mixed valence state, was observed in response to aging and Zn 2+ contamination. The correlation of this chemical state drift with electrochemical conditions and the evolution of crystal structure adds a nuanced layer of insight into the intricate interplay of factors influencing the performance and degradation of these electrocatalysts. In particular, the control of the oxidative stress under OER, enabled by addition of Ni NPs, was correlated with preservation of α-MnO 2 crystallinity, GDE operation in the presence of Zn 2+ was proved to give rise to the formation of ZnMn 2 O 4 , poisoning the electrocatalyst. Lastly, the role of hydrophobicity of the active layer of the GDE was proven to be of crucial importance in the stability of the Mn-based catalyst, as PTFE-surrounded clusters were observed to be less affected by cycling with respect to others which clearly underwent electrolyte flooding.

Access to clean water is a pressing environmental and public health concern. Excess nitrate (NO 3 - ) from the overuse of fertilizer finds its way into our surface water and groundwater, which leads to adverse health effects such as cancer and causes significant damage to ecosystems. 1-4 The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) has emerged as a promising water treatment approach to address this issue. The NO 3 RR involves the transformation of waste NO 3 - into value-added nitrogen species, such as ammonia (NH 3 ), via reduction. NH 3 serves as a valuable chemical in various applications, including its use as a fertilizer, chemical precursor, fuel, and a potential hydrogen (H 2 ) carrier for energy storage and transportation. 5-7 Leveraging renewable energy, the NO 3 RR provides a sustainable approach to distributed NH 3 production, which stands in stark contrast to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. 8-10 As a result, there is growing interest in designing catalysts for the selective reduction of NO 3 - to NH 3 . However, this requires that we obtain a clear understanding of the role of each component in the catalyst structure. Molecular catalysts have unique advantages over other electrocatalytic materials due to their well-defined structures, which can be tailored through the choice of the metal center and ligands. 11,12 Moreover, molecular catalysts can be immobilized on substrates to create heterogeneous electrocatalysts capable of achieving a high current density. 13,14 In previous investigations, we showcased the efficacy of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a catalyst support for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. 13,15 In heterogenized molecular catalysts, CNTs are generally believed to provide high surface area and electron conduction. However, our recent investigation reveals that CNTs can serve as catalysts themselves for the NO 3 RR, 16 which expands our understanding of the diverse roles CNTs play in NO 3 - reduction electrocatalysis. A major challenge in the field of electrocatalysis is the development of catalyst design strategies to control the reaction selectivity. We report on an underexplored approach to overcome this challenge by tuning the CNT support for a cobalt complex. With pristine CNTs as the support, the cobalt complex/CNT hybrid catalyst is selective for NO 3 - reduction to NH 3 with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 70%. In contrast, the cobalt complex supported on oxidized CNTs (OCNTs) generates mostly H 2 under the same conditions. On the basis of kinetic measurements which reveal that the rate-determining step of NO 3 – reduction is limited by the first electron transfer without involving a proton, we propose that the oxygen functional groups on the OCNT support help deliver protons and steer the supported cobalt complexes from catalyzing NO 3 - reduction to H 2 evolution. The performance of both of these hybrid catalysts is compared with the controls of bare CNTs and OCNTs. Additional control experiments include tests conducted in the absence of NO 3 - . These control experiments together with the rest of the experimental data provide strong evidence to support the notion that the product selectivity of the NO 3 RR catalyzed by cobalt complexes can be controlled via the CNT support. This study demonstrates the importance of tailoring the catalyst support to advance reactivity in catalysis for environmental remediation. References: Follett, R. F., et al.
