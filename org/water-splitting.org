In photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, semiconductor‐based photoelectrodes can improve reaction rates and durability by incorporating cocatalysts that serve as active sites for the water splitting process. However, achieving both high light transmittance and efficient catalytic activity is essential for these cocatalysts. This study aimed to optimize the surface loading of semitransparent NiFeOx thin‐film electrocatalysts to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rates while maintaining high light transmittance. NiFeOx thin films were deposited on fluorine‐doped SnO2 (FTO) transparent conductive substrates, and the relationship between the NiFeOx loading amount (Γ) and the OER rate was examined using electrochemical techniques. The OER rate of NiFeOx on FTO (NiFeOx/FTO) was the highest at a Γ value of 0.20 μmol cm‐2. To further explore the connection between this optimized Γ and PEC activity, the impact of Γ on the PEC OER performance of visible‐light‐absorbing α‐Fe2O3 semitransparent photoanodes was evaluated as a model system. Applying the optimized Γ of NiFeOx to modify the α‐Fe2O3 surface also led to enhanced PEC OER performance. These findings highlight the critical role of surface design, specifically the optimization of cocatalyst loading and electrocatalytic activity, in improving PEC water splitting efficiency, providing valuable guidelines for future semitransparent photoelectrode development.

Abstract The application of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in the electro‐catalysis of heterogeneous structures is limited by the problems of low electrical conductivity and poor mechanical strength due to the complex synthesis process, although their high specific surface area and controllable structure. In this study, a method involving metal precipitation and ligand reaction is used during the electrochemical corrosion of hydroxides/oxy‐hydroxides to obtain ZIF‐67 in situ. The in situ growth technology not only effectively addresses the bonding strength and material conductivity challenges in the heterostructure between MOFs and the substrate but also enhances the catalyst's surface area and activity. Additionally, the exposure and protection of Co 4+ by ZIF‐67 contribute to the electrocatalyst's performance, demonstrating a low overpotential (η 100 ) of 293 mV, a Tafel slope of 25.8 mV dec −1 , and a charge transfer resistance of 3.9 Ω, with long‐term robustness proven in continuous stability test exceeding 75 000 s under the superhigh current density of 500 mA cm −2 . This work on binder‐free in situ growth of MOFs not only provides relevant theoretical insights and experimental experience for cost‐effective and controllable production of MOF‐based catalysts but also offers ideas for the development of future electrocatalysts by exploring the exposure and protection of active site using MOFs materials.

Abstract The low activity of ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) and the rapid dissolution of the ruthenium (Ru) site during acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high current density restricts its application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. In this work, a series of rare‐earth (RE) elements doped RuO 2 nanorods is developed as high‐performance OER electrocatalysts. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that RE doping regulates the local coordination environment around Ru sites, lowers the valance of Ru, and shortens the Ru─O─Ru(M) bond length, which enhances structural stability. Among the RE‐RuO 2 samples, Sm‐RuO 2 exhibits remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 283 mV to reach 100 mA cm −2 and maintained stability for over 140 h at 10 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the PEM electrolyzer using Sm‐RuO 2 as the anode can be stably operated at 500 mA cm −2 for 15 h. Electrochemical analysis, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy show that Sm doping lowers the d ‐band center, reduces the adsorption energy of O intermediates to enhance the OER activity, and restrains excessive oxidation of Ru sites while stabilizing lattice oxygen during the OER process, thereby enhancing OER stability. This work offers valuable insights into improving the stability of metal oxide catalysts in acidic electrolytes.

Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting is long constrained by the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and rational spin‐state manipulation holds great promise to break through this bottleneck. Low‐spin Fe 3+ (LS, t 2g 5 e g 0 ) species are identified as highly active sites for OER in theory, whereas it is still a formidable challenge to construct experimentally. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated for the effective construction of LS Fe 3+ in NiFe‐layered double hydroxide (NiFe‐LDH) by introducing multiple defects, which induce coordination unsaturation over Fe sites and thus enlarge their d orbital splitting energy. The as‐obtained catalyst exhibits extraordinary OER performance with an ultra‐low overpotential of 244 mV at the industrially required current density of 500 mA cm −2 , which is 110 mV lower than that of the conventional NiFe‐LDH with high‐spin Fe 3+ (HS, t 2g 3 e g 2 ) and superior to most previously reported NiFe‐based catalysts. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies reveal that LS Fe 3+ configuration effectively reduces the adsorption strength of the O* intermediate compared with that of the HS case, thereby altering the rate‐determining step from (O* → OOH*) to (OH* → O*) of OER and lowering its reaction energy barrier. This work paves a new avenue for developing efficient spin‐dependent electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.

Abstract The integration of multiple elements in a high‐entropy state is crucial in the design of high‐performance, durable electrocatalysts. High‐entropy metal hydroxide organic frameworks (HE‐MHOFs) are synthesized under mild solvothermal conditions. This novel crystalline metal–organic framework (MOF) features a random, homogeneous distribution of cations within high‐entropy hydroxide layers. HE‐MHOF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching a current density of 100 mA cm −2 at ≈1.64 V RHE , and demonstrates remarkable durability, maintaining a current density of 10 mA cm −2 for over 100 h. Notably, HE‐MHOF outperforms precious metal‐based electrocatalysts despite containing only ≈60% OER active metals. Ab initio calculations and operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate that the high‐entropy catalyst contains active sites that facilitate a multifaceted OER mechanism. This study highlights the benefits of high‐entropy MOFs in developing noble metal‐free electrocatalysts, reducing reliance on precious metals, lowering metal loading (especially for Ni, Co, and Mn), and ultimately reducing costs for sustainable water electrolysis technologies.

Abstract Neither electrocatalytic activity nor structural stability is inconsequential in water electrolysis. Unfortunately, they have to be compromised in practice, especially in the anodic redox chemistry of lattice oxygen. Herein, the discovery of a La 1− x Ce x FeO 3 perovskite is presented which shows both good stability and high catalytic activity. Using advanced operando characterizations, it is identified that the self‐healing evolution of the La 1− x Ce x FeO 3 perovskite plays a key role during water oxidation in the lattice oxygen‐mediated mechanism (LOM) pathway. Unlike irreversible reconstruction, the formation of reconstructed active‐phase α ‐FeOOH is reversed by re‐crystallization of surface La 1− x Ce x FeO 3 upon return to noncatalytic conditions. The self‐healing transformation of the α ‐FeOOH termination layer on the stable La 1− x Ce x FeO 3 core imparts remarkable long‐term stability as well as excellent electrocatalytic performance. As a result, a composition La 0.9 Ce 0.1 FeO 3 @FeOOH is designed that exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 257 and 312 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm −2 , respectively. The findings provide insight into self‐healing behavior toward engineering perovskite oxides for efficient and stable oxygen electrocatalysis.

Abstract The practical capacity of lithium-oxygen batteries falls short of their ultra-high theoretical value. Unfortunately, the fundamental understanding and enhanced design remain lacking, as the issue is complicated by the coupling processes between Li 2 O 2 nucleation, growth, and multi-species transport. Herein, we redefine the relationship between the microscale Li 2 O 2 behaviors and the macroscopic electrochemical performance, emphasizing the importance of the inherent modulating ability of Li + ions through a synergy of visualization techniques and cross-scale quantification. We find that Li 2 O 2 particle distributed against the oxygen gradient signifies a compatibility match for the nucleation and transport kinetics, thus enabling the output of the electrode’s maximum capacity and providing a basis for evaluating operating protocols for future applications. In this case, a 150% capacity enhancement is further achieved through the development of a universalizing methodology. This work opens the door for the rules and control of energy conversion in metal-air batteries, greatly accelerating their path to commercialization.

Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high‐value product with less energy consumption. Two‐dimensional conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (2D c‐MOFs), comprising square‐planar metal‐coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c‐MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm‐2, significantly reducing the overall water‐electrolysis‐voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4>CoO4>Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non‐noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high‐performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.

Green hydrogen production can be achieved through electrolysis of fresh water or the use of renewable energy to electrolyze seawater. However, due to the low activity and poor stability of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater faces significant challenges. Herein, The catalyst F‐CoFe(OH)‐CO3/NF with three‐dimensional nanosphere structure was prepared, The introduction of CO32‐ into the intermediate layer of CoFe Hydroxide improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and the doping of F‐ is to design three‐dimensional layered nanostructures, increase the active site, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte. By in situ Raman analysis, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen‐related intermediates. In 1M KOH, it requires overpotentials of 210 mV and 251mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm‐2, respectively. And it remained stable at the current density of 100 mA cm‐2 for 120 h in 1M KOH. F‐CoFe(OH)‐CO3/NF can also catalyzes the decomposition of electrolytic seawater. Compared with hydroxide, anion‐doped carbonate hydroxide is more efficient and stable in electrolyte solution, which is of great importance for the development of a new stable electrocatalyst for water decomposition.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key electrochemical redox reaction involved in metal–air batteries and water-splitting devices. Reducing the energy barrier of these reactions accentuates the necessity in designing competent electrocatalysts. There is an urgent demand for affordable and durable catalysts utilizing non-noble metals, specifically Ni, Co, and Fe, for the OER. In this context, three following cobalt(II) coordination frameworks based on a pyridyl carboxylic acid ligand were synthesized: [Co3(μ3-OH)(PCA)4(DMF)2(H2O)](NO3)·DMF·3H2O (1), [Co3(μ3-OH)(PCA)4(EtOH)3](NO3)·3EtOH·3H2O (2), and [Co3(μ3-OH)(PCA)4(DMA)2(H2O)] (ClO4)·DMA·H2O) (3) using a solvothermal method. The single-crystal diffraction studies confirm the similarity in the three-center cobalt secondary building unit (SBU) and the final 3D topology. These frameworks are investigated as potential catalysts for the OER under alkaline (1 M KOH) conditions. Compound 1 shows extraordinary OER activity demonstrating an overpotential value of 0.37 V at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 78.9 mV. The alternation in the coordination sphere resulting from the difference in coordinated solvent emerges as an intriguing reason contributing to the exceptional activity of a coordination network. The effective electronic modulation within the cobalt trinuclear center induced by the changes in the coordination sphere has lowered the free energy barrier for the desorption of the oxygen produced. This work emphasizes the significant influence and effect of the coordination environment in catalytic activity, serving as a template for designing advanced electrocatalysts that are free from noble metals.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with single- and odd-numbered layers is a novel piezocatalyst, and its piezocatalytic molecular oxygen activation is considered a promising and low-cost strategy for environmental remediation. In this study, the odd-numbered layers of Co-doped MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets were successfully fabricated, which decomposed tetracycline by 99.8% in 15 min through shaking vibration. Moreover, to verify the enhanced piezoelectric catalytic activity of MoS2 via the doping effect, molecular oxygen activation properties were predicted through DFT calculation and monitored by generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) evolution. In addition, the primary reactive species responsible for the degradation of tetracycline pollutants were also investigated in detail.

Electrochemical advanced oxidation process represents a promising strategy for water decontamination, but the parasitic anodic side oxygen evolution reaction always causes a low energy utilization efficiency. In this study, we address this limitation of developing an electrocatalytic oxygen self-sufficiency system. This system established an integrated electrocatalytic process that ran solely on O2 produced by anodic oxygen evolution, followed by transformation of O2 into H2O2 at the nanoconfined Fe2O3 cathode, which then led to the generation of 1O2. The performance of water decontamination was evaluated using tetracycline (TC), bisphenol A (BPA), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as model emerging contaminants. When anodic polarization was applied at 2.0 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode, the removal of TC, BPA, and PFOA with a flow rate of 10 mL min–1 could reach 90.1%, 92.1%, and 62.2%, respectively. Electron spin resonance and radical quenching results indicated 1O2 as the main reactive oxygen species for TC and BPA decomposition, whereas PFOA decomposition was contributed by direct electron transfer. The intermediate toxicity was predicted to be reduced, and the excellent anti-interference ability of this system was proved in actual water. These findings suggest a reagent-free and oxygen-dependent sustainable system for water decontamination.

In green hydrogen production via water electrolysis, catalysts with multiscale nanostructures synthesized by compositing micro-heterojunctions and nanoporous structures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Moreover, they are the most promising non-noble metal catalysts. Herein, FeNi-based aerogels with a three-dimensional nanoporous structure and amorphous matrix embedded with FeNi3 nanoclusters were synthesized via wet chemical reduction coprecipitation. The FeNi3 nanoclusters and the FeNi-based amorphous matrix formed a crystalline–amorphous heterojunction. These aerogels exhibited excellent OER performance and electrocatalytic stability in alkaline electrolytes. In 1 mol/L of KOH electrolyte, the as-synthesized aerogel exhibited an overpotential of 262 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of only 46 mV dec−1. It also demonstrated excellent stability during a 12 h chronopotentiometry test.

In this work, we have investigated the effect of oxygen vacancies on the surface composition, electronic structure and OER performance of LaNiO3. The results show that the OER performance of LaNiO3 can be improved both by lowering the oxygen partial pressure during film growth or annealing the thin film in H2 atmosphere. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) shows a significant increase in La ratio on the LaNiO3 surface after the introduction of oxygen defects, especially after H2 treatment where Ni/La reaches 3.5:1. The presence of oxygen vacancies leads to the aggregation of Ni on the surface of LaNiO3, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the OER performance of LaNiO3. In addition, the OER activity of both LaNiO3 and oxygen vacancy rich LaNiO3 decreases upon cyclic voltammetry (CV) between +1.0 V and +1.5 V vs. RHE with proceeding cycle numbers. XPS results reveal that the CV treatments lead to the decrease of Ni concentration at the LaNiO3 surface, which is an important factor for the decrease in the OER performance of LaNiO3 as well as oxygen vacancy rich LaNiO3.

Abstract Insufficient bifunctional activity of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major obstruction to the application of rechargeable metal–air batteries. The primary reason is the mutual constraint of ORR and OER mechanism, involving the same oxygen‐containing intermediates and demonstrating the scaling limitations of the adsorption energies. Herein, it is reported a high‐valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide (Ir SA ‐MnO x ) bifunctional catalyst showing independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e − pathway on high‐valence Ir site for ORR and a novel chemical‐activated concerted mechanism for OER, where a distinct spontaneous chemical activation process triggers direct O ─ O coupling. The Ir SA ‐MnO x therefore delivers outstanding bifunctional activities with remarkably low potential difference (0.635 V) between OER potential at 10 mA cm −2 and ORR half‐wave potential in alkaline solution. This work breaks the scaling limitations and provides a new avenue to design efficient and multifunctional electrocatalysts.

Abstract The use of efficient and affordable non‐precious metal catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions is vital for replacing and widely implementing new energy sources. Nevertheless, improving the catalytic performance of these non‐precious‐metal bifunctional electrocatalysts continues to be a major challenge. In this article, an optimized Se‐incorporated bulk CoS 2 @MoS 2 heterostructure grown on the surface of carbon nanotubes is reported. The resulting Se‐CoS 2 @MoS 2 /CNTs exhibit robust bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, with low overpotentials of 85 and 240 mV @ 10 mA·cm −2 for HER and OER, respectively. The materials exhibit superior long‐term stability of over 145 h, surpassing most electrocatalysts of similar type. This enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect at the interface between the MoS 2 and CoS 2 phases, abundant active sites, and high active surface area, which collectively improves the electron‐transfer efficiency during the reaction process. Furthermore, the incorporation of the amorphous state of Se into the heterostructure yields a change in the crystallinity of the heterostructure in the electronic structure, which optimizes the adsorption and activation energy barriers of the catalytic intermediate. This study thus presents a promising approach to regulating anion doping in bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Abstract Water electrolyzer is crucial for producing clean hydrogen, but the traditional approach faces challenges owing to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) slow kinetics at the anode. Hybrid water splitting replaces the OER with the oxidation of an organic molecule to enhance hydrogen production along with value‐added products. The scarcity of affordable and highly effective catalysts remains a major challenge. MXene, a 2D nanomaterial, has gained substantial attention for its enviable properties, for instance high conductivity, hydrophilicity, and substantial surface area. This review discusses experimental methods for synthesizing MXene and MXene‐based nanocomposites. Furthermore, the small molecules oxidation such as benzyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, urea, hydrazine, furfural, and formic acid as alternatives to the oxygen evolution reaction is examined. Finally, an understanding of imminent research and the development of MXene‐associated materials in electrocatalytic applications are presented.

The preparation of durable and efficient photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation is of great importance in promoting the development of green hydrogen production and artificial photosynthesis. Here, n-type BiVO4 was combined with p-type CuI to construct a CuI/BiVO4 (CIB-1) p–n heterojunction photoanode. The composite photoanode effectively overcame the drawbacks of BiVO4, such as low separation and injection efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. As a result, the CIB-1 had the highest photocurrent density of 1.98 mA cm–2, which was 2.5 times higher than pure BiVO4 with 0.79 mA cm–2 at 1.23 V (vs RHE) under AM 1.5G light irradiation. The CIB-1 had a lower Tafel slope of 23.2 mV decade–1 compared to 47.9 mV decade–1 for BiVO4, so the water oxidation kinetics was remarkably advanced over CuI/BiVO4. Based on DFT calculations, the OER overpotential of 0.480 V for CuI/BiVO4 was significantly lower than that of 1.546 V for BiVO4 due to the lower free energy from OH– to oxygen over CuI/BiVO4 compared to BiVO4.

The development of multifunctional electrocatalysts with high performance for electrocatalyzing urea oxidation-assisted water splitting is of great significance for energy-saving hydrogen production. In this work, we demonstrate a novel heteroatom engineering strategy for development of B-doped Co as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that a B dopant can efficiently adjust the electron reconstruction of the exposure of Co sites nearby and facilitate electron transfer, resulting in an optimal d-band center along with a lower Gibbs free energy barrier. Ultimately, the obtained B–Co exhibits pH-universal HER properties in various electrolytes. A highly efficient HER performance with overpotentials as low as 27, 163, and 430 mV to −10, −100, and −500 mA cm–2 in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, is observed for the B–Co electrode. More importantly, the UOR-assisted electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 1.55 V to produce the current densities of 50 mA cm–2, resulting in a 200 mV saving-energy potential compared to water electrolysis, demonstrating its high efficiency of hydrogen production in industrial applications.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in water electrolysis and renewable energy conversion processes. Descriptors are utilized to elucidate the structure‐performance relationships of OER catalytic materials, yet each descriptor exhibits specificity to particular systems. Currently, there is a lack of effective descriptors to describe the relationship between electronic structure and OER performance in ionic systems. This study reveals for the first time that widely used OER descriptors, the d‐band center and charge transfer energy, are limited in their effectiveness for oxide systems dominated by ionic bonds, in which ionic interactions significantly enhance or suppress the catalytic activity. Furthermore, composite descriptors tailored for ionic systems are proposed, with findings extended to complex multi‐component and high‐entropy oxides. The results indicate that the metal d‐band unoccupied states parameter and the active states parameter can serve as effective OER descriptors for ionic catalytic materials. This work addresses the gap in OER descriptors for ionic systems, offering a new theoretical foundation and guidance for the development of efficient OER catalytic materials.

The catalytic performance of oxalate-based Ni–Fe metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated via a coordination strategy. The bidentate chelating ligand 2,2′-bpy (2,2′-bipyridine), was utilized to improve the catalytic kinetics under ambient conditions. The results revealed that a MOF-to-MOF transformation including the formation of [M(2,2′-bpy)n]2/3+ (M = Ni/Fe, n = 1–3) could boost alkaline OER, giving an impressive ultralow overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in a 1 M KOH solution, surpassing the performance of control group activity of oxalate-based Ni–Fe MOF. However, excessive addition of the ligand had a negative effect, leading to decreased activity. Further investigation revealed the double role of 2,2′-bpy: Both promote and suppress catalytic reactions. The catalytic mechanism was then discussed, highlighting the potential of secondary ligands to effectively fine-tune the catalytic behavior of these materials.

It remains a grand challenge to develop electrocatalysts with simultaneously high activity, long durability, and low cost for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), originating from two competing reaction pathways and often trade-off performances. The adsorbed evolution mechanism (AEM) suffers from sluggish kinetics due to a linear scaling relationship, while the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) causes unstable structures due to lattice oxygen escape. We propose a MoZnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) incorporating AEM-promoter Mo and LOM-active Zn to achieve dual activation and stabilization for efficient and durable OER. Density functional theory and chemical probe experiments confirmed dual-mechanism activation, with representative Co-Co † -Mo sites facilitating AEM and Zn-O † -Ni sites enhancing LOM, resulting in an ultralow OER overpotential (η 10 = 221 mV). The multielement interaction, high-entropy structure, and carbon network notably enhance structural stability for durable catalysis (>1500 hours at 100 mA cm −2 ). Our work offers a viable approach to concurrently enhance OER activity and stability by designing HEA catalysts to enable dual-mechanism synergy.

The advancement of highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for advancing sustainable hydrogen energy technologies. In this study, we synthesized a novel medium-entropy metal nitride (MEMN), FeCoNiZnN, with an antiperovskite structure through a solid-phase reaction method. FeCoNiZnN displays ferromagnetism above 350 K and demonstrates exceptional OER performance with a specific activity 141 times greater than that of Co3ZnN, with an overpotential of only 301 mV at 10 mA cm–2, comparable to that of commercial RuO2 catalysts, and exhibits superior durability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced catalytic performance is due to optimized electronic properties and improved d-band centers, which enhance the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and reduce the free energy barriers at the rate-determining step. This study highlights the potential of MEMNs in developing advanced magnetic materials and novel electrocatalysts.

The development of efficient electrocatalysts in water electrolysis is essential to decrease the high overpotentials especially at the anode where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place. However, establishing catalyst design rules to find optimal electrocatalysts is a substantial challenge. Complex oxides, which are often considered as suitable OER catalysts, can exhibit vastly different conductivity values, making it challenging to separate intrinsic catalytic activities from internal transport limitations. Here, we systematically decouple the limitations arising from electrical bulk resistivity, contact resistances to the catalyst support, and intrinsic OER catalytic properties using a systematic epitaxial thin film model catalyst approach. We investigate the influence of the resistivity of the three perovskite oxides LaNiO3-δ (3.7x10-4 Ωcm), La0.67Sr0.33MnO3-δ (2.7x10-3 Ωcm) and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ, (0.57 Ωcm) on the observed catalytic activity. We tune the electron pathway through the catalyst bulk by comparing insulating and conductive substrates. The conducting substrate reduces the electron pathway through the catalyst bulk from millimeter to nanometer length scale. As we show, for the large electron pathways, the observed catalytic activity scales with the resistivity because of a highly inhomogeneous lateral current density distribution. At the same time, even on the conducting substrate (Nb-doped SrTiO3), large contact resistances occur that limit the determination of intrinsic catalytic properties. By inserting interfacial dipole layers (in this case LaAlO3) we lifted these interface resistances, allowing us to reveal the intrinsic catalytic properties of all examined catalysts. We find that La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ and LaNiO3-δ exhibit a similar intrinsic overpotential of 0.36 V at 0.1 mA/cm2, while their resistivities differ by three orders of magnitude. This finding shows that optimizing the electron pathway of OER catalyst can lead the way to find new structure-activity relationships and to identify high-activity catalysts even if the electronic resistance is high.

NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) derived oxyhydroxides are promising electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, NiFe LDH with a stable metal-oxygen-metal (M-O-M) structure suffers from inadequate NiFe interaction, leading to undesirable activity and stability. Herein, we develop a NiFe hydroxide-organic framework (NiFe HOF) via modification of NiFe LDH with an organic linker to break the structural constraint of M-O-M and thus boost the OER. NiFe HOF with reconfigurable metal sites facilitates structural reengineering under the OER condition to form abundant NiFe interaction and prolonged M-O bonds, stimulating lattice oxygen mechanism. Therefore, NiFe HOF shows a distinctly decreased overpotential at 50 mA cm

The efficiency of electrochemical water splitting is constrained by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which suffers from high energy barriers, sluggish kinetics, and significant overpotential. Designing affordable and efficient electrocatalysts for the OER remains a key goal for advancing the hydrogen economy, with transitional metals like Co, Ni, and Cu gaining significant attention as promising alternatives due to their redox properties, abundance, and economy. The oxidation step of Mn+ → M(n+1)+ (M = Co, Ni, Cu) is the key intermediate step that produces the active species (M-OOH) formation, and thereby lowers the energy barrier and enhances the kinetics of the OER. However, the oxidation of Mn+ → M(n+1)+ creates charge-transfer orbitals near the Fermi energy level, which is fundamentally challenging. In this study, through structural and surface analyses, we demonstrate that the highly reducible CeO2 support in the Ce1–xMxO2−δ solid-solution effectively facilitates the Mn+ → M(n+1)+ oxidation process and the evolution of lattice oxygen during the OER. Among the three transition metals, the presence of the Ni3+ species along with the surface oxygen vacancy promoted the formation of -OOH surface intermediates and maximized the OER activity in Ce0.95Ni0.05O2−δ catalyst.

The application of seawater splitting is crucial for hydrogen production; therefore, efficient electrocatalysts are necessary to prevent chlorine evolution and severe corrosion. A synergistic method is employed on CoFe LDH by integrating a conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene layer and subsequently applying anionic modulation. Robust metal-substrate interaction along with subsequent phosphidation facilitates efficient electron transfer and optimises the electronic structure of Co and Fe sites. The CoFe-P-1000@Ti3C2Tx/CC demonstrates commendable electrochemical performance, requiring overpotentials of 106.6 mV and 276 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm-2 in 1M KOH electrolyte, while 292 mV is necessary for OER in a simulated seawater electrolyte (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl). Furthermore, the CoFe-P-1000@Ti3C2Tx/CC exhibits an encouraging cell voltage of 1.59 V (j = 10 mA cm-2) for comprehensive alkaline seawater splitting, maintaining exceptional stability for over 50 hours.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is widely recognized as a bottleneck in the kinetics and activity of decomposition water. Unique geometric design and compositional regulation are important technologies for achieving significant activity and excellent kinetics, but they continue to face obstacles in reaction thermodynamics and kinetic response. Here, a "needle mushroom" shaped Cu2O-NiCo2O4 heterostructure with abundant active sites and optimized conductivity that is grown on the Nickel-foam (NF) (labeled as Cu2O-NiCo2O4/NF-2) is prepared using advanced magnetron sputtering strategies for electrochemical water oxidation. Based on the excellent geometric advantages and efficient charge transfer capabilities, the catalyst of Cu2O-NiCo2O4/NF-2 shows superior electrocatalytic activity (low overpotential) and kinetics (low electrochemical impedance) compared with nanoneedle shaped Cu2O-NiCo2O4/NF-1 and NiCo2O4/NF for OER in alkaline medium. This work demonstrates a practical and economical strategy toward the fabrication of ternary transition metal oxides for water oxidation.

Abstract The synthesis of hydrogen via water electrolysis is an important step towards resolving the energy crisis and impeding global warming, as hydrogen can be used as a green energy carrier. The oxygen evolution as one half‐cell reaction (OER) is currently limiting efficient water splitting due to kinetic inhibition as well as a complex mechanism, causing a large overpotential. Nickel‐iron layered double hydroxides (LDH) were found to be suitable OER catalysts, as they are cost effective, stable and highly active. This work focuses on the intercalation of different organic and inorganic borates into the LDH interlayers to study their influence on OER. Besides activity and stability measurements, three borate candidates were chosen for a kinetic study, including steady‐state Tafel analysis and reaction order plots. It was found that the Bockris pathway with the second step as rate‐determining step was predominant for all three catalysts. Of all candidates, the intercalation of borate resulted in the highest performance, which was associated with a high reducibility affecting the active metal sites.

With the increasing global emphasis on green energy and sustainable development goals, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually becoming a crucial focus in research on water oxidation for hydrogen generation. However, its complicated reaction processes associated with its high energy barrier severely limit the efficiency of energy conversion. Recently, layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been considered as one of the most promising catalysts in alkaline media. Nonetheless, lacking a deep insight into the kinetic process of the electrocatalytic OER process is detrimental to the further optimization of LDH catalysts. Therefore, monitoring the catalytic reaction kinetic process via surface-sensitive in situ spectroscopy is especially important. In particular, the in situ Raman technique is capable of providing fingerprint information for surface species and intermediates in the operating environment. From the perspective of Raman spectroscopy, this paper provides an exhaustive overview of research progress in in situ Raman for the characterization of the catalytic mechanism of LDH catalysts, providing theoretical guidance for designing LDH materials. Finally, we present an incisive discussion on the challenges of the electrocatalytic in situ Raman technique and its future development trend.

For green hydrogen, the exploitation of advanced electrocatalysts is crucial, and transition metal phosphides have great potential in water splitting due to their abundant reserves and optimized electronic structure. Herein, a synergistic approach involving Mn doping and phosphorization is applied to CoFe‐layered double hydroxide nanoflowers to produce a series of bifunctional catalysts Mn‐doped CoFeP (Mn‐CoFeP). Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of Mn(10%)‐CoFeP both have notable improvement in 1 M KOH, with the overpotentials of only 160 and 239 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm −2 , respectively. Comparative electrocatalytic analysis indicates that moderate Mn doping mainly contributes to improve the OER performance, while the phosphorization significantly enhances the HER activity, resulting in effective bifunctional catalysis. For overall water decomposition, a total hydrolysis electrolysis cell equipped with the Mn(10%)‐CoFeP bifunctional catalyst requires only 1.64 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, it performs stable operation for 10 h at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 with a current maintenance rate of 83.6%. This work offers new insights into preparing effective bifunctional electrocatalysts, advancing clean energy development.

Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising technology for green hydrogen production, although its widespread development with state‐of‐the‐art loadings is threatened by the scarcity of iridium (Ir). Homogeneous dispersion of Ir in an immiscible electro‐ceramic matrix can enhance catalytic mass activity and structural stability. The study presents Ir y Sn 0.9(1− y ) Sb 0.1(1− y ) O x solid solutions produced by highly scalable flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) process as efficient anode electrocatalysts for PEMWE, containing only 0.2 mg cm −2 of Ir in the catalyst layer (CL). Intense mixing of metal vapor and large thermal gradients in the precursor‐derived high‐temperature flame aids stabilizing sub‐nanoscale entropic mixing within self‐preserved 4–6 nm particles. Detailed investigations confirm that the one‐step prepared solid solution electrocatalysts exhibit up to fourfold higher activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to Ir black. The anode of a PEMWE utilizing this catalyst exhibits high performance and stability over 2000 h but with tenfold lower Ir loading than the state‐of‐art.

Significant efforts have been devoted to investigating the oxidation of MXenes in various environments. However, the underlying mechanism of MXene oxidation and its dependence on the electrode potential remain poorly understood. Here we show the oxidation behavior of MXenes under the working conditions of electrochemical processes in terms of kinetics and thermodynamics by using constant-potential ab initio simulations. The theoretical results indicate that the potential effects can be attributed to the nucleophilic attack of water molecules on metal atoms, similar to that taking place in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction. Building upon these findings, we deduced the oxidation potential of the common MXenes, and proposed antioxidant strategies for MXene. Finally, we demonstrated that MBenes, the boron analogs of MXenes, may undergo a similar nucleophilic attack in water and inferred that molecule-induced Walden inversion is widely present in material reconstructions. This work contributes to a fundamental understanding MXene stability at the atomic level, and promotes the transition in materials discovery from trial-and-error synthesis to rational design. MXenes are two-dimensional materials with promising applications, but their oxidation mechanisms under electrochemical conditions are poorly understood. Here, the authors use theoretical simulations to investigate how the oxidation of MXenes is influenced by the electrode potential.

Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high‐value product with less energy consumption. Two‐dimensional conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (2D c‐MOFs), comprising square‐planar metal‐coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c‐MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm‐2, significantly reducing the overall water‐electrolysis‐voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4>CoO4>Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non‐noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high‐performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.

The sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) could offer an energy‐efficient and tech‐economically favorable alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for H2 production. Transition metal (TM) based catalysts have been considered promising candidates for SOR but suffer from limited activity due to the excessive bond strength from TM‐S2‐ d‐p orbit coupling. Herein, we propose a feasible strategy of screening direct d‐p orbit hybridization between TM and S2‐ by constructing the Turing structure composed of lamellar stacking carbon‐confined nickel nanosheets. The optimized p‐p orbit coupling between electron‐injected carbon and S2‐ enables exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy‐efficient yet value‐added H2 production. Specifically, it achieves a current density of 500 mA cm‐2 at an ultralow potential of 0.67 V vs. RHE for alkaline SOR. Theoretical calculations indicate that the electron transfer from Ni imparts metallicity and a higher p‐band center to carbon shells, thereby contributing to optimized p‐p orbit hybridization and a thermodynamically favorable stepwise sulfion degradation. Practically, a two‐electrode flow cell achieves an industrial current density of 1 Acm‐2 at an unprecedented low voltage of 0.91 V while maintaining stability for over 300 hours, and exhibits high productivities of 3.83 and 0.32 kgh‐1m‐2 for sulfur and H2, respectively.

The catalytic conversion of CO2 into value-added chemical building blocks is a crucial process towards a more sustainable society. The performance of the catalysts for this conversion process can be tracked using analytical methods, including spectroscopy and microscopy, which can aid towards a better understanding and optimization of these catalyst materials. The length scales of importance for a catalytic reaction vary over multiple orders of magnitude, where each length scale provides additional physicochemical insights into the functioning of the catalyst. Consequently, spectroscopy and microscopy methods need to be applied to this variety of length scales. In this PhD Thesis, we show the development and application of two spectroscopic methods to probe the local temperature and reaction intermediates, namely luminescence thermometry and Raman spectroscopy, at a spatial resolution of 1 µm2 and temporal resolution of seconds. The results described in the different chapters provide a methodological view on the application of these analytical methods and showcase spatially resolved information on the catalytic performance. We optimized the lanthanide-based luminescent thermometer to have optimal signal strength, resulting in low temperature uncertainties. The thermometer particles were used to study the temperature change in two processes: 1) the thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction and 2) the electrocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. We found significant temperature increase upon the introduction of the reactant gasses CO2 and H2 during process 1 due to exothermic reactions at the catalyst surface, as well as temperature variations as a function of current density and electrolyte composition in process 2. Furthermore, the reaction intermediates of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction were studied with plasmonic substrates, for which we provided more robust and homogeneous alternatives based on a combination of atomic layer deposition and lithography. Further progress can be made in the combination of the two analytical methods, as well as more efficient designs of operando reactor cells. This PhD Thesis can be used as a guideline for spatiotemporal spectroscopic studies during catalytic reactions to map out local effects such as temperature and reaction intermediates.

Abstract This paper reports an electrochemical approach that uses lignin as a resource for renewable and sustainable methanol production. The aromatic rings of lignin have methoxy substituents, which can be oxidatively demethylated to methanol by active oxygen produced at the anode. A graphite electrode fabricated in a sponge form provided sufficient reaction space for the lignin feedstock, efficiently generated active oxygen species from water, and considerably suppressed the overoxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide. As a result, the methanol yield reached approximately 70 % at a temperature of 75 °C, atmospheric pressure, and anode potential of +0.57 V. Another advantage of this technique is that hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred at the cathode and the cathode potential was held at approximately −0.5 V during the HER. Therefore, the cell voltage required for lignin electrolysis was 1.1 V or lower, which means that hydrogen as well as methanol was produced under mild conditions.

In recent years, the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) has made many advances in C2+ production. Cu+/Cu0 site is beneficial for C‐C coupling process, but the oxidation state of copper cannot be well maintained during the reaction process, resulting in a decrease in catalyst activity. Based on this consideration, in this work, transition metal oxide CeO2 with a hollow cube structure and oxygen vacancies was introduced to stabilize and increase Cu+/Cu0 active sites (Ce1Cu2). The catalyst exhibits excellent CO2RR performance, with FEC2+ achieving 73.52% and jC2+ > 280 mA/cm2 at 1.26 V (vs. RHE). Ethanol is the main C2+ product and FEethanol reaches 39% at 1.26 V. The experimental results indicate that the presence of CeO2 provides a large number of oxygen vacancies and forming Cu+‐O2‐‐Ce4+ structure by the strong interaction of CeO2 and Cu NPs. The structure of Cu+‐O2‐‐Ce4+ and abundant oxygen vacancies lay a good foundation for the CO2 adsorption. Moreover, it increases the content of Cu+/Cu0 sites, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction, promoting the C‐C coupling interaction, thereby facilitating the generation of C2+ products. The DFT theoretical calculation further demonstrates that Ce1Cu2 is more inclined towards the ethanol pathway, confirming its high selectivity for ethanol.

To investigate the porosity and expansion mechanism of CO-reduced magnetite, the reduced microstructures of magnetite under conventional heating and microwave heating were compared. The microstructure characteristics of magnetite with various reduction degrees were examined in a 60%CO-Ar reduction atmosphere, and the formation and evolution mechanism of the structure were analyzed in conjunction with the reduction effect. The results indicate that the reduction product of CO reduced magnetite possesses a porous structure. Nevertheless, when the gas diffusion is restricted, the reduction process is sluggish and the porous structure is not readily formed. Microwave heating enhances the gas-phase diffusion capacity, thermodynamic carburizing capacity, and solid-phase carbon-oxygen diffusion capacity, resulting in a higher oxygen loss rate than that of conventional heating. Under the experimental conditions, the lattice shrinkage during the Fe 3 O 4 → Fe 0.88 O transformation and the rapid expansion of Fe 0.88 O → Fe 0.94 O are the causes of the crack. Microwaves facilitate the formation of pores and cracks in the product. This study offers a novel concept for the development of foam steel.

The disproportionate expansion of telencephalic structures during human evolution involved tradeoffs that imposed greater connectivity and metabolic demands on midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Despite the central role of dopaminergic neurons in human-enriched disorders, molecular specializations associated with human-specific features and vulnerabilities of the dopaminergic system remain unexplored. Here, we establish a phylogeny-in-a-dish approach to examine gene regulatory evolution by differentiating pools of human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque pluripotent stem cells into ventral midbrain organoids capable of forming long-range projections, spontaneous activity, and dopamine release. We identify human-specific gene expression changes related to axonal transport of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species buffering and candidate cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression divergence. Our findings are consistent with a model of evolved neuroprotection in response to tradeoffs related to brain expansion and could contribute to the discovery of therapeutic targets and strategies for treating disorders involving the dopaminergic system.

The evolution of Jurassic carbonates is globally significant for understanding the depositional framework, diagenetic phases and sedimentary characteristics of shallow marine shelf deposits. For this purpose, two outcrop sections of the Jurassic carbonates with a road distance of 121 km in the Trans Indus Ranges, NW Himalayas, were included in this study. Geological fieldwork was conducted for sedimentological data, and representative samples were collected for microfacies analysis and diagenetic evolution complemented by carbon and oxygen isotope analysis. Results show that eight microfacies were identified in both sections where mudstone microfacies was only present in the Chichali section, whereas wackestone and packstone facies widely existed in both sections. The diagenetic evolution interpreted that dolomitization and stylolization were pronounced in the Paniala section, while micritization and calcite cementation were prevalent in the Chichali section. The interpreted depositional setting implies the wide range from supratidal to outer ramp shallow marine for the Chichali section, suggesting a wide range and relatively deeper environment, alongside merely intertidal to middle ramp settings for Paniala section. Diagenetic evolution suggests marine to meteoric influence in the Chichali section, while burial and uplift phases were dominant in the Paniala section. The diagenetic events were also validated by the isotopic analysis, where most of the samples with values up to −4‰ VPDB δ18O, corresponding to a carbon isotope range of up to +4‰, were interpreted as the burial phase of diagenesis; meanwhile, a few samples with −2 δ13C and −7‰ VPDB δ18O isotope signatures were marked as meteoric influx in the Paniala section. This study indicates the diversity of the depositional environment and diagenetic heterogeneity by integration of thin sections using isotope data, which are quite applicable to shallow marine carbonates.

Abstract Reconsideration of the stratigraphy of the Dharwars of Mysore State in the light of new data suggests that they are Paleoproterozoic and overlie Charnockites of Archean age. Classification of Dharwars based on tectonomagmatic and atmospheric evolution leads to a four fold divison. Pregeosynclinal shelf stage iS represented by two cycles of platformal sedimentation and magmatism; the earlier, under oxygen deficient conditions, on mafic platforms built by subaerial lavas, Is represented by Bababudan Series, and the latter under oxygenic conditions accompained by alkaline ultramafic intrusions gave rise to Dodguni Series. The geosynclinal Stage represented by pillow-Iava-greywacke-Iron ore deposition (third cycle of magmatism and sedimentation) constitutes the Grey trapRambennur Series. Early tectonic plagioclase granites-Champion gneisses syntectonic migmatites-Peninsular gneisses and late to post-tectonic alkali metasomatic granites Closepet granites (fourth, fifth and sixth magmatic cycles) developed during the folding and metamorphism of Dharwar geosynclinal pile. The inversion of geosyncline witnessed apogeosynclinal molasse red bed Sedimentation (fourth cycle of sedimentation) represented by G. R. Series. Paleoproterozoic epidiorites and post-Paleoproterozoic dolerites cratonised the area.

The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) of nickelates has potential similarities with cuprate superconductors, which may provide unique perspectives on the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most of high-pressure experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase. Therefore, the discovery of new superconducting nickelate compounds is highly desired to explore the generality of pressure-induced superconductivity in RP nickelates. Here, we grow high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure and conduct high-pressure transport measurements with various pressure transmitting mediums. The density wave in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal was suppressed by pressure, accompanying the arising of superconducting state beyond 10 GPa. The maximum and unsaturated Tc of 39 K is obtained within our research pressure. Although zero resistivity was not achieved in our experiments, the pressure and temperature-dependent diamagnetism along with the systematic evolution of resistivity with applied magnetic field, corroborate the superconductivity in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals. Our findings provide a new platform for the investigation of the relationship among structural evolution, magnetism, correlation, and superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.

DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine (5mC) is an ancient epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. The levels of total 5mC vary enormously between different species, and the DNA methyltransferases that introduce 5mC have been repeatedly lost in several independent lineages. DNA methyltransferases are a threat to genomic stability due to the increased mutagenicity of 5mC bases and the propensity of DNA methyltransferases themselves to introduce DNA alkylation damage as an off-target effect. However, whether alkylation damage explains why 5mC is frequently lost in evolution is unclear. Here we tested the fitness consequences of DNA methyltransferase-induced alkylation damage by introducing a eukaryotic-like 5mC system into E. coli . We showed that introducing 5mC genome-wide leads to increased sensitivity to alkylating agents, which is strongly enhanced by removal of the 3mC repair enzyme AlkB. Unexpectedly, we discovered that 5mC introduction led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. We showed that this is due to increased formation of reactive oxygen in the presence of 5mC. We determined that reactive oxygen species led to non-enzymatic oxidation of 5mC, producing modified cytosines such as 5fC that are recognised as DNA base damage in E. coli . Overall, our work identifies increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, as well as alkylating agents, as a negative consequence of genome-wide 5mC. Oxidative stress is frequently encountered by organisms in their environment, thus offering a plausible reason for total loss of 5mC in some species.

Life on Earth is more than 3.5 billion years old nearly as old as the age of the planet. Over this vast expanse of time, life and its biomolecules adapted to and triggered profound changes to the Earth s environment. Certain critical enzymes evolved early in the history of life and have persisted through planetary extremes. While sequence data is widely used to trace evolutionary trajectories, enzyme structure remains an underexplored resource for understanding how proteins evolve over long timescales. Here, we implement an integrated approach to study nitrogenase, an ancient, globally critical enzyme essential for nitrogen fixation. Despite the ecological diversity of its host microbes, nitrogenase has strict functional limitations, including extreme oxygen sensitivity, energy requirements and substrate availability. By combining phylogenetics, ancestral sequence reconstruction, protein crystallography and deep learning based structural prediction, we resurrected three billion years of nitrogenase structural history. We present the first effort to predict all extant and ancestral structures along the evolutionary tree of an enzyme and present a total of 5000 structures. Our approach lays the foundation for reconstructing key structural constraints that influence protein evolution and studying ancient enzyme evolution in the light of phylogenetic and environmental change.

Recent discoveries of gravitational wave sources have advanced our knowledge about the formation of compact object binaries. At present, many questions about the stellar origins of binary neutron stars remain open. In this work, we explore the evolution of binary neutron star progenitors with the population synthesis code COSMIC. We identify three dominant evolutionary tracks to form neutron star binaries that merge within the age of the Universe: a scenario that includes a common envelope phase between the first neutron star and its companion, a scenario with almost equal-mass progenitors that evolve quasi-simultaneously and feature a double-core common envelope, and a scenario involving the accretion-induced collapse of an oxygen-neon white dwarf into a neutron star. We show that the distribution of time delays between stellar formation and binary neutron star merger at a given progenitor metallicity does not follow a power law but instead features a complex structure that reflects the progenitor properties and the relative contribution of each evolutionary track. We also explore the evolution of the merger rate density with redshift, and we show that the scenario involving the accretion-induced collapse could be dominant at high redshifts. These results can have important implications for the study of the chemical enrichment of galaxies in r-process elements produced in kilonovae and of short gamma-ray burst offsets in their host galaxies.

14Cr-2W-0.3Ti-0.3Y2O3 Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) Ferritic Stainless Steels are promising candidates for structural components in future nuclear systems. Their outstanding properties are attributed to an ultrafine microstructure and a very stable dispersion of Y-Ti-O oxide nanoparticles (NPs).The STARS Route® developed to produce ODS alloys avoids the need for mechanical alloying to dissolve the oxide-former elements in the matrix and relies on Ceit’s capability to introduce them during gas atomization as oversaturated solid solution. Warm rolling after HIPing introduces a high density of dislocations, preferential nucleation sites. Final annealing heat treatment precipitates the NPs through an internal oxidation process: the metastable oxides formed at the surface of powder particles after atomization dissociate, and oxygen, Ti and Y diffuse towards the dislocations, where they precipitate as Y-Ti-O nano-oxides.This work shows the microstructural evolution of ODS steels obtained with the STARS Route®, and the role of process parameters on mechanical properties.

Abstract Circumstellar material (CSM) produced by mass loss from massive stars (≳10 M ⊙ ) through strong stellar winds or binary stripping provides rich information for understanding progenitors of core-collapse supernova remnants. In this paper we present a grating spectroscopy of a Galactic SNR G292.0+1.8, which is claimed to be a Type Ib/c remnant in a binary system according to recent studies. If G292.0+1.8 had experienced a strong mass-loss via binary interactions before its explosion, an oxygen-rich material produced in the He-burning layer is expected to be observed in the central belt-like structure formed by shock-heated CSM. Using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard XMM-Newton, we detect N vii Ly α line (0.50 keV) for the first time in G292.0+1.8 and find that the abundance ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is significantly lower (N/O = 0.5 ± 0.1) than the solar value. This low N/O suggests that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong mass-loss and ended up as a Wolf–Rayet star exposing the He-burning layer at the presupernova. Comparing our result and the evolution models of single stars and binaries, we conclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong enough mass-loss to occur a Type Ib/c supernova. Our finding is another crucial piece of evidence for a stripped-envelope supernova such as Type Ib/c as the origin of G292.0+1.8.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) correspond to the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (C-O WD) star in a binary system, triggered by the accretion of material from another star, or the merger/collision with a secondary WD. Their phenomenal luminosity -- several billion times that of the sun -- has motivated their use as cosmological distance indicators and led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. SNe Ia are also the main producers of iron and hence play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. While recent observations have confirmed the basic theoretical picture of an exploding C-O WD star whose luminosity is powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, a number of uncertainties remain concerning the nature of the binary companion and the explosion mechanism. Several lines of evidence point towards the existence of multiple progenitor channels in order to explain the full range of the observed diversity. A complete physical understanding of these energetic stellar explosions remains a long-lasting goal of modern astrophysics.

Currently, oxidation of SiCf/SiC composites in harsh environments such as high temperatures has become a key challenge for their application in high-temperature structural wave-absorbing materials. In this study, borosilicate glass (BSZ) coatings were prepared using the thermal nitrogen–oxygen process. The evolution of mechanical and coating microwave dielectric properties of the composites with and without BSZ coatings after oxidation at 1100 °C, 1200 °C, 1300 °C and 1400 °C was investigated. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the BSZ-coated SiCf/SiC specimens remains virtually unchanged, with a remarkable strength retention rate of 94%. The exceptional oxidation resistance of these coatings can be attributed to the formation of self-healing oxides and the reinforcing “pinning” effect of ZrSiO4. With an increase in oxidation temperature, the dielectric properties of the oxidized coatings are determined by the intrinsic properties of the generators and the porosity. Overall, these features highlight the potential of borosilicate coatings in the field of electromagnetic wave-absorbing composites, and the current work establishes a correlation between the oxidized microscopic properties of the coatings and the dielectric properties.

Through first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we investigate the crystal and electronic structures of twisted bilayer BaTiO 3 . Our findings reveal that large stacking fault energy leads to a chiral in-plane vortex pattern that was recently observed in experiments. We also found nonzero out-of-plane local dipole moments, indicating that the strong interlayer interaction might offer a promising strategy to stabilize ferroelectric order in the two-dimensional limit. The vortex pattern in the twisted BaTiO 3 bilayer supports localized electronic states with quasi-flat bands, associated with the interlayer hybridization of oxygen p z orbitals. We found that the associated bandwidth reaches a minimum at ∼19 ∘ twisting, configuring the largest magic angle in moiré systems reported so far. Further, the moiré vortex pattern bears a notable resemblance to two interpenetrating Lieb lattices and the corresponding tight-binding model provides a comprehensive description of the evolution the moiré bands with twist angle and reveals the topological nature.

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

Electrochemical processes of electrolysis of solutions belong to heterogeneous processes, their most intensive development and flow occurs at the interface, namely at the contact line between the metal electrode and the liquid electrolyte. The paper describes an algorithm for solving the objective of calculating hydrogen evolution during electrolysis of alkaline electrolyte in one-dimensional approximation. This numerical algorithm makes it possible to predict the hydrogen yield, to find the rates of constants in electrode processes, as well as we calculate the concentrations of substances involved in electrode processes and their spatial distribution. The algorithm consists of two blocks. The first block is an independent objective to find rate constants of processes. Kinetic objectives make it possible to find rate constants of near-electrode processes and to estimate contributions of near-electrode processes. The second block is the solution of initial-boundary and boundary value objectives in the “one-dimensional” approximation. The difference schemes for solving these objectives are constructed by the integrointerpolation method on a uniform grid, and an explicit difference scheme is used for solving the initial-boundary objectives of the charged particle balance. Calculation of the amount of separated gas showed good convergence both at the cathode (hydrogen) and at the anode (oxygen). The calculation of the spatial ones showed characteristic gradients, i.e., rather qualitative convergence.

In recent years, research has gradually uncovered the mechanisms of animal adaptation to hypoxic conditions in different altitude environments, particularly at the genomic level. However, past genomic studies on high-altitude adaptation have often not delved deeply into the differences between varying altitude levels. This study conducted whole-genome sequencing on 60 Tibetan sheep (Medium Altitude Group (MA): 20 Tao sheep (TS) at 2887 m, High Altitude Group (HA): 20 OuLa sheep (OL) at 3501 m, and Ultra-High Altitude Group (UA): 20 AWang sheep (AW) at 4643 m) from different regions of the Tibetan Plateau in China to assess their responses under varying conditions. Population genetic structure analysis revealed that the three groups are genetically independent, but the TS and OL groups have experienced gene flow with other northern Chinese sheep due to geographical factors. Selection signal analysis identified FGF10, MMP14, SLC25A51, NDUFB8, ALAS1, PRMT1, PRMT5, and HIF1AN as genes associated with ultra-high-altitude hypoxia adaptation, while HMOX2, SEMA4G, SLC16A2, SLC22A17, and BCL2L2 were linked to high-altitude hypoxia adaptation. Functional analysis showed that ultra-high-altitude adaptation genes tend to influence physiological mechanisms directly affecting oxygen uptake, such as lung development, angiogenesis, and red blood cell formation. In contrast, high-altitude adaptation genes are more inclined to regulate mitochondrial DNA replication, iron homeostasis, and calcium signaling pathways to maintain cellular function. Additionally, the functions of shared genes further support the adaptive capacity of Tibetan sheep across a broad geographic range, indicating that these genes offer significant selective advantages in coping with oxygen scarcity. In summary, this study not only reveals the genetic basis of Tibetan sheep adaptation to different altitudinal conditions but also highlights the differences in gene regulation between ultra-high- and high-altitude adaptations. These findings offer new insights into the adaptive evolution of animals in extreme environments and provide a reference for exploring adaptation mechanisms in other species under hypoxic conditions.

Crystalline Ga2O3 is a desirable candidate for high-performance solar-blind photodetectors (SBPDs) owing to its intrinsic merits, such as an ultrawide bandgap (∼4.9 eV) and high chemical stability. However, Ga2O3-based SBPDs fabricated using conventional methods often suffer from high crystallization temperatures exceeding 750 °C. Herein, we propose a zinc-induced low-temperature dual-crystallization method for facile fabrication of high-performance n-ZnO/n-β-Ga2O3 heterostructures by annealing a sputtered Zn/a-Ga2O3 bilayer (5 nm/15 nm) at 500 °C in air. The structural evolution and crystallization mechanism of n–n heterojunctions were explored using cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Benefiting synergistically from the significantly reduced oxygen vacancies as well as the high mobility of the n-ZnO derived from zinc oxidation, the back-gated phototransistors based on this heterojunction exhibited outstanding and balanced optoelectronic performance, with an ultrahigh responsivity of 7.4 × 104 A/W, an ultrafast rise time of 8.0 ms, a photo-to-dark current ratio of 2.4 × 107, and a detectivity of 2.8 × 1015 Jones. This study presents a novel approach for low-cost fabrication of high-quality ZnO/Ga2O3 heterojunctions, revealing a promising pathway for achieving high-performance heterojunction optoelectronic devices.

Abstract Although the deep oceans represent Earth's largest habitat, the challenges of studying deep‐sea organisms in situ have limited our understanding of adaptation, ecology, and behaviour in these important ecosystems. One fundamental trait of fishes that remains largely unexplored in the deep ocean is swimming, a vital process for movement, migration, and dispersal in marine habitats. Deep‐sea conditions such as temperature, pressure, and food availability could each impact the speed and efficiency of swimming in fishes. To investigate swimming kinematics of fishes with increasing depth, we analysed in situ video of bony fishes across a 6000‐m depth gradient. We compared open‐source videos of fishes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ocean Exploration with tank‐based recordings of shallow‐water relatives from Puget Sound, Washington, USA to understand how both habitat depth and phylogeny influence swimming in fishes. We analysed kinematics in four dominant demersal fish groups, the orders Anguilliformes, Gadiformes, Ophidiiformes, and Perciformes. Deep‐sea fishes swam consistently slowly. Swimming kinematics varied across temperature, oxygen, body elongation, and depth. These results suggest that swimming kinematics do not change linearly with increasing habitat depth in fishes and that the impacts of deep‐sea conditions such as low temperatures, high pressures, and low nutrient availability on swimming behaviour need to be considered independently of one another. These findings provide insight into the evolution of fish form and function in the deep ocean.

Iron isotope ratios in magnetite have been widely used to reveal critical geological and biological processes. Laser ablation multi‐collector inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS) is ideally suited for measurement of Fe isotope ratios, however the lack of suitable reference materials poses a significant challenge for in situ Fe isotopic measurements in magnetites. In this study, five high‐quality natural magnetite crystals were characterised for Fe isotope ratios using solution nebulisation (SN)‐MC‐ICP‐MS and LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS. The effects of LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS analytical conditions were investigated to obtain precise and accurate Fe isotope ratios. The yielded intermediate measurement precisions for the δ 56 Fe values in the five investigated magnetites were ± 0.05–0.06‰ (2 s ) using SN‐MC‐ICP‐MS and ± 0.08–0.14‰ (2 s ) using LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS. Magnetites with homogeneous Fe isotopic compositions in hand‐specimen measurements and microanalysis can serve as potential reference materials for in situ Fe isotopic measurement. Furthermore, the Fe isotope ratios in the magnetites from the Jinchuan Ni‐Cu‐PGE sulfide deposit were measured using LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS with natural magnetite as the bracketing calibrator. The increase in the Fe isotopic composition with magmatic sulfide evolution was primarily dominated by oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) and hydrothermal fluids. This finding implies that the Fe isotopic composition of magnetite can serve as a potential geochemical indicator of magmatic Ni‐Cu sulfide mineralisation.

The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), Arabian Sea (AS), and Bay of Bengal (BoB) are recognized for hosting the most intense oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), characterized by severe hypoxia at intermediate depths (Gilly et al., 2013; McCreary et al., 2013). The formation of these OMZs is attributed to a complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical processes, many of which exhibit commonalities across all three basins. Enhanced primary productivity in surface waters fosters organic matter export to deeper layers. This organic matter undergoes intensified decomposition at intermediate depths, leading to oxygen depletion through microbial respiration (Breitburg et al., 2018; Gilly et al., 2013; Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; Pennington et al., 2006). Furthermore, sluggish circulation patterns within these basins limit the advection of oxygen-rich waters into the OMZ, and weak vertical mixing restricts oxygen replenishment from the surface (Breitburg et al., 2018; Gilly et al., 2013; Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; McCreary et al., 2013).The Bay of Bengal oxygen minimum zone (BoB-OMZ) deviates from the typical pattern observed in the ETP and AS despite sharing common drivers for OMZ formation (Gilly et al., 2013; McCreary et al., 2013). This disparity underscores the significant influence of regional factors on the BoB-OMZ's characteristics. A key distinction lies in the primary mechanism responsible for its persistence. Microbial processes such as denitrification and anammox are crucial for oxygen consumption in the ETP and AS (Rao et al., 1994; Gilly et al., 2013; Kalvelage et al., 2013; Castro-González et al., 2014). In contrast, the BoB-OMZ primarily owes its existence to intense salinity stratification (Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; Sarma et al., 2018; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021). This stratification effectively traps oxygen-depleted waters, hindering vertical mixing and oxygen replenishment from the surface. Cyclonic eddies further influence the intensity and distribution of the BoB-OMZ (Sarma et al., 2018). Interestingly, anticyclonic eddies can sporadically ventilate the BoB-OMZ with oxygen-rich surface waters, leading to temporary weakening and spatial heterogeneity of the hypoxic zone (Sarma and Udaya Bhaskar, 2018). These contrasting mechanisms, absent in the ETP and AS, contribute to the BoB-OMZ's weaker overall intensity and dynamic nature.The intensity and extent of the BoB-OMZ exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations. In the northern BoB, influenced by major river discharge from the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, the summer monsoon and post-monsoon seasons see intensified salinity stratification, leading to a more pronounced OMZ (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Jana et al., 2015; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021; Sarma et al., 2016). This stratification traps oxygen-depleted waters, hindering vertical mixing and oxygen replenishment. Additionally, the cross-shelf transport of organic matter from the western BoB fuels microbial decomposition, resulting in a stronger OMZ compared to the eastern region (Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021). Recent studies suggest the possibility of even more intense OMZ formation in the northwestern BoB during winter (Bristow et al., 2017), potentially due to enhanced nutrient input from rivers or atmospheric deposition. However, Sridevi and Sarma (2021) propose that these intense episodes might be transient features caused by eddies. Biogeochemically, the BoB-OMZ is considered weaker compared to other regions. This can be attributed to factors such as weak upwelling, limited primary productivity, and rapid sinking of organic carbon to the deep sea, reducing the availability of organic matter for microbial oxygen consumption (Rao et al., 1994; Ittekkot et al., 1991; Naqvi et al., 1996; Ramaiah et al., 2010; McCreary et al., 2013). Furthermore, several studies suggest that riverine nutrients are rapidly consumed within a limited distance (20 km) from the coast, restricting their contribution to offshore OMZ intensification (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Sarma et al., 2018).The Godavari River, India's third-longest fluvial system (1,465 km), is driven by the monsoon cycle, resulting in concentrated discharge from July to September (Central Water Commission, 2019). This peak discharge coincides with the BoB's highest riverine input, contrasting with the dominance of tidal processes in other seasons (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Sarma et al., 2010). While the influence of major rivers such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra on the northern BoB-OMZ is well-established (Jana et al., 2015; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021), the annual impact of medium-sized rivers such as the Godavari remains less explored. This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the annual cycle of Godavari River discharge (GRD), its potential effects on local coastal primary productivity, and its contribution to the development of a seasonal OMZ near the river mouth. The following section outlines the methodology and details the datasets employed. Section 3 presents our findings on the seasonal evolution of the BoB- OMZ, the biogeochemistry in the river mouth region, and the potential mechanisms driving the intense OMZs observed near the Godavari. Finally, section 4 provides a comprehensive summary and concluding remarks. The GRD data utilized in this study were obtained from the Dowleiswaram barrage, located approximately 50 km upstream of the river's confluence with the BoB. This barrage serves as the final major infrastructure point along the Godavari's course, regulating the downstream flow of freshwater into the BoB. Daily measurements of water released from the Dowleiswaram barrage provided a high- resolution record of GRD variations. These daily values were subsequently aggregated to generate monthly mean time series data spanning 29 years (1990-2018). The use of Dowleiswaram barrage discharge as a proxy for total GRD into the BoB is justified due to several factors. First, the barrage captures the vast majority of the Godavari's freshwater input, as evidenced by minimal tributaries downstream. Second, the relatively short distance (50 km) between the barrage and the BoB minimizes potential losses through evaporation or tributary inputs. This time series data of mean monthly GRD serve as a key foundation for our investigation of the river's influence on coastal BoB dynamics. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the GRD data used in this study were not publicly available. The data was obtained from Superintending Engineer, Irrigation Circle, Dhavaleswaram, Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh (https://irrigationap.cgg.gov.in/wrd/home; scicbowlm@gmail.com).This study leverages Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-ARGO) data, a critical component of the Global Ocean Observing System (Notarstefano, 2020), to provide high-resolution in situ station observations in the vicinity of the Godavari River mouth. Within the extensive BGC-ARGO network, we identified two floats (2902264 and 2902193) strategically positioned within the plume of low-saline GRD. The precise locations of these floats are presented in Figure 1, along with their temporal and location information in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S1, S2. These two floats provided individual quality-controlled profiles of various oceanographic parameters. Float 2902193 completed 184 data cycles, with three profiles (cycles 49, 59, and 71) acquired within the vicinity of the GRD region through the fall to early winter (mid-September to December). Float 2902264 completed 268 cycles, with three profiles (cycles 41, 44, and 60) in the GRD region through the fall to the winter months (mid-October to January). Both floats were stationed outside the GRD region for the remaining data cycles. Consequently, only the three profiles acquired within the GRD region, as outlined above, were utilized for the analysis of dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and particle backscattering coefficient information at 700 nm (bb700) in this study. The DO measurements offer insights into potential oxygen depletion associated with enhanced organic matter decomposition driven by the GRD influx. Chl-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, acts as a marker of primary productivity potentially stimulated by nutrient enrichment from the river discharge. Finally, the particle backscattering coefficient serves as an indicator of the presence and type of suspended particles, including phytoplankton and non-living organic matter, which the GRD dynamics can influence. By scrutinizing these critical variables from the strategically located BGC-ARGO floats, we aim to provide robust observational evidence to confirm and refine our understanding of the Godavari River's impact on the biogeochemical dynamics of the coastal BoB region. We obtained BGC-ARGO data from https:// biogeochemical-argo.org/data-access.php. To gain further insights into potential spatial biogeochemical responses to the GRD, we also drew upon complementary datasets from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) (https://www.oceancolour.org/browser/index.php?product=chlor_ a&page=0.=monthly&version=1&limit=24&from=2002- 01-01&to=2016-01-01&mode=download#results). This fresh initiative provides a robust, merged Level 3 product for monthly mean Chl-a concentrations from 2002 to 2016. This valuable resource utilizes satellite observations from diverse sensors, including Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MERIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), seamlessly combined to offer a comprehensive and spatially extensive view of phytoplankton biomass across the global ocean (Sathyendranath et al., 2019). The 4 km spatial resolution of the OC-CCI Chl-a data strikes a balance between capturing local dynamics near the Godavari estuary and providing regional context for the observed patterns. To further elucidate the potential impact of GRD on primary productivity, we also leverage monthly mean net primary productivity (NPP) data obtained from the same OC-CCI website for the same timeframe (2002-2016) (https://www.oceancolour.org/browser/index.php?product=pp&page=0&limit=24&from=2002-01-01&to=2016-01- 01&mode=browse#results). NPP is estimated using the Ocean Production from the Absorption of Light (OPAL) model. This model builds upon the framework originally proposed by Marra et al. (2003). NPP is integrated over the euphotic zone and expressed in grams of carbon per square meter of sea surface (g C m-2). Four key satellite-derived inputs that are assimilated into OPAL are surface Chl- a concentration, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation reaching the ocean surface, and the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter. A detailed description of the NPP calculations is available in O'Reilly (2017). This dataset provides a valuable quantitative estimate of the rate at which organic matter is produced by Chl-a-rich phytoplankton biomass within the coastal BoB region. By analyzing the co-variation between Chl-a, and NPP, we aim to gain insights into the potential stimulation of primary productivity by nutrient enrichment associated with the GRD. The World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18) serves as a cornerstone resource for this study, providing a comprehensive set of objectively analyzed climatological fields for the world ocean (https:// www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/world-ocean-atlas-2018/). These fields, derived from in-situ measurements, encompass various oceanographic parameters at standard depth levels across different grid resolutions (5° × 5°, 1° × 1°, and 0.25° × 0.25°). Specifically, the data includes annual, seasonal, and monthly climatologies of temperature, salinity, DO, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate. The annual and seasonal climatologies extend to an impressive depth of 5,500 m, encompassing 102 distinct vertical levels. However, for monthly climatologies, the data extends only up to 1,500 m (57 vertical levels), still providing valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of near-surface ocean processes. Additionally, the chemical parameters (such as DO, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate) are available only on a 5° × 5° and a 1° × 1° horizontal resolution. This choice balances the need for a detailed spatial resolution within the coastal BoB region with the data availability and reliability constraints inherent in monthly climatologies. In this study, we used the monthly climatological salinity (Zweng et al., 2018) on a 0.25° × 0.25° grid, and dissolved oxygen (Garcia et al., 2019) at a 1° × 1° resolution. By leveraging this robust and authoritative dataset, we aim to gain valuable insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of dissolved oxygen and their potential association with the influence of GRD. The monthly mean horizontal and vertical current data (2000-2020) from the Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) developed by the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is used to elucidate the seasonal dynamics of coastal circulation and upwelling near the Godavari River mouth. This advanced reanalysis product (replacing Reanalysis 6) serves as the initial oceanic state for the NCEP's Climate Forecast System (Saha et al., 2006). The GODAS is forced by the momentum flux, heat flux, and freshwater flux. It utilizes a quasi-global configuration of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) MOM.v3 model, encompassing the critical coastal zone with high-resolution grids (1° x 1°, enhanced to 1/3° near the equator) and 40 vertical levels (10 m resolution in the upper 200 m). Leveraging these capabilities of the GODAS data (https:// www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/GODAS/), we estimated the divergence and upwelling of the GRD region. The divergence field represents the net flow of fluid into or out of a specific region and is calculated as the sum of the partial derivatives of the horizontal velocity components (u and v) with respect to x and y, respectively. Positive divergence leads to upwelling as surface water is drawn away, allowing deeper water to rise and replace it.The monthly distribution of the various physical and biogeochemical fields near the GRD region displays interesting signatures (Supplementary Figures S1–S4). Since a detailed analysis of each month will be too descriptive, we focus on January, April, July, and October to examine the evolution of various fields in the boreal seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. GRD exhibits a strong seasonality driven by the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) season. Monthly climatology (Figure 2A) reveals a peak discharge exceeding 4700 m3.s-1 in August, coinciding with peak SWM rainfall. Subsequently, GRD declines through September, October, and November, becoming negligible by December. Surface salinity distribution (Figure 2B) generally shows a freshening trend during fall due to the equatorward movement of the West India Coastal Current (WICC) transporting low-salinity waters from the northern BoB. Interestingly, GRD also contributes significantly to this freshening during the SWM season, causing a decrease in over 2 practical salinity units (psu) near the river mouth compared to the pre- monsoon values. From summer to winter, salinity becomes the dominant factor controlling near-surface density stratification. This stratification results in a shallow mixed layer and the formation of a thick barrier layer. The shallow mixed layer restricts the exchange of air-sea fluxes, while the barrier layer suppresses mass and energy exchange between the surface layers and the deeper ocean interior. In short, though the relative contribution of fresh water from GRD is negligible compared to other rivers (Sarma et al., 2016), it has the potential to impact the physical and biogeochemical state of the BoB, especially near the Godavari River mouth region. GRD profoundly amplifies spatiotemporal Chl-a dynamics in the BoB during the SWM season (Figure 2C). Pre-monsoon and winter months are characterized by Chl-a concentrations lingering well below 0.4 mg.m-3, indicative of quiescent phytoplankton growth. In stark contrast, the SWM season ushers in a vibrant pulse of primary productivity, propelling Chl-a to peak values exceeding 2.2 mg.m-3 within a significantly expanded spatial footprint encompassing regions up to 83°E around the river mouth (Figure 2C). This pronounced Chl-a bloom intricately mirrors the fluctuations in GRD, diminishing in intensity as the monsoon recedes. The riverine influx of nutrients orchestrates this dramatic seasonal spectacle, directly fueling phytoplankton proliferation and consequently boosting regional NPP, as depicted in Figure 2D. NPP exhibits a gradual ascent from April that culminates at the onset of SWM, and surges beyond 1000 mgC.m-2 by July. However, with the waning of the monsoon and subsequent decline in GRD, NPP undergoes a steep drop, leaving the river mouth region with markedly reduced productivity by October. Thus, the annual peak in GRD serves as a potent force, not only inducing vertical stratification but also transforming the BoB into a highly productive ecosystem during the SWM season. The thriving phytoplankton blooms fueled by enhanced nutrients from the Godavari River are projected to contribute to a significant suspension of organic matter in subsurface BoB waters. To gain insights into this process, we utilized particle backscatter data from two BGC-ARGO floats (2902264 and 2902193) deployed near the river mouth (Figure 1). These floats offered three individual profiles spanning the SWM to winter seasons, allowing us to analyze the organic matter dynamics across contrasting productivity regimes. Details of the data acquisition and processing are provided in Table 1. The BGC-ARGO float 2902264 revealed a pronounced peak in particle backscatter (>0.002 m-1), coinciding with elevated Chl-a concentrations (>3.5 mg m-3) at depths between 30 and 50 m in October 2018 (Figures 1A, B). This peak, located at a depth of 40-50 m, suggests a substantial abundance of organic matter during peak productivity. By November, the intensity of the particle backscatter peak diminished to 0.00165 m-1 at 39 m, accompanied by a reduction in Chl-a to 1.5 mg.m-3 at 37 m. This decline implied a weakening of organic matter abundance as productivity decreased. Notably, while the extreme particle backscatter peaks were absent by January 2019, Chl-a exhibited a secondary peak at 48 m, albeit with a lower magnitude (<0.8 mg.m- 3). This suggests a potential decoupling between Chl-a and organic particle suspension during this period. Data from BGC-ARGO float 2902193 qualitatively support the observed patterns from float 2902264 (Figures 1C, D) in the upper 80 m of the water column. The highest values for both particle backscatter (>0.003 m-1) and Chl-a (>3.5 mg.m-3) were observed during November 2016 (late fall/early winter season) at depths between 25 and 40 m. The peak particle backscatter (>0.003 m-1) occurred at 38 m, while the peak Chl-a (>3.5 mg.m-3) was slightly shallower at 28 m. These elevated values suggest an enhanced production and possible export of organic matter during the fall, following the peak productivity of the SWM. However, the September 2016 data showed lower particle backscatter (<0.0028 m-1) and significantly reduced Chl-a (<1.9 mg.m-3), indicating weaker organic matter suspension preceding the fall peak. Interestingly, while December 2016 exhibited the highest particle backscatter value (>0.0032 m-1) between 85 and 95 m, Chl-a concentrations remained very low (<1 mg.m-3) at depths between 30 and 80 m. This discrepancy suggests a potential decoupling between particle export and phytoplankton biomass at deeper depths during this period. Thus, our analysis of the BGC-ARGO data from both floats indicates a seasonal pattern of enhanced Chl-a inducing an elevated particle backscatter underneath it, along with increased organic matter abundance near the Godavari River mouth region, particularly at depths between 25 and 55 m during the fall season. Furthermore, this abundance appears to be linked to elevated Chl-a and NPP during the preceding SWM season.Hence, GRD significantly impacts the river mouth region during the SWM season through a multifaceted interplay of stratification, primary productivity, and organic matter abundance. The pronounced stratification resulting from a shallow mixed layer and a thick barrier layer generated by GRD restricts vertical mixing, potentially minimizing DO transport from the surface to subsurface layers. Simultaneously, the riverine influx of nutrients fuels phytoplankton growth, leading to enhanced Chl-a concentrations and culminating in elevated NPP. This primary productivity surge drives organic matter export into subsurface layers, potentially capable of influencing DO distribution through microbial decomposition processes. In conclusion, the combined effects of altered stratification, intensified primary productivity at the surface, and organic matter sinking into subsurface layers during the post-SWM season are likely to significantly modify the DO distribution (both horizontal and vertical) near the Godavari River mouth region. The region near the Godavari River mouth lies within the BoB- OMZ, a persistent feature characterized by year-round hypoxic conditions at intermediate depths (200-1,000 m). This section focuses on the potential impact of enhanced organic matter sinking during the SWM and early fall seasons on the distribution of DO and the dynamics (intensity and upper limit) of the BoB-OMZ in the Godavari River mouth region. Analysis of DO profiles from BGC-ARGO floats near the Godavari River mouth reveals the presence of an OMZ (DO within 0-0.5 ml.l-1) between 50 to 800 m (average depth levels), with a dynamic response to seasonal changes in organic matter input (Figure 3). Both floats exhibit a shoaling and intensification of the OMZ during the fall season, indicating a potential influence of riverine flow on DO consumption. At float 2902264, the upper limit of the OMZ deepened from 40-45 m in October 2018 (DO ~ 0 ml.l-1) to 50m in November (DO ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) and to 100 m by January 2019 (DO ~0.5 ml.l-1) (Figure 3A). This pattern suggests a gradual deepening of the OMZ as surface productivity declined and oxygen consumption in subsurface layers for microbial respiration reduced. Float 2902193 exhibited a similar trend, with the upper OMZ boundary at 35-40 m in November 2016 (following the SWM with a DO of ~ 0 ml.l-1), which was as deep as 75 m in September (pre-SWM with a DO of ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) and further down to 105 m in December (with a DO of ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) (Figure 3B). These observations collectively suggest a significant shoaling and intensification of the OMZ near the Godavari River mouth during the fall season. Thus, the enhanced Chl-a and particle backscatter (between 25 and 55 m depth) during the fall season driven by GRD (Figure 1) coincides with shoaling and intensification of the OMZ near the Godavari River mouth. This provides strong evidence for the potential impact of high organic matter sinking on the dynamics of the BoB-OMZ. The limited availability of BGC-ARGO observations in the GRD region restricts our ability to investigate the seasonal evolution of DO. Therefore, we turn to the objectively analyzed WOA18 DO data, despite its coastal data gap. WOA18 offers sufficient coverage (>80% data availability) for a 63-year period (1955-2017), enabling seasonal analysis of various ocean fields. Figures 4A–D display the vertical distribution of DO (surface to 500 m) in the BoB near GRD (16.8°N) during different seasons, derived from WOA18. High DO concentrations (>4-5 ml.l-1) characterize the basin's surface layers (~0-80 m) year-round. Below this, the OMZ prevails, with its upper boundary primarily residing between 80-200 m, exhibiting seasonal and spatial variations. Winter and spring months reveal similar spatial patterns of the OMZ (Figures 4A, B), with its upper limit confined between 80-110 m depth. A pronounced OMZ (DO < 0.3 ml.l-1) persists below 500 m throughout these seasons. Summer (July) exhibits distinct spatial patterns from the previous two seasons (Figure 4C). Except for a narrow depth range (200-250 m, 92.5-93.5°E), DO levels below the mixed layer generally remain above 0.2 ml.l-1. Additionally, the OMZ upper boundary in the western basin deepens to 110-130 m. The fall season witnesses the most profound OMZ expansion and intensification near the western basin, where the Godavari River discharges (Figure 4D). DO levels below 0.1 ml.l-1 appear between 60-175 m in this region, a stark contrast to summer values of 1-1.5 ml.l-1 (Figure 4C). The shoaling and intensification of the OMZ at subsurface depths (40-200 m) near the Godavari River mouth, evident in the BGC- ARGO and WOA18 data during fall, necessitates further investigation. To validate this localized phenomenon, we delved deeper into the seasonal evolution of DO within this critical depth range (40-200 m) in the western BoB (Figures 4E–H). Winter reveals a clear influx of highly oxygenated water from the southern BoB (Figure 4E), aided by the prevailing ocean current system (Figure 2B). This influx maintains sufficient DO (>1 ml.l-1) in the western BoB throughout winter and spring (Figures 4E, F). Even in summer (July) (Figure 4G), subsurface DO (averaged over 40-200 m) near the Godavari River mouth remains moderate, exceeding 1.2 ml.l-1. However, a dramatic shift occurs in the fall (October) as the region transforms into an oxygen-depleted zone (<0.5 ml.l-1) (Figure 4H). This stark contrast highlights the dynamic seasonal cycle of subsurface DO in the western BoB. While oxygenated waters prevail near the Godavari delta basin during winter, spring, and summer, a localized and intense OMZ establishes itself near the river mouth during fall. Thus, coinciding with the retreat of the SWM season, the confluence of increased organic matter input from the Godavari River and enhanced stratification likely contributes to the generation of an intense and shallow subsurface OMZ (40-200 m) near the river mouth. The genesis and dynamics of the pronounced subsurface OMZ observed near the GRD region after the retreat of the SWM season are likely influenced by a complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical factors. In this section, we focus on analyzing other processes such as surface ocean circulation and divergence in the western BoB near the GRD region (Figure 5) using GODAS data, recognizing their crucial role in upwelling and associated biogeochemical processes influencing OMZ dynamics. The surface circulation in the western BoB exhibits distinct seasonal patterns near the Godavari River mouth, playing a crucial role in regional upwelling and potentially influencing the observed OMZ dynamics. The pre-Southwest Monsoon and SWM seasons are characterized by strong northward coastal currents and an eastward current across the BoB, as shown in Figures 5B, C, respectively. Additionally, during the SWM season, south-westerly winds induce positive divergence along the western BoB coast, favoring coastal upwelling (Figure 5C). Following the retreat of the SWM season, the strong monsoon currents subside, and southward- moving coastal currents dominate the western BoB (Figure 5D). This shift creates favorable conditions for upwelling near the GRD region and northwards, indicated by positive surface divergence (Figure 5D). Winter (January) sees a further weakening of the southward current, and positive divergence persists near the GRD region, suggesting continued upwelling potential (Figure 5A). Thus the oceanic region near the GRD experiences favorable conditions for upwelling throughout the SWM, fall, and late winter periods due to the combined influence of surface currents and divergence. This sustained upwelling could potentially contribute to the observed surge in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), NPP, and the subsequent intensification and vertical expansion (shoaling) of the OMZ observed after the retreat of the SWM season. To provide insights into the interplay between GRD and upwelling in shaping dissolved DO and OMZ dynamics in the BoB, we selected two geographically distinct study regions. Box A (82-84°E, 15.5-17°N) lies directly at the Godavari River mouth, maximizing its exposure to GRD influence and benefiting from favorable upwelling conditions during the SWM season. In contrast, Box B (84-86°E, 17-18.5°N), located slightly north, experiences minimized GRD influence while retaining similar upwelling conditions during the SWM season. This strategic selection allows for a comparative analysis, disentangling the individual and combined effects of GRD and upwelling on DO and OMZ dynamics. Figure 6 represents the seasonal evolution of vertical velocity (GODAS data), and those of Chl-a (OC-CCI data), NPP (OC-CCI), and depth-averaged (40-200 m) dissolved oxygen (WOA18 data) in these two selected oceanic regions. The analysis unfolds similar qualitative patterns for vertical velocity (upwelling) in both boxes. In both the oceanic regions, upwelling increases with the emergence of the SWM season and starts declining with its withdrawal. In comparison, Box A records higher values for upwelling than Box B (Figure 6A). The highest upwelling was recorded in July in both boxes, 0.72×10-5 m.s-1 in Box A and 0.58×10-5 m.s-1 in Box B. The increase in upwelling during the SWM season clearly reflects the seasonal evolution of Chl-a in Box A, whereas Box B shows a slight decreasing trend from June to July, although it maintained an overall increasing trend during the SWM season (Figure 6B). Both the regions reflected mild Chl-a values during rest of the year. In comparison, Chl-a blooms in Box A (0.8-0.9 mg.m-3) were almost twice as intense as Box B (0.4-0.5 mg.m-3) during the SWM season. NPP also showed a similar seasonal signature (Figure 6C). Both boxes highlighted an increasing trend in NPP during the SWM season and showed similar patterns during the rest of the year. Similar to the Chl-a distribution, Box A recorded very high (> 1100 mgC.m-3) NPP distribution compared to Box B (< 850 mgC.m-3) during the SWM season. The rise in Chl- a and NPP during the SWM season significantly impacted seasonal DO fluctuations in both study regions (Figure 6D). While DO exhibited a mildly increasing trend in both boxes during late winter and pre-monsoon, it displayed a substantial decline with the onset of the SWM season. In Box A, DO plummeted from 3 ml.l-1 in May to a critical low of 0.1 ml.l-1 in October (fall), representing a drastic decrease of 2.9 ml.l-1. In contrast, Box B experienced a smaller decline, with DO decreasing from 2.2 ml.l-1 in June to an average of 0.55 ml.l-1 during fall (September-November), representing a decrease of 1.75 ml.l-1. In conclusion, it is evident that SWM- driven biogeochemical activity was significantly enhanced in Box A, directly influenced by GRD, leading to pronounced oxygen consumption during fall. This comparative analysis highlights the crucial role of GRD in shaping DO and OMZ dynamics in the BoB. This study delves into the profound biogeochemical impact of GRD in the BoB, with a particular focus on the region near the river mouth. Our key finding is the intriguing presence of an intense and shallow OMZ within the subsurface (40-200 m) depths near the Godavari River mouth during the post-monsoon season which has hardly been mentioned previously. Notably, this phenomenon differs from the conventional intermediate-depth BoB-OMZ prevalent in the basin (McCreary et al., 2013). The temporal evolution of this shallow OMZ was elucidated through data from two BGC-ARGO floats located close to the river discharge region. Their observations revealed a clear intensification and shoaling of the OMZ during fall. To unveil the spatial extent and context of this phenomenon, we leveraged the broader coverage of WOA18 data, facilitating comparisons with other crucial variables. Furthermore, to disentangle the relative influence of GRD and upwelling on OMZ dynamics, we conducted a comparative analysis in two geographically distinct locations. This comparative analysis proved the pivotal role of GRD in shaping the biogeochemical environment near the river mouth. Despite both regions experiencing similar upwelling patterns, the area directly influenced by GRD exhibited significantly higher Chl-a blooms, enhanced NPP during the SWM season, and a more pronounced oxygen consumption during fall. These observations strongly suggest that the extensive nutrient influx from GRD fuels increased primary productivity, leading to enhanced organic matter suspension and subsequent oxygen depletion in the subsurface layers, culminating in the observed intense and shallow OMZ. Our findings paint a compelling picture of the substantial influence of GRD on BoB biogeochemistry, particularly in the vicinity of the river mouth. Briefly, during the SWM season, the influx of nutrients from GRD, combined with enhanced coastal upwelling, creates favorable conditions for phytoplankton blooms. These blooms, peaking in August and September, are characterized by high Chl-a concentrations and lead to a surge in NPP. However, this elevated productivity comes with a subsequent cost. As the blooms senesce and decompose by fall, an elevation in suspended organic matter at the subsurface depths (40-200 m) develops. This organic matter fuels the activity of heterotrophic microbial communities, leading to intense oxygen consumption through respiration. This microbial respiration, coupled with the reduced atmospheric oxygen supply due to strong stratification, drives the shoaling and intensification of the OMZ off the Godavari River mouth. Understanding and quantifying these impacts are crucial for various reasons. First, alterations in GRD can directly affect primary productivity and food webs in the coastal zone. Second, changes in the OMZ's intensity can influence the release of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and N2O, potentially impacting global climate change. Finally, understanding the dynamic interplay between riverine inputs, upwelling, and biogeochemical processes is critical for predicting and managing the future state of the BoB ecosystem. In summary, although the discharge of the Godavari River is negligible compared to other rivers flowing into the BoB, GRD plays a pivotal role in shaping the biogeochemistry of the bay, with profound impacts on primary productivity, oxygen dynamics, and greenhouse gas emissions. Further research is needed to fully understand the intricate interactions between GRD, upwelling, and biogeochemical processes, and to predict the consequences of future alterations in riverine inputs on this vital ecosystem. It should, however, be noted that the interpretations derived from our analysis are subject to the limited temporal and spatial sample extent, which precludes us from any statistical significance test of the results. We are in the process of initiating a few high-resolution sensitivity experiments with the ocean model that will be 15-20 years long. The outputs will enable us to quantify the contributions of each parameter separately.

The article presents an analysis of the synergy of structural transformations of phyllosilicates subjected to high temperatures and microwave radiation in terms of the destruction and formation of crystal structures. Studying the synergy of transformations of crystal structures is essential for the development of new materials and technologies, because it helps to create materials with unique properties, which cannot be obtained when using the same factors separately. The material used in the study was a polymineral complex, which contained quartz, montmorillonite, kaolinite, chlorite, paragonite, and iron oxides (listed from the largest to the smallest mass fraction). The methods used in the study allowed us to assess the structural transformations. Averaged structural formulas of the studied phyllosilicates were calculated using the oxygen method combined with a recalculation method based on the results of a microprobe analysis. Differential thermal analysis demonstrated a synergistic effect of high temperature and microwave fields registered as a decrease inthe temperature gradient of the ceramics and initiation of the sintering process at lower temperatures and with greater intensity. All the treated samples contained the amorphous phase in significant concentrations: from 15 to 25 vol. %. Half of the three-layer phyllosilicates (chlorite and montmorillonite) were destroyed by the microwave field. Kaolinite and paragonite practically did not react to external factors. The synergistic effect was the most obvious in the structural transformations of silicon and iron oxides. Our experiments demonstrated for the first time the mechanism of formation of magnetite and hematite crystals from X-ray amorphous iron-containing films covering the particles of clay minerals. The use of the MW field and the resulting dehydration led to the formation of crystals of nuclei of iron oxides. The following high-temperature processes activated an increase in aggregated iron (magnetite and hematite). The X-ray diffraction analysis determined the presence of a synergistic effect in the evolution of structures, which could not be identified by means of IR-spectroscopy. The EPR spectroscopy allowed us to register the states of rare irregular cells with foreign paramagnetic atoms. The shift of the foreign Fe3+ from the geometric centers of octahedral crystal cells towards the minima of potential energy caused by the Jahn-Teller effect decreased the potential energy of the crystal lattice. At the same time, some chemical bonds forming the crystal cellbecame stronger, while others weakened

Abstract The mass–metallicity relation provides crucial insights into the baryon cycle in galaxies and strong constraints on galaxy formation models. We use JWST NIRSpec observations from the UNCOVER program to measure the gas-phase metallicity in a sample of eight galaxies during the epoch of reionization at z = 6–8. Thanks to the strong lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744, we are able to probe extremely low stellar masses between 10 6 and 10 8 M ⊙ . Using strong-line diagnostics and the most recent JWST calibrations, we derive extremely low oxygen abundances in the range of 12 + log(O/H) = 6.7–7.8. By combining this sample with more massive galaxies at similar redshifts, we derive a best-fit relation of 12 + log(O/H) =  −   0.076   − 0.03   + 0.03   ×   ( log (   M   ⋆   ) )   2   +   1.61   − 0.52   + 0.52    ×  log (   M   ⋆   ) −   0.26   − 0.10   + 0.10    , which becomes steeper than determinations at z ∼ 3–6 toward low-mass galaxies. Our results show a clear redshift evolution in the overall normalization of the relation, galaxies at higher redshift having significantly lower metallicities at a given mass. A comparison with theoretical models provides important constraints on which physical processes, such as metal mixing, star formation or feedback recipes, are important in reproducing the observations. Additionally, these galaxies exhibit star formation rates that are higher by a factor of a few to tens compared to extrapolated relations at similar redshifts or theoretical predictions of main-sequence galaxies, pointing to a recent burst of star formation. All these observations are indicative of the highly stochastic star formation and interstellar medium enrichment expected in these low-mass systems, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in high- z dwarf galaxies might be different from those in place at higher masses.
