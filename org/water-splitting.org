Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is central to energy conversion technologies, but the high cost and scarcity of commercial noble metal catalysts limit their widespread application. Natural products exhibit great potential in preparing high‐performance electrocatalysts due to their cost‐effectiveness and sustainability. Here, a kind of 1D polymers [M‐EA (M═Co, Cu, Ni)] for oxygen evolution reaction via the complexation of ellagic acid (EA) with metal ions are reported. It is found that Ni‐EA displays a low overpotential (190 mV at 10 mA cm −2 ) and an ultralow Tafel slope (28 mV dec −1 ), with a production cost of only 3.6 × 10 −2 % of IrO 2 . Density functional theory investigations reveal the electrocatalytic mechanism of the OER. A rechargeable Zn‐Air battery using Ni‐EA+Pt/C as the air electrode shows a lower charging potential and better cycling stability than the IrO 2 +Pt/C‐based battery. This work provides a train for the development of state‐of‐the‐art OER catalysts.

Abstract Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is identified as an ideal candidate for next‐generation energy storage systems in consideration of its high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfur resources. However, the shuttling behavior of soluble polysulfides (LiPSs) and their sluggish reaction kinetics severely limit the practical application of the current Li–S battery. In this work, a series of In 2 O 3 nanocubes with different oxygen vacancy concentrations are designed and prepared via a facile self‐template method. The introduced oxygen vacancy on In 2 O 3 can effectively rearrange the charge distribution and enhance sulfiphilic property. Moreover, the In 2 O 3 with high oxygen vacancy concentration (H‐In 2 O 3 ) can slightly slow down the solid–liquid conversion process and significantly accelerate the liquid–solid conversion process, thus reducing the accumulation of LiPSs in electrolyte and inhibiting the shuttle effect. Contributed by the unique selective catalytic capability, the prepared H‐In 2 O 3 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance when used as sulfur host. For instance, a high reversible capacity of 609 mAh g −1 is obtained with only 0.044% capacity decay per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. This work presents a typical example for designing advanced sulfur hosts, which is crucial for the commercialization of Li–S battery.

High‐efficiency and low‐cost catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical for electrochemical water splitting to generate hydrogen, which is a clean fuel for sustainable energy conversion and storage. Among the emerging OER catalysts, transition metal dichalcogenides have exhibited superior activity compared to commercial standards such as RuO2, but inferior stability due to uncontrolled restructuring with OER. In this study, we create bimetallic sulfide catalysts by adapting the atomic ratio of Ni and Co in CoxNi1‐xSy electrocatalysts to investigate the intricate restructuring processes. Surface‐sensitive X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and bulk‐sensitive X‐ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the favorable restructuring of transition metal sulfide material following OER processes. Our results indicate that a small amount of Ni substitution can reshape the Co local electronic structure, which regulates the restructuring process to optimize the balance between OER activity and stability. This work represents a significant advancement in the development of efficient and noble metal‐free OER electrocatalysts through a doping‐regulated restructuring approach.

Integrating anion-redox capacity with orthodox cation-redox capacity is deemed as a promising solution for high-energy-density battery cathodes surmounting the present technical bottlenecks. However, the evolution of oxidized oxygen species during the electrochemical or chemical process easily jeopardizes the reversibility of oxygen redox and remains poorly understood. Herein, we showcase the gradual conversion of the π-interacting oxygen (localized hole states on O) to the σ-interacting oxygen upon resting at a high voltage for P3-type Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 with nominally stable ribbon-like superstructure, accompanied by the O–O dimerization and the local structural reorganization. We further pinpoint an abnormal Li+ migration process from the alkali–metal layer to the transition-metal layer for desodiated P3–Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2, thereby leading to a partial reconstruction of the ribbon superstructure. The high-voltage plateau of oxygen-redox cathodes is concluded to be exclusively controlled by the oxygen stabilization mechanism rather than the superstructure ordering. In addition, there exists a kinetic competition between π and σ interaction during the uninterrupted electrochemical process.

Many highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) demonstrate strong pH-dependent catalytic activities. However, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is still a subject of debate. In this study, delithiated Li0.5CoO2 is utilized as a model catalyst due to its tunable chemical states and layered structure that can facilitate reversible intercalation and deintercalation of cations. By increasing the pH to 14 using a 1.0 M CsOH solution, rapid intercalation of Cs+ cations and water molecules induce notable lattice expansion up to 9.9 Å, resulting in an order of magnitude higher OER intrinsic activity comparing to that in 0.1 M CsOH. It is hypothesized that lattice water in layered structure facilitates the dynamic intercalation and deintercalation of Cs+ cations, promoting the so-called "electrochemical-chemical" reaction mechanism. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate nature of surface dynamics and the redox chemistry on the catalyst/electrolyte interface during the OER.

Abstract Seawater electrocatalysis holds significant promise as a technology for hydrogen production. A simple and low-cost impregnation-hydrothermal and thermal reduction strategy was used to synthesis in-situ constructed three-dimensional porous trimetallic (Pd, Fe, and Co) anchored on a cheap and high-conducting carbon paper (CP) electrode for water electrolysis in alkaline media. The fabricated PdFeCo1−xONPs@CP electrode had superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties, allowing for efficient removal of oxygen bubbles from the electrode surface due to the close interaction between the electrode and electrolyte. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of trimetallics and CP-fibers significantly increased OER intrinsic activity. PdFeCo1−xONPs@CP catalyst demonstrated critical low overpotentials of 220 and 300 mV, resulting in an extraordinarily high current density of 100 mA cm−2. For the full cell overall water splitting performance, cell overpotentials as low as 140 and 151 mV were needed to drive 10 mA cm-2 in seawater and alkaline solution electrolytes.

The sluggish reaction kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) remain obstacles to the commercial promotion of water splitting and direct methanol fuel cells. Considering the vital role of noble metals in electrocatalytic activity, this work focuses on the rational synthesis of Ni-noble metal composite nanocatalysts for overcoming the drawbacks of high cost and susceptible oxidized surfaces of noble metals. The inherent catalytic activity is improved by the altered electronic structure and effective active sites of the catalyst induced by the size effect of noble metal clusters. In particular, a series of Ni-noble metal nanocomposites are successfully synthesized by partially introducing noble metal into Ni with porous interfacial defects derived from Ni-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH). The Ni10Pd1 nanocomposite exhibits high OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 0.279 V at 10 mA/cm2, surpassing Ni10Ag1 and Ni10Au1 counterparts. Furthermore, the average diameter of Pd clusters gradually increases from 5.57 nm to 44.44 nm with the increased proportion of doped Pd, leading to the passivation of catalytic activity due to the exacerbated surface oxidation of Pd in the form of Pd2+. After optimization, Ni10Pd1 delivers significantly enhanced OER and MOR electroactivities and long-term stability compared to that of Ni2Pd1, Ni1Pd1 and Ni1Pd2, which is conducive to the effective utilization of Pd and alleviation of surface oxidation.

In a unified regenerative fuel cell (URFC) or reversible fuel cell, the oxygen bifunctional catalyst must switch reversibly between the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), fuel cell mode, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), electrolyzer mode. However, it is often unclear what effect alternating between ORR and OER has on the electrochemical behavior and physiochemical properties of the catalyst. Herein, operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is utilized to monitor the continuous and dynamic evolution of the Co, Mn, and Fe oxidation states of perovskite catalysts Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3‐δ (BSCF) and La 0.4 Sr 0.6 MnO 3‐δ (LSM), while the potential is oscillated between reducing and oxidizing potentials with cyclic voltammetry. The results reveal the importance of investigating bifunctional catalysts by alternating between fuel cell and electrolyzer operation and highlight the limitations and challenges of bifunctional catalysts. It is shown that the requirements for ORR and OER performance are divergent and that the oxidative potentials of OER are detrimental to ORR activity. These findings are used to give guidelines for future bifunctional catalyst design. Additionally, it is demonstrated how sunlight can be used to reactivate the ORR activity of LSM after rigorous cycling.

The quest for advanced energy storage solutions has intensified the focus on developing next-generation secondary batteries, with lithium-oxygen batteries (LOB) standing out for their superior theoretical gravimetric energy density. This study introduces a novel model-based approach to battery development, enabling the detailed analysis of charge–discharge cycles and oxygen evolution efficiency within a virtual environment. Our model distinctively simulates the oxidative decomposition of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) and differentiates between its formation through solution and surface pathways, addressing the complexities of the charging process and its multiple elementary steps. The developed model further categorizes the oxidative decomposition species into four distinct types, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of their interactions, voltage profile changes, and O2 evolution within the battery's porous cathode. This approach not only enhances the understanding of battery behavior but also aids in refining the design of component materials, thereby propelling forward the development of LOBs with improved energy density and cycle performance.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) plays a vital role in water electrolysis, but its slow kinetics and expensive catalysts are obstacles to widespread use. To improve the OER activity, it is crucial to create a well-structured design for electrocatalysts based on transition metals, which may be applied to a conducting polymer substrate. This research reports a facile hydrothermal synthesis and remarkable catalytic behavior of NbSe2/g-CN as an OER catalyst in an alkaline condition. The fabricated electrocatalysts were examined utilizing numerous analytical techniques to assess their crystallinity, oxidation states and morphology. NbSe2/g-CN shows enhanced electro-catalytic behavior to OER in alkaline solution (1.0 KOH) with minor overpotential (196 mV) and Tafel slop (38 mV/dec) than pristine NbSe2 electrocatalyst was associated with the exceptional conductivity of NF and its highly porous structure, along with a greater SSA. In addition, the durability of the electrocatalyst was examined via cyclic stability and chronoamperometry study over 40 h. This study demonstrates that TMSe with specific morphology can improve electrocatalytic activity when combined with g-CN, demonstrating its potential for reliable and eco-friendly energy generation

In order to address the main challenges in photocatalysis, such as the recombination of photo-generated carriers and the limited absorption range of light, a successful strategy was developed by creating a photothermal-photocatalytic S-scheme heterojunction through the combination of CdS nanoparticles with BiVO4 nanorods. XPS analysis, as well as SPV results, revealed the establishment, direction, and strength of the internal electric field (IEF) in the created CdS/BiVO4 heterojunction. Due to the matched band structure and the strong IEF, the heterojunction followed the S-scheme transfer mode under light, inducing the strong redox ability and fast separation of photo-generated carriers. Besides that, the heat generated by incorporating a photothermal-effect during illumination also helped to boost the photocatalytic reaction. As a result, the engineered CdS/BiVO4 heterojunction exhibited an impressive benzaldehyde production of 17.45 mmol g−1·h−1, approximately four times higher than that of pure BiVO4 (3.70 mmol g−1·h−1). Furthermore, the oxygen evolution rate of the CdS/BiVO4 heterojunction was 3146.68 µmol·g−1, much higher than that of BiVO4 (1042.98 µmol·g−1). This study introduces a novel approach to overcome the fundamental obstacles in semiconductor photocatalysis, paving the way for enhanced overall performance.

Compared with traditional water electrolysis, electrolysis of seawater has larger resources and a brighter future. However, seawater contains more elements that have greater corrosive effects on electrodes; especially chloride ions (seawater contains more chloride ions) have the greatest impact. The existence of the corrosion problem creates greater difficulties in electrolyzing seawater, further limiting the efficiency of the electrocatalyst for electrolysis of seawater. In this paper, we report a Mn-doped Ni2P/Cu3P as an environmentally friendly monofunctional electrode for seawater electrolysis, which was made by a simple hydrothermal phosphatization operation method. The experimental results show that Mn-doped Ni2P/Cu3P presents overpotential of only 161 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at iR compensation of 90 and a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It has a small Tafel slope (25.15 mV dec−1) and a large capacitance (9.58 mF cm−2 on 1 × 1 nickel foam), which exceeds most reported oxygen evolution activities of non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts for electrolysis of alkaline seawater. The performance of Ni2P/Cu3P was probably significantly enhanced due to Mn doping by some characterization means. Through Density functional theory (DFT) analysis, it is known that the doping of Mn gives a large enhancement in the adsorption energy of water when Ni2P/Cu3P is electrolyzed with seawater. This paper provides train of thought for the exploration of excellent electrocatalysts for electrolysis of alkaline seawater.

Iron hydroxide (FeOOH) is a potential active component in iron-based electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. However, its catalytic performance is constrained by its slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Herein, we synthesized a nanoflower-like FeCo-hydro(oxy)oxides composite with tunable Fe/Co ratios (Fex-Coy) on nickel foam (NF) via a one-step electrodeposition technique. This method allows for precise control over the morphology and composition of the hybrid nanoflowers. The optimized Fe9-Co1 discloses favorable OER performance with a low overpotential of 222 mV at 50 mA cm−2 and demonstrates good stability exceeding 60 h at 10 mA cm−2. Further, an assembled Fe9-Co1(+) || Pt/C(−) dual-electrode configuration achieves a low cell voltage of 1.73 V at the current density of 100 mA cm−2 for water splitting, with long-term stability for 70 h and minimal degradation. Studies indicate that the distinctive nanoflower morphology of Fe9-Co1 enhances active site exposure, while both FeOOH and reconstructed CoOOH serve as catalytic centers, contributing to the observed OER performance. This work introduces a facile approach for synthesizing OER electrocatalysts, underscoring the role of the high-valence state of Fe/Co as active sites in the OER process.

Due to the expensive cost of precious metals, there is an urgent need to develop cheap and efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a novel catalyst, high-entropy alloy (HEA) has found widespread application in the field of hydrogen production through water electrolysis. However, a significant portion of HEA catalysts prepared by traditional solvothermal methods are challenging due to their high cost, extended compound cycle, and relatively difficult electronic structure adjustment in the catalytic center. In this study, a heterostructure catalyst composed of MoC and FeCoNiMo HEA alloy (denoted as FeCoNiMo-M) was synthesized by the microwave method. Catalysts produced via the microwave method typically exhibit MoC encloses the spherical heterostructure of the internal high entropy alloy, MoC not only protects the true active center Ni-OOH, but even further regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst. Notably, the FeCoNiMo-M sample synthesized using microwave demonstrates an overpotential of merely 232 mV (@10 mA cm-2) in 1 M KOH, nearly 20 mV lower compared to the traditional hydrothermally-synthesized FeCoNiMo-H HEA catalyst. Furthermore, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst demonstrates impressive durability in OER with a significant current density of 100 mA cm-2 for a duration of 240 hours. The in-situ Raman results indicate that the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst undergoes the conversion of the actual reaction intermediate Ni-OOH and accelerates the OER with only a very low overpotential. These findings suggest that our approach could open up possibilities for the advancement of OER catalysts that are both more convenient and efficient.

The electrochemical splitting of seawater is promising but also challenging for sustainable hydrogen gas production. Herein, ZIF-67 nanosheets are grown on nickel foam and then etched by Ni2+ in situ to obtain a hierarchical hollow nanosheets structure, which demonstrates outstanding OER performance in alkaline seawater (355 mV at 100 mA cm−2). Diven by a silicon solar panel, an overall electrolysis energy efficiency of 62% is achieved at a high current of 100 mA cm−2 in seawater electrolytes. This work provides a new design route for improving the catalytic activity of metal organic framework materials.

The four-electron oxidation process of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) highly influences the performance of many green energy storage and conversion devices due to its sluggish kinetics. The fabrication of cost-effective OER electrocatalysts via a facile and green method is, hence, highly desirable. This review summarizes and discusses the recent progress in creating carbon-based materials for alkaline OER. The contents mainly focus on the design, fabrication, and application of carbon-based materials for alkaline OER, including metal-free carbon materials, carbon-based supported composites, and carbon-based material core–shell hybrids. The work presents references and suggestions for the rational design of highly efficient carbon-based OER materials.

Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e– oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy‐intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e– oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial‐level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50‒421 mA cm‒2 with 84‒100% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856‒7842 μmol cm‐2 h‐1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low‐current electrolysis. Finite‐element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e– oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.

The advancement of rechargeable zinc–air batteries (RZABs) faces challenges from the pronounced polarization and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Single-atom catalysts offer an effective solution, yet their insufficient or singular catalytic activity hinders their development. In this work, a dual single-atom catalyst, FeCo-SAs, was fabricated, featuring atomically dispersed N3–Fe–Co–N4 sites on N-doped graphene nanosheets for bifunctional activity. Introducing Co into Fe single-atoms and secondary pyrolysis altered Fe coordination with N, creating an asymmetric environment that promoted charge transfer and increased the density of states near the Fermi level. This catalyst achieved a narrow potential gap of 0.616 V, with a half-wave potential of 0.884 V for ORR (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a low OER overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm–2. Owing to the superior activity of FeCo-SAs, RZABs exhibited a peak power density of 203.36 mW cm–2 and an extended cycle life of over 550 h, exceeding the commercial Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, flexible RZABs with FeCo-SAs demonstrated the promising future of bimetallic pairs in wearable energy storage devices.

A new dinuclear Ni(II) complex 1, [Ni2II(dtbh-PLY)2], is synthesized from 9-(2-(3,6-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazineyl)-1H-phenalen-1-one, dtbh-PLYH2 ligand, and structurally characterized by various analytical tools including the single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) technique. In the solid state, both Ni(II) metal centers in complex 1 exist in a distorted square planar geometry and display the presence of rare Ni···H–C anagostic interactions to form a one-dimensional (1-D) linear motif in the supramolecular array. Complex 1 is further stabilized in the solid state by π–π-stacking interactions between the highly delocalized phenalenyl rings. The redox features of complex 1 have been analyzed by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique in solution as well as in the solid state, revealing the crucial involvement of both the Ni(II) metal centers for undergoing quasi-reversible oxidation reactions on the application of an anodic sweep. A complex 1-modified glassy carbon electrode, GC-1, is employed as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH, giving an OER onset at 1.45 V, and very low OER overpotential, 300 mV vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to reach 10 mA cm–2 current density. Furthermore, GC-1 displayed fast OER kinetics with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec–1, a significantly lower Tafel slope value than those of previously reported molecular Ni(II) catalysts. In situ electrochemical experiments and postoperational UV–vis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed to analyze the stability of the molecular nature of complex 1 and to gain reasonable insights into the true OER catalyst.

Efficient and cost-effective catalysts are essential to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in sustainable hydrogen production through water splitting. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy aimed at constructing heterogeneous structure that form abundant Fe2O3/NiSe2 interfaces on the FeOOH surface. The resulting catalyst exhibits extraordinary performance with an excellently low overpotential of 169 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Notably, this catalyst also demonstrates impressive long-term stability in alkaline seawater. Compared to traditional heterogeneous catalysts with core-shell structures, Fe2O3/NiSe2 possesses a closely heterogeneous interface, which plays a role in modulating the interface electron. Supported by complementary spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, it has been further demonstrated that the distinctive Fe-O-Ni-Se structure can effectively modulate the electronic state of Ni, thereby enhancing the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates and facilitating oxygen desorption. Overall, this research presents a promising avenue for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance by amplifying active sites at interfaces.

Recently, perovskite oxides have acquired a rapidly growing research interest in energy storage and conversion systems, especially the electrolysis of water. Rational doping is an extremely effective strategy to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) of the perovskite oxides. Herein, a series of novel bi-functional electrocatalysts were synthesized by doping Ru in SrFeO3-δ perovskite oxide (SrFe1-xRuxO3-δ, x = 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45) which exhibit remarkable enhancements of HER/OER activities and long-term stabilities in the alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH). Among them, SrFe0.7Ru0.3O3-δ (SFR30) shows the best electrocatalytic activities for overall water splitting, exhibiting low overpotentials for HER (∼41 mV) and OER (∼334 mV) at −10 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively, generating current densities of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolytic cell using the potential of 1.58 V. In addition, the SFR30 electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable stability which can be operated continuously for 96 h without significant delay. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Ru doping can effectively modulate the adsorption of intermediates on the active sites to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance. Many new prospects have been opened for the development of bi-functional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

Exact structure or mechanistic pathways charge transfer inside of OEC is still subject to research. Many inorganic complexes have been synthesised which show structural or functional resemblance with OEC. Theses complexes helps us in understanding election transfer mechanisms operating in different steps of the oxygen -evolving complex.

The anode of a proton exchange membrane (PEM)−based electrolyzer presently necessitates the utilization of iridium oxide (IrO2) as an anodic catalyst, which is exceedingly costly and scarce on Earth. Ruthenium oxide (RuO2) has garnered significant attention due to its superior catalytic activity and lower cost compared to IrO2. However, the relatively inadequate stability of RuO2 impedes its practical application. The deterioration of RuO2 is presently ascribed to the dissolution of Ru sites. Through systematic investigations encompassing distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis, leaching measurements, structural characterizations, and designed experiments, we verify that the deactivation of RuO2 is primarily attributed to the surface reconstruction of the catalyst to insert phase, rather than dissolution.

Abstract Hierarchical hollow urchin-like nickel cobaltite (NiCo 2 O 4 ) was synthesized using a two-step hydrothermal method. The effects of metal composition and surfactant addition on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated. The addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) reduced particle aggregation, resulting in a higher electrochemical active surface area and electrical conductivity. Lowering the Ni content from 1.0 to 0.25 did not alter the morphology and structure of the product to any extent. However, the crystallite size slightly increased. Among the spinels with different Ni and Co compositions, NiCo 2 O 4 exhibited a superior OER electrocatalytic activity, achieving a 380 mV overpotential at 10 mA/cm 2 current density. It also delivered a good performance in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) using 1 M NaOH at 60 °C, reaching a current density of about 420 mA/cm 2 at a cell voltage of 1.95 V.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as promising electrocatalysts have been widely studied, but their performance is limited by conductivity and coordinating saturation. This study proposes a cationic (V) modification strategy and evaluates its effect on the electrocatalytic performance of CoFe–MOF nanosheet arrays. The optimal V–CoFe–MOF/NF electrocatalyst exhibits excellent oxygen-evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) performance (231 mV at 100 mA cm–2/86 mV at 10 mA cm–2) in alkaline conditions, with its OER durability exceeding 400 h without evident degradation. Furthermore, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting, a small cell voltage is achieved (1.60 V at 10 mA cm–2). The practicability of the catalyst is further evaluated by membrane electrode assembly (MEA), showing outstanding activity (1.53 V at 10 mA cm–2) and long-term stability (at 300 mA cm–2). Moreover, our results reveal the apparent reconstruction properties of V–CoFe–MOF/NF in alkaline electrolytes, where the partially dissolved V promotes the formation of more active β-MOOH. The mechanism study shows the OER mechanism shifts to a lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) after V doping, which directly avoids complex multistep adsorption mechanism and reduces reaction energy. This study provides a cation mediated strategy for designing efficient electrocatalysts.

Herein we propose a Ba-site Gd doping protocol in layered perovskites, demonstrating highly active bifunctional PrBa1-xGdxCo2O5+δ electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from enhanced oxygen surface exchange and chemical diffusion kinetics, resultant PrBa0.95Gd0.05Co2O5+δ (PBG0.05CO) exhibits an area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.038 Ω cm2 at 700 oC, reduced by ∼46.5% relative to undoped PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBCO). When evaluated as the air electrode, the as-fabricated single coin fuel cell delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 1230 mW cm-2 at 700 oC. For the CO2-electrolysis at 750 oC, the large current density (J) of 2630 mA cm-2 is achieved in the PBG0.05CO anode-based electrolysis cell at a voltage (V) of 1.8 V. Furthermore, exceptional operating stability is realized in both ORR and OER manners. Our findings highlight an effective strategy to optimize the electrocatalytic properties of layered perovskites, endowing potential applications in energy storage and conversion aspects.

Deep insight into the synergy between anion and cation aids in the maximization of catalytic activity and the rational exploitation of efficient oxygen-evolving catalysts. However, how to use ion exchange reconstruction to devise highly active and cost-efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with anion and cation synergies for water electrolysis is rarely reported. Herein, the cobalt triphosphide (CoP3) nanowires are elaborately devised as a component-flexible precatalyst for directing an anodic reconfiguration with Ni cation exchange to construct a highly active and quasi‐amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) catalyst integrated with cation (Ni) substitution and oxyanion (PO43-) decoration (denoted by R-(Ni)CoP3). Interestingly, the structural evolution and the Ni cation exchange processes are captured through various in/ex situ techniques. The resultant R-(Ni)CoP3 nanowires display a splendid activity with low overpotentials of 406 and 420 mV to respectively deliver industrial grade current densities of 1000 and 1500 mA cm−2, and an outstanding stability over 300 h at a large current density of 500 mA cm−2, superior to most progressive cobalt-based OER materials and the benchmark IrO2. The combination of theoretical calculations with experimental studies demonstrate that the synergy of cation (Ni) substitution and oxyanion (PO43-) decoration can significantly modulate the electronic states of CoOOH and optimize the adsorption free energy of OER intermediates, thus immensely expediting the kinetics process and enhancing the charge transfer ability and the intrinsic OER activity. This research suggests ion-regulatory reconfiguration as a flexible and changeable strategy to construct various efficient and advanced catalysts for water electrolysis and beyond.

Transition metal oxides are considered alternative electrocatalysts for ZAB owing to their multiple oxidation states. However, they have limitations such as low electrical conductivity and the deficiency of reactive sites. In this study, to overcome these shortcomings and improve electrocatalytic activity, oxygen vacancies and porous architectures were introduced through a partial reduction process and a porous carbon framework. Open porous carbon microspheres with uniformly loaded NiCo2O4 nanosheets and oxygen vacancies (V-NCO/OPC) displayed enhanced electrocatalytic performance with a low Tafel slope (68 mV dec-1) in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential (402 mV) at 10 mA cm–2 in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The combined effect of the oxygen vacancies and porous architecture can offer sufficient active sites, modify the electronic structure of the metal oxide surface, and facilitate mass transport, enhancing the electrocatalytic properties of V-NCO/OPC. Furthermore, when applied for ZAB, V-NCO/OPC demonstrated better electrochemical performance including discharge power density (154.9 mW cm-2) at the current density of 175.9 mA cm-2, low voltage gap (0.85 V) at the initial cycle, and long-term (250 h) cycle stability at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 than those of noble-metal electrocatalysts.

Abstract Design of active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires in‐depth understanding of the electrocatalyst properties and interfacial structural dynamics during OER. One of the essential insights for advanced electrocatalyst design is vivid understanding of the drivers and mechanisms of dissolution of electrocatalysts. In this work we analyze some important aspects of electrocatalyst dissolution during OER, to deepen and advance our understanding of activity‐stability relations and relevant stability descriptors.

Molecular oxygen is a stable diradical. All O 2 ‐dependent enzymes employ a radical mechanism. Generated by cyanobacteria, O 2 started accumulating on Earth 2.4 billion years ago. Its evolutionary impact is traditionally sought in respiration and energy yield. We mapped 365 O 2 ‐dependent enzymatic reactions of prokaryotes to phylogenies for the corresponding 792 protein families. The main physiological adaptations imparted by O 2 ‐dependent enzymes were not energy conservation, but novel organic substrate oxidations and O 2 ‐dependent, hence O 2 ‐tolerant, alternative pathways for O 2 ‐inhibited reactions. Oxygen‐dependent enzymes evolved in ancestrally anaerobic pathways for essential cofactor biosynthesis including NAD + , pyridoxal, thiamine, ubiquinone, cobalamin, heme, and chlorophyll. These innovations allowed prokaryotes to synthesize essential cofactors in O 2 ‐containing environments, a prerequisite for the later emergence of aerobic respiratory chains.

Abstract In addressing the challenge of hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment (TME), a significant obstacle to effective cancer therapy, this research introduces a pioneering nanozyme engineered to utilize water and oxygen as reactants. Utilizing ultrasonic piezoelectricity, this nanozyme converts these substrates into oxygen (O 2 ) and reactive oxygen species, thereby amplifying oxidative stress without relying on endogenous H 2 O 2 . This approach involves the strategic engineering of porous ZnSnO v :Mn nanosheets (named MZSO NSs), which are distinguished by oxygen‐rich vacancies and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This breakthrough represents the initial attempt to merge catalytic activities akin to catalase (CAT) with the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), confirmed through both enzymatic reactions and electrochemical voltammetric analysis. The predominant mechanism of ultrasound‐augmented oxygen generation in MZSO is identified as piezoelectric hole‐induced OER. Supporting theoretical analyses clarify the synergistic impact of oxygen vacancies and Mn doping on the dynamics of carriers and the OER process, leading to a notable increase in catalytic efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of piezoelectric‐enhanced OER electrocatalysts to alleviate hypoxia in the TME, providing novel insights into the development of piezoelectric acoustic sensitizers for the treatment of cancer.

Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) catalysts with high catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity have been extensively studied, especially Fe and Co-based sulfides. Fe and Co active sites with a strong synergistic effect, which can adjust the electron density distribution and effectively improve the electrocatalytic OER activity. However, TMSs has poor stability in alkaline environment caused by metal ions and sulfur elements are facilitated to dissolve. In this work, TMSs was modified by polyaniline (PANI) to inhibit the precipitation of iron, cobalt, and sulfur elements and enhance its stability under alkaline conditions. Moreover, π-d structure can also be formed by the coating of polyaniline, which can further adjust its own electronic structure on the basis of stabilizing the TMSs structure, so as to improve the electrochemical performance, rendering them to stably operate at harsh environment for more than 90 h. These findings offer new guidance for improving the electrocatalytic stability of TMSs.

Improving the conductivity of the electrocatalyst itself is essential for enhancing its performance . In this work, N, S-rich 6-thioguanine (TG) is selected as the ligand to synthesize a Fe, Ni bimetallic porous coordination polymer (PCP), which is then derived to fabricate N,S codoped carbon (NSC)-coated (Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni3S2 bridged nanowires. The (Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni3S2@NSC bridged nanowires obtained through bimetallic synergistic catalysis and self-sulfurization processes not only introduced additional electrocatalytic active sites but also significantly enhance the overall conductivity of the catalyst due to the interconnected nanowire structure. The resulting (Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni3S2@NSC demonstrates remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, exhibiting an overpotential as low as 252 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This work proposes a novel strategy for enhancing the overall conductivity of catalysts by growing bridged nanowires, providing valuable insights and inspiration for the design and preparation of advanced transition metal sulfide electrocatalysts.

Several CoS2/Ni flow-through porous electrodes are fabricated to promote gas bubble release for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. Structural characterization shows that CoS2 catalyst is immobilized on the porous Ni substrate. The bubble average diameter can be decreased from 29.29 ± 17.9 μm to 13.51 ± 5.05 μm, and the desorption time is decreased from 1.615 s to 0.067 s, with the electrolyte velocity increase from 0 cm/s to 2.89 cm/sat the current density of 100 mA/cm2. A mathematical model is proposed to describe gas bubble grown, which is found that higher current density is not bring much bigger gas bubble. The overpotential of the CoS2/Ni electrode for OER is 498 mV at 100 mA/cm2. The overpotential of CoS2/Ni electrode can be decreased from 754 mV to 661 mV with the electrolyte velocity increase from 0 cm/s to 9.42 cm/s at 200 mA/cm2 with the energy required for hydrogen production reduced by 5.01 kWh/kmol.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a half-reaction that transpires at the anode during water electrolysis. It is a controlling step in the process because of slow kinetics. Therefore, developing OER catalysts with low cost, enduring stability, and wide-pH-value adaptability is a significant challenge. In this article, NiXCo2.4-X-MOF (x = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) catalysts were synthesized via hydrothermal on nickel foam (NF). The proportion and hydrothermal temperature can affect the performances, and the optimal catalyst is obtained with x= 0.6 and hydrothermal temperature is 150°C (Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF). This catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performances. The overpotentials are 1.77, 1.61, and 1.68 V in 1 M PBS (pH= 7), 1 M KOH, and alkaline seawater at 20, 200, and 200 mA cm-2 with excellent stability towards OER, respectively. In-situ SERS results suggest that during the OER process, hydroxyoxides are formed on the catalyst surface, which serves as the actual active substance. Furthermore, XPS analysis of the OER reaction reveals the formation of M-O and high-valence state oxides. DFT calculations confirm that Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF/NiCoOOH acts as the genuine active site for the OER, formed through the reconstruction of Ni0.6Co1.8-MOF, lowering the energy barrier for OOH* formation further accelerates the reaction kinetics of the OER. This study indicates the broad application prospects of MOFs in wide-pH-value and seawater.

Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have been utilized as cost-effective alternatives for noble metal electrocatalysts, exhibiting comparable activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nickel-cobalt selenide (NiCoSe) is a TMC exhibiting significant potential in reducing the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A carbon-based hydrochar support is used as a scaffold for depositing NiCoSe, ensuring the dispersion and stability of the synthesized electrocatalyst. This work develops a NiCoSe/hydrochar electrocatalyst to enhance the stability and activity of the TMC towards OER. Various compositions of nickel-cobalt selenide (NiCoSe 2 , Ni 0.85 Co 0.85 Se, and Ni 0.6 Co 0.4 Se 2 ) with a chitin-based hydrochar support are synthesized. The electrocatalytic activity is determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry using a three-electrode set-up. NiCoSe 2 has the lowest overpotential at 179.3 mV and a Tafel slope of 163.4 mV-dec -1 . This highlights the enhanced performance of NiCoSe 2 compared to other compositions.

Oxygen vacancies are important factors to tune the performance of oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it remains challenging how to control the concentration of the oxygen vacancies and decouple their effects on OER from other factors. In this work, we use a specific composition/phase La 0.4 Sr 0.6 FeO 3- d perovskite oxide as an example to tailor the oxygen vacancies of their nanoparticulate using a modified molten salt synthesis and ozone treatment. The OER performance of the resulting La 0.4 Sr 0.6 FeO 3- d nanoparticles with different degree of oxygen vacancies ranging from 0 to 25% are compared. The OER reactivity increases with increased oxygen vacancies in the materials, but the change is nonlinear. The OER stability, on the other hand, has a bimodal distribution. The activities of fully oxidized sample and the most oxygen-deficient sample degrade slower than the two samples in the middle. The results suggest that it is feasible to design catalysts with oxygen vacancy to be the most OER active and stable. Further investigation into the oxygen vacancy – active site relation would offer guiding principle to design and synthesize high OER performance oxide catalysts.

The activity of iron oxyhydroxides (FeOOH) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is limited by its poor conductivity and the high energy barrier in the rate-determining step. Herein, we report the immobilization of atomic dispersed Pd species on Co doped FeOOH, realizing the preparation of amorphous hetero-structure FeCoaOOH-Pdb. In the case of Co/Fe of 0.68 and Pd/Fe of 0.026, the coexisting structure of nanorods and nanospheres with appropriate oxygen vacancies and unsaturated active centers increases the number of active sites and enhances the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst. The density functional theory results uncover that the FeCo0.68OOH-Pd0.026 optimizes the binding energies of ⁎O and ⁎OOH, and accelerates the OER kinetics. The rationally designed FeCo0.68OOH-Pd0.026 exhibits excellent OER activity and reliability, manifesting a Tafel slope of 37.5 mV dec-1, a low overpotential of 265.1 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which has the potential to realize the large-scale implementation of water splitting.

Transition metal materials that loaded with trace of Iridium (Ir) are widely accepted as effective catalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which the Ir atoms exposed on the surface can directly affect the electrocatalytic reaction. However, this neglects the Ir – Ir interaction of distinct locations, which may be benefit for the fine-tuning of electronic structure. Herein, we changed the locations (surface and inside) of Ir atoms in the cobalt oxide (Co3O4@NC), and investigated their alkaline OER and HER performances. Combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical calculations, we infer that the steric interactions induced by the surface – internal Ir sites can weaken the Ir-O bond and optimize the adsorption of intermediates on catalyst surface with a negative shift of d-band center, enabling the surface-Ir sites with lower energy barrier for water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption for HER. Therefore, the as-prepared Irw-Co3O4@NC with surface − inside Ir distributions significantly improve the HER without degrading OER performance, with low overpotential of −173 / −71 mV for HER at −10 mA·cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH / 1.0 M KOH, and 244 / 249 mV at 10 mA·cm−2 for OER.

Abstract Electrochemical water-splitting is a promising green technology for the production of hydrogen. One of the bottlenecks, however, is the oxygen evolution half-reaction (OER), which could be overcome with the development of a suitable electrocatalyst. Recently, non-noble metal, high-entropy oxides (HEO) have been investigated as potential OER electrocatalysts, but complex synthesis approaches that usually produce the material in powder form limit their wider utilization. Here, an innovative synthesis strategy of formulating a nanostructured (CoFeNiMnCr) 3 O 4 HEO thin film on a CoFeNiMnCr high entropy alloy (HEA) using facile electrochemical and thermal treatment methods is presented. The CoFeNiMnCr HEA serves as exceptional support to be electrochemically treated in an ethylene glycol electrolyte with ammonium fluoride to form a rough and microporous structure with nanopits. The electrochemically treated CoFeNiMnCr HEA surface is more prone to oxidation during a low-temperature thermal treatment, leading to the growth of a spinel (CoFeNiMnCr) 3 O 4 HEO thin film. The (CoFeNiMnCr) 3 O 4 HEO exhibits a superior overpotential of 341 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec −1 along with remarkable long-term stability in alkaline media. The excellent catalytic activity and stability for the OER can serve as a promising platform for the practical utilization of (CoFeNiMnCr) 3 O 4 HEO. Graphical abstract

Given the energy crisis and escalating environmental pollution, the imperative for developing clean new energy is evident. Hydrogen has garnered significant attention owing to its clean properties, high energy density, and ease of storage and transportation. This study synthesized four types of catalysts—FeS(DI/MB), FeS(ET/MB), Fe(DI/MB), and Fe(ET/MB)—using two distinct solution systems: DI/MB and ET/MB. The FeS(DI/MB) catalyst, synthesized using the layered solution system (DI/MB), demonstrates a uniformly distributed and dense nanosheet structure, exhibiting excellent resistance to strong bases and superior catalytic properties. The FeS(DI/MB) electrode showed OER overpotentials of 460 mV and 318 mV in 1 M and 6 M, respectively, at current densities of up to 500 mA cm−2. Under industrial electrolysis test conditions, the FeS(DI/MB) electrode required only 262 mV to achieve a current density of 500 mA cm−2, operating in a high-temperature, strong alkaline environment of 6 M at 60 °C. Furthermore, the FeS(DI/MB) electrode exhibited excellent OER catalytic activity and stability, as evidenced by a 60 h stability test These findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of iron nickel sulfide-based catalysts, and further in-depth and comprehensive exploration is anticipated to yield the excellent catalytic performance of these catalysts in the realm of electrolytic water hydrogen production.

Shergottite meteorites, classified as depleted, intermediate, or enriched based on incompatible trace elements and specific radiogenic isotope compositions (Sr, Nd, and Hf isotope ratios), point to multiple Martian mantle source regions. The oxygen fugacity (fO2) of these mantle regions, determined from early crystallizing minerals using the olivine-pyroxene-spinel oxybarometer, appears to correlate with incompatible trace element enrichment and isotope compositions. However, values derived from the vanadium-in-olivine oxybarometer challenge this correlation, hinting at potential biases in oxybarometry or complexities in the redox conditions of the Martian mantle. By analyzing the intermediate shergottite Northwest Africa (NWA) 11043 with various oxybarometers, this study deduced its origin from a reduced mantle source, with an average fO2 value of −0.77 ± 0.35 relative to the iron-wüstite (IW) buffer. Notably, these values coincide with those of depleted shergottites, which represent the depleted Martian mantle region. This redox similarity between intermediate and depleted shergottites contrasts with earlier notions that postulated intermediate shergottites as a mix of depleted and enriched mantle derivatives. Moreover, intermediate shergottites such as NWA 11043, Elephant Moraine (EETA) 79001A, and Allan Hills (ALH) 77005 display 176Hf/177Hf values akin to those of depleted shergottites, suggesting that intermediate mantle components can be separated from the depleted mantle source at approximately 2.2 Ga based on model age calculations. Therefore, there presents a consistent redox state between mantle magma sources of both intermediate and depleted shergottites since the Hesperian period, while enriched shergottites lean toward more oxidized conditions past source formation. This study prompts a reassessment of conventional theories, emphasizing the nuanced redox evolution of the Martian mantle across distinct mantle source regions and underscoring the complexity of the redox evolution of the Martian mantle. The emergence of chemically diverse mantle reservoirs might predominantly arise from early magma ocean differentiation processes, albeit with inherent oxidation nuances. The differences in fO2 observed between intermediate and depleted shergottites underscore the need for more in-depth studies to decipher Martian mantle differentiation and evolution.

Herein, a series of thiophene-based conductive polymers were prepared through electrochemical polymerization processes, and their microenvironments were modulated by introducing triazine/benzene linkers and co-polymerizing with various hydrophilic thiophene derivatives. Importantly, the rationally designed polythiophene G-3TT-COOCH3 with electron-withdrawing triazine unit and most satisfied hydrophilic surface exhibits the satisfied electrochemically catalyzed hydrogen evolutions and selective oxygen reduction properties to H2O2 which are better than most of organic catalysts.

Electrochemical water splitting technology enables the production of next-generation fuels, with enhancements in energy conversion achievable through the development of superior oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Within the spectrum of electrocatalysts, metal tellurides emerge as promising candidates due to their cost-effectiveness and exceptional performance in facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Within the present study, an FeTe2/MoO3 nano-electrocatalyst is synthesized via anion exchange reaction, directly deposited onto a nickel foam (NF) substrate within a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte medium, specifically tailored for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The electrochemical assessments are conducted employing customized electrodes and evaluated under alkaline conditions utilizing cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LCV), and constant potential chronoamperometry (CA). Due to its distinctive morphology, characterized by enlarged electrochemically active regions and increased active sites without requiring a binding agent, the FeTe2/MoO3 composite exhibited a reduced excess of 294 mV, accompanied by a diminished Tafel slope measuring 71 mV dec−1, and demonstrated notable consistency over a duration of 40 hours for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, this investigation confirms the enhanced activity of the FeTe2/MoO3 hybrid in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Theoretical computations corroborate these findings, suggesting the potential for developing multi-metal telluride-based materials as long-lasting and very effective OER electrocatalysts, with promising implications for future applications.

Oxygen evolution reaction at the anode consumes about 60–70% of the total power for the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), and power consumption can be greatly reduced by introducing hydrocarbon fuels such as methane into the anode for the oxidation reaction. In this work, rare-earth doped CeO2 is used as catalyst support and oxygen ion conductor with Ni serving as an active metal for methane oxidation at the SOEC anode. The catalyst is synthesized via stepwise hydrolysis and impregnation methods, and the influences of rare-earth oxides on the performance of CH4 thermal oxidation, SOEC anode oxidation and hydrogen production are studied. The results show that 5%Ni–Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ exhibits the optimal catalytic oxidation and electrolytic hydrogen production with the lowest cell voltage of 0.38 V at 0.4 A/cm2. The high performance is mainly attributed to the oxygen vacancy, oxygen ion conductivity, and active metal dispersion. It is supposed that oxygen evolution reaction and simultaneous methane oxidation with generated oxygen occur at the SOEC anode can reduce oxygen partial pressure, which results in the ultra-low voltage for hydrogen production.

Layered transition metal dichalcogenides are effective electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, active site density, and catalytic properties. This study focused on the deposition of Ni-based dichalcogenides (NiX2, where X = S, Se, Te) onto a carbon cloth substrate using a simple one-step electrodeposition method at room temperature with different deposition times (10, 15, and 20 minutes). The optimized NiS2-15, NiSe2-15, and NiTe2-15 electrocatalysts showed excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The overpotential values for hydrogen evolution were ∼56 mV, ∼37 mV, and ∼75 mV for NiS2-15, NiSe2-15, and NiTe2-15, respectively, while the overpotential values for oxygen evolution were ∼220 mV, ∼170 mV, and ∼210 mV, respectively. The electrocatalysts maintained stability for 24 hours during the evolution reactions. The density functional theory calculations suggested that NiSe2 had a lower ΔGH* value due to its smaller bandgap and inherent metallic characteristics, which is consistent with the experimental results. These findings provide a new direction for designing NiX2 (X = S, Se, Te) nanosheets for electrocatalysis applications.

We constructed a photoanode comprising the homogeneous water oxidation catalyst (WOC) Na8K8[Co9(H2O)6(OH)3(HPO4)2(PW9O34)3] (Co9POM) and nanoporous n-type TiO2 photoelectrodes (henceforth "TiO2–Co9POM") by first anchoring the cationic 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) ligand on a metal oxide light absorber, followed by treatment of the metal oxide-APS with a solution of the polyoxometalate WOC. The resulting TiO2–Co9POM photoelectrode exhibits a 3-fold oxygen evolution photocurrent enhancement compared to bare TiO2 in aqueous acidic conditions. Three-element (Co 2p, W 4f, and O 1s) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy studies before and after use indicate that surface-bound Co9POM retains its structural integrity throughout all photoelectrochemical water oxidation studies reported here. Extensive charge-transfer mechanistic studies by photoelectrochemical techniques and transient absorption spectroscopy elucidate that Co9POM serves as an efficient WOC, extracting photogenerated holes from TiO2 on the picosecond time scale. This is the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation elucidating the roles of polyoxometalates in POM-photoelectrode hybrid oxygen evolution reaction systems.

Seawater electrolysis holds great promise for sustainable green hydrogen generation, but its implementation is hindered by high energy consumption and electrode degradation. Two dimensional (2D) layered double hydroxide (LDH) exhibits remarkable stability, high catalytic activity, and excellent corrosion resistance in the harsh electrolytic environment. The synergistic effect between LDH and seawater ions enhances the oxygen evolution reaction, enabling efficient and sustainable green hydrogen generation. Here, we report a synthesis of low cost, novel 2D Vanadium Copper (VCu) LDH first time in the series of LDH’s as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. The electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) study of VCu LDH and VCu LDH/Graphite Carbon Nitride (g‐C3N4) nanohybrid was performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 (acidic), 1 M KOH (basic), 0.5 M NaCl (artificial seawater), 0.5 M NaCl + 1 M KOH (artificial alkaline seawater), real seawater and 1 M KOH + real seawater (alkaline real seawater) electrolyte medium. It was found that VCu LDH shows a remarkable lower overpotential of 72 mV hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 254 mV oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at current density of 10 mA/cm2 under alkaline real seawater electrolysis exhibiting bifunctional activity and also showing better stability.

In response to society's urgent drive to significantly decrease its reliance on fossil fuels in the future, there has been continuing efforts to utilize hydrogen (H2) generated by water electrolysis as clean and sustainable substitute for the traditional fossil fuels. A significant challenge in water electrolysis revolves around creating affordable and efficient electrocatalysts to speed up the chemical reactions involved. Our new study introduces a bifunctional catalyst made from a high-entropy alloy (HEA), capable of efficiently catalyzing both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The findings reveal that a complex chemical composition of FeCoNiCuTi HEA can significantly modify its electronic structure, resulting in an impressive electrocatalytic performance. Specifically, FeCoNiCuTi HEA catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 64.9 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution with a Tafel slope of 36.81 mV dec−1 and double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of 34.1 mF cm−2. For oxygen evolution, HEA achieves an overpotential of 175 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 44.31 mV dec−1, exhibiting the performance superior to noble catalysts. Theoretical calculations support that the intricate chemical composition of high-entropy alloy plays vital role to enhance its electrocatalytic capabilities. This research represents a straightforward efficient method to create electrocatalysts for water electrolysis using non-noble metals by leveraging high-entropy effect.

Efficient water splitting remains a challenge to produce clean and pure H2 in an industrial scale for the lack of high-performance cost-effective stable electrocatalysts of hydrogen and oxygen evolution (HER and OER). Surface engineering is a novel proposal to upgrade the electrocatalytic performances of HER and OER during the water splitting with energy-saving. Herein, a hierarchical architecture composed of carbon-supported CoNiP nanoplates (NPs) on Ni2P nanowire was constructed. The nanoarray of CoNiP@Ni2P heterostructure shows a high bifunctional activity of HER and OER. The overpotential is 46 mV required for HER at 10 mA·cm-2 and 292 mV for OER at 100 mA·cm-2 in 1 mol·L-1 KOH. In addition, the nanoarray of CoNiP@Ni2P heterostructure also shows a high stability for HER. The HER activity can be maintained at 11 mA·cm-2 without loss after 50 h cathode polarization at the overpotential of 100 mV, while the OER activity continuously increases from 26 to 64 mA·cm-2 at an overpotential of 400 mV after 50 h anode polarization. The enhancement of the oxygen evolution performance can be ascribed to the surface reconstruction of CoNiP/Ni2P heterostructure nanoarray, which can offer more active sites to OER. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals surface reconstruction can create an oxygen-rich surface in favor of intermediate adsorption, thus enabling a fast OER kinetics at the interface of NiCoOOH/Ni2P heterostructure. This work highlights surface reconstruction adaptability to design advanced catalysts of efficient water splitting for commercial H2 production.

Surface reconstituted metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer appealing properties for electrocatalysis due to their unique structural and compositional advantages. In this work, a controlled potential-induced reconstruction of a two-dimensional cobalt metal-organic framework for boosting oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media is reported. The current MOF is shown to undergo a partial structural transformation that generates a heterogeneous system, where the original MOF coexists with an oxyhydroxide phase. It has been found that the potential-induced stabilization of Co(III) metal centers in the MOF is crucial for delaying its full degradation in alkaline media. This partial retention of the Co(III)MOF phase in the so-derived heterogeneous catalyst has been demonstrated to be decisive for boosting the alkaline electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), displaying superior OER activity in terms of both thermodynamic and kinetic merits compared to the benchmark IrO2 and RuO2 electrocatalysts and the prototypical cobalt (oxy)hydroxides, with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec-1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 6.8 s-1 at 450 mV. It is also proved that the generated final product is stable, exhibiting a high robustness and long durability for long term OER electrolysis. This work provides new insight into the impact of the reconstruction of a MOF for alkaline OER under the typical electrochemical conditions, which ultimately benefits the rational design of MOF-based catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

Abstract The increasing demand for clean hydrogen necessitates the rapid development of efficient photoanodes to catalyze the water oxidation half‐reaction effectively. Here a strategy is introduced to fabricate photoanodes that synergistically combine and leverage the properties of porous Ti‐doped hematite (Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 ) and graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) nanosheets anchored with in situ grown Ni‐doped CoP co‐catalyst (Ni‐CoP). The resulting hybrid photoanodes exhibit >7 times higher photocurrent density at +1.23 V RHE compared with Ti‐Fe 2 O 3 photoanodes. Comprehensive characterization techniques, including ambient photoemission spectroscopy, intensity‐modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, and transient absorption spectroscopy complementarily reveal the key impact of g‐C 3 N 4 in these composites with enhanced solar oxygen evolution reaction: The incorporation of g‐C 3 N 4 leads to enhanced charge separation through a type‐II heterojunction, thereby increasing the hole flux at the surface, and extending the charge carrier lifetime to the ms‐s range needed for water oxidation. Additionally, g‐C 3 N 4 facilitates efficient transfer of photogenerated holes to the fine Ni‐CoP nanoparticles confined in the graphitic matrix for a boosted oxygen evolution reaction. These findings highlight the advantages of complex heterostructure photoanodes and demonstrate a new application of g‐C 3 N 4 as a multifunctional support of co‐catalysts for future photoanodes with enhanced performance.

A Fe-Co dual-metal co-doped N containing the carbon composite (FeCo-HNC) was prepared by adjusting the ratio of iron to cobalt as well as the pyrolysis temperature with the assistance of functionalized silica template. Fe1Co-HNC, which was formed with 1D carbon nanotubes and 2D carbon nanosheets including a rich mesoporous structure, exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities. The ORR half-wave potential is 0.86 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), and the OER overpotential is 0.76 V at 10 mA cm−2 with the Fe1Co-HNC catalyst. It also displayed superior performance in zinc–air batteries. This method provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of efficient transition metal-based carbon catalysts.

Abstract Slow oxygen evolution kinetics and severe corrosion limit the further application of BiVO4 photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Here, BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanodes were synthetized aiming at improving its photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability. Compared with pure BiVO4 photoanode, the BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanode enhanced the photocurrent from 1.1 mA/cm2 to 4.5 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. In addition, Ni(OH)2 acted as a corrosion protection layer on the surface of the photoanode, allowing the BiVO4/Co-Pi/Ni(OH)2 photoanode to exhibit excellent stability.

It is fascinating and challenging to construct earth-abundant first-row transition metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for large-scale hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Here we report a progressive conversion from spinel nanosheets to layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets through the preferential dissolution of alternated layers in spinel. This process enables the formation of a lattice-matched and chemically bonded edge-to-edge spinel/LDH 2D/2D heterojunction. Significant charge redistribution at the 2D/2D heterointerface accelerates water dissociation kinetics and optimize adsorption energy of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing intermediates. The synthesized CoFe2O4/CoFe-LDH 2D/2D heterojunction demonstrates exceptional performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving an overpotential of 337 mV at a high current density of 1000 mA cm-2, surpassing previously reported non-noble metal-based spinels and LDHs. Furthermore, its oxygen evolution reaction performance is comparable to that of typical spinel and LDH catalysts. The in-depth insights can guide rational interfacial engineering of heterogeneous catalysts for energy and environmental applications.

Amorphous RuOx (a-RuOx) with disordered atomic arrangement and abundant coordinatively unsaturated Ru sites possesses high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the a-RuOx is prone to fast corrosion during OER in strong acid. Here, we realized the stabilization of an ultrathin a-RuOx layer via constructing heterointerface with crystalline α-MnO2 nanorods array (MnO2@a-RuOx). Benefiting from the strong electronic interfacial interaction, the as-formed MnO2@a-RuOx electrocatalyst display an ultralow overpotential of 128 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 and stable operation for over 100 h in 0.1 M HClO4. The assembled proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer reach 1 A cm-2 at applied cell voltage of 1.71 V. Extensive characterizations indicate the MnO2 substrate work as an electron donor pool to prevent the overoxidation of Ru sites and the OER proceeds in adsorbent evolution mechanism process without involving lattice oxygen. Our work provides a promising route to construct robust amorphous phase electrocatalysts.

A kinetics-based analytical model is developed to describe the steady state and impedance response of photoelectrodes in the case where charge carrier build-up modifies the potential distribution across the semiconductor-electrolyte junction. The predictions of the steady state model are compared with numerical calculations. It is shown that carrier build up should accelerate interfacial hole transfer by increasing the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer. This effect may explain observations of higher reaction orders with respect to hole concentration during photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution. The analytical model is extended to photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). The calculations indicate that interpretation of PEIS measurements becomes more complicated if high illumination intensities are used. The modelling of the analytically calculated PEIS response using equivalent circuits is discussed with the aim of understanding the physical significance of the resistive and capacitive elements.

Reducing the overpotential of water splitting is an important strategy for achieving low-cost and large-scale production of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). It is shown that bimetallic sulfide combines the advantages of a single component and an ideal structure for efficient electrocatalysis. Hence, an acanthosphere-like bimetallic sulfide electrocatalyst Cu9S5/Mo2S3/NF with high catalytic performance and superior durability was prepared by a simple one-pot method. In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the Cu9S5/Mo2S3/NF achieved a Tafel slope of 62.7 mV dec-1, and an overpotential of 224 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Concomitantly, it also possesses a small overpotential of 96 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and low Tafel slope of 81.6 mV dec-1 at the used of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. Moreover, the two-electrode system Cu9S5/Mo2S3/NF||Cu9S5/Mo2S3/NF single cell requires only 1.55 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in overall water splitting. This work highlights the advantages of bimetallic sulfide combines structural for overpotential of water splitting and provides an idea for modifying the catalytic performance of single metal sulfides and preparing high-performance bimetallic sulfide catalysts.

Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) technology holds tremendous promise for large‐scale green hydrogen production. However, its widespread application faces significant constraints due to the limited lifespan of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in highly acidic and oxidative operating environments. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's structural degradation mechanism is imperative for the rational design of high‐performance acidic catalysts. In this review, the essence of the structural degradation of catalysts: and irreversible cationic and anionic overoxidation is initially unveiled. This is followed by an in‐depth exploration of their intricate relationship with the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). Then, state‐of‐the‐art characterization techniques for cationic and anionic overoxidation analysis are introduced. Subsequently, 4 cutting‐edge catalyst antioxidation strategies, including heterostructure engineering, doping strategy, nanostructuring, and phase engineering are systematically discussed, aiming to reveal their intrinsic factors for effectively inhibiting catalyst overoxidation. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospective insights into catalysts for PEMWE are delineated. The overarching goal of this review is to facilitate a fundamental understanding of catalyst structural degradation mechanisms and provide principal guidelines for the rational design of robust acidic OER catalysts.

Electrochemical reactions are those that occur on the surface of a charged catalyst, including carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction in total hydrolyzed water, anode fuel oxidation reaction, and cathode oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells and so on. Usually, active sites of these catalysts used in the aforementioned electrochemical reactions are noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Ru, which are limited by high cost and low reserves. In comparison, transition metals with low cost and high reserves are gradually used in these electrochemical fields, and have the potential to replace common noble metal catalytic materials. As a typical transition metal, copper is not the best choice as active site in catalysts for electrochemical reactions, but its properties offer unique characteristics in different electrochemical reactions. For example, in CO2RR process, moderate adsorption capacity of CO intermediates on Cu active site promotes the formation of a carbon-carbon bond, which will increase the proportion of multi-carbon products. In other electrochemical reactions, the use of copper can affect the electronic structure of other transition metal active sites to improve the catalytic capacity. Therefore, this chapter gives an overview of the application of copper used as active site or dopant in the field of electrochemistry.

Globally, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria has created an urgent need for an effective method to remove antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewater. Engineering Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) with an oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) holds a promising potential for enhancing water splitting efficiency in the production of hydrogen (H2) using free solar energy. Here, we successfully developed a Zr:BiVO4/NiFeOOH heterojunction by electrodeposition and photoelectrochemical transformation. Zr:BiVO4/NiFeOOH photoanodes exhibit 5 fold superior photocurrent response at 1.23 V compared with Zr:BiVO4 electrodes, since NiFeOOH acts as an oxygen-releasing catalyst. Furthermore, the attained heterojunctioned electrode can effectively degrade TCH, riboflavin, and streptomycin in PEC. The degradation rate of TCH acquired 96% within 1 h, which is 3 times superior than the efficiency reported for pristine Zr:BiVO4 photoelectrodes. By introducing NiFeOOH into BiVO4, electron life-time was increased and electron-hole recombination was suppressed. In this study, we present a solar-driven, sustainable and effective way of treating wastewater and provide new insights into the process.

Li-O2 batteries have attracted much attention due to their high energy density. However, the high charging potential cause serious side reactions and safety issues. Designing catalysts is one of the mostly adopted strategies to decrease the charging potential. Herein, we propose a distinct strategy of electrochemical lithiation of Pd-CN to significantly reduce the overpotential of Li-O2 batteries from 4.28V to 3.25V and the underlying catalysis mechanism is revealed. The lithiation promotes the formation of N defects and the Li-Pd alloying, which improves the conductivity of the catalyst and increases the number of active sites. This promotes the oxygen evolution reaction and decreases the overpotential. Theoretical calculations are further used to prove that the electrochemically tuned Pd-CN with nitrogen vacancies exhibits a weak adsorption energy for LiO2, enabling a significant reduction in the charge potential. This study proposes a distinct and facile strategy to address the overpotential issue in Li-O2 batteries.

Electrocatalysis plays a crucial role in the production of renewable clean fuels and carbon reduction. However, the catalytic efficiency of transition metal-based electrocatalysts often falls short due to unfavorable surface structures. To address this challenge, the phase transition technique has emerged as a promising surface structure optimization strategy that can modify the crystal and electronic structure of catalysts, thereby enhancing their electrocatalytic efficiency. This comprehensive review explores the mechanism of phase transition in catalysts and its potential for enhancing electrocatalysis. It provides an in-depth analysis of commonly employed phase transition strategies for transition metal-based materials and discusses the characterization techniques used to observe the phase transition process. The significance of the phase transition strategy in electrocatalysis is elucidated through the lens of key reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges associated with implementing phase transition strategies to achieve advanced catalytic performance. By providing valuable insights, this review aims to inspire further research in phase transition modulation, paving the way for the advancement of the catalysts that contribute to sustainable and eco-friendly energy production.

Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries are a family of promising energy storage systems. However, they face various challenges related to their lifetime, such as the Faradaic imbalance due to the occurrence of parasitic reaction leading to the fading of its energy storage capacity. Herein, automatization of a rebalancing system to reverse the detrimental effects of Faradaic imbalance due to the unavoidable presence of small quantities of oxygen in the negative reservoir is developed and implemented in an alkaline flow battery. A membrane‐free rebalancing cell is proposed to promote the oxygen evolution reaction and reverse the accumulated charge in the catholyte showing a 100% coulombic efficiency. The programmable logic controller monitors the open circuit voltage to calculate the charge stored in each charge / discharge step and closes a circuit so a fixed voltage is applied to the rebalancing cell when the battery needs to be rebalanced. The system is tested using an alkaline flow battery consisting of ferrocyanide and 2,6‐dihydroxyanthraquinone, improving the energy capacity retention from 0.27% cycle‐1 and 0.47% h‐1 without rebalancing system to 100% retention after >850 cycles and >24 days (without Ar‐filled glovebox), demonstrating the feasibility of this proposed system to address the Faradaic imbalance.

Heterogeneous oxide couplers represent a type of emerging composite materials with inherently outstanding interface properties for electrocatalytic applications. In this study, we fabricate a Ru-Co nano-oxide coupler that enables internal electron transfer between Ru and Co elements. The catalyst exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance compared to commercial RuO2, with mere 260 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm-2. The exchange current density (i0) for RuO2/Co3O4 is enhanced by three orders of magnitude compared to commercial RuO2. Electrochemical characterizations and computational analysis reveal that the coupling of Co3O4 and RuO2 enhances the surface's capability for water dissociation on the interface Ru sites, thereby initiating OER. The exceptional performance of RuO2/Co3O4 enables water splitting via a single-cell AA battery configuration that utilizes a RuO2/Co3O4 anode || Pt/C cathode setup. This accomplishment underscores the potential of RuO2/Co3O4 for effective and sustainable electrochemical water splitting applications.

In this study, we propose combustion-assisted corrosion engineering as a rapid method to fabricate electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within seconds. By utilizing a three-dimensional framework composed of nickel foam and the unique structure of the active species, we enable swift electrolyte diffusion and gas release. Consequently, the optimized S–NiO/NF exhibits remarkable OER catalytic activity, requiring a low overpotential of 236 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Notably, the reconfiguration during the OER process leads to the formation of actual catalytic active species, enhancing the number of active centers and thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This research presents a versatile method for industrially fabricating non-noble metal self-supporting electrodes with high efficiency, offering a practical solution for energy conversion and storage.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a very complex process with slow reaction kinetics and high overpotential, which is the main limitation for the commercial application of water splitting. Thus, it is of necessary to design high-performance OER catalysts. NiFe based layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) have recently gained a lot of attention due to their high reaction activity and simple manufacturing process. In this study, a novel electrocatalyst based on NiFe-LDH was constructed by introducing Ti3C2, which was utilized to modulate the structural and electronic properties of the electrocatalysts. Structural examinations reveal that the Ti3C2 of 2D structure successfully dope the NiFe-LDHs nanosheets, forming NiFe-LDH/Ti3C2 heterojunctions. Firstly, the heterojunction substantially reduces the charge transfer resistance, promoting the electron migration between the LDH nanosheets. Secondly, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier between the rate-determining step from *OH to *O is lowered, favoring the formation of the reaction intermediates and thus the occurrence of OER. As a result, the composite electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 334 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec, which are superior to those of the NiFe-LDH by 11.2% and 38.5%, respectively. This study provides inspiration for promoting the performances of NiFe based electrocatalysts by utilizing 2D materials.

Rechargeable aqueous zinc-based batteries not only pave the way for environmentally friendly and safe energy storage devices but also hold great promise for reducing the manufacturing costs of next-generation batteries, positioning them as the most promising energy storage system to replace lithium-ion batteries. However, the commercial application of aqueous zinc-based batteries (AZBs) is severely constrained by issues such as zinc dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and electrode corrosion. While significant efforts have been devoted to exploring electrode materials and their storage mechanisms in this system in recent years, research on the nature of Zn2+ solvation in electrolytes remains insufficient. Therefore, this review primarily provides a comprehensive and in-depth elucidation of the existing issues such as dendrite formation, hydrogen/oxygen evolution, electrode corrosion and passivation interactions. Additionally, from the perspective of electrolyte optimization, this review emphasizes existing strategies to address Zn2+ solvation, including adjusting electrolyte concentration, incorporating functional additives or co-solvents, utilizing ionic liquids, and developing hydrogel electrolytes, and summarizes approaches and mechanisms for improving their relevant performance. Finally, prospects for electrolyte modification and innovation directions of AZBs are proposed, providing guidance for future AZB studies.

Multifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial for development of the key electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, for which single-atom catalyst (SAC) has present great promises. Very recently, some experimental works showed that structurally well-defined ultra-small transition-metal clusters (such as Fe and Co tetramers, denoted as Fe4 and Co4, respectively), can efficiently modulate the catalytic behavior of SACs by axial coordination. Herein, taking the graphene-supported MN4 SACs as representatives, we theoretically explored the feasibility of realizing multifunctional SACs for ORR, OER, and HER by this novel axial coordination engineering. Through extensive first-principles calculations, from 23 candidates, IrN4 decorated with Fe4 (IrN4/Fe4) is identified as the promising trifunctional catalyst with the theoretical overpotential of 0.43, 0.51, and 0.30 V for OER, ORR, and HER, respectively. RhN4/Fe4 and CoN4/Fe4 are recognized as potential OER and ORR bifunctional catalysts. In addition, NiN4/Fe4 exhibits the best ORR activity with an overpotential of 0.30 V, far superior to the pristine NiN4 SAC (0.88 V). Electronic structure analyses reveal that the significantly enhanced ORR activity can be ascribed to the orbital and charge redistribution of Ni active center, resulting from its electronic interaction with Fe4 cluster. This work could stimulate and guide the rational design of graphene-based multifunctional SACs realized by axial coordination of small TM clusters, and provide insights into the modulation mechanism.

The implementation of nanocomposite materials as electrode layers represents a potential turning point for next-generation of solid oxide cells in order to reduce the use of critical raw materials. However, the substitution of bulk electrode materials by thin films is still under debate especially due to the uncertainty about their performance and stability under operando conditions, which restricts their use in real applications. In this work, we propose a multiphase nanocomposite characterized by a highly disordered microstructure and high cationic intermixing as a result from thin-film self-assembly of a perovskite-based mixed ionic-electronic conductor (lanthanum strontium cobaltite) and a fluorite-based pure ionic conductor (samarium-doped ceria) as an oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells. Electrochemical characterization shows remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (fuel cell mode) and oxygen evolution activity (electrolysis mode) in comparison with state-of-the-art bulk electrodes, combined with outstanding long-term stability at operational temperatures of 700 ºC. The disordered nanostructure was implemented as a standalone oxygen electrode on commercial anode-supported cells, resulting in high electrical output in fuel cell and electrolysis mode for active layer thicknesses of only 200 nm (>95% decrease in critical raw materials with respect to conventional cathodes). The cell was operated for over 300 hours displaying excellent stability. Our findings unlock the hidden potential of advanced thin-film technologies for obtaining high-performance disordered electrodes based on nanocomposite self-assembly combining long durability and minimized use of critical raw materials.

Multimetallic oxide configuration and hollow structure construction are effective strategies for the design of efficient electrocatalysts, which can regulate the intrinsic properties of the active sites, enlarge the specific surface areas and expose more active sites. In this work, hollow-structured CuCo-based ternary metal oxides supported nitrogen-carbon networks (HS-CuMCoOx, M=Fe/Zn/Ni) derived from ZIF-67 hollow spheres were fabricated through facile ion exchange and heat treatment. The prepared composites possess hollow configurations with homogeneously dispersed trimetallic active species on the shells. Among all the ternary metallic derivatives, hollow spheres supporting Cu, Fe, and Co oxides (HS-CuFeCoOx) exhibited highest electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The improved OER performance ascribed to the inherent electrocatalytic properties of the ternary metal active species and microstructure by hollow structure design and heat treatment, which offered an effective synthetic strategy for the fabrication of trimetallic oxide composites for as OER electrocatalysts.

Seawater Electrolysis is an exciting alternative to freshwater electrolysis; however, it suffers from a multitude of issues that must be resolved before the technology can be scaled. Corrosive hypochlorite forms at the anode of seawater electrolysis and can damage catalysts and electrolyzer components. Hypochlorite is unstable and can decay, particularly when exposed to heat and metal ions, which can lead to erroneously high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) selectivity conclusions, resulting in poor catalyst and electrolyzer component selection. In this study, we use the rotating ring-disc electrode technique to characterize the selectivity of IrO 2 , NiO, Co 3 O 4 , RuO 2 , Pt and PtRu electrocatalysts in situ at near-neutral pH (8.4) with linear scan voltammetry (LSV), potentiostatic and galvanostatic experiments. Our findings reveal that elevated temperatures are conducive to higher OER selectivity. Furthermore, when we increased the chloride concentration in the electrolyte with an IrO 2 catalyst, we observed that although the overall selectivity towards the OER reaction decreased, the OER current independently increased, indicating a synergistic relationship.

Direct electrolysis of pH-neutral seawater for hydrogen generation is a promising method for storing renewable energy. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) faces a selectivity challenge, competing with chlorine evolution and confronting severe corrosion issues of the electrode. Here, we have synthesized ultrathin, polycrystalline, porous Co3O4 nanosheets with Pd single atoms (PdSA-Co3O4) for efficient and stable pH-neutral seawater decomposition. The octahedral Pd-O-Co active unit, generated by the synergistic coordination of the Pd single atom strong proton adsorption (SPA) material with Co3O4 nanosheets, resulted in PdSA-Co3O4 have activities 3, 5, and 31 times higher than Co3O4, IrO2, and commercial Co3O4, respectively. It also remained stable in pH-neutral seawater for 80 h. Operando in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations showed that synergistic interactions between the strong proton adsorption of Pd single atoms and the active site Co enhanced the adsorption of intermediates and significantly reduced the free energy of adsorption at the rate-determining step (O*→OOH*). The Pd-O-Co active units inhibited the transformation of the dynamic structure of the Co3O4 substrate and reduced the corrosive effect of Cl ions during the OER process.

Construction of multi-component heterostructures is an effective strategy for electrocatalysts to improve both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity at the anode. Herein, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst towards overall water/seawater splitting (OW/SS) is reported with strategy of heterostructure construction (ruthenium/nickel phosphorus) on nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2). With the unique hydrolysis layer (Ni(OH)2), the processes of H2O hydrolysis and the adsorption/desorption of H*/O-containing intermediates (OH, O, OOH) were greatly boosted by Ru and P sites, which acted as the catalytic active centers of OER and HER, respectively. In addition, the electronic structure reconfiguration was realized through the strong interaction between multi-interfaces. For alkaline HER at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Ru-P-Ni(OH)2/NF (denoted as RNPOH/NF) was 98 mV, whereas just 230 mV of overpotential was essential to stimulate alkaline OER at the current density of 20 mA cm−2. Specifically, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting, RNPOH/NF deserves cell voltages of 1.7/1.92 V and 1.75/1.94 V, respectively, to activate current densities of 50/100 mA cm−2 in alkaline water/seawater systems, together with a good durability of 12 h. This work contributes insights to the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water/seawater splitting.

We combined ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface science techniques, electrochemical measurements, and computational modeling to investigate electrocatalytic systems that are crucial components of the carbon management effort, including oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). Well-defined Model catalysts were grown on substrates in the UHV chamber and characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Selected model electrocatalysts were then tested in electrochemical cells to establish the structure-property relationships in OER and CO2RR. Our results showed that the edge sites of Fe2O3 grown on Au(111) were the most active toward OER and incorporation of Ni at the edge sites (NiFeOx) further boosted their OER activity. We also resolved the size-dependent electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion of the Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with average particle diameter between 2 to 6 nm: smaller diameter (< 3 nm) particles favored H2 evolution reaction (HER) due to a high population of Ag edge sites, whereas larger diameter particles favored CO2RR as the population of Ag(100) surface sites grew. We further discovered that electronic interactions between small diameter Ag particles and highly defective carbon supports could break the size-dependent CO2RR selectivity, resulting in highly selective (CO Faradaic Efficiency > 90%) and active Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with sizes < 2 nm diameter.

Abstract Water electrolysis remains a key component in the societal transition to green energy. Membrane electrolyzers are the state‐of‐the‐art technology for water electrolysis, relying on 80 °C operation in highly alkaline electrolytes, which is undesirable for many of the myriad end‐use cases for electrolytic water splitting. Herein, an alternative water electrolysis process, decoupled electrolysis, is described which performed in mild acidic conditions with excellent efficiencies. Decoupled electrolysis sequentially performs the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), at the same catalyst. Here, H + ions generated from the OER are stored through pseudocapacitive (redox) charge storage, and released to drive the HER. Here, decoupled electrolysis is demonstrated using cheap, abundant, TiO 2 for the first time. To achieve decoupled acid electrolysis, ultra‐small anatase TiO 2 particles (4.5 nm diameter) are prepared. These ultra‐small TiO 2 particles supported on a carbon felt electrode show a highly electrochemical surface area with a capacitance of 375 F g −1 . When these electrodes are tested for decoupled water splitting an overall energy efficiency of 52.4% is observed, with excellent stability over 3000 cycles of testing. This technology can provide a viable alternative to membrane electrolyzers—eliminating the need for highly alkaline electrolytes and elevated temperatures.

The development of non‐precious metal electrocatalysts with excellent activity and durability for electrochemical water splitting has always been a goal. Transition metal sulfides are attractive electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this article, we designed and constructed efficient catalysts with multiple synergistic interactions and synthesized Ce‐NiS2@NF nanosphere using a solvothermal method. Ce‐NiS2@NF exhibits excellent HER performance, OER performance, and overall water splitting capability in alkaline electrolytes, demonstrating good stability. The addition of Ce influences the activity of the catalysts, attributed to the synergistic interactions creating more active sites and higher intrinsic activity through the introduction of Ce heteroatoms. Additionally, the self‐supported conductive substrate promotes electron transfer, enhancing the intrinsic activity and active site density of the catalyst. This study provides an in‐depth investigation into structural design and performance enhancement, offering ideas for designing efficient catalysts for overall water electrolysis. This work provides an in‐depth study in terms of structural design performance enhancement and provides ideas for designing efficient alkaline bifunctional catalysts. Valuable insights have been provided in elucidating the intrinsic mechanism of the catalytic activity of cerium‐doped nickel sulfide nanospheres, thus providing new guidance in the field of energy conversion technology.

The development of economical, earth-rich, and high-performance transition metal phosphides electrocatalysts is crucial for water splitting. Herein, the NiCo PBA/Ni(OH)2 hierarchical nanostructure arrays are in situ grown on the coal-based carbon nanofibers (C-CNFs) using hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods. Subsequently, the Co-doped Ni5P4 porous nanosheet arrays composite coal-based carbon nanofibers electrocatalyst (Co-Ni5P4@C-CNFs) is obtained through low-temperature phosphorization process. Benefiting from cation-doped, porous nanosheet arrays structure and self-supported conductive substrates, the Co-Ni5P4@C-CNFs has excellent electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting. It provides low overpotentials of 75 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 231 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the Co-Ni5P4@C-CNFs demonstrates a low overall water splitting cell voltage of 1.537 V at current density of 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable long-term stability for over 160 h. It outperforms the most transition metal phosphide bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. This research provides a novel strategy for synthesizing high-performance transition metal phosphides bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Abstract Engineering the intermetallic nanostructures as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is of great interest in green hydrogen production. However, a few non‐noble metals act as bifunctional electrocatalysts, exhibiting terrific HER and OER processes reported to date. Herein the intermetallic nickel–antimonide (Ni─Sb) dendritic nanostructure via cost‐effective electro‐co‐deposition method is designed and their bifunctional electrocatalytic property toward HER and OER is unrevealed. The designed Ni─Sb delivers a superior bifunctional activity in 1 m KOH electrolyte, with a shallow overpotential of ≈119 mV at ‐10 mA for HER and ≈200 mV at 50 mA for OER. The mechanism behind the excellent bifunctional property of Ni─Sb is discussed via “interfacial descriptor” with the aid of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). This study reveals the rate of electrocatalytic reaction depends on the energy required for electron and proton transfer from the catalyst's surface. It is noteworthy that the assembled Ni─Sb‐90 electrolyzer requires only a minuscule cell voltage of ≈1.46 V for water splitting, which is far superior to the art of commercial catalysts.

The catalytic efficiency of water electrolysis is directly affected by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). DFT simulation was used to calculate the doping of SiC nanoparticles into Ni–Co alloys. The results indicate that doping nano SiC particles enhances the intrinsic activity of Ni–Co–SiC in OER by introducing a separate RDS at each of the four reaction sites. Then, magnetic field-induced jet electrodeposition was used to manufacture Ni–Co–SiC catalytic electrodes. To obtain a larger specific surface area of the micro/nano structure, nickel nanoparticles, and SiC nanoparticles were mixed in the form of mixed nanoparticles and then added to the electrolyte. The effect of mixed nanoparticle concentration on OER performance of Ni–Co–SiC catalytic electrodes was investigated. Research showed that the Ni–Co–SiC catalytic electrode exhibits micro/nano dense cellular protrusion structures with higher surface roughness with a magnetic field. OER performance of the Ni–Co–SiC catalytic electrode further increased with the concentration of nanoparticles, the catalytic electrode has excellent catalytic performance when the concentration of mixed nanoparticles reaches 6 g/L in the electrolyte. The overpotential of the Ni–Co–SiC/Ni catalytic electrode decreased to 309 mV, and the Tafel slope was 54.5 mV/dec.

The development of silicon (Si) photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation is highly crucial for the progress of solar‐driven hydrogen production. Apart from the typical water oxidation reaction or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is gaining more attention due to favorable thermodynamics. In this work, we study Si photoanodes modified with electrodeposited copper‐nickel (CuNi) alloy for OER and UOR. The optimized photoanodes exhibit a low onset potential of 1.15 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a current density of 6 mA cm‐2 at 1.23 V vs RHE (the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation) for OER. Further, CuNi alloy‐modified photoanodes can drive the UOR at a lower onset potential (1.05 V vs RHE) and generate a higher current density of 31 mA cm‐2 at 1.23 V vs RHE. Importantly, the CuNi alloy can extend the stability for UOR under PEC conditions when compared to a planar Ni film deposited by a vacuum‐based process. This work demonstrates that CuNi alloy can further improve the properties of inhomogeneous metal‐insulator‐semiconductor Si photoanodes which can be efficiently utilized for both OER and UOR.

Doping bi-metal transition metal phosphides (TMPs) with high-valent metal is a powerful method to obtain highly efficient and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts in alkaline media for overall water splitting. However, the composition-activity relationship of such doping has not been investigated yet due to the challenge in constructing tri-metal TMPs with continuously variable composition while maintaining a homogenous elemental distribution. In this study, we proposed a strategy using a trimetal oleta composite with a homogenous elemental distribution at the molecular scale as an ideal precursor. This precursor was then used to fabricate Fe-doped Ni-Co phosphide on a flower-like carbon substrate, resulting in a continuously changeable Fe content (FexNiCoP/C). Benefiting from the fully exposed structure and the doping effects of Fe, the flower-like FexNiCoP/C hybrids exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By optimizing the Fe content, the flower-like Fe0.4NiCoP/C hybrid achieved 10 mA/cm2 at a low overpotential of 243 mV for the OER and 107 mV for the HER, respectively. When the optimal Fe0.4NiCoP/C electrodes were employed as the anode and cathode for water electrolysis in an alkaline electrolyte, the electrolyzer achieved 10 mA/cm2 at a low cell voltage of 1.59 V. This work provides an inexpensive, highly active, and durable electrocatalyst, while revealing the composition-activity relationship of FexNiCoP/C for overall water splitting in alkaline media.

In addressing the challenging quest for an efficient electrocatalyst in electrochemical water splitting, we demonstrate an Fe-doped NiO nanosheet array anchored on nickel foam synthesized via a two-step process. Demonstrating exceptional performance in an alkaline electrolyte, FeNiO catalysts exhibit the oxygen evolution reaction with a low potential of 1.52 V vs RHE and the urea oxidation reaction of 1.32 V vs RHE @ 10 mA/cm2. The bifunctional electrolyzer generates 10 mA/cm2 current at 1.95 V for water and 1.59 V for urea electrolysis at ambient temperature. Promisingly, the FeNiO catalyst based electrolyzer generates hydrogen at an industrial-scale current density of 400 mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of just 1.91 V in concentrated alkaline electrolyte and elevated temperature (80 °C) due to the dimensionally stable and robust behavior of the self-supported catalyst. The activation energy for alkaline water electrolysis is found to be 52 kJ/mol.

Utilization of widely available seawater for hydrogen generation using robust electrolysis methods can provide sustainable solutions to energy carriers. Sea waves at the same time provide abundant renewable energy that can produce the electricity required for seawater electrolysis. This work presents a novel design for a self-powered hydrogen generation based on membrane-less seawater electrolysis integrated with spring-assisted spherical triboelectric nanogenerators. To streamline fabrication and minimize maintenance expenses, water electrolysis is conducted in a membrane-less electrochemical cell reactor. Employing a mathematical model, the system's performance is analyzed across different catalysts, electrolytes, and operational temperatures. The modeling outcomes indicate that elevating the cell's temperature can lower the necessary potential, enhancing overall electrochemical cell efficiency and decreasing capacitor charging duration. The voltage required for the cell to reach 100 mA cm−2 in the seawater decreases from 2.4 V to 1.9 V as the cell temperature increase from 25 °C to 70 °C. This is due to the decline in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction overpotentials for NPNNS and Ti supported PtPd from 351 mV to 246 mV and 568 mV–394 mV, respectively. Furthermore, increase in the temperature results in an additional 19 % improvement in cell efficiency from 78 % to 97 % and producing hydrogen per cycle during electrolysis of seawater increase from 0.015 μmole to 0.020 μmole.

5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) offers a promising avenue to achieve energy-saving H2 production and produce value-added chemicals. However, the lack of HMFOR electrocatalysts with large current density and high selectivity impedes the whole productivity. Herein, an Ni3P-Cu3P heterojunction grown on Cu foam (Ni3P-Cu3P/CF) was successfully constructed, achieving large current density (300 mA cm-2 at 1.60 V vs. RHE) and high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency (>99%) for HMFOR. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the interface charge redistributes at the Ni3P-Cu3P heterointerface, resulting into the charge-deficiency Ni3P and charge-accumulation Cu3P. The charge-deficiency Ni3P induced by charge-attracting Cu3P favors to form more high-valence Ni species, which facilitates to optimize the adsorption of HMF and OH⁎ species for improving current density and decreasing potential, while the charge-accumulation Cu3P enables to broaden the potential window by suppressing competitive oxygen evolution reaction, thus elevating the conversion rate and selectivity of products. Benefiting from the excellent performance of Ni3P-Cu3P/CF for HMFOR, when constructing a HMFOR-assisted H2 production system using Ni3P-Cu3P/CF and self-prepared MoNiNx/NF as anode and cathode, the energy consumption was substantially decreased to 3.8 kW•h/Nm3 relative to that of pure water splitting (4.66 kW•h/Nm3). Our work is instructive for achieving low energy consumption of H2 production and synthesis of valuable chemicals by constructing heterojunction.

This study examines the catalytic activity of NiFeCoOx catalysts for anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. The catalysts were synthesized with a Ni to Co ratio of 2:1 and Fe content ranges from 2.5 to 12.5 wt%. The catalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The catalytic activity of the NiFeCoOx catalysts was evaluated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) experiments for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst with 5% Fe content exhibited the highest catalytic activity, achieving an overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Long-term catalyst testing for the OER at 50 mA cm−2 showed stable electrolysis operation for 100 h. The catalyst was further analyzed in an AEM water electrolyzer in a single-cell test, and the NiFeCoOx catalyst with 5% Fe at the anode demonstrated the highest current densities of 1516 mA cm−2 and 1620 mA cm−2 at 55 °C and 70 °C at 2.1 V. The maximum current density of 1880 mA cm−2 was achieved at 2.2 V and 70 °C. The Nyquist plot analysis of electrolysis at 55 °C showed that the NiFeCoOx catalyst with 5% Fe had lower activation resistance compared with the other Fe loadings, indicating enhanced performance. The durability test was performed for 8 h, showing stable AEM water electrolysis with minimum degradation. An overall cell efficiency of 70.5% was achieved for the operation carried out at a higher current density of 0.8 A cm−2.

Abstract Seawater electrolysis is a potentially cost‐effective approach to green hydrogen production, but it currently faces substantial challenges for its high energy consumption and the interference of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER). Replacing the energy‐demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising alternative, as the MOR occurs at a significantly low anodic potential, which cannot only reduces the voltage needed for electrolysis but also completely circumvents the ClER. To this end, developing high‐performance MOR catalysts is a key. Herein, we report a novel quaternary Pt 1.8 Pd 0.2 CuGa/C intermetallic nanoparticles (i‐NPs) catalyst, which shows a high mass activity (11.13 A mg PGM −1 ), a large specific activity (18.13 mA cm PGM −2 ), and outstanding stability toward alkaline MOR. Advanced in‐situ surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), online differential mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically distributed Pd in Pt 2 CuGa intermetallic markedly promotes the oxidation of key reaction intermediates by enriching electron concentration around Pt sites, resulting in weak adsorption of carbon‐containing intermediates and favorable adsorption of the synergistic OH − groups near Pd sites. Using Pt 1.8 Pd 0.2 CuGa/C i‐NPs as anodic catalysts, we demonstrate MOR‐assisted seawater electrolysis that continuously operates under 1.23 V for 240 h in simulated seawater and 120 h in natural seawater without notable degradation, showing great potential for energy‐saving and cost‐competitive hydrogen production from seawater.

Developing efficient hole transport layers and water oxidation electrocatalysts is vital for improving the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices for water-splitting. In this work, we synthesized Co3O4 nanoparticles/Ti3C2-MXene hybrid material and utilized it as a dual-function material to transport the photogenerated holes and catalyze the water oxidation reaction. It was found that the modification of BiVO4 with Co3O4/Ti3C2-MXene prolonged the lifetime of the photogenerated holes by 13.7-fold (i.e. from 0.26 s for BiVO4 to 3.56 s for Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4) and significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance. The modification of BiVO4 with only Ti3C2-MXene resulted in significant surface recombination more likely due to the high concentration of the accumulated holes in the Mxene layer because of its low electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation reaction. Employing the Co3O4/Ti3C2-MXene hybrid materials reduced significantly the rate constant of surface recombination and dramatically enhanced the charge transfer efficiency (i.e. from 0.17% for BiVO4 to 14.0% for Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4 at 0.65 VRHE). Under optimized conditions, the Co3O4/Ti3C2/BiVO4 photoanode was able to deliver 5.05 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE and outperforms Ti3C2/BiVO4 and Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanodes. Moreover, it showed high stability for over 50 hours and reached a Faradaic efficiency of 90%. An applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) value of 1.71% at 0.62 VPt was obtained for the overall water splitting. This work provides a facile method to reduce surface recombination and enhance the stability and PEC efficiency of BiVO4 photoanodes via modification with dual-function oxygen evolution catalyst/hole transport layer hybrid materials.

Abstract Double-atom catalysts (DACs) have open up novel paradigms in the field of rapidly developing atomic catalysis because of their great potential to promote catalytic performances in various reaction systems. However, increasing the loading and extending the service life of metal active centers represents a grand challenge for the efficient utilization of DACs. Here, we rationally design asymmetric nitrogen, sulfur-coordinated diatomic iron centers on highly defective nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (denoted as A-Fe2S1N5/SNC, A: asymmetric), which possesses the atomic configuration of N2S1Fe-FeN3 moiety. The abundant defects and low-electronegativity heteroatoms in the carbon-based framework endow the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC with a high loading of 6.72 wt%. Furthermore, the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC demonstrates an ultra-low overpotential of 193 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm− 2, outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalysts. In addition, the A-Fe2S1N5/SNC exhibits extraordinary stability, maintaining > 97% activity for over 2000 hours during the OER process. This work provides a practical scheme for simultaneously balancing activity and stability of DACs toward electrocatalysis applications.

The wettability of polymers is usually inadequate to ensure the appropriate spreading of polar liquids and thus enable the required adhesion of coatings. A standard ecologically benign method for increasing the polymer wettability is a brief treatment with a non-equilibrium plasma rich in reactive oxygen species and predominantly neutral oxygen atoms in the ground electronic state. The evolution of the surface wettability of selected aromatic polymers was investigated by water droplet contact angles deposited immediately after exposing polymer samples to fluxes of oxygen atoms between 3 × 1020 and 1 × 1023 m−2s−1. The treatment time varied between 0.01 and 1000 s. The wettability evolution versus the O-atom fluence for all aromatic polymers followed similar behavior regardless of the flux of O atoms or the type of polymer. In the range of fluences between approximately 5 × 1020 and 5 × 1023 m−2, the water contact angle decreased exponentially with increasing fluence and dropped to 1/e of the initial value after receiving the fluence close to 5 × 1022 m−2.

The evolution of oxide scales on a 9Cr–1Mo ferritic-martensitic steel (T91) in oxygen-saturated liquid LBE at 500 °C was investigated. While taken out at around 500 °C, the T91 steel, after corrosion, shows clean surface with little LBE adhesion due to the poor wettability induced by surface oxides, due to the formation of an oxide layer. The results reveal the evolution of surface oxides from irregular strip shapes to regular crystalline grains, and stack-packed equiaxed crystals in the outer magnetite layer. Thermally-induced cracks were captured in the oxide scale on T91 steel after 1,000 h exposure to LBE. A new oxidation mechanism is proposed, with consideration of the formation of the outer layer by metal dissolution/oxide precipitation, and a thin film of chromium oxide at the inner/outer layers interface. The dependency of temperature and oxygen concentration on the oxidation kinetics of T91 steel in LBE at the present condition is discussed.

The control of diamond film growth is crucial for the application of diamond films. In this article, different diamond film samples were prepared by adding nitrogen and oxygen in different proportions during the growth process. The key conditions for controlling the growth of diamond film with preferred orientation were obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy characterizations. During the growth process, the growth of the diamond film with (100) preferred orientation could be achieved by adjusting nitrogen content. It was necessary to introduce nitrogen and oxygen in the growth process, and precisely regulate the ratio of the two to obtain the (111) preferred orientation of the diamond film. When only oxygen was introduced during growth, the preferred orientation of the diamond could not be achieved, leading to a smaller grain size and poorer crystal quality. From the perspective of grain morphology to film morphology evolution, this study obtained the crystal orientation control conditions during the diamond film growth, which has important guiding significance for the application of the diamond film. This study seeks to drive progress in the large-scale growth of readily machinable diamond and the evolution of diamond-grain optical fiber sensing through comprehensive investigations into the correlation between the preferred orientation in polycrystalline diamonds and reaction conditions.

Abstract Photosynthetic organisms, fungi, and animals comprise distinct pathways for vitamin C biosynthesis. Besides this diversity, the final biosynthetic step consistently involves an oxidation reaction carried out by the aldonolactone oxidoreductases. Here, we study the origin and evolution of the diversified activities and substrate preferences featured by these flavoenzymes using molecular phylogeny, kinetics, mutagenesis, and crystallographic experiments. We find clear evidence that they share a common ancestor. A flavin-interacting amino acid modulates the reactivity with the electron acceptors, including oxygen, and determines whether an enzyme functions as an oxidase or a dehydrogenase. We show that a few side chains in the catalytic cavity impart the reaction stereoselectivity. Ancestral sequence reconstruction outlines how these critical positions were affixed to specific amino acids along the evolution of the major eukaryotic clades. During Eukarya evolution, the aldonolactone oxidoreductases adapted to the varying metabolic demands while retaining their overarching vitamin C-generating function.

Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e– oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy‐intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e– oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial‐level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50‒421 mA cm‒2 with 84‒100% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856‒7842 μmol cm‐2 h‐1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low‐current electrolysis. Finite‐element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e– oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.

Employing the Cooper-Rushton-Grimes (CRG) interatomic empirical potential with new parameters for U3+ interactions in U1-y,PuyO2-x, classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the first time to compute the enthalpy, the lattice parameter, the elastic constants and derived properties of hypostoichiometric U1-y,PuyO2-x compounds (with y in the range 0-1, x between 1.92-2.0, and from 1000 K to melting points). As hypostoichiometry results from adding oxygen vacancies to U1-y,PuyO2, this study investigates how oxygen vacancies affect the thermodynamic and thermomechanical properties of MOX compounds. The most pronounced effect appears at high temperatures, where the so-called Bredig transition occurs. We observed that the effects of this transition on the properties are softened by the presence of oxygen vacancies. The analytical law of the heat capacity for stoichiometric mixed-oxide fuels U1-y,PuyO2 developed by Bathellier et al. [9] was modified by introducing the deviation from stoichiometry as a variable. It was fitted on Molecular Dynamics data of heat capacity and linear thermal expansion coefficient and a good agreement was found. To model the thermal evolution of mechanical properties up to melting point, a new law was developed. The laws may be used in Fuel Performance Codes.

Hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane hydrolysis is a promising way for utilization of clean energy. Development of efficient and stable non-noble catalysts for improvement of hydrogen generation rate is essential but still a challenge. Herein, the heterostructured Co-based catalysts were controllably designed by combining the synergistic effect with oxygen vacancy engineering to improve the hydrogen generation rate. CoCu1Mo3-NC-O-15 exhibits the TOF value of 24.44 min-1 at 298 K with addition of 0.44 M NaOH, which is nearly 68 times that of Co-NC. The activation energy over CoCu1Mo3-NC-O-15 is 28.44 kJ mol-1. The CoCu1Mo3-NC-O-15 catalyst presents the good stability in ammonia borane hydrolysis reaction due to the carbon-coated structure. The strong synergistic effect and oxygen vacancy are favorable to the adsorption and dissociation of NH3BH3 and H2O molecules, leading to an astonishing improvement of catalytic activity. This study provides a novel way to design the heterostructured catalysts and a rational way to boost the dehydrogenation rate from AB.

The configurational disorder of high entropy oxides (HEOs) promotes the reversible exsolution–redissolution of constituent metal species. This unique feature could be exploited to facilitate cyclic lattice oxygen storage and exchange. Herein, we report an in situ generated, halite-structured (MgCoNiMnFe)Ox HEO, which simultaneously functions as a redox catalyst and an oxygen carrier for dry reforming of methane in a chemical looping process (CL–DRM). Accordingly, the (MgCoNiMnFe)Ox/ZrO2 HEO catalyst exhibits outstanding DRM activity, syngas selectivity and cyclic stability compared to medium-entropy oxides and bimetallic oxides over 100 CL–DRM cycles at 800 °C. XRD analysis verified the entropy-mediated preservation of the alloy/HEO/ZrO2 catalytic structure over CL–DRM cycles. XAFS studies revealed the reversible and cyclic evolution–dissolution of Ni, Fe, Co over redox cycles. The exsolved NiFeCo nanoalloy exhibited high efficiency in activating CH4. This study has demonstrated the potential applications of HEO-based catalysts in efficient chemical looping processes.

The bulk damage of p-type silicon sensors caused by gamma irradiation with high total ionizing doses has been investigated. The study was carried out on different types of n+-in-p silicon diodes with different oxygen concentrations and silicon bulk resistivities. The Secondary-Ion Mass Spectrometry technique was used to determine the relative concentration of oxygen in the individual samples. The measured diodes were irradiated by a 60Co gamma source to total ionizing doses ranging from 0.50 up to 8.28 MGy, and annealed for 80 min at 60 °C. The main goal of the study was to characterize the gamma-radiation induced displacement damage by measuring I–V and C–V characteristics, and the evolution of the full depletion voltage with the total ionizing dose. The Transient Current Technique was used to verify the full depletion voltage and to extract the electric field distribution and the sign of the space charge in the silicon diodes irradiated to the lowest and the highest delivered total ionizing doses. The results show a linear increase of the bulk leakage current with the total ionizing dose, with the damage coefficient being dependent on initial resistivity and oxygen concentration of the silicon diode. The effective doping concentration and full depletion voltage decrease significantly with an increasing total ionizing dose, before starting to increase again at a specific dose. We assume that the initial decrease in the effective doping concentration is caused by the effect of acceptor removal. An additional notable finding of this study is that the bulk leakage current and C–V characteristics of the gamma-irradiated diodes do not show any evidence of an annealing effect.

Abstract Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital malformations that occur in adults and children, with differences in distribution and presentation. We present the case of a newborn who initiated respiratory distress from the first minutes of life, presenting with hypoventilation and rightward displacement of the cardiac impulse, requiring oxygen therapy and intubation. The first radiograph shows a left pulmonary emphysema. The computerized axial tomography revealed a large mediastinal mass causing an obstructive syndrome of the left bronchus. The mass was successfully excised, resulting in a favorable clinical evolution. Although the presentation of our case is exceptional, it is worth noting that while most bronchogenic cysts are asymptomatic, they can occur in childhood, even from birth, as in our case.

Giant evaporite deposits formed during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) in the Mediterranean Sea during the upper Miocene. The primary cause is a restricted Atlantic-Mediterranean connection, but the detailed hydroclimate evolution of this event is still a matter of debate. Here we reconstruct the triple oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of paleo brines from structurally bonded water in Messinian gypsum from Cyprus. A two-stage evaporation model is constructed to best approximate the hydrological conditions at which Messinian gypsum formed in marginal basins of the Mediterranean Sea. Subsequently, hydroclimatic parameters like paleo relative humidity (RH) are modelled using an iterative curve fitting isotope model approach. The results of our limited dataset reveal a slightly lower RH during the third compared to the second stage of the MSC. This apparent drop in RH is consistent with previous observations from the literature. Besides absolute values of RH, our model allows reconstructing the triple oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of the open Mediterranean Sea. This provides an estimate for the proportions of continental water vs. Atlantic seawater flowing into the basin, serving as a proxy for the size of the strait of Gibraltar. The model implies a continental water fraction of around 75–81 % both for the second and third stage of the MSC. In addition, we determined the 87Sr/86Sr of our samples to: i) confirm their stratigraphy; and ii) estimate the relative proportion of continental water vs. Atlantic seawater entering the Mediterranean using Sr mass balance calculations. The combined oxygen and Sr isotope records indicate a persistent connection to the Atlantic supporting the hypothesis that the striking drop in 87Sr/86Sr at the beginning of MSC stage 3 is mainly related to an increased contribution of continental water with low 87Sr/86Sr and high Sr concentrations from the Paratethys. Our results show that the combination of triple oxygen, hydrogen, and Sr isotope data provides a powerful tool to disentangle paleo-hydroclimate even in such complicated hydrological settings as the Mediterranean Sea during the MSC.

Abstract Rechargeable Li‐CO 2 batteries are considered as a promising carbon‐neutral energy storage technology owing to their ultra‐high energy density and efficient CO 2 capture capability. However, the sluggish CO 2 reduction/evolution kinetics impedes their practical application, which leads to huge overpotentials and poor cyclability. Multi‐element transit metal oxides (TMOs) are demonstrated as effective cathodic catalysts for Li‐CO 2 batteries. But there are no reports on the integration of defect engineering on multi‐element TMOs. Herein, the oxygen vacancy‐bearing Li‐Ni‐Co‐Mn multi‐oxide (Re‐NCM‐H3) catalyst with the α ‐NaFeO 2 ‐type structure is first fabricated by annealing the NiCoMn precursor that derived from spent ternary LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathode, in H 2 at 300 °C. As demonstrated by experimental results and theory calculations, the introduction of moderate oxygen vacancy has optimized electronic state near the Fermi level (E f ), eventually improving CO 2 adsorption and charge transfer. Therefore, the Li‐CO 2 batteries with Re‐NCM‐H3 catalyst deliver a high capacity (11808.9 mAh g −1 ), a lower overpotential (1.54 V), as well as excellent stability over 216 cycles at 100 mA g −1 and 165 cycles at 400 mA g −1 . This study not only opens up a sustainable application of spent ternary cathode, but also validates the potential of multi‐element TMO catalysts with oxygen defects for high‐efficiency Li‐CO 2 batteries.

The present study investigates the sparsely documented tribological performance of selective laser-melted Ti-6Al-4V over a wide range of temperatures (room temperature to 450 °C). The evolution of wear mechanism was traced by examining the phase changes, chemical composition, and morphology of wear tracks in the material. The native oxide layer developed on the surface of the material was found to mitigate adhesive wear during dry sliding at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, this oxide layer contributed to oxidative wear, as evidenced by the formation of a tribo-oxide layer with increased oxygen penetration. Further, abrasive wear was found to increase with increasing temperatures, which could be attributed to the presence of entrapped oxidized wear particles (third-body wear) and material softening.

The advent of FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) has brought forth a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, showcasing remarkable normal cell sparing effects with ultra-high dose rates (>40 Gy/s). This review delves into the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of FLASH effect, examining both physicochemical and biological hypotheses in cell biophysics. The physicochemical process encompasses oxygen depletion, reactive oxygen species, and free radical recombination. In parallel, the biological process explores the FLASH effect on the immune system and on blood vessels in treatment sites such as the brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. This review investigated the selective targeting of cancer cells and the modulation of the tumor microenvironment through FLASH-RT. Examining these mechanisms, we explore the implications and challenges of integrating FLASH-RT into cancer treatment. The potential to spare normal cells, boost the immune response, and modify the tumor vasculature offers new therapeutic strategies. Despite progress in understanding FLASH-RT, this review highlights knowledge gaps, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize its clinical applications. The synthesis of physicochemical and biological insights serves as a comprehensive resource for cell biology, molecular biology, and biophysics researchers and clinicians navigating the evolution of FLASH-RT in cancer therapy.

Due to the ever‐increasing demand for high‐quality steel and the need to reduce CO 2 emissions, research and development of sustainable steelmaking processes have gained a lot of interest in the past decade. One of these processes is the hydrogen plasma smelting reduction (HPSR), which has proven to be a promising solution for iron ore reduction where water vapor is formed instead of CO 2 . However, due to the highly dynamic and sometimes unpredictable behavior of plasmas and their nonlinear interaction with the liquid oxides, the monitoring and control of the underlying processes must be improved. This article explores the usage of optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and image analysis for HPSR process monitoring at laboratory and pilot scale. The results cover the time evolution of the OES and camera data with the focus on the most interesting radiating species, such as atomic hydrogen, iron, and oxygen together with the FeO molecule. In addition, the advantages, disadvantages, and requirements of these methods for HPSR process monitoring are discussed.

The utilization of NH3, a carbon-free hydrogen carrier, can be optimized through its co-combustion with solids. However, prior studies have primarily focused on coal as the solid fuel, which entails its consumption. Considering that hydrochar possesses abundant oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as high mass and energy density, it presents itself as a promising alternative solid fuel to coal, thereby decreasing dependence on fossil fuels. Therefore, this study investigates the co-combustion of different proportions of hydrochar, NH3, and O2. Molecular dynamic simulations using the ReaxFF MD method were conducted to investigate the impact of temperature on combustion by analyzing product distribution, evolution of bonds, and gas characteristic curves. Additionally, N migration was examined to elucidate the processes leading to the generation of N2 and NOx from NH3. The results showed that temperature facilitated the progression of combustion as the total number of molecules increased (from 2614 at 2000 K to 3137 at 2500 K) and variety of products expanded (from 48 at 2000 K to 69 at 2500 K) with increasing temperature. With increasing temperature, the descent rate of NH3 and oxygen accelerated, whereas the quantities of H2 and H2O increased. Furthermore, during combustion, hydrochar underwent three stages: initial coke formation, subsequent tar generation, and organic gas production. Second, during N migration, hydrochar directly or indirectly participated in the formation of N2. In this process, hydrochar indirectly contributed to the formation of NH and NH2 intermediates, leading to the formation of N2. In contrast, the majority of NO was formed through the direct decomposition of hydrochar. Finally, because of the limited quantity of generated NO2, N existed primarily in the form of N2 and NO. These findings provide theoretical guidance for the combustion of NH3 using hydrochar.

Abstract Gondwana developed marine platforms at its northern edge with Paleozoic deposits reflecting varied paleoclimatic conditions. In the northwestern (NW) Iberian Peninsula (NW Gondwana), Ordovician black-grey shales and sandstones were deposited in these platforms at southern polar latitudes. The current research contributes to a better understanding of the recycling, climate, and redox conditions during the deposition of black-grey shales in the low/mid-Ordovician period. During the Lower-Middle Ordovician period, the black-grey shales recorded an increase in recycling (Th/Sc, Zr/Sc, Zr/Ti, La/Th), low level of chemical alteration (CIA, Th/U) and relatively low oxygen conditions (Ce/Ce*, Y/Ho). These data indicate arid-cold conditions with a seasonal glacial-periglacial environment, consistent with the location of the NW Iberian Peninsula at low latitudes close to the South Pole. Towards the Middle Ordovician, the black-grey shales recorded a more temperate climate with higher levels of chemical alteration, less recycling, and a relatively more oxygenated environment, what suggests a transition to a moderate climate with no glacial events developed. This climate evolution could have been promoted by the progressive Gondwana drift away from the south pole aided by CO2 input to the atmosphere from alkaline mafic intraplate volcanism linked with a previous felsic LIP event in this area. The rapid decline of this volcanism and the partial alteration of its products (fixing CO2) could have contributed to the development of the Hirnantian glacial conditions during the Upper Ordovician, which brings a new view of the secular climatic evolution of the Earth during the Ordovician.

Earth-abundant and effective electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting process have seen an exceptional rise in research over the past few years. Among these, synthesis of active, long-lasting materials that act as bifunctional electrocatalysts in an alkaline environment is a crucial step for the development of perovskite-based electrocatalysts. Herein, perovskite type BaNi1-xCoxO3; x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5; prepared by economic solution combustion method is reported with regard to its oxygen and hydrogen evolution activity in 1.0 M KOH. The benchmark current density of 10 mAcm−2 was reached by BaNi0.7Co0.3O3 (BC3) with the lowest overpotential of 279 mV and 419 mV for OER and HER respectively. Furthermore, BC3 showed a phenomenal bifunctional electrocatalytic property with an overall cell voltage of 1.98 V at 10 mAcm−2 in a two-electrode system. A gain by 92 mV in overall electrocatalytic activity of BC3 was recorded after 24 h of constant splitting of water at 30 mAcm−2 makes it an interesting bifunctional electrocatalyst best suited for large scale hydrogen production through water electrolyser.

Completely achieving spontaneous water splitting without sacrificing co-catalysts poses a significant challenge, as factors such as electrical, optical, and catalytic activity can limit the conversion efficiency of solar energy to hydrogen. Herein, we propose a type-II van der Waals heterostructure composed of vertically stacked AlO and WSi2N4, and systematically investigate its mechanism and potential for catalyzing water splitting. Photon-induced photocatalytic water splitting takes advantage of the staggered energy bands of the heterojunction, effectively promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers and thus enhancing catalytic efficiency. In neutral water environment, the band edge position of AlO/WSi2N4 aligns with the redox potential required for water decomposition. Thermodynamic analysis of the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions indicates that the external potential provided by photogenerated carriers is expected to trigger spontaneous water decomposition. Moreover, with its high electron mobility (4800.62 cm2/Vs) and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of up to 19.98 %, the AlO/WSi2N4 heterojunction demonstrates substantial potential as a photoelectric catalyst. This research introduces a promising avenue for efficient photocatalytic production of clean energy.

Nanostructured hybrids that combine metals and semiconductors exhibit significant potential as photocatalysts for various reactions. Among these, core–shell plasmonic noble metal–semiconductor nanostructures, such as Au/ZnO nanostars (NSs), are highly effective catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting. This study presents a simple method for synthesizing Au/ZnO NSs and comprehensively characterizes them by using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The synthesized Au/ZnO NSs exhibit very high efficiencies in hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution when used as a catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting. This heightened photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the efficient suppression of the scavenging activity of Au nanoparticles. Additionally, the anisotropic star-shaped morphology of the Au component in the catalyst contributes to an increased surface area that promotes an enhanced interaction between the catalyst's components. This interaction facilitates facile interfacial charge transfer at the interface, resulting in an improved performance. Moreover, the plasmonic response of the Au core surrounded by ZnO nanostructures enhances the catalyst's light utilization capability, contributing to its superior performance. This synthesis method represents a significant advancement and paves the way for future developments in the design of plasmon-semiconductor nanostructures for energy conversion applications.

Composite oxides have been widely applied in the hydrogenation of CO/CO2 to methanol or as the component of bifunctional oxide–zeolite for the synthesis of hydrocarbon chemicals. However, it is still challenging to disentangle the stepwise formation mechanism of CH3OH at working conditions and selectively convert CO2 to hydrocarbon chemicals with narrow distribution. Here, we investigate the reaction network of the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol over a series of spinel oxides (AB2O4), among which the Zn-based nanostructures offer superior performance in methanol synthesis. Through a series of (quasi) in situ spectroscopic characterizations, we evidence that the dissociation of H2 tends to follow a heterolytic pathway and that hydrogenation ability can be regulated by the combination of Zn with Ga or Al. The coordinatively unsaturated metal sites over ZnAl2Ox and ZnGa2Ox originating from oxygen vacancies (OVs) are evidenced to be responsible for the dissociative adsorption and activation of CO2. The evolution of the reaction intermediates, including both carbonaceous and hydrogen species at high temperatures and pressures over the spinel oxides, has been experimentally elaborated at the atomic level. With the integration of a series of zeolites or zeotypes, high selectivities of hydrocarbon chemicals with narrow distributions can be directly produced from CO2 and H2, offering a promising route for CO2 utilization.

Advances in material fabrication techniques and growth methods have opened up a new chapter for twistronics, in the form of twisted freestanding three-dimensional material membranes. Through first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we investigate the crystal and electronic structures of twisted bilayer BaTiO$_3$. Our findings reveal that large stacking fault energy leads to chiral in-plane vortex pattern that was recently observed in experiments. Moreover, we also found non-zero out-of-plane local dipole moments, indicating that the strong interlayer interaction might offer promising strategy to stabilize ferroelectric order in the two-dimensional limit. Remarkably, the vortex pattern in the twisted BaTiO$_3$ bilayer support localized electronic states with quasi-flat bands, associated with the interlayer hybridization of oxygen $p_z$ orbitals. We found that the associated band width reaches a minimum at $\sim$19$^{\circ}$ twisting, configuring the largest magic angle in moir\'e systems reported so far. Further, the moir\'e vortex pattern bears a striking resemblance to two interpenetrating Lieb lattices and corresponding tight-binding model provides a comprehensive description of the evolution the moir\'e bands with twist angle and reveals the topological nature of these states.

Abstract Atom‐site catalysts, especially for graphitic carbon nitride‐based catalysts, represents one of the most promising candidates in catalysis membrane for water decontamination. However, unravelling the intricate relationships between synthesis‐structure‐properties remains a great challenge. This study addressed the impacts of coordination environment and structure units of metal central sites based on Mantel test, correlation analysis and evolution of metal central sites. An optimized unconventional oxygen doping cooperated with Co‐N‐Fe dual‐sites (OCN Co/Fe) exhibited synergistic mechanism for efficient peroxymonosulfate activation, which benefited from a significant increase in charge density at the active sites and the regulation in the natural population of orbitals, leading to selective generation of SO 4 •− . Building upon these findings, the OCN‐Co/Fe/PVDF composite membrane demonstrated a 33 min −1 ciprofloxacin (CIP) rejection efficiency and maintained over 96% CIP removal efficiency (over 24 h) with an average permeance of 130.95 L m −2 h −1 . Our work offers a fundamental guide for elucidating the definitive origin of catalytic performance in advance oxidation process (AOPs) to facilitate the rational design of separation catalysis membrane with improved performance and enhanced stability.

The molecules of 3,8-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (L1), 3,8-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (L2), 3,8-di(naphthalen-2-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (L3), 3,8-di(anthracen-9-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (L4) and 3,8-di(pyren-1-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (L5) were prepared in good yield from the reaction of 3,8-dibromo-1,10-phenanthroline and the corresponding boronic acid catalyzed by [Pd(PPh3)4]. Computational DFT modelling suggest than the aromatic substituent arms are not coplanar with the central phenanthroline core, and that the HOMO-LUMO gap diminishes as the number of fused carbon rings in the arms increased. Cyclic voltammograms for the ligands show between one and two oxidation and one to three reduction waves, which are believed to be centered on the arms and the central phen fragments respectively, suggesting some small electronic mixing. The absorption and emission properties depend on the electronic interaction between the polyaromatic substituents and the phenanthroline core. Different emissive ππ* excited states for the molecules bearing anthryl and pyrenyl substituents conferring them a more charge transfer character, and a consequent major sensitive to the increase of solvent polarity. The photosensitizing capacity of singlet oxygen generation upon excitation of L1-L5 in solution is consistent with a significant evolution of the former singlet excited state towards a triplet excited state.

Abstract We report a solution-based approach for the synthesis of oxidation-free MoS2 films, focusing on interface mechanisms. Through a sulfurization-free solution process and single-step annealing, the oxidation-free MoS2 film is successfully prepared on Si3N4 surfaces, showing improved uniformity with a surface roughness below 0.5 nm and a thickness of 4 nm at a precursor solution concentration of 30 mM, annealed between 700 and 800ºC. The MoS2 films exhibit a hexagonal lattice structure with crystallographic orientations of (1 1 0 0) and (1 2 1 0) with lattice spacings of 0.27 nm and 0.16 nm respectively. Interfacial analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on SiO2 reveals migration of oxygen species as evidenced by a shift in the Si 2p spectrum at binding energies between 102.6eV and 102.8eV. MoS2 films on Si3N4 show a complex Si 2p peak evolution at binding energies between 100.9 and 101.8 eV, providing valuable insights into the synthesis of oxide-free MoS2 films for potential applications in advanced electronic devices.

Mixing length scales for methane–oxygen shear-coaxial single-element rocket injectors were experimentally assessed using laser absorption tomography. The laser spectroscopy technique enables quantitative and spatially resolved measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and temperature within the near-field region, probing rovibrational absorption lines of CO near [Formula: see text]. Multiple injector designs were examined with differing oxidizer post recess depths to compare mixing characteristics. All tests were performed at an oxidizer-to-fuel ratio of 3 with a total propellant flow rate of 0.350 g/s. Planar measurements were taken at 16 axial positions, which collectively captured the first 57 mm of each flame. A tomographic inversion method was applied to obtain radially resolved distributions of temperature and CO mole fraction for each axial position, from which two-dimensional images of the thermochemical structure were generated. Characteristic mixing parameters are defined and extracted from features within the species and temperature profiles to visualize the spatial evolution of CO production. Increasing oxidizer post recess improved mixing due to enhanced shear-induced turbulence and associated radial diffusion of species and temperature; however, the enhancement was nonlinear. This work establishes the first use of laser absorption tomography to directly measure mixing length scales associated with temperature and species profiles in coaxial flames.

Abstract Lespedeza potaninii, a xerophytic subshrub belonging to the legume family, is native to the Tengger Desert and is highly adapted to drought. It has important ecological value due to its drought adaptability, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report a 1.24 Gb chromosome-scale assembly of the L. potaninii genome (contig N50=15.75 Mb). Our results indicate that L. potaninii underwent an allopolyploid event with two subgenomes, A and B, presenting asymmetric evolution and B subgenome dominance. We estimate that the two diploid progenitors of L. potaninii diverged around 3.6 MYA and merged around 1.0 MYA. We revealed that the expansion of hub genes associated with drought responses, such as the binding partner 1 of accelerated cell death 11 (ACD11) (BPA1), facilitated environmental adaptations of L. potaninii to desert habitats. We found a novel function of the BPA1 family in abiotic stress tolerance in addition to the known role in regulating the plant immune response, which could improve drought tolerance by positively regulating reactive oxygen species homeostasis in plants. We revealed that bZIP transcription factors could bind to the BPA1 promoter and activate its transcription. Our work fills the genomic data gap in the Lespedeza genus and the tribe Desmodieae, which should provide both theoretical support in the study of drought tolerance and in the molecular breeding of legume crops.

Abstract A 65–year–old male with renal cell carcinoma, previously treated with nephrectomy and recently diagnosed with lung metastases, presented to the cardiology clinic for investigations before starting chemotherapy. He reported a history of ischemic heart disease, a non–ST–elevation myocardial infarction for which he refused coronary angiography in 2005, and a negative maximal stress test for ischemia in 2017. Additionally, the patient reported insulin–dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and well–controlled arterial hypertension. The patient was referred for a cardiological evaluation due to a reported short–term rhythmic heartbeat without other cardiological symptoms. Cardiological parameters were stable (blood pressure: 140/95 mmHg; heart rate: 42 bpm, and oxygen saturation without oxygen supplementation: 98%). Physical examination was normal. Laboratory investigations did not show elevated levels of high–sensitivity troponin I, and only signs of mild chronic kidney disease were observed. The initial ECG showed sinus bradycardia with deeply inverted T–waves in the extended anterior area (Fig. 1), which were not present in an ECG performed one month earlier. There was no reported chest pain. An echocardiogram examination demonstrated hypertensive heart disease with marked hypokinesia of the mid–apical portion of the anterior wall and anterior interventricular septum, together with a moderate reduction in global systolic function (LV ejection fraction: 40%). The patient was hospitalized, and underwent coronary angiography the following day. He had a low–risk score (GRACE: 95 pts) As shown in Fig. 2, there was evidence of long sub–occlusive stenosis of the proximal part of the anterior descending coronary artery that was treated with angioplasty and a single drug–eluted stent placement, resulting in a good angiographic result. After the procedure, there was a rapid recovery of regional kinetics but a slower normalization of the electrocardiographic morphology (Fig. 3). Comment Wellens‘ syndrome identifies a particular subtype of unstable angina characterized by the appearance of ischemic changes on the ECG,. The clinical risk assessment of this subgroup of patients with ACS, apparently having a more benign prognosis due to their definition as unstable angina with a low GRACE risk score, potentially has an evolution toward a large myocardial infarction if not promptly diagnosed.

Irradiation of CeO2 with heavy ions is commonly used to accelerate the evaluation of the irradiation performance of UO2 nuclear fuel. However, the differences in damage rates between ions and neutrons have led to doubts about this method, making it especially important to study the dose rate effect. Here, two kinds of dose rates were used to in-situ irradiate CeO2 using 400 keV Kr+ at 550 °C and 700 °C to study the dose rate effect on loop characteristics. High dose rate (HR) led to low-density and small-sized dislocation loops compared to low dose rate (LR), which was attributed to the initial high concentration of oxygen vacancies and enhanced recombination of point defects. HR was found to promote the direct nucleation of perfect dislocation loops (PDLs), while under LR irradiation, the PDLs tended to be formed by the transformation of Frank dislocation loops (FDLs) through a typical unfaulting. At a same dose, the proportion of PDL under HR condition was much higher than that under LR condition. Temperature greatly affected the loop characteristics. High temperature caused large sized and small dense loops, as well as high PDL proportion. Moreover, the newly nucleated PDL tended to close to the pre-existing PDLs and had the same Burgers vector as the adjacent PDL under HR irradiation at 700 °C. Current results provide underlying insights for assessing the effect of dose rate on irradiation-induced loop evolution and a reference for understanding the dose rate effect.

With the rapid development of high-speed aircraft, the demanding for light, strong, reliable and high temperature resistive thermal protection material (TPM) is becoming urgent. High temperature material interface, such as silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic matrix composite, has received strong interest recently due to its high mechanical and thermochemical stability. For reactive interface development with nano-roughness under extremely hyperthermal non-equilibrium flow conditions for TPM applications, however, has not been reported yet. This work performs a systematic reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) study of the SiC surface morphology effect withstanding hyperthermal atomic oxygen (AO) impact via a gas–solid interface reaction model. The results show that a self-healing trend of the defect-rich silicon carbide surface with original nano-roughness is revealed towards a flatter interface accompanying with the oxidation process. The surface catalytic recombination coefficient is more sensitivity to the surface defects when wall temperature Tw > 500 K. Nano-roughness structure can also vary the main thermochemical reaction path at the thermochemical reactive interface: For the nano-groove surface model, the thermal oxidation reaction becomes dominant, while more pronounced surface catalytic recombination characteristics are revealed for the flat surface model. The mechanisms of roughness effect, surface temperature and gas impacting angle on the surface catalytic recombination, surface oxidation, and interface evolution are revealed, which advance our microscopic understanding of SiC interfacial performance with nano-roughness under non-equilibrium flow conditions.

Abstract. A tipping point is defined by the IPCC as a critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly. Tipping points can be crossed solely by internal variation in the system or by approaching a bifurcation point where the current state loses stability and forces the system to move to another stable state. It is currently debated whether or not Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, abrupt warmings occurring during the last glacial period, are noise-induced or caused by the system reaching a bifurcation point. It can be shown that before a bifurcation point is reached there are observable changes in the statistical properties of the state variable. These are known as early warning signals and include increased fluctuation and correlation time. To express this behaviour we propose a new model based on the well-known first order autoregressive process (AR), with modifications to the correlation parameter such that it depends linearly on time. In order to estimate the time evolution of the correlation parameter we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework, from which Bayesian analysis can be performed using the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. We then apply the model to segments of the oxygen isotope ratios from the Northern Greenland Ice Core Project record corresponding to 17 DO events. Early warning signals were detected and found statistically significant for a number of DO events, suggesting that such events could indeed be caused by approaching a bifurcation point. The methodology developed to perform the given early warning analyses can be applied more generally, and is publicly available as the R-package INLA.ews.

This study investigated the effects of varied loadings of TiO2 overlayers in heterojunction with conventional Ir0.7Ta0.3Ox (IrTaOx) anodes on chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) and real (waste)water treatment at circum-neutral pH. With an optimized design of IrTaOx/TiO2, elevated ClER selectivity was attained by more facile chemisorption of chloride ions to a thin TiO2 layer on IrTaOx. The current efficiency (CE) of ClER in galvanostatic electrolysis of 50 mM NaCl solutions (at 30 mA cm–2) was maximized to ∼80% by a heterojunction architecture with ∼605 μg cm–2 of IrTaOx and ∼265 μg cm–2 of TiO2 after specific rounds of drop casting. Further increases in loading resulted in escalated film-pore resistance or deterioration of ClER selectivity. The observed CE values were correlated with experimental descriptors, such as potential of zero charge and flat band potential, demonstrating that the weaker metal–oxygen bond strength on TiO2 could enhance the ClER selectivity compared to bare IrTaOx. We concluded that ClER primarily occurs on TiO2 near the junction owing to the nanoporous nature of the TiO2 layer, while IrTaOx serves as ohmic contact. The optimized IrTaOx/TiO2 anodes effectively improved the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate, but phosphate ions in livestock wastewater caused adverse effects due to complexation on TiO2. The heterojunction architecture effectively tunes the surface charge density for selective generation of oxidants, which can facilitate electrochemical water treatment with reduced use of the precious metals.

The work investigates the deposition of zinc and oxygen atoms on a Zinc terminated ZnO substrate, maintaining their stoichiometric ratio (O:Zn) at 0.8, under varying incident energies (0.5 eV and 5 eV) and temperatures (300 K and 700 K) using the ReaxFF potential in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. The study explores the impact of deposition conditions on growth mechanisms, film morphology, and structural parameters such as Radial Distribution Function (RDF) and Coordination Number (CN). RDF analysis highlights disordered atomic arrangements and diverse bonding configurations within the film, with CN showing deviations from perfect crystalline ZnO, indicating non-uniform, non-crystalline, and nano behaviour. Post-heating the films to temperatures approaching the ZnO melting point results in enhanced crystallinity, as evidenced by distinct, dominant, and multiple RDF peaks. Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach of the deposited structures elucidates the formation of ZnO nanoclusters-(ZnO)3 and (ZnO)4 and investigates their electronic structure properties. DFT analysis of the post-heated films reveals the formation of ZnO monomers (ZnO), indicating an approaching crystalline behaviour, yet the films exhibit non-epitaxial and non-uniform characteristics. DFT calculations were instrumental in validating the observed structural behaviours in the deposited films. The study underscores the significance of stoichiometric ratio in film deposition and demonstrates the temperature-dependent evolution of structural properties towards crystallinity, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of ZnO film growth offering tailored control over film properties for enhanced performance in practical applications such as optoelectronics and gas sensing.

Studies have determined that nonredox enzymes that are cofactored with Fe(II) are the most oxidant-sensitive targets inside Escherichia coli . These enzymes use Fe(II) cofactors to bind and activate substrates. Because of their solvent exposure, the metal can be accessed and oxidized by reactive oxygen species, thereby inactivating the enzyme. Because these enzymes participate in key physiological processes, the consequences of stress can be severe. Accordingly, when E. coli senses elevated levels of H 2 O 2 , it induces both a miniferritin and a manganese importer, enabling the replacement of the iron atom in these enzymes with manganese. Manganese does not react with H 2 O 2 and thereby preserves enzyme activity. In this study, we examined several diverse microbes to identify the metal that they customarily integrate into ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase, a representative of this enzyme family. The anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , like E. coli , uses iron. In contrast, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis use manganese, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae uses zinc. The latter organisms are therefore well suited to the oxidizing environments in which they dwell. Similar results were obtained with peptide deformylase, another essential enzyme of the mononuclear class. Strikingly, heterologous expression experiments show that it is the metal pool within the organism, rather than features of the protein itself, that determine which metal is incorporated. Further, regardless of the source organism, each enzyme exhibits highest turnover with iron and lowest turnover with zinc. We infer that the intrinsic catalytic properties of the metal cannot easily be retuned by evolution of the polypeptide.

Abstract This study explores the low‐temperature pyrolysis kinetic of low metamorphic grade coal from Northern Shaanxi, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy to analyze the characteristics of various functional groups over a 293–1023 K temperature range. A kinetic model, correlating with the pyrolysis behaviors of these groups, was developed through thermal analysis kinetics. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology simulated the furnace's flow dynamics, allowing an examination of the physical field alterations and functional group evolution during pyrolysis. Results showed that the pyrolysis kinetic functions for aromatic C–H, C=C, C–O, and •OH, along with temperature, pressure, and velocity fields, were successfully integrated into the simulation. This integration provided detailed insights into the temperature profile, pressure distribution, flow velocities, and functional group distribution in the furnace. Aliphatics, exhibiting the largest mass fraction and wide pyrolysis temperature range, and •OH radicals with the highest activation energy were concentrated in the furnace's pyrolysis zone center. C=C's distribution was influenced by aromatic C–H and aliphatics, showing a complementary pattern. The oxygen‐containing groups C–O and C=O had similar pyrolysis mechanisms and uniform distribution. The functional groups' mass fractions were ranked from highest to lowest as follows: aliphatics > •OH > aromatic C–H > C–O > C=C > C=O.

Depletion of microbiota increases susceptibility to gastrointestinal colonization and subsequent infection by opportunistic pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). How the absence of gut microbiota impacts the evolution of MRSA is unknown. The present report used germ-free mice to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of MRSA in the absence of gut microbiota. Through genomic analyses and competition assays, we found that MRSA adapts to the microbiota-free gut through sequential genetic mutations and structural changes that enhance fitness. Initially, these adaptations increase carbohydrate transport; subsequently, evolutionary pathways largely diverge to enhance either arginine metabolism or cell wall biosynthesis. Increased fitness in arginine pathway mutants depended on arginine catabolic genes, especially nos and arcC, which promote microaerobic respiration and ATP generation, respectively. Thus, arginine adaptation likely improves redox balance and energy production in the oxygen-limited gut environment. Findings were supported by human gut metagenomic analyses, which suggest the influence of arginine metabolism on colonization. Surprisingly, these adaptive genetic changes often reduced MRSA's antimicrobial resistance and virulence. Furthermore, resistance mutation, typically associated with decreased virulence, also reduced colonization fitness, indicating evolutionary trade-offs among these traits. The presence of normal microbiota inhibited these adaptations, preserving MRSA's wild-type characteristics that effectively balance virulence, resistance, and colonization fitness. The results highlight the protective role of gut microbiota in preserving a balance of key MRSA traits for long-term ecological success in commensal populations, underscoring the potential consequences on MRSA's survival and fitness during and after host hospitalization and antimicrobial treatment.

The observation of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) associated with a supernova (SN) coincides remarkably with the energy output from a binary system comprising a very massive carbon-oxygen (CO) core and an associated binary neutron star (NS) by the Binary-Driven Hypernova (BdHN) model. The dragging effect in the late evolution of such systems leads to co-rotation, with binary periods on the order of minutes, resulting in a very fast rotating core and a binary NS companion at a distance of $\sim 10^5$ km. Such a fast-rotating CO core, stripped of its hydrogen and helium, undergoes gravitational collapse and, within a fraction of seconds, leads to a supernova (SN) and a newly born, fast-spinning neutron star ($\nu$NS), we name the emergence of the SN and the $\nu$NS as the SN-rise and $\nu$NS-rise. Typically, the SN energies range from $10^{51}$ to $10^{53}$ erg. We address this issue by examining 10 cases of Type-I BdHNe, the most energetic ones, in which SN accretion onto the companion NS leads to the formation of a black hole (BH). In all ten cases, the energetics of the SN events are estimated, ranging between $0.18$ and $12 \times 10^{52}$ erg. Additionally, in all 8 sources at redshift $z$ closer than $4.61$, a clear thermal blackbody component has been identified, with temperatures between $6.2$ and $39.99$ keV, as a possible signature of pair-driven SN. The triggering of the X-ray afterglow induced by the $\nu$NS-rise are identified in three cases at high redshift where early X-ray observations are achievable, benefits from the interplay of cosmological effects.

A magma ocean (MO) is thought to be a ubiquitous stage in the early evolution of rocky planets and exoplanets. During the lifetime of the MO, exchanges between the interior and exterior envelopes of the planet are very efficient. In particular, volatile elements that initially are contained in the solid part of the planet can be released and form a secondary outgassed atmosphere. We determine trends in the H-C-N-O-S composition and thickness of these secondary atmospheres for varying planetary sizes and MO extents, and the oxygen fugacity of MOs, which provides the main control for the atmospheric chemistry. We used a model with coupled chemical gas-gas and silicate melt-gas equilibria and mass conservation to predict the composition of an atmosphere at equilibrium with the MO depending on the planet size and the extent and redox state of the MO. We used a self-consistent mass-radius model for the rocky core to inform the structure of the planet, which we combined with an atmosphere model to predict the transit radius of lava worlds. We find that MOs (especially the shallow ones) on small planets are generally more reduced, and are thus dominated by H2-rich atmospheres (whose outgassing is strengthened at low planetary mass), while larger planets and deeper MOs vary from CO to CO2-N2-SO2 atmospheres, with increasing fO2 . In the former case, the low molecular mass of the atmosphere combined with the low gravity of the planets yields a large vertical extension of the atmosphere, while in the latter cases, secondary outgassed atmospheres on super-Earths are likely significantly shrunk. Both N and C are largely outgassed regardless of the conditions, while the S and H outgassing is strongly dependent on the fO2 , as well as on the planetary mass and MO extent for the latter.

We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of $\sim$20 au that straddles the L/T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 $\pm$ 3 km/s and water plus carbon monoxide mass fractions of log CO = $-$2.3 $\pm$ 0.3 and log H$_2$O = $-$2.7 $\pm$ 0.2. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 $\pm$ 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L/T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high $v\sin{i}$ and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures we are sensitive to. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation over break-up velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of >200 very low-mass objects (M$\lesssim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated field low-mass objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.

Abstract We use the extensive stellar occultation data set of the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph aboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft to determine the first quantification of vertical variation in O 2 mole fraction separately for day and night in the ∼90–130 km altitude range. The upper atmospheric O 2 variation is expected to be due to the interplay between diffusion and advection because of its long photochemical lifetime. It is therefore a useful tracer of the state of atmospheric mixing and circulation. The altitude‐averaged mixing ratio is measured to be 2.69(±0.03) × 10 −3 for the nightside and 2.05(±0.03) × 10 −3 for the dayside. The average O 2 mole fraction for day and night are nearly identical below 105 km, consistent with the value of 1.61 × 10 −3 derived from the Mars Curiosity Rover/Sample Analysis at Mars near‐surface measurements. At higher altitudes, dominated by molecular diffusive separation, the measured O 2 mole fraction demonstrates a vertical gradient with a local time dependence. The nightside mole fraction is a factor of 1.37 ± 0.04 larger than the dayside value at ∼125 km. This nightside enhancement is explained in terms of the relative role of solar‐driven rapid horizontal winds at high altitudes and slower vertical diffusion, resulting in a nightside (dayside) downward (upward) diffusive flux. Using the 1‐D diffusion model, the measured profiles correspond to a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient K = 3.5(±1.5) × 10 6 cm 2 / s . The Mars Climate Database predicts comparable but lower day‐night differences in oxygen mole fraction due to an overestimated K = 7.0(±1.0) × 10 6 cm 2 / s , which affects atmospheric mixing as well as the rate of atmospheric escape to space.

Abstract Male, 79 years old, presented to the ED with chest pain and hemodynamically instability. Approximately one month prior, he underwent aortic bioprosthesis implantation for severe aortic stenosis. Pre–intervention coronary angiography revealed diffuse atheromatous plaques, none of which were stenotic. Additionally, the patient‘s medical history included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on NOAC, hypertension and COPD. Upon admission: NIBP 80/50 mmHg, HR 150 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 85%. ECG showed atrial fibrillation with ST–segment elevation from V1 to V5. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.25 and lactate 6 mmol/L. He received inotropic and vasopressor support, and prompt coronary angiography was performed, revealing 99% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery at the bifurcation with the diagonal branch, which was treated with angioplasty and coronary stent placement (Fig.1). Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated the presence of the aortic bioprosthesis with diffusely thickened leaflets consistent with multiple vegetations. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed a nosocomial infectious endocarditis, with mild–to–moderate stenosis, and evidence of peri–prosthetic echogenic material directed towards the left atrium, suggestive of abscess. The patient reported low–grade fever and asthenia in the weeks prior. The systemic and local inflammatory state of the endocarditis contributed to an accelerated atherosclerotic process, destabilizing the plaque and resulting in its rupture. Blood cultures identified multidrug–resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus, for which specific antibiotic therapy was started. The patient and his family declined cardiac surgery due to high operative risk. Follow–up TEE, after approximately six weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy, showed reduced vegetations on the bioprosthetic valve leaflets, with evolution of the previously noted large echolucent cavity, along with two similar peri–prosthetic lesions. These findings were confirmed on contrast–enhanced CT. The patient, achieving hemodynamic stability, was discharged home, continuing intravenous antibiotic therapy (OPAT protocol). At the one–month post–discharge follow–up, the patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. A repeat TEE showed normally mobile bioprosthetic valve leaflets without vegetations, and the previously noted large cavity with internal flow, consistent with cleansed abscess (Fig.2–3).
