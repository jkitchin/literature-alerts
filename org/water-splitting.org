Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to the water splitting and CO 2 reduction reactions, while this reaction is kinetically sluggish and demands the efficient electrocatalyst. Transition metal selenides (TMSes) have gained greater attention as nonprecious metal‐based electrocatalysts due to their low cost, earth abundance, and high efficiency. Typically, TMSe can exhibit superior OER activity to their counterparts such as hydroxides/oxyhydroxides and sulfides. As such, their unique way to boost the catalytic activity is intriguing to researchers and many studies have been recently carried out. The last decades have witnessed the rapid development of TMSe‐based electrocatalysts in design and preparation for OER. However, there is still no exclusive review summarizing the recent development of this material for OER electrocatalysis. Herein, this article underscores the significant promise of TMSes in advancing the field of high‐performance OER electrocatalysts. The research progress is summarized and the importance of strategies to improve the performance of selenide electrodes including multimetal composite, hybrid composite with carbonaceous materials, morphological engineering, heterostructure engineering, and vacancies engineering is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and opportunities concerning the improvement of TMSe electrocatalysts are outlined, which are essential for their further application in electrochemical energy conversion.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of hydrogen adsorption on titanium nitride had previously shown that hydrogen may adsorb on both titanium and nitrogen sites with a moderate adsorption energy. Further, the diffusion barrier was also found to be low. These findings may qualify TiN, a versatile multifunctional material with electronic conductivity, as electrode material for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This was the main impetus of this work which aims to experimentally and theoretically investigate the electrocatalytic properties of TiN-layers that were processed on Ti substrate using reactive ion sputtering. The properties are discussed focusing on the role of oxygen defects introduced during the sputtering process on the HER. Based on DFT calculations, it is shown that these oxygen defects alter the electronic environment of the Ti atoms which entails a low hydrogen adsorption energy in the range of -0.1 eV; this leads to HER performances that match those of Pt-NPs in acidic media. When a few nanometr thick layer of Pd-NPs is sputtered on-top of the TiN-layer, the performance is drastically reduced. This is interpreted in terms of oxygen defects being scavenged by the Pd-NPs near the surface which is thought to reduce the hydrogen adsorption sites.

Water splitting is an important way to obtain hydrogen applied in clean energy, which mainly consists of two half-reactions: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the kinetics of the OER of water splitting, which occurs at the anode, is slow and inefficient, especially in acid. Currently, the main OER catalysts are still based on noble metals, such as Ir and Ru, which are the main active components. Hence, the exploration of new OER catalysts with low cost, high activity, and stability has become a key issue in the research of electrolytic water hydrogen production technology. In this paper, the reaction mechanism of OER in acid was discussed and summarized, and the main methods to improve the activity and stability of non-noble metal OER catalysts were summarized and categorized. Finally, the future prospects of OER catalysts in acid were made to provide a little reference idea for the development of advanced OER catalysts in acid in the future.

Abstract This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance– surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR–SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1–13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied here to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2–7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions— lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency—showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.

The composition and crystal structure are crucial parameters for the activity and stability of the electrocatalysts. Herein, we synthesize a series of CoxNi–B oxide nanosheets with low degree of crystallinity for alkaline media oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The sample with an optimized ratio Co8Ni–B oxide shows the best OER performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 312 mV and a Tafel slope of 47 mV/dec in the 1 M KOH electrolyte. This sample is stable in the purified Fe-free KOH electrolyte and strongly activated in the nonpurified commercial electrolyte due to the Fe impurity uptake. The high surface area and partially crystalline structure caused by boron incorporation and low-temperature treatment provide more accessible active sites with retaining good stability against leaching during the OER. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy investigation reveals the formation of OER active Co and Ni oxyhydroxides in Co8Ni–B oxides under a potential bias. The Ni substitution in Co oxides modulates the electronic structure of Co, and the OER activity of the electrocatalyst can be enhanced by Fe uptake from the KOH electrolyte.

Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising route for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high overpotential of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction poses significant challenge. SrIrO 3 -based perovskite-type catalysts have shown great potential for acidic oxygen evolution reaction, but the origins of their high activity are still unclear. Herein, we develop a Co-doped SrIrO 3 system to enhance oxygen evolution reaction activity and elucidate the origin of catalytic activity. In situ experiments reveal Co activates surface lattice oxygen, rapidly exposing IrO x active sites, while bulk Co doping optimizes the adsorbate binding energy of IrO x . The Co-doped SrIrO 3 demonstrates high oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity, markedly surpassing the commercial IrO 2 catalysts in both conventional electrolyzer and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.

Modification of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is recently under the spotlight due to their versatile properties and potential applications in electrochemical catalysis. Here, we successfully demonstrate nitrogen doping into the MOF electrocatalyst without noble metals using a facile, tunable ion beam sputtering (IBS) process for the first time and evaluate the role of the incorporated heteroatom. Two-dimensional Ni-naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid MOF (NiNDC) with large surface area was subjected to nitrogen IBS (NIBS) and exhibited significantly improved performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 222 mV at 10 mA cm−2; a Tafel slope of 88 mV dec-1; and over 120 h of stability at 100 mA cm−2. The relationship between the nitrogen functionalities and catalytic activity was elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, i.e., (i) pyridinic N as an electron-withdrawing group that directly enhances the reaction kinetics, (ii) pyrrolic N to stabilize the catalyst and (iii) graphitic N to enhance the electrical conductivity. We found that the electrocatalytic performance was affected by the ratio of the three nitrogen species, which was controllable by the accelerating potential (AP) of NIBS. This study provides insights into the influence of the chemical state of MOF surfaces on catalytic reactions and presents a novel method for effective nitrogen doping.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process for sustainable energy, although renewable sources require the use of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, with IrO 2 -based materials being the gold standard due to their high activity and stability under dynamic anodic polarization conditions. However, even for the (110) facet of a single-crystalline IrO 2 model electrode, the reaction mechanism is not settled yet due to contradictory reports in literature. In the present manuscript, we disentangle the conflicting results of previous theoretical studies in the density functional theory approximation. We demonstrate that dissimilar reaction mechanisms and limiting steps for the OER over IrO 2 (110) are obtained for different active surface configurations present on the IrO 2 electrode. In contrast to previous studies, we factor Walden-type mechanisms, in which the formation of the product O 2 and adsorption of the reactant H 2 O occur simultaneously, into the analysis of the elementary steps. Combining free-energy diagrams along the reaction coordinate and Bader charge analysis of the active site under constant potential, we elucidate why mononuclear- or bifunctional-Walden pathways excel the traditional OER mechanisms for the OER over IrO 2 (110). Our computational methodology to identify the reaction mechanism and limiting step of proton-coupled electron transfer steps is universally applicable to electrochemical processes in the field of energy conversion and storage.

Abstract Developing highly active and stable electrocatalysts is essential for the large‐scale production of hydrogen from alkaline water. In this work, Ag single atoms and nanoparticles co‐decorated Co hydro(oxy)oxide (Ag SAs&NPs@CoO(O)H) is synthesized by a facile one‐step approach. Notably, the overpotential of Ag SAs&NPs@CoO(O)H is 200 mV at current density of 50 mA cm −2 during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Meanwhile, it can display the mass activity of 637.47 A g −1 Ag under 300 mV, which is 212.49 times higher than that of commercial IrO 2 . Moreover, the assembled Pt/C // Ag SAs&NPs@CoO(O)H system only requires 1.9 V to reach an industrial current density of 1000 mA cm −2 in alkaline water electrolyzer and exhibits excellent stability at large current density of 1000 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis coupled with theoretical calculations reveals an novel active site switching mechanism is found on Ag SAs&NPs@CoO(O)H. Specifically, the O* preferentially generates on the Ag NPs and then switches toward the Co 3+ site in CoO(O)H to produce OOH* and O 2 . Meanwhile, the Ag SAs in the lattice of CoO(O)H can exert an inhibitory force on the reconstruction process of CoOOH to Co(OH) 2 , resulting in excellent anti‐dissolution stability.

Development non-precious electrocatalysts in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) with excellent activity and durability is of great significance but challenging for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, under the guidance of theoretical calculation, we report that in-situ Co-doped NiFe (NiFeCo) LDH is an excellent catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and its activity and durability are superior to NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The dynamic evolution of its structure/composition is uncovered by in-situ Raman and UV–vis spectroscopies, in which Co doping reduces the Ni oxidation potential and accelerates the formation of highly active Ni(Co)1-xFexOOH species during OER. The reconstructed product catalyzes the OER with low overpotential of 261 and 318 mV at 100 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively, and maintains outstanding stability for at least 300 h at 500 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Our findings not only deepen the basic understanding of the OER process of this material, but also provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for the further development of new low-cost electrocatalysts.

Hydrogen gas is a promising renewable energy storage medium when produced via water electrolysis, but this process is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we used a microkinetic model to investigate promoting the OER using programmable oxide catalysts (i.e., forced catalyst dynamics). We found that programmable catalysts could increase current density at a fixed overpotential (100–600× over static rates) or reduce the overpotential required to reach a fixed current density of 10 mA cm–2 (45–140% reduction vs static). In our kinetic parametrization, the key parameters controlling the quality of the catalytic ratchet were the O*-to-OOH* and O*-to-OH* activation barriers. Our findings indicate that programmable catalysts may be a viable strategy for accelerating the OER or enabling lower-overpotential operation, but a more accurate kinetic parametrization is required for precise predictions of performance, ratchet quality, and resulting energy efficiency.

Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a widely employed half‐electrode reaction in oxygen electrochemistry, in applications such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, ammonia synthesis, and electrocatalytic hydrogenation. Unfortunately, its slow kinetics limits the commercialization of such applications. It is therefore highly imperative to develop highly robust electrocatalysts with high activity, long‐term durability, and low noble‐metal contents. Previously intensive efforts have been made to introduce the advancements on developing non‐precious transition metal electrocatalysts and their OER mechanisms. Electronic structure tuning is one of the most effective and interesting ways to boost OER activity and spin angular momentum is an intrinsic property of the electron. Therefore, modulation on the spin states and the magnetic properties of the electrocatalyst enables the changes on energy associated with interacting electron clouds with radical absorbance, affecting the OER activity and stability. Given that few review efforts have been made on this topic, in this review, the‐state‐of‐the‐art research progress on spin‐dependent effects in OER will be briefed. Spin engineering strategies, such as strain, crystal surface engineering, crystal doping, etc., will be introduced. The related mechanism for spin manipulation to boost OER activity will also be discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the development of spin catalysis are presented. This review aims to highlight the significance of spin engineering in breaking the bottleneck of electrocatalysis and promoting the practical application of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts.

Owing to abundant resource and affordable price, metal–free carbon has been extensively studied in the field of oxygen reduction reaction, while the related studies on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are quite few. In this work, a facile and scalable knife coating coupled with annealing strategy is proposed to produce self–standing oxygen–doped graphene membranes (marked as O–GM–T, T represents the annealing temperature). Through systematic characterization and analysis, it is discovered the annealing treatment not only decreases the amount of oxygenic groups, but allows for controlled regulation of the oxygen configurations, leaving only C–OH/C–O–C and CO. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations indicate that the OER activity trend of different oxygen configurations is as follows: –COOH ​> ​CO ​≈ ​C–OH ​> ​C–O–C. Despite the removal of highly active –COOH group through annealing treatment, the resulting O–GM–800 sample maintains good mechanical property and achieves a favorable balance on conductivity, hydrophilicity and catalytic sites. Consequently, it displays significantly improved OER performance compared to the counterparts, making it highly promising for applications in overall water splitting devices. Apparently, our work provides guidance for the rational design and controllable fabrication of self–standing carbon–based catalysts for energy–related reactions.

Development of efficient, affordable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction andthe oxygen reduction reaction is critical for rechargeable metal-air batteries. Here we presentlithium cobalt oxide, synthesized at 400 C (designated as LT-LiCoO2) that adopts a lithiatedspinel structure, as an inexpensive, efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.The catalytic activity of LT-LiCoO2 is higher than that of both spinel cobalt oxide and layeredlithium cobalt oxide synthesized at 800 C (designated as HT-LiCoO2) for the oxygen evolutionreaction. Although LT-LiCoO2 exhibits poor activity for the oxygen reduction reaction,the chemically delithiated LT-Li1 xCoO2 samples exhibit a combination of high oxygenreduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities, making the spinel-type LTLi0,5CoO2a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries. Thehigh activities of these delithiated compositions are attributed to the Co4O4 cubane subunitsand a pinning of the Co3 þ /4 þ :3d energy with the top of the O2 :2p band.DO

Improving the stability of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through materials design has received less attention than improving their catalytic activity. We explored the effects of Mn addition to a cobalt oxide for stabilizing the catalyst by comparing single phase CoOx and (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox films electro­deposited in alkaline solution. The obtained disordered films were classified as layered oxides using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The CoOx films showed a constant decrease in the catalytic activity during cycling, confirmed by oxygen detection, while that of (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox remained constant within error as measured by electrochemical metrics. These trends were rationalized based on XAS analysis of the metal oxidation states, which were Co2.7+ and Mn3.7+ in the bulk and similar near the surface of (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox, before and after cycling. Thus, Mn in (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox successfully stabilized the bulk catalyst material and its surface activity during OER cycling. The development of stabilization approaches is essential to extend the durability of OER catalysts.

Research on novel electrocatalysts with high activity, stability, and economic feasibility for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important to the wide application of water electrolyzers. Here, two novel quinoline complexes, L-Co and L-Fe, are synthesized and their crystal structure and electrochemical properties are systematically investigated. Electropolymerization using these complexes are successfully carried out on carbon cloth. The copolymer (P–Co–Fe) is active towards OER in 1 M KOH, with 298 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 current densities. Kinetic analyses suggest the P–Co–Fe follows both the adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen evolution mechanistic pathways. Lower Tafel slope value, lower charge transfer resistance and lower apparent activation energy all suggest enhacned intrinsic activity of the P–Co–Fe, which stem from the electron interaction between the Co and Fe moieties. The P–Co–Fe exhibits stability in 1 M KOH over 24 h, with partial decomposition and the formation of oxides/hydroxides.

Oxygen fugacity controls the behaviour of multivalent elements and compositions of C-O-H fluids in Earth’s mantle, which further affects the cycling of materials between the deep interior and surface of Earth. The redox state of the mantle lithosphere of typical stable cratons has been well documented, but how oxygen fugacity had varied during craton destruction remains unclear. This study estimates the oxygen fugacity of peridotite xenoliths entrained in Mesozoic and Cenozoic basalts on North China Craton (NCC), a typical destroyed craton. The oxygen fugacity vs. Mg# of olivine reveals that the mantle lithosphere beneath the NCC experienced three stages of evolution in terms of oxygen fugacity. First, the refractory and oxidized peridotite xenoliths indicate that the lithospheric mantle experienced a high degree of melt extraction and later long-term and complicated metasomatism before craton destruction. Then, the variations of olivine Mg-number in peridotites and oxygen fugacity reveal significant metasomatism by melts originated from the shallow asthenosphere during the destruction of the NCC since the Mesozoic. The third stage may have occurred when mantle peridotites interacted with silica-undersaturated melts or fluids stemmed from the mantle transition zone where the stagnant Pacific slab underlies. This study further verifies that the asthenospheric convection induced by the roll-back of the subducted paleo-Pacific slab played a crucial role in the destruction of the NCC and helps understand the oxygen fugacity variability during the later life of the craton.

Abstract The dynamic response and microstructure evolution of oxygen-free high-conductivity copper in a shaped charge liner are investigated through microstructural examination of a soft-recovery EFP. Adiabatic shear bands and voids which is the failure original of copper EFP can be observed in the rear part of the projectile. Numerical simulation results illustrate that the highest plastic strain reaches about 2.9 which can fully accommodate the grains deformation of copper EFP during the formation process at strain rates of the order of 104s−1. Theoretical calculation results indicate that the highest temperature increase of EFP caused by shock wave and plastic deformation can reach 747K, which is 0.55T m (where T m is the melting temperature of copper). The main body of the EFP undergoes completely dynamic recrystallisation, and the average size of the refined grains significantly decreases to approximately 10µm. A slight increase in grain size occurs mainly away from the center and extends towards the head and rear sections of the EFP. During the DRX process, the dislocation movement is believed to be the controlling mechanism significantly refining the microstructure.

The constraint of temperature evolution in coastal environments is an important factor in deciphering the Earth’s global climatic history. In this study, we reconstruct the evolution of sea-surface palaeotemperatures from the oxygen stable isotope compositions in four marine molluscs families in the Paris Basin during the Palaeogene. The combination of several taxa living in different environments is used to limit uncertainties related to the influence of salinity variations on palaeotemperature estimations. One family of bivalves (oysters) and three families of gastropods (Volutidae, Cerithiidae and Turritellidae) were sampled in the French part of the Paris Basin, in Belgium and in the Isle of Wight (southern England). Maximum seawater temperatures were observed during the Early Eocene (c. 30°C), which correspond to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, and temperatures then decreased until the Lutetian (c. 20°C). A transient warming, identified as the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, occurred during the Bartonian, when temperatures reached 32°C. Temperatures decreased through the Eocene–Oligocene boundary, the coolest interval of the Palaeogene (c. 12°C). A final warming period occurred throughout the Early Oligocene, with temperatures reaching 24°C. The fossils analysed thus record the global climatic intervals of the Palaeogene.

Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp., Synechocystis sp. and Chroococcidiopsis cubana) were immobilised in synthetic latex with halloysite to create porous biocoatings. Hardness measurements of this latex were performed first. Toxicity of the liquid latex was then assessed and biocoating structures were visualised using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). Finally, oxygen evolution of the biocoating was measured.

Salt stress significantly impacts the functions of the photosynthetic apparatus, with varying degrees of damage to its components. Photosystem II (PSII) is more sensitive to environmental stresses, including salinity, than photosystem I (PSI). This study investigated the effects of different salinity levels (0 to 200 mM NaCl) on the PSII complex in isolated thylakoid membranes from hydroponically grown pea (Pisum sativum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) plants treated with NaCl for 5 days. The data revealed that salt stress inhibits the photochemical activity of PSII (H2O → BQ), affecting the energy transfer between the pigment–protein complexes of PSII (as indicated by the fluorescence emission ratio F695/F685), QA reoxidation, and the function of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). These processes were more significantly affected in pea than in maize under salinity. Analysis of the oxygen evolution curves after flashes and continuous illumination showed a stronger influence on the PSIIα than PSIIβ centers. The inhibition of oxygen evolution was associated with an increase in misses (α), double hits (β), and blocked centers (SB) and a decrease in the rate constant of turnover of PSII reaction centers (KD). Salinity had different effects on the two pathways of QA reoxidation in maize and pea. In maize, the electron flow from QA- to plastoquinone was dominant after treatment with higher NaCl concentrations (150 mM and 200 mM), while in pea, the electron recombination on QAQB- with oxidized S2 (or S3) of the OEC was more pronounced. Analysis of the 77 K fluorescence emission spectra revealed changes in the ratio of the light-harvesting complex of PSII (LHCII) monomers and trimers to LHCII aggregates after salt treatment. There was also a decrease in pigment composition and an increase in oxidative stress markers, membrane injury index, antioxidant activity (FRAP assay), and antiradical activity (DPPH assay). These effects were more pronounced in pea than in maize after treatment with higher NaCl concentrations (150 mM–200 mM). This study provides insights into how salinity influences the processes in the donor and acceptor sides of PSII in plants with different salt sensitivity.

Abstract Magnetic field effects on electrocatalysis have recently gained attention due to the substantial enhancement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on ferromagnetic catalysts. When detecting an enhanced catalytic activity, the effect of magnetic fields on mass transport must be assessed. In this study, we employ a specifically designed magneto-electrochemical system and non-magnetic electrodes to quantify magnetic field effects. Our findings reveal a marginal enhancement in reactions with high reactant availability, such as the OER, whereas substantial boosts exceeding 50% are observed in diffusion limited reactions, exemplified by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Direct visualization and quantification of the whirling motion of ions under a magnetic field underscore the importance of Lorentz forces acting on the electrolyte ions, and demonstrate that bubbles’ movement is a secondary phenomenon. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of magnetic fields in electrocatalysis and unveil new prospects for developing more efficient and sustainable energy conversion technologies.

Abstract Understanding the oceanic phosphate concentration is critical for understanding marine productivity and oxygen evolution throughout Earth history. During the Archean, estimates of marine phosphate levels range from scarce to enriched conditions. However, biogeochemical conditions required for sustaining high phosphate concentrations while retaining an anoxic atmosphere during the Archean remain ambiguous. Here, we employ a biogeochemical model of the marine phosphate cycle to determine the conditions under which oceanic phosphate levels could have been higher than present‐day values during the Archean after the emergence of oxygenic photoautotrophs (OP). We show that, under the presence of OP, phosphate‐rich oceans require the limitation by factors other than phosphate, or a high outgassing rate of reducing gases. If these conditions were not met, the occurrence of oceanic phosphate levels higher than present‐day values during the Archean would require the absence of OP.

Stabilizing active sites of non-iridium-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial, but remains a big challenge for hydrogen production by acidic water splitting. Here, we report that non-stoichiometric Ti oxides (TiOx) can safeguard the Ru sites through structural-confinement and charge-redistribution, thereby extending the catalyst lifetime in acid by 10 orders of magnitude longer compared to that of the stoichiometric one (Ru/TiO2). By exploiting the redox interaction-engaged strategy, the in situ growth of TiOx on Ti foam and the loading of Ru nanoparticles are realized in one step. The as-synthesized binder-free Ru/TiOx catalyst exhibits low OER overpotentials of 174 and 265 mV at 10 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that TiOx stabilizes the Ru active center, enabling operation at 10 mA cm-2 for over 37 days. This work opens an avenue of using non-stoichiometric compounds as stable and active materials for energy technologies

The development of low-cost electrocatalysts to selectively oxidize methanol to formate to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will be beneficial to reduce the overpotential of electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we propose a one-step low-temperature strategy for anion and cation co-doping to reconstruct ZIF-67 into two-dimensional Mo, N co-doped Co(OH)2 [N-CoMo(OH)x]. The N-CoMo(OH)x only needs 1.36 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Meanwhile, N-CoMo(OH)x exhibits good stability at 100 mA cm−2 with Faraday efficiency of 98.1 %. The Mo6+ and N co-doping synergistically enhance the conductivity and dehydrogenation energy barrier of OCH2 intermediate species, leading to good catalytic performance. This work thus provides a strategy for designing anion and cation co-doped catalysts for methanol upgrading.

The traditional electrochemical caustic soda recovery system uses the generated pH gradient across the ion exchange membrane for the regeneration of spent alkaline absorbent from CO2 capture. This electrochemical CO2 capture system releases the by-products H2 and O2 at the cathode and anode, respectively. Although effective for capturing CO2, the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limit the energy efficiency of this technique. Hence, this study proposed and validated a hybrid electrochemical cell based on the H2-cycling from the cathode to the anode to eliminate the reliance on anodic oxygen generation. The results show that our lab-scale prototype enabled effective spent caustic soda recovery with an electron utilisation efficiency of 90%, and a relative carbonate/bicarbonate diffusional flux of approximately 40%. The system also enabled the regeneration of spent alkaline absorbent with a minimum electrochemical energy input of 0.19 kWh/kg CO2 at a CO2 recovery rate of 0.7 mol/m2/h, accounting for 30% lower energy demand than a control system without H2-recycling, making this technique a promising alternative to the conventional thermal regeneration technology.

Cost-effective highly efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen catalysts are critical for practical applications of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). In this study, a non-precious bifunctional FeCoNiCuMo high entropy alloy (HEA) catalyst was developed, exhibiting outstanding dual-functionality toward catalysis of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, with an ultralow voltage gap (ΔE10) of 0.67 V. The FeCoNiCuMo HEA based ZAB exhibited a high peak power density of 298 mW cm−2 at a high current density of 412 mA cm−2 and an outstanding cycling stability over 1576 cycles (788 h) at 10 mA cm−2 with a minor voltage gap increase of 6.2 %. Incorporation of CoNi layered double hydroxide nanowire arrays to poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) gel electrolytes significantly enhanced the aqueous electrolyte adsorption and water retention capabilities and ionic conductivities of the PVA gel, leading to much improved efficiency and stability of the flexible ZAB (FZAB), with an increase in peak power densities from 72 to 102.9 mW cm−2 and a prolonged lifespan from 35 to 58 h at 5 mA cm−2. The FZAB exhibited excellent mechanical stability, with no variations in voltage gaps observed under increasing bending.

Lithium‐excess cation‐disordered rocksalt materials are a promising class of transition metal‐based cathodes that exhibit high specific capacity and energy density. The exceptional performance is achieved through participation of anionic redox in addition to cationic redox reactions in the electrochemistry. However, anionic redox reactions accompanied by oxygen evolution, accelerated electrolyte breakdown, and structural evolution lead to voltage hysteresis and low initial Coulombic efficiency. Herein, an Al 2 O 3 layer with varying thickness has been coated onto a high‐entropy disordered rocksalt oxyfluoride cathode through atomic layer deposition to enhance battery performance. The results indicate that the utilization of a uniform Al 2 O 3 coating improves the capacity retention and rate capability of the cathode, with the performance being strongly dependent on the layer thickness. Further investigation into cathode–electrolyte interfacial reactions reveals that the thin protecting Al 2 O 3 coating can reduce the decomposition of electrolyte on the cathode surface but cannot prevent bulk phase degradation during prolonged cycling. These findings highlight the need for optimized coating design on the disordered rocksalt cathode to improve battery performance.

Rational design of semiconductor molecule structure is of significant importance for achieving the multifunctional photocatalysis. Herein, three end/bay-substituted perylenediimide (PDI) molecules, including bis(N-carboxymethyl) perylenediimide (H2PDI), 1,7-dibromo-substituted H2PDI (2Br-H2PDI) and 1,6,7,12-tetraether-substituted H2PDI (4CH3CH2O-H2PDI), are synthesized for photocatalytic oxygen evolution (POE) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). One-dimensional H2PDI nanorods, two-dimensional 2Br-H2PDI nanosheets, and zero-dimensional 4CH3CH2O-H2PDI nanoparticles are obtained. Under visible light, 4CH3CH2O-H2PDI as photocatalyst (5.31 mmol·g−1·h−1) exhibits the 1.8-times and 20-times POE rate of 2Br-H2PDI (2.93 mmol·g−1·h−1) and H2PDI (0.26 mmol·g−1·h−1) with AgNO3 as sacrificial agent. Additionally, the POE rate can be further improved to 9.34 mmol·g−1·h−1 with the Co2+ doping of 4CH3CH2O-H2PDI. With isopropanol as sacrificial agent, the H2O2 evolution rate of 657.4 μM·g−1·h−1 can be also achieved via photocatalytic ORR with 4CH3CH2O-H2PDI as catalyst, which is ∼3 and ∼4 times those of 2Br-H2PDI (220.8 μM·g−1·h−1) and H2PDI (160.0 μM·g−1·h−1), respectively. Especially, in the O2- or air- saturated aqueous solution without sacrificial agent, the H2O2 rate of 273.1 or 112.7 μM·g−1·h−1 can be also achieved. This work provides a promising way to design the PDI-based multifunctional photocatalysts.

In this work, we employed operando X‐ray absorption (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structure‐activity relationships of low‐crystalline cobalt sulfide (L‐CoS) catalysts toward overall water splitting. The operando results for L‐CoS catalyzing the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrate that the cobalt centers in the bulk are predominantly coordinated by sulfur atoms, which undergo a kinetic structural rearrangement to generate metallic cobalt in S‐Co‐Co‐S moieties as the true catalytic active species. In comparison, during the acidic HER, L‐CoS undergoes local structural optimization of Co centers, and H2 production proceeds with adsorption/desorption of key intermediates atop the Co‐S‐Co configurations. Further operando characterizations highlight the crucial formation of high‐valent Co4+ species in L‐CoS for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the formation of such active species was found to be far more facile than in crystalline Co3O4 and Co‐LDH references. These insights offer a clear picture of the complexity of active species and site formation in different media, and demonstrate how their restructuring influences the catalytic activity.

The lack of highly efficient and inexpensive catalysts severely hinders the large-scale application of Zn–air batteries (ZABs). High-entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit unique structures and attractive properties; thus, they are promising to be used in ZABs. However, conventional high-temperature synthesis methods tend to obtain microscale HEOs with a lower exposure rate of active sites. Here, we report a facile solvothermal strategy for preparing two-dimensional (2D) HEO sub-1 nm nanosheets (SNSs) induced by polyoxometalate (POM) clusters. Taking advantage of the special 2D sub-1 nm structure and precise element regulation, these 2D HEOs-POM SNSs exhibit enhanced bifunctional oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction activity under light irradiation. Further applying these 2D HEOs-POM SNSs to ZABs as cathode catalysts, the CoFeNiMnCuZnOx-phosphomolybdic acid SNSs-based ZABs deliver a low charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.25 V at 2 mA cm–2 under light irradiation. Meanwhile, it could maintain an ultralong-term stability for 1600 h at 2 mA cm–2 and 930 h at 10 mA cm–2. The 2D sub-1 nm structure and fine element control in HEOs provide opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, limited active sites, and instability of air cathodes in ZABs.

Modification of oxygen evolution co-catalyst (OEC) on the surface of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) can effectively improve the kinetics of water oxidation, but it is still limited by the small hole extraction driving force at the BiVO4/OEC interface. Modulating the BiVO4/OEC interface with a hole transfer layer (HTL) is expected to facilitate hole transport from BiVO4 to the OEC surface. Herein, a copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) HTL is inserted between BiVO4 and NiFeOx OEC to create BiVO4/CuSCN/NiFeOx photoanode, resulting in a significant enhancement of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. From electrochemical analyses and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, the markedly enhanced PEC performance is attributed to the insertion of CuSCN as an HTL, which promotes the extraction of holes from BiVO4 surface and boosts the water oxidation kinetics. The optimal photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 5.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and an impressive charge separation efficiency of 96.2 %. This work offers valuable insights into the development of advanced photoanodes for solar energy conversion and emphasizes the importance of selecting an appropriate HTL to mitigate recombination at the BiVO4/OEC interface.

Abstract Organic oxidation reactions (OORs) powered by renewable energy sources are gaining importance as a favorable alternative to oxygen evolution reaction, with the promise of reducing the cell potential and enhancing the overall viability of the water electrolysis. This comprehensive review delves into the electrochemical oxidation of diverse organic compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, amines, and urea, as well as biomass‐derived renewable feedstocks such as hydroxymethylfurfural and glycerol. The key focus centers on the role of nickel (Ni)‐based catalysts for these OORs. The unique redox activity and chemical nature of Ni have been proven instrumental for the sustainable and cost‐effective oxidation of various organic molecules more efficiently and selectively. This review article discusses how strategic choices, such as the selection of foreign metals, intercalating species, vacancies, defects, and a secondary element (e.g. chalcogens and non‐metals), contribute to tuning the electrochemical performances of a Ni‐based (pre)catalyst for OORs. Moreover, this review provides insights into the active species in various reaction environments and further explores reaction mechanisms, to apparent phase changes of the catalyst with the most relevant examples. Finally, the review not only elucidates the limitations of the current approaches but also outlines potential avenues for future advancements in OOR.

Abstract The electrocatalytic performance of MoNi‐based nanomaterials undergo selenization has garnered significant interest due to their modified electronic structure, while still posses certain challenges for obtained bimetallic selenides. Here, a novel MoNi‐based electrocatalyst of NiMoO 4 @Mo 15 Se 19 /NiSe 2 core‐shell nanomaterials is constructed to promote the desorption of OOH * which can facilitate the water oxidation process. NiMoO 4 @Mo 15 Se 19 /NiSe 2 core‐shell nanoarrays show that the “cores” are mainly NiMoO 4 nanorods while the “shells” are the bimetallic selenides nanoflakes, which are super architectures that can expand more active sites and accelerate the electron transfer. Moreover, the hybridization interaction between Ni 3d, Mo 4d, and Se 4p orbitals leads to an asymmetric distribution of electric clouds, which decreases the adsorption energy and transformation of oxygen‐containing species. Electrochemical data displays that the overpotentials of NiMoO 4 @Mo 15 Se 19 /NiSe 2 core‐shell nanomaterials are only 195 mV, 220 mV, and 224 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline freshwater, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater. The current density decay is negligible after 100 h stability at about 1.46 V with a three‐electrode system in alkaline natural seawater. The low cost and the unique MoNi‐based bimetallic selenides in this work provide a more constructive solution for designing efficient and stable OER catalysts in the future.

Abstract Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis holds great promise in revolutionizing clean energy production by enabling the efficient generation of hydrogen. Nevertheless, a formidable challenge persists in the realm of designing electrocatalysts that are both highly active and acid‐resistant during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thereby mitigating the substantial kinetic barrier. In this study, the facile synthesis of iridium‐yttrium (IrY) alloy nanocatalysts via a thermal shock method is introduced, which exhibits exceptional activity in the context of acidic water oxidation. Through the strategic incorporation of dispersed Y into the lattice of Ir metal, the IrY catalyst demonstrates a notably low overpotential of 255 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 and showcases remarkable catalytic stability in acidic electrolytes, enduring for over 500 h with a high current density of 100 mA cm −2 . Through a comprehensive set of in situ characterizations and analytical methods, the formation of a surface Ir‐based oxide layer, induced by deprotonation and electrochemical oxidation is unveiled, which is notably stabilized by the presence of Y dopants. This stabilization of the active site imparts enhanced resistance to over‐oxidation and dissolution, underpinning the exceptional stability of the catalyst. Theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of Y into the catalyst structure has a significant impact on enhancing the reactivity of the oxygen intermediate (O*) at adjacent Ir sites, thus lowering the overpotential and promoting OER activity. The alloying approach presents a straightforward method for achieving atomic‐level modifications in catalyst design and can pave the way for the development of more effective and economically viable OER catalysts and beyond.

This study unveils a novel role of bare graphite as a catalyst in glycerol electrooxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions, challenging the prevailing notion that current collectors employed in electrolyzers are inert. Half-cell experiments elucidate the feasibility of glycerol oxidation and hydrogen production on bulk graphite electrodes at potentials exceeding 1.7 V. The investigation of varying glycerol concentrations (0.05 to 1.5 mol L–1) highlights a concentration-dependent competition between glycerol electrooxidation and oxygen evolution reactions. Employing an H-type glycerol electrolyzer, polarization curves reveal significant activation polarization attributed to the low electroactivity of the anode. Glycerol electrolysis at different concentrations yields diverse product mixtures, including formate, glycolate, glycerate, and lactate at the anode, with concurrent hydrogen generation at the cathode. The anolyte composition changes with glycerol concentration, resulting in less-oxidized compounds at higher concentrations and more oxidized compounds at lower concentrations. The cell voltage also influences the product formation selectivity, with an increased voltage favoring more oxidized compounds. The glycerol concentration also affects hydrogen production, with lower concentrations yielding higher hydrogen amounts, peaking at 3.5 V for 0.05 mol L–1. This model quantitatively illustrates graphite's contribution to current and product generation in glycerol electrolyzers, emphasizing the significance of background current and products originating from current collectors if in contact with the reactants. These results have an impact on the efficiency of the electrolyzer and raise questions regarding possible extra non-noble "nonparticipating" current collectors that could affect overall performance. This research expands our understanding of electrocatalysis on graphite surfaces with potential applications in optimizing electrolyzer configurations for enhanced efficiency and product selectivity.

Selective oxidative cleavage of C(OH)–C or C(O)–C bonds in cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone (KA oil) to produce adipic acid (AA), a monomer for the synthesis of nylon-66, is of significant importance for the petrochemical industry. Herein, we report an electrochemical method to improve the efficiency for upgrading KA oil into AA. Free-standing electrodes consisting of hydroxides (Ni(OH)2 and Mn-doped Ni(OH)2) supported by carbon paper were fabricated via an in situ electrodeposition process and further examined for KA oil conversion. The morphology and structures of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the samples was studied by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The products of KA oil oxidation were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The introduction of manganese into nickel hydroxides enhanced the catalytic performance in terms of activity and product selectivity. Specifically, the optimal sample exhibited a current density of 50 mA mg–1 and selectivity of 46.8%, which are superior to those of pure nickel hydroxides. Such enhancement was attributed to the electronic interaction of manganese with nickel hydroxides, thereby modifying the adsorption of the substrates. Interestingly, the introduction of Mn into nickel hydroxides had negligible effects in the oxygen evolution reaction. The effects of critical parameters including substrate composition, reaction temperatures, KOH concentrations, and electrolysis time on the conversion of KA oil were investigated.

It matters to design and explore transition metal bifunctional electrocatalysts which can efficiently catalyze overall water splitting. Herein, we report a series of Fe doped NiSe/Ni3Se2 (NiSe/Ni3Se2-Fe-X@t, X is Fe dosage, and t is electrodeposition time) heterojunctions assembled on nickel foam (NF) by one-step electrodeposition. Under alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH), the optimized NiSe/Ni3Se2-Fe-5@5min catalyst shows ultra-low overpotentials of 144 and 200 mV respectively for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to afford the current density of 10 mA·cm−2, and a small cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA·cm−2 is needed for overall water splitting with extraordinary high stability (≥120 h). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the heterojunction keeps metallic state, and Fe3+ doping reduces electron density of Ni2+, effectively accelerating Ni → Fe electron transfer. For HER, Se serves as the active site in the materials with and without Fe, and Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) at Se site decreases from 0.149 eV in NiSe/Ni3Se2 to −0.051 eV in NiSe/Ni3Se2-Fe, whose the much smaller value near to zero indicates significantly enhanced HER activity. For OER, in NiSe/Ni3Se2, Ni serves as active site, while in NiSe/Ni3Se2-Fe, Fe becomes the active site. In the both materials, rate-determining step (RDS) is the formation of *O→*OOH intermediates and the much lower energy barrier (1.589 eV) after Fe doping contributes to superior OER activity. The calculated TDOS shows that Fe doping increases carrier density and intrinsic conductivity of the catalyst. This work provides important reference for regulating interface effect of electrocatalysts through elemental doping.

Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have received significant interest for optimizing metal atom utilization and superior catalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we investigate a range of single‐transition metal (STM 1 = Sc 1 , Ti 1 , V 1 , Cr 1 , Mn 1 , Fe 1 , Co 1 , Ni 1 , Cu 1 , Zr 1 , Nb 1 , Mo 1 , Ru 1 , Rh 1 , Pd 1 , Ag 1 , W 1 , Re 1 , Os 1 , Ir 1 , Pt 1 , and Au 1 ) atoms supported on graphyne (GY) surface for HER/OER and ORR using first‐principle calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and phonon dispersion spectra reveal the dynamic and thermal stabilities of the GY surface. The exceptional stability of all supported STM 1 atoms within the H1 cavity of the GY surface exists in an isolated form, facilitating the uniform distribution and proper arrangement of single atoms on GY. In particular, Sc 1 , Co 1 , Fe 1 , and Au 1 /GY demonstrate promising catalytic efficiency in the HER due to idealistic ΔG H* values via the Volmer‐Heyrovsky pathway. Notably, Sc 1 and Au 1 /GY exhibit superior HER catalytic activity compared to other studied catalysts. Co 1 /GY catalyst exhibits higher selectivity and activity for the OER, with an overpotential (0.46 V) comparable to MoC 2 , IrO 2 , and RuO 2 . Also, Rh 1 and Co 1 /GY SACs exhibited promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, with an overpotential of 0.36 and 0.46 V, respectively. Therefore, Co 1 /GY is a versatile electrocatalyst for metal‐air batteries and water‐splitting. This study further incorporates computational analysis of the kinetic potential energy barriers of Co 1 and Rh 1 in the OER and ORR. A strong correlation is found between the estimated kinetic activation barriers for the thermodynamic outcomes and all proton‐coupled electron transfer steps. We establish a relation for the Gibbs free energy of intermediates to understand the mechanism of SACs supported on STM 1 /GY and introduce a key descriptor. This study highlights GY as a favorable single‐atom support for designing highly active and cost‐effective versatile electrocatalysts for practical applications.

Oxygen plays a central role in cellular metabolism, in both healthy and tumour tissue. The presence and concentration of molecular oxygen in tumours has a substantial effect on both radiotherapy response and tumour evolution, and as a result the oxygen micro-environment is an area of intense research interest. Multicellular tumour spheroids closely mimic real avascular tumours, and in particular they exhibit physiologically relevant heterogeneous oxygen distribution. This property has made them a vital part of in vitro experimentation. For ideal spheroids, their heterogeneous oxygen distributions can be predicted from theory, allowing determination of cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and anoxic extent. However, experimental tumour spheroids often depart markedly from perfect sphericity. There has been little consideration of this reality. To date, the question of how far an ellipsoid can diverge from perfect sphericity before spherical assumptions breakdown remains unanswered. In this work, we derive equations governing oxygen distribution (and more generally, nutrient and drug distribution) in both prolate and oblate tumour ellipsoids, and quantify the theoretical limits of the assumption that the spheroid is a perfect sphere. Results of this analysis yield new methods for quantifying OCR in ellipsoidal spheroids, and how this can be applied to markedly increase experimental throughput and quality.

Several1 studies have revealed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by antibacterial stimulation accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance, which uncovered new links between oxygen rise and evolution and inspired new strategies to prevent antibiotic resistance. Considering many other mechanisms cause DNA mutations aside from ROS damage, evaluating the significance of oxidative DNA damage in the development of antibiotic resistance is of great interest. In this study, we examined the ratio of G:C > T:A transversion to G:C > A:T transition in drug-resistant Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and found that it is significantly higher than the background values. This finding strongly suggests that ROS damage plays a critical role in the development of antibacterial resistance. Considering the long-term co-evolution between host organisms and pathogenic bacteria, we speculate that the hosts may have evolved strategies for combating antibiotic resistance by controlling DNA damage in bacteria. Analysis of the global transcriptional profiles of Staphylococcus aureus treated with berberine (derived from Berberis, a traditional antibacterial medicine) revealed that the transcription of DNA repair enzymes was markedly upregulated, whereas the antioxidant enzymes were significantly downregulated. Thus, we propose that consolidating the DNA repair systems of bacteria may be a viable strategy for preventing antibiotic resistance. 1These authors contributed equally to this work.

Corrosion is still one of the most serious and frequent problems in industries. The phenomena involved in the corrosion mechanism of Al-alloys may be explained by formation of galvanic cells between the metal matrix and heterogeneities, such as precipitates, intermetallic phases leading to potential differences and electrochemical reactions. In the cathodic sites, the main reactions are oxygen reduction reaction, in aerated neutral environments, and hydrogen evolution in acid media. This last type of reaction might also occur in neutral solutions inside pits (anodic region). In this study, the mechanism of hydrogen evolution during corrosion of the 2198-T8 Al-Cu-Li alloy exposed in a chloride solution was investigated. The mechanism was related to the presence of T1 phase (Al2CuLi), which is the main strengthening phase in this material. This phase is highly active and, when exposed to corrosive media, leads to severe localized corrosion (SLC). One of the main characteristics related to SLC is hydrogen gas evolution which was confirmed by gel visualization. In this study, the hydrogen evolution mechanism inside the SLC sites was studied by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM).

Hemoglobin (Hb) has been identified in at least 14 molluscan taxa so far. Research spanning over 130 years on molluscan Hbs focuses on their genes, protein structures, functions, and evolution. Molluscan Hbs are categorized into single-, two-, and multiple-domain chains, including red blood cell, gill, and extracellular Hbs, based on the number of globin domains and their respective locations. These Hbs exhibit variation in assembly, ranging from monomeric and dimeric to higher-order multimeric forms. Typically, molluscan Hbs display moderately high oxygen affinity, weak cooperativity, and varying pH sensitivity. Hb’s potential role in antimicrobial pathways could augment the immune defense of bivalves, which may be a complement to their lack of adaptive immunity. The role of Hb as a respiratory protein in bivalves likely originated from the substitution of hemocyanin. Molluscan Hbs demonstrate adaptive evolution in response to environmental changes via various strategies (e.g. increasing Hb types, multimerization, and amino acid residue substitutions at key sites), enhancing or altering functional properties for habitat adaptation. Concurrently, an increase in Hb assembly diversity, coupled with a downward trend in oxygen affinity, is observed during molluscan differentiation and evolution. Hb in Protobranchia, Heteroconchia, and Pteriomorphia bivalves originated from separate ancestors, with Protobranchia inheriting a relative ancient molluscan Hb gene. In bivalves, extracellular Hbs share a common origin, while gill Hbs likely emerged from convergent evolution. In summary, research on molluscan Hbs offers valuable insights into the origins, biological variations, and adaptive evolution of animal Hbs.

Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a new technology that has gained great attention due to its advantages in CO2 capture during combustion. Sulfur in coal maybe harmful to the CLC process. The interactions between sulfur and oxygen carrier may reduce the purity of carbon captured, and affect the characteristics of the oxygen carrier. Therefore, the evolution of sulfur in Xinzhou coal and the desulfurization performance in this process were studied by using iron ore as an oxygen carrier. Experimental results showed that the main sulfur-containing component released was SO2, and the fractions of sulfur during the reduction and oxidation periods reached 64.28 and 3.91%, respectively. The addition of desulfurization agent (CaO) could control the release of sulfur and a higher molar ratio of Ca/S resulted in less emission of sulfur-containing gases. The desulfurization efficiency reached 36.61%, 50.72%, and 55.45% when the Ca/S molar ratio was 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 respectively. Considering the investment and operation costs, the recommended molar ratio of Ca/S was 2.0. The formation of CaSO4 was confirmed after reaction, but the stability of CaSO4 and its effect on oxygen carrier over a longer period of time still need to be further studied.

The world-class Jinchuan magmatic Ni–Cu sulfide deposit in China is one of the world's major suppliers of nickel (Ni) and platinum-group elements (PGEs). The evolution of Jinchuan magma that fed this enormous deposit, which is hosted by an abnormally small intrusion, is highly controversial. The variation in major element compositions of the Jinchuan intrusion suggests that the magma evolution was mainly controlled by olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene crystallization with increasing magma oxygen fugacity from ΔFMQ -1 to ΔFMQ +3, consistent with the results simulated by a thermodynamically constrained model, rhyolite-MELTS. During the change in oxygen fugacity, the decrease in sulfur solubility between the liquidus and the temperature of orthopyroxene crystallization calculated by numerical models under ideal conditions dramatically increases from 0.01 wt.% to 0.15 wt.%, contributing to a decrease in magma mass needed to form the deposit (from 2.00 * 105 Mt to 1.52 * 104 Mt, approximately 21 to 1.6 times the estimated mass of the present intrusion). This highlights the vital role of the transition in magma redox state in controlling metallization. The mantle sulfur isotope characteristics (δ34S = -2.0 ~ +2.1 ‰) of sulfide inclusions in Cr-spinel grains analyzed by NanoSIMS imply that no addition of external sulfur was involved in attaining sulfide saturation during the early stage of Jinchuan magma. Therefore, we conclude that the change in oxygen fugacity and massive magma mass were potentially essential conditions required to generate the world-class Jinchuan deposit, unless contamination by crustal materials, especially external sulfur, was involved.

Abstract Understanding causal relationships between evolution and ocean oxygenation hinges on reliable reconstructions of marine oxygen levels, typically from redox-sensitive geochemical proxies. Here, we develop a proxy, using dolomite U–Pb geochronology, to reconstruct seawater U/Pb ratios. Dolomite samples consistently give U–Pb dates and initial 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ratios lower than expected from their stratigraphic ages. These observations are explained by resetting of the U–Pb system long after deposition; the magnitude of deviations from expected initial 207 Pb/ 206 Pb are a function of the redox-sensitive U/Pb ratios during deposition. Reconstructed initial U/Pb ratios increased notably in the late-Paleozoic, reflecting an increase in oxygenation of marine environments at that time. This timeline is consistent with documented shifts in some other redox proxies and supports evolution-driven mechanisms for the oxygenation of late-Paleozoic marine environments, as well as suggestions that early animals thrived in oceans that on long time scales were oxygen-limited compared to today.

The evolution of designs from the pit houses to pueblos was due to a series of progressive improvments. While the pueblo is build above the ground, the pit house was both above and below the surface. The circular kiva became a gathering place for people, protection against weather, and could be defended. There is also evidence that grains were stored there and that such graineries were also sealed, and the oxygen removed by burning corn cobbs to eliminate rodent infestations. Much of the truth of things are unknown and only revealed by the evidence that we find and history that we know. Created in RealityCapture by Capturing Reality from 72 images in 00h:41m:09s.

Abstract The presence of hematite (Fe2O3) clusters at low coverage on titanium dioxide (TiO2) sur-&#xD;face has been observed to enhance photocatalytic activity, while excess loading of hematite is&#xD;detrimental. We conduct a comprehensive density functional theory study of Fe2O3 clusters&#xD;adsorbed on the anatase TiO2 (101) surface to investigate the effect of Fe2O3 on TiO2. Our&#xD;study shows that TiO2 exhibits improved photocatalytic properties with hematite clusters at&#xD;low coverage, as evidenced by a systematic study conducted by increasing the number of cluster&#xD;adsorbates. The adsorption of the clusters generates impurity states in the band gap improving&#xD;light absorption and consequently affecting the charge transfer dynamics. Furthermore, the&#xD;presence of hematite clusters enhances the activity of TiO2 in the hydrogen evolution reaction.&#xD;The Fe valence mixing present in some clusters leads to a significant increase in H2 evolution rate&#xD;compared with the fixed +3 valence of Fe in hematite. We also investigate the effect of oxygen&#xD;defects and find extensive modifications in the electronic properties and local magnetism of the&#xD;TiO2 -Fe2O3 system, demonstrating the wide-ranging effect of oxygen defects in the combined&#xD;system.

Abstract Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of algae and plants harbor specialized thylakoid membranes that convert sunlight into chemical energy. These membranes house photosystems II and I, the vital protein-pigment complexes that drive oxygenic photosynthesis. In the course of their evolution, thylakoid membranes have diversified in structure. However, the core machinery for photosynthetic electron transport remained largely unchanged, with adaptations occurring primarily in the light-harvesting antenna systems. Whereas thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria are relatively simple they become more complex in algae and plants. The chloroplasts of vascular plants contain intricate networks of stacked grana and unstacked stroma thylakoids. This review provides an in-depth view of thylakoid membrane architectures in phototrophs, and the determinants that shape their forms, as well as presenting recent insights into the spatial organization of their biogenesis and maintenance. Its overall goal is to define the underlying principles that have guided the evolution of these bioenergetic membranes.

Anophelines are vectors of malaria, the deadliest disease worldwide transmitted by mosquitoes. The availability of genomic data from various Anopheles species allowed evolutionary comparisons of the immune response genes in search of alternative vector control of the malarial parasites. Now, with the Anopheles aquasalis genome, it was possible to obtain more information about the evolution of the immune response genes. Anopheles aquasalis has 278 immune genes in 24 families or groups. Comparatively, the American anophelines possess fewer genes than Anopheles gambiae s. s., the most dangerous African vector. The most remarkable differences were found in the pathogen recognition and modulation families like FREPs, CLIP and C-type-lectins. Even so, genes related to the modulation of the expression of effectors in response to pathogens and gene families that control the production of reactive oxygen species were more conserved. Overall, the results show a variable pattern of evolution in the immune response genes in the anopheline species. Environmental factors, such as exposure to different pathogens and differences in the microbiota composition, could shape the expression of this group of genes. The results presented here will contribute to a better knowledge of the Neotropical vector and open opportunities for malaria control in the endemic-affected areas of the New World.

Abstract We present optical observations and analysis of the bright type Iax supernova SN 2020udy hosted by NGC 0812. The evolution of the light curve of SN 2020udy is similar to that of other bright type Iax SNe. Analytical modeling of the quasi-bolometric light curves of SN 2020udy suggests that 0.08 ± 0.01 M ⊙ of 56 Ni would have been synthesized during the explosion. The spectral features of SN 2020udy are similar to those of the bright members of type Iax class, showing a weak Si ii line. The late-time spectral sequence is mostly dominated by iron group elements with broad emission lines. Abundance tomography modeling of the spectral time series of SN 2020udy using TARDIS indicates stratification in the outer ejecta; however, to confirm this, spectral modeling at a very early phase is required. After maximum light, uniform mixing of chemical elements is sufficient to explain the spectral evolution. Unlike in the case of normal type Ia SNe, the photospheric approximation remains robust until +100 days, requiring an additional continuum source. Overall, the observational features of SN 2020udy are consistent with the deflagration of a carbon–oxygen white dwarf.

Corrosion processes at cut edges of galvanized steels proceed as highly localized electrochemical reactions between the exposed bulk steel matrix and the protective thin metallic coating of a more electrochemically active material. Scanning microelectrochemical techniques can thus provide the spatially resolved information needed to assess the corrosion initiation and propagation phenomena, yet most methods scan cut edge sections as embedded in insulating resin to achieve a flat surface for scanning purposes. In this work, the galvanized coatings on both sides of the material were concomitantly exposed to simulated acid rain while characterizing the cut edge response using SECM and SVET techniques, thereby maintaining the coupled effects through the exposure of the whole system as rather realistic operation conditions. The cut edges were shown to strongly promote oxygen consumption and subsequent alkalization to pH 10–11 over the iron, while diffusion phenomena eventually yielded the complete depletion of oxygen and pH neutralization of the nearby electrolyte. In addition, the cathodic activation of the exposed iron was intensified with a thinner coating despite the lower presence of sacrificial anode, and preferential sites of the attack in the corners revealed highly localized acidification below pH 4, which sustained hydrogen evolution at spots of the steel-coating interface.

The interest of the scientific community toward carbon-based nanostructures is justified by the wide range of applications of such multifaceted structures. In the present work, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized, in mild conditions, by using spent coffee grounds as the carbon source. Green-emitting CNPs of about 40 nm were obtained, and they were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, highlighting that they are naturally doped with N, K, Mg, and P. Such intrinsic doping promotes the characteristic green emission; furthermore, the N- and P-doping prompted us to evaluate their ability to photoproduce 1O2 for PDT applications. The presence of heteroatoms in the CNP structure was also used to electrochemically promote the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis.

Alignments used for the positive selection tests performed in the work "Molecular Evolution of the Glutathione S-transferase family in the Bemisia tabaci species complex ".Abstract:The glutathione S-transferase (GST) family plays an important role in the adaptation of herbivorous insects to new host plants and other environmental constrains. The family codes for enzymes that neutralize reactive oxygen species and phytotoxins through the conjugation of reduced glutathione. Here, we studied the molecular evolution of the GST family in Bemisia tabaci, a complex of >35 sibling species, differing in their geographic and host ranges. We tested if some enzymes evolved different functionality, by comparing their sequences in six species, representing five of the six major genetic clades in the complex. Comparisons of the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios detected positive selection events in 11 codons of 5 cytosolic GSTs. Ten of them are located in the periphery of the GST dimer, suggesting a putative involvement in interactions with other proteins. Modeling the tertiary structure of orthologous enzymes, identified additional 19 mutations in 9 GSTs, likely affecting the enzymes’ functionality. Most of the mutation events were found in the environmentally responsive classes Delta and Sigma, indicating a slightly different delta/sigma tool box in each species. At a broader genomic perspective, our analyses indicated a significant expansion of the Delta GST class in B. tabaci and a general association between the diet breadth of hemipteran species and their total number of GST genes. We raise the possibility that at least some of the identified changes improve the fitness of the B. tabaci species carrying them, leading to their better adaptation to specific environments.

Abstract The streamer dynamic evolution and discharge mode transition of three-electrode surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) driven by repetitive pulses are studied experimentally and numerically for better plasma-mode controlling and optimized application. Spatial-temporal plasma morphologic features together with electro-optical behaviors are utilized to analyze the streamer dynamic evolution and streamer-to-spark transition. To have a deep insight into the physical mechanism of the discharge mode transition in repetitive pulses, a 2D fluid model combined with 0D kinetic model is built and studied. A good agreement between experimental measurements and numerical simulation in the propagation dynamics and voltage-current characteristics is achieved. Results show that the surface-streamer discharge in the form of primary and transitional streamers can transform into a surface-spark discharge characterized with the primary streamer, transitional streamer and spark phase in repetitive pulses under the high applied electric field. A high gas temperature will result in a large reduced electric field after the transitional streamer, which exceeds the ionization threshold and thus promotes the discharge mode transition. The most electrons can be released from the negative charges by oxygen atoms during the inter-pulse period, which is favor to the re-ignition and ionization process of the subsequent pulse discharge.

Herein, the control of steel composition and evolution of inclusions during the electroslag remelting (ESR) of NiCrMoV high‐strength steel are investigated by laboratory experiments and thermodynamic calculations. The effects of slag systems, atmosphere protection, and surface quality of the consumable electrode are discussed. Results show that slag containing 5% TiO 2 and 2% SiO 2 is beneficial for controlling Ti and Si losses in steel during the ESR. Using argon gas protection reduces the total oxygen (TO) and nitrogen contents in ESR ingots and improves steel cleanliness, while it has little influence on the types of inclusions. The oxide scales on the electrode surface lead to the reoxidation of liquid steel during the ESR. The TO content increases to 113 ppm and Si, Ti, Als, and Mn contents in ESR ingots are considerably reduced. The inclusions are transformed from Al 2 O 3 –CaO–TiO x –MgO to MnO–SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 –TiO x . Thermodynamic calculations reveal that the decrease in temperature promotes the precipitation of Ca 2 Ti 2 O 5 and Ca 2 Ti 2 O 6 in inclusions. As the oxygen content from reoxidation increases, the formation of SiO 2 and MnO in inclusions in ESR ingots is promoted. Appropriate process parameters are proposed to control the composition and cleanliness of steel during the ESR.

Abstract Background Cetaceans, having experienced prolonged adaptation to aquatic environments, have undergone evolutionary changes in their respiratory systems. This process of evolution has resulted in the emergence of distinctive phenotypic traits, notably the abundance of elastic fibers and thickened alveolar walls in their lungs, which may facilitate alveolar collapse during diving. This structure helps selective exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, while minimizing nitrogen exchange, thereby reducing the risk of DCS. Nevertheless, the scientific inquiry into the mechanisms through which these unique phenotypic characteristics govern the diving behavior of marine mammals, including cetaceans, remains unresolved. Results This study entails an evolutionary analysis of 42 genes associated with pulmonary fibrosis across 45 mammalian species. Twenty-one genes in cetaceans exhibited accelerated evolution, featuring specific amino acid substitutions in 14 of them. Primarily linked to the development of the respiratory system and lung morphological construction, these genes play a crucial role. Moreover, among marine mammals, we identified eight genes undergoing positive selection, and the evolutionary rates of three genes significantly correlated with diving depth. Specifically, the SFTPC gene exhibited convergent amino acid substitutions. Through in vitro cellular experiments, we illustrated that convergent amino acid site mutations in SFTPC contribute positively to pulmonary fibrosis in marine mammals, and the presence of this phenotype can induce deep alveolar collapse during diving, thereby reducing the risk of DCS during diving. Conclusions The study unveils pivotal genetic signals in cetaceans and other marine mammals, arising through evolution. These genetic signals may influence lung characteristics in marine mammals and have been linked to a reduced risk of developing DCS. Moreover, the research serves as a valuable reference for delving deeper into human diving physiology.

Understanding the long-term variance of seawater sulfate concentrations ([SO 4 2- ] sw ) is critical to understanding the dynamic relationship between the sulfur, carbon, calcium, and oxygen cycles, and their influence on Earth's habitability. Here, we explore how [SO 4 2- ] sw has changed throughout the Phanerozoic, and its impact on other elemental cycles. We do this by utilising the biogeochemical box model GEOCARBSULFOR. The model suggests that [SO 4 2- ] sw rose throughout the Paleozoic, declined during the Mesozoic, and then rose once more in the Cenozoic, generally matching geochemical proxies. Atmospheric oxygen mirrors [SO 4 2- ] sw changes during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but intriguingly, decouples during the Cenozoic. We further explored controls on [SO 4 2- ] sw by modifying the modelled gypsum fluxes via the incorporation of evaporite data from the geological record. We find that forcing gypsum burial with the observed evaporite deposition data causes the model to better match proxy records at some times, but worsens predictions at others. Finally, we investigate model reliance on a prescribed record of marine calcium concentrations, finding that it is a dominant control on modelled Phanerozoic [SO 4 2- ] sw , and that removing this control seriously degrades model predictions. We conclude that no model can yet simulate a reasonable evolution of both the calcium and sulfur cycles.

Abstract Lithium-rich layered oxide (LRLO) hold great promise as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, but they face challenges due to their complex electrochemical behavior and structural instability. This study proposes an analysis framework using unsupervised learning via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve the predictability and reliability of these materials. By applying PCA, we have identified key factors affecting their electrochemical performance and degradation mechanisms. This has enabled us to easily separate and elucidate oxygen and manganese redox reactions in the low-voltage range, thereby improving our understanding of how the evolution of these reactions affects the degradation of LRLO materials. The PCA-based approach proves to be highly effective in predicting performance and identifying degradation pathways, making a significant advance in the understanding and optimization of these cathodes. These findings represent a step forward in quantifying the mechanisms of electrode materials, which requires the development of models that integrate domain knowledge with data.

The early Silurian Llandovery–Wenlock boundary interval was marked by significant marine perturbations and biotic turnover, culminating in the Ireviken Extinction Event (IEE) and the Early Sheinwoodian Carbon Isotope Excursion (ESCIE). Here, we apply multiple independent redox proxies to the early Wenlock Buttington section, which was deposited in a mid-shelf location in the Welsh Basin, UK. To account for regional geochemical variability in marine sediments due to factors such as sediment provenance, we first define oxic baseline values for the Welsh basin, utilizing deeper water, well-oxygenated intervals of late Llandovery age. Our approach documents unstable, oscillating redox conditions on the mid shelf at Buttington. We suggest that these dynamic redox fluctuations are likely to relate to changes in the position of the chemocline or a migrating oxygen minimum zone. Benthic biota such as trilobites, brachiopods, bivalves and gastropods appear to have been relatively unaffected by fluctuating oxic-ferruginous conditions, but were more severely impacted by the development of euxinia, highlighting the inhibiting role of toxic sulfides. By contrast, the redox perturbations appear to have placed extreme stress on graptolites, causing many extinction losses regardless of the specific development of euxinia.

ABSTRACT Studies carried out over short time intervals assist in understanding the biogeochemical processes occurring relatively fast in natural waters. High frequency monitoring shows a greater variability in the water quality during and immediately after heavy rainfall events. This paper presents an assessment of the surface water quality parameters in the Atlantic Forest biome, caused by heavy rainfall events. The work was developed in two fluviometric sections of the Concordia River watershed, located in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. The spatial distribution of land use shows the predominance of Atlantic Forest in fluviometric section 1 (FS1) and pasture, forestry, agriculture, and Atlantic Forest in fluviometric section 2 (FS2). In each selected heavy rainfall event, the evolution rainfall height, the water level, and physicochemical parameters of water were analyzed. In all events, the water quality changed due to the heavy rainfall. After the events, an increase in water level and turbidity in both fluviometric sections were detected. In addition, the ammonium ion concentration increased in the river, and the pH value and nitrate concentration decreased. The electrical conductivity presented different behavior in each section. The dissolved oxygen concentration increased in 19 of 27 events. The principal component (PC1) correlated with the turbidity in FS1, and it correlated with level, turbidity, and pH in FS2.

Halogen bonding acknowledged as a noteworthy weak interaction, has gained growing recognition in the field of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we selected structurally rigid diaryliodonium ions (I(III)) with two biaxial σ‐holes as halogen‐bond donors, to bind with three chiral acceptor molecules bearing cholesteryl and naphthalimides with distinct geometries. The abundant carbonyl oxygen atoms in side‐arm substituents function as multiple acceptors for halogen bonding. The self‐aggregation of chiral acceptor molecules demonstrates adaptiveness to solvent media, evidenced by the inversion of the Cotton effect and the morphological evolution from spherical to rod‐like nanoarchitectures in different solvent systems. The distinct geometries of the acceptor molecules conferred various binding modes with I(III). The introduction of I(III) as a halogen‐bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self‐aggregated assembly. This study successfully utilized rational structural design and multimodal control strategies to achieve regulation of supramolecular chirality.

Understanding the explosion mechanism and hydrodynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing quest in astronomy. The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution -- with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the $\texttt{Prometheus-HotB}$ code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling -- circumventing the difficulties of representing $^{56}$Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models -- we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium. Lastly, we turn to the NIR spectra from our models to investigate the potential of using this regime to look for the presence of He in the nebular phase.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Arteriolar tone regulation plays a critical role in maintaining appropriate organ blood flow and perfusion distribution, which is vital for vascular and overall health. Impaired arteriolar function has been associated with the evolution and manifestation of various CVD conditions, emphasizing the importance of understanding arteriolar reactivity. This scoping review aims to explore the interplay between five major regulators of arteriolar tone - metabolism (adenosine), adrenergic control (norepinephrine), myogenic activation (intravascular pressure), perivascular oxygen tension, and intraluminal flow rates. Specifically, the aim was to address how arteriolar reactivity changes in the presence of other vasoactive stimuli and by what mechanisms. The review focused on animal studies that investigated the impact of combining two or more of these stimuli on arteriolar diameter. 848 articles were identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE database searches, and 38 studies were included in the final review. The results indicate that arteriolar reactivity is influenced by multiple factors, including competitive processes, structural limitations, and indirect interactions among stimuli. Additionally, the review identified a lack of research involving female animal models and limited insight into the interaction of molecular signaling pathways, which represent gaps in the literature.

Applying a NOx trap catalyst to effectively remove NOx contaminants from the oxygen‐rich exhaust is still very challenging, due to the lack of use guidance based on deactivation mechanisms. The temperature‐dependent Pt sintering rate constant was described using Pt dispersion determined by pulse CO chemisorption. It was found that 700‐850 ºC was the determining temperature regions for the significant Pt sintering, according to the sintering kinetics and the evolution of active Ptδ+ sites. The weak basicity plays a critical role in trapping NOx at low‐temperature (≤ 300 ºC), and the NOx trap efficiency decreases because of the loss of catalytic activity and medium basicity caused by forming BaAl2O4 phase. The reduction of NOx towards N2 on the Pt crystallites smaller than 18 nm is structure sensitive and decreases with losing the reducibility of catalysts. The security for long‐time use of a NOx trap catalyst should be exposed to the exhaust gas within 750 ºC, and effectively removing NOx contaminants requires it to be worked in the 350‐500 ºC regions. These findings can guide engineers and applied chemists how to efficiently use a NOx trap catalyst in the automotive exhaust purification system.

Egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor (egln), an oxygen-sensing enzyme family, has been thoroughly characterized in mammals and certain fishes, but there is few research on its involvement in reproductive development and hypoxic stress in rainbow trout. In this study, we investigated the gene structure, physicochemical properties, and evolutionary connection of the egln gene family. The expression profile of egln gene family and their regulatory mechanism were explored using bioinformatics analysis and hypoxia treatment experiments. Five egln genes were discovered in the rainbow trout genome in this investigation (egln1, egln2a, egln2b, egln3a, and egln3b). Domain prediction revealed that all egln proteins have p4hc conserved domains, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that rainbow trout egln2 and egln3 were closely related to Atlantic salmon. The results of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that egln genes were generally expressed in all detected tissues, and higher in the ovary, testis, and brain in normoxia. Under hypoxia, the expression level of eglns was significantly down-regulated in most tissues except the liver. Our research contributes to future research on the functional properties of egln genes, as well as the evolution of teleosts and the impact of hypoxia on biological immunity.

Abstract Objective: To clinically and epidemiologically characterize patients receiving home care in the city of Maceio, in the state of Alagoas, Brazil. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional study with a sample of 859 patients was carried out, based on data obtained from the medical records of institutions that provide a home care service. A total of 445 patients were from a public service and 414 were from a private service. Descriptive analysis was used for the demographic, clinical and functional variables. Results: Most patients were elderly, female, bedridden, fed orally and had neurological disorders, with stroke the most common diagnosis. Regarding patient evolution, 16.8% of individuals were discharged from home care, 45% of patients died and 24% were hospitalized during the period of home care. A total of 9% of patients had a tracheostomy, 84.7% breathed room air, 9.3% used oxygen, 4% used noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 1.9% used invasive mechanical ventilation, and 24.9% of patients had pressure ulcers. All patients received medical visits, with 693 receiving nursing care, 767 undergoing physiotherapy, 233 receiving speech therapy sessions, 665 patients accompanied by a nutritionist, 64 undergoing occupational therapy sessions and 98 receiving counseling. Conclusion: It was noted that some results differed from literature and between the public and private service. This divergence could be related to the specific epidemiology of each region and the type of insurance paying for care (Unified Health Service or Private).

Tire wear particles (TWP) are a prevalent form of microplastics (MPs) extensively distributed in the environment, raising concerns about their environmental behaviors and risks. However, knowledge regarding the properties and toxicity of these particles at environmentally relevant concentrations, specifically regarding the role of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) generated during TWP photoaging, remains limited. In this study, the evolution of EPFRs on TWP under different photoaging times and their adverse effects on Caenorhabditis elegans were systematically investigated. The photoaging process primarily resulted in the formation of EPFRs and reactive oxygen species (O2•−, ⋅OH, and 1O2), altering the physicochemical properties of TWP. The exposure of nematodes to 100 μg/L of TWP-50 (TWP with a photoaging time of 50 d) led to a significant decrease in locomotory behaviors (e.g., head thrashes, body bends, and wavelength) and neurotransmitter contents (e.g., dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin). Similarly, the expression of neurotransmission-related genes was reduced in nematodes exposed to TWP-50. Furthermore, the addition of free-radical inhibitors significantly suppressed TWP-induced neurotoxicity. Notably, correlation analysis revealed a significantly negative correlation between EPFRs levels and the locomotory behaviors and neurotransmitter contents of nematodes. Thus, it was concluded that EPFRs on photoaged TWP induce neurotoxicity by affecting neurotransmission. These findings elucidate the toxicity effects and mechanisms of EPFRs, emphasizing the importance of considering their contributions when evaluating the environmental risks associated with TWP.

The single‐atom Fe‐N‐C is a prominent material with exceptional reactivity in areas of sustainable energy and catalysis research. It is challenging to obtain the dense Fe‐N4 site without the Fe nanoparticle (NPs) sintering during the Fe‐N‐C synthesis via high‐temperature pyrolysis. Thus, a novel approach is devised for the Fe‐N‐C synthesis at low temperatures. Taking FeCl2 as Fe source, a hydrogen environment can facilitate oxygen removal and dechlorination processes in the synthesis, efficiently favouring Fe‐N4 site formation without Fe nanoparticle clustering at as low as 360 °C. We shed light on the reaction mechanism about hydrogen promoting Fe‐N4 formation in the synthesis. By adjusting the temperature and duration, the Fe‐N4 structural evolution and site density can be precisely tuned to directly influence the catalytic behavior of the Fe‐N‐C material. The FeNC‐H2‐360 catalyst demonstrates a remarkable Fe dispersion (8.3 wt%) and superior acid ORR activity with a half‐wave potential of 0.85 V and a peak power density of 1.21 W cm‐2 in fuel cell. This method also generally facilitates the synthesis of various high‐performance M‐N‐C materials (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Ru) with elevated single‐atom loadings.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health concern characterised by a progressive alteration of renal function, and obesity, diabetes and hypertension are major risk factors. Oxidative stress is commonly observed in CKD patients resulting from an imbalance between overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairment of defense mechanisms. Therefore, strategies that alleviate oxidative stress may have major clinical implications towards improving vascular health and reducing the burden of CKD. Also, CKD worsens the quality of life of patients, therefore it is fundamental to implement new therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing down its progression. This interventional study is a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial consisting at the daily oral supplementation with high dosing grape seed flour (GSF ≈ 1 g/kg) for experimental (n = 30) or starch for placebo (n = 10) to patients suffering from CKD of various stages and aetiologies. Blood and urine samples were collected at baseline and after a six-month-long supplementation period to follow up the disease evolution through the determination of renal function biomarkers, as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and blood parameters. Supplementation with high dosing GSF was safe and well tolerated during the entire period of investigation. GSF clearly improved the main renal function biomarkers as GFR, proteinuria, blood pressure, oxidative stress and inflammation as well as the overall patient welfare as indicated by several blood parameters. Most importantly high dosing GSF specifically halted and even reversed the progression of diabetic nephropathy a major cause of CKD and end stage renal disease.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in defence response of host plants versus pathogens. While generation and detoxification of ROS is well understood, how varied ability of different isolates of pathogens to overcome host ROS, or ROS contribution to a particular isolate's pathogenicity, remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that transcriptional regulation of ROS pathway, in combination with the insulin pathway, increases the pathogenicity of invasive species Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. The results showed a positive correlation between fecundity and pathogenicity of different nematode isolates. The virulent isolates from introduced populations in Japan, China and Europe had significantly higher fecundity than native avirulent isolates from the USA. Increased expression of Mn-SOD and reduced expression of catalase/GPX-5 and H2O2 accumulation during invasion are associated with virulent strains. Additional H2O2 could improve fecundity of B. xylophilus. Furthermore, depletion of Mn-SOD decreased fecundity and virulence of B. xylophilus, while insulin pathway is significantly affected. Thus, we propose that destructive pathogenicity of B. xylophilus to pines is partly due to upregulated fecundity modulated by insulin pathway in association with ROS pathway and further enhanced by H2O2 oxidative stress. These findings provide a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in plant–pathogen interactions and adaptive evolution of invasive species.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Biotic signalling sheds light on smart pest management’.

Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 phosphors (0–9.0 mol%) were prepared through sol–gel combustion method. The crystal structure, morphology, chemical composition, photoluminescence (PL), afterglow and thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve of Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, PL spectroscopy, afterglow spectroscopy, and TL dosimetry. Characterizations of the PL and afterglow spectra indicate that both Tb3+ doping species and oxygen vacancies act as the luminescence center of PL whereas only Tb3+ dopant works as the luminescence center of afterglow for Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4. The green afterglow of Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 lasts for about 214 min at the optimal doping concentration of about 1.0 mol%. The profile of TL glow curve of Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 heavily depends on the doping concentration, and the evolution of the TL glow curve with doping concentration reveals that doping BaAl2O4 with Tb3+ can significantly modify the distribution of carrier traps in the phosphor. The effects of Tb3+ doping on the PL, afterglow, and TL glow curve of Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 are discussed in terms of the creation, recombination, and neutralization of defects in BaAl2O4. This work proves that doing with Tb3+ species is a general and robust strategy for endowing BaAl2O4 with highly efficient green afterglow. This "defect engineering" approach enables ultra-long afterglow for Tb3+ doped BaAl2O4 when defect centers in the phosphors are optimized.

The interpretation of trace element/calcium ratios of speleothems as indicators of local hydroclimatic variability in the vicinity of caves has led to controversy in reconstructing the evolution of moisture conditions in arid central Asia (ACA) during the Holocene. Here we present records of Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, and U/Ca from precisely dated stalagmites from Baluk cave in Xinjiang (northwest China), spanning the past 9370 years. The co-variations of the trace element ratios, together with the slopes of the regression lines of the corresponding logarithmically transformed data, suggest that they are dominated by prior calcite precipitation (PCP) and thus can be used as reliable proxies of changes in moisture/precipitation. The trace element ratios are relatively high during ~9 to 5 ka and lower from 5 ka to the present, indicating a trend of increasing mid–late Holocene moisture in ACA. The long-term trend of variation of the trace element ratios is correlative with two other records of speleothem trace element ratios from caves in ACA: Kesang cave (western Xinjiang) and Ton cave (Uzbekistan). This spatial coherency of the trend of inferred moisture conditions from three caves that are separated by hundreds of kilometers demonstrates that speleothem trace element ratios are indicative of large spatial scale rather than local hydroclimatic variability in ACA during the Holocene. However, the long-term trend of variation of the trace element ratios is the inverse of the corresponding oxygen isotope (δ18O) records from the same cave sites, which implies that Holocene speleothem δ18O records do not represent changes in the precipitation amount in ACA; rather, they most likely reflect moisture sources and related water vapor transport controlled by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHSI). Our findings provide new evidence for a ‘westerlies-dominated climatic regime’, which influenced hydroclimatic changes in ACA during the Holocene.

A diversity of Devonian-Carboniferous volcanic arcs and granitoid intrusions are exposed in the Gurvansaykhan arc terrane of southern Mongolia. Several giant porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposits are associated with intrusions within these arcs. The Bronze Fox deposit located in the central part of the Gurvansaykhan arc terrane is an example of a potentially economic deposit with affinity of adakite-like granitoid porphyry (i.e. 428 Mt grading 0.26% to 0.30% Cu for up to 2,437 Mlb of copper and 0.84 Moz gold). The genesis and magmatic evolution of the causative rocks of the Bronze Fox porphyry Cu-Au hosting rocks are poorly understood, and different models are still under debate. In the current study, we present new field observations and petrographic, geochemical, and geochronological data to describe the magmatic evolution and geodynamic settings. In addition, the mineral chemical data are reported from some selected rock-forming minerals to identify crystallization conditions of the studied rock suites by employing geothermobarometric methods. Zircon chronological data reveal the emplaced age at 331 ± 3.4 Ma for the volcanic lava, followed by mineralized granodiorite and monzodiorite with intruded ages of 326.5 ± 3.4 Ma and 326.5 ± 2.7 Ma, respectively. The studied intrusive and extrusive rocks are high-K-alkaline and metaluminous, characterized by high Mg#. They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (Sr and Ba) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) and depleted in high field strength elements (Nb, Ta, and Ti) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). The highly mineralized granodiorite intrusion yields zircon crystallization temperatures ranging from 631.8 to 779.4°C, and the monzodiorite intrusion, which contains relatively low-grade mineralization, has a wider range (599.0 to 803.4°C). The formation pressures of the former range from 0.5 to 0.2 kbar, which is equivalent to a depth of 1.38 km based on amphibole geochemical calculations. The results of mineral chemistry indicate that the unmineralized diorite unit was formed under medium pressure (~50 MPa) and high temperature (~750°C) at depths of 6.8 to 7.5 km. Similarities in geochemistry and petrographic features suggest that the igneous rocks probably originated from a similar magma source (i.e. from the melting of ancient oceanic crust and sediments) but experienced different degrees of partial melting or mixing with lower juvenile crust melts. The estimated fO2 values obtained by amphibole chemistry in the granodiorite and quartz diorite of the Bronze Fox copper-gold mineralization range from −13.0 to −11.8 and −13.2 to −10.8, respectively, confirming that these igneous rocks probably crystallized under relatively oxidized conditions above the nickel-nickel oxide (NNO) buffer. Such results yield an overall range between NNO +2.6 and NNO +1.4, which are characterized by high oxygen fugacities and high Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios that reflect oxidizing magma, thus indicating quite promising potential for porphyry Cu-Au mineralization in the region. Based on the findings of this work, we suggest a new tectonic model of arc magmatism that is a response to the subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the early Carboniferous period.

Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) generates ATP, but OXPHOS also supports biosynthesis during proliferation. In contrast, the role of OXPHOS during quiescence, beyond ATP production, is not well understood. Using mouse models of inducible OXPHOS deficiency in all cell types or specifically in the vascular endothelium that negligibly relies on OXPHOS-derived ATP, we show that selectively during quiescence OXPHOS provides oxidative stress resistance by supporting macroautophagy/autophagy. Mechanistically, OXPHOS constitutively generates low levels of endogenous ROS that induce autophagy via attenuation of ATG4B activity, which provides protection from ROS insult. Physiologically, the OXPHOS-autophagy system (i) protects healthy tissue from toxicity of ROS-based anticancer therapy, and (ii) provides ROS resistance in the endothelium, ameliorating systemic LPS-induced inflammation as well as inflammatory bowel disease. Hence, cells acquired mitochondria during evolution to profit from oxidative metabolism, but also built in an autophagy-based ROS-induced protective mechanism to guard against oxidative stress associated with OXPHOS function during quiescence.
