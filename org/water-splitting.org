Hydrogen energy is a strategic emerging industry and the key development direction of the future industry, and is one of the important directions of China's new quality productive forces. Hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions are important electrochemical processes in the preparation and utilization of hydrogen energy, low-cost, highly efficient, environmentally friendly and stable electrocatalysts are the key to economically drive the aforesaid electrochemical reactions. RE elements have unique electronic structures and low electronegativity, which can serve as active sites for electrocatalytic reactions, more importantly, they can act as additives to regulate the electronic properties of active sites, significantly affecting the reaction energy barrier and adsorption energy of reactants, thereby achieving the improvement of electrocatalytic performance. This article mainly introduces the research progress of RE-based low-temperature electrocatalysts in hydrogen energy related electrocatalytic reactions, and also summarizes the mechanisms of the above three reactions as well as the synthesis methods of RE-based catalysts. Therefore, this review has certain guiding significance for the comprehensive utilization of RE elements and further exploration and research of RE-based electrocatalysts.

Abstract Kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on PbO2 deposited glassy carbon disk electrode in methane sulfonic acid (MSA) is analyzed with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, for soluble lead flow battery applications. The effect of concentration of active species (Pb2+), and the electrolyte (MSA) on the OER at the deposited PbO2 layer is investigated. The apparent activation energy of the OER on PbO2, deposited at various overpotential, is obtained from the Arrhenius and Eyring analysis. The apparent activation energy follows a special trend that it increases with overpotential, reaches a maximum and decreases thereafter. This is consistent with the PbO2 specifically deposited from low concentration of MSA (<1M), where the gel layer composed of hydrated PbO(OH)2 is also found. It is observed that low MSA concentration is preferred for limiting the OER at the positive electrode.

Developing efficient catalysts for seawater electrolysis hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for producing green hydrogen. Carbonized wood (CW), a porous carbon monolith, is a promising self-supporting electrocatalytic electrode owing to its environmentally friendly, sustainable, and hierarchically porous properties. However, the impact of different tree species on the hydrogen evolution performance remains unclear. In this study, various types of CWs, including carbonized poplar (PoCW), carbonized balsa (BaCW), carbonized fir (FiCW), and carbonized pine (PiCW), have been selected to investigate their electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution. Among these, the PoCW exhibits superior electrocatalytic HER performance compared to the other CWs, attributed to its electrochemically active surface area, resistance, and the content of oxygen-containing functional groups. PoCW demonstrates a low overpotential of 284 mV and 356 mV at 10 mA cmâ2 in alkaline freshwater and seawater, respectively. Moreover, PoCW shows long-term durability for 100 h in both alkaline freshwater and seawater. This work guides the selection of wood-based carbon monoliths and demonstrates that metal-free, CW-based self-supporting electrodes hold great potential for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution in both freshwater and seawater.

Abstract Iridium (Ir)âbased oxide is the stateâofâtheâart electrocatalyst for acidic water oxidation, yet it is restricted to a few IrâO octahedral packing modes with limited structural flexibility. Herein, the geometric structure diversification of Ir is achieved by integrating spatially correlated Ir atoms into the surface lattice of TiO 2 and its booting effect on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is investigated. Notably, the resultant i âIr/TiO 2 catalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity, with an overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm â2 and excellent stability of 315 h at 100 mA cm â2 in acidic electrolyte. Both experimental and theoretical findings reveal that flexible IrâOâIr coordination with varied geometric structure plays a crucial role in enhancing OER activity, which optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the d âband center of active Ir sites. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the interactive IrâOâIr units can suppress overâoxidation of Ir, effectively widening the stable region of Ir species during the catalytic process. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, equipped with i âIr/TiO 2 as an anode, gives a low driving voltage of 1.63 V at 2 A cm â2 and maintains stable performance for over 440 h. This work presents a general strategy to eliminate the inherent geometric limitations of IrO x species, thereby inspiring further development of advanced catalyst designs.

Manganese oxides have been considered as the most competitive cathode materials for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) on account of their inherent safety, high operating voltage, environmental friendliness, and cost-effectiveness. Unfortunately, the manganese dissolution, inherently poor electronic conductivity, and the sluggish reaction kinetics of commercial manganese-based oxides severely hinder their practical applications. To address the above issues, we creatively developed hierarchical porous Y

Iron cation impurities reportedly enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ni-based catalysts, and the enhancement of OER activity by Fe cations has been extensively studied. Meanwhile, Fe salts, such as iron hydroxide and iron oxyhydroxide, in the electrolyte improve the OER performance, but the distinct roles of Fe cations and Fe salts have not been fully clarified or differentiated. In this study, NiO electrodes were synthesized, and their OER performance was evaluated in KOH electrolytes containing goethite (Î±-FeOOH). Unlike Fe cations, which enhance the performance via incorporation into the NiO structure, Î±-FeOOH boosts OER activity by adsorbing onto the electrode surface. Surface analysis revealed trace amounts of Î±-FeOOH on the NiO surface, indicating that physical contact alone enables Î±-FeOOH to adsorb onto NiO. Moreover, interactions between Î±-FeOOH and NiO were observed, suggesting their potential role in OER activity enhancement. These findings suggest that Fe salts in the electrolyte influence OER performance and should be considered in the development of OER electrodes.

Rechargeable Znâair batteries (ZABs) with nearâneutral electrolytes hold promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices, but they suffer from slow charge kinetics and remain poorly studied. Here we reveal a charge storage mechanism of nearâneutral Znâair batteries that is mediated by formation of dissolved hydrogen peroxide upon cell discharge and its oxidation upon charge. This H2O2âmediated pathway facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at ~1.5 V vs. Zn2+/Zn, reducing charge overpotentials by ~0.2â0.5 V and mitigating carbon corrosion â a common issue in ZABs. The manifestation of this mechanism strongly depends on the electrolyte composition and positive electrode material, contributing up to ~60% of the capacity with ZnSO4 solutions and carbon nanotubes. Enhancing the H2O2âmediated pathway offers a route to higher energy efficiency and durability in nearâneutral ZABs, advancing practical, sustainable energy storage.

Developing low-cost, efficient alternatives to catalysts for bifunctional oxygen electrode catalysis in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for advancing the practical applications of alkaline fuel cells. In this study, Co particles and single atoms co-loaded on nitrogen-doped carbon (CoNC) were synthesized via pyrolysis of a C3N4 and cobalt nitrate mixture at varying temperatures (900, 950, and 1000 Â°C). The pyrolysis temperature and precursor ratios were found to significantly influence the ORR/OER performance of the resulting catalysts. The optimized CoNC-950 catalyst demonstrated exceptional ORR (E1/2 = 0.85 V) and OER (Ej10 = 320 mV) activities, surpassing commercial Pt/C + RuO2-based devices when used in a rechargeable zincâair battery. This work presents an effective strategy for designing high-performance non-precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline environments.

Abstract Developing lowâcost, highly active, and stable bifunctional catalysts is of great significance for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, novel RuâO 3 Se 4 single atoms doped Ni 3 Se 2 /FeSe 2 interface catalyst is fabricated by a twoâstep method for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, RuâNi 3 Se 2 /FeSe 2 nanosheets exhibit excellent HER (43 mV@10 mA cm â2 ) and OER (283 mV@100 mA cm â2 ) activities in alkaline solution. In particular, the mass activity of RuâNi 3 Se 2 /FeSe 2 catalyst is 3593.61 mA mg Ru â1 at 200 mV for HER and 7073.80 mA mg Ru â1 at 400 mV for OER, which is 25.91 and 367.28 times of commercial Pt/C and RuO 2 , respectively. In situ spectroscopy techniques confirm RuâO 3 Se 4 single atoms facilitate the adsorption of intermediates H * and OOH * during HER and OER processes, respectively. Further density functional theory calculations reveal introducing RuâO 3 Se 4 single atoms causes the transfer of electrons from Ru to Ni and Fe atoms, leading to a redistribution of charge at the Ni 3 Se 2 /FeSe 2 interface, thus reducing the energy barriers of rateâdetermining step to â0.37 and 1.92 eV for HER and OER, respectively. This work emphasizes the significant role of single atoms at the interface for overall water splitting.

Abstract Electrochemical waterâsplitting is vital in energy storage and conversion applications. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinders the electrochemical waterâsplitting. Therefore, developing efficient catalysts and understanding the OER mechanism are highly desirable. This study successfully synthesized a new quadruple perovskite oxide CaCu 3 Co 2 Ru 2 O 12 (CCCRO) catalyst exhibiting high OER activity with overpotential 198 mV at 10 mA cm â2 , a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec â1 , and longâterm operational stability with a current density of 500 mA cm â2 for >500 h. The in situ Xâray absorption nearâedge structure (XANES) indicated that a part of highâspin (HS) Co 3+ ions and lowâspin (LS) Ru 5+ ions transitioned to the tetravalent Co (IV) and hexavalent Ru (VI) valence states under OER. However, the Cu 2+ valence state remained unchanged. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the latticeâoxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) rather than conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) is responsible for high OER activity in Ru (VI)âOâCo (IV) network, and that the Cu(Aâ)/Co(B)/Ru(Bâ) three sites synergistically facilitate the OER activity for CCCRO.

Abstract Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is a green and sustainable approach in the synthesis of H 2 O 2 , depending on the semiconductor to initiate twoâelectron water oxidation into hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). However, the photoanodes generally have sluggish charge transfer and a limited number of active sites, which limit the yield and faradaic efficiency (FE) for the production of H 2 O 2 . Herein, Tiâdoped Fe 2 O 3 photoanode with the modification of ZnO passivation layer (ZnO/TiâFe 2 O 3 ) for PEC H 2 O 2 production is developed. The optimized photoanode has shown a high FE and selectivity for twoâelectron water oxidation, achieving a yield approaching 0.56 Âµmol min â1 cm â2 at 1.23 V RHE and an average FE over 80% in the potential range from 1.0 to 1.6 V RHE . Impressively, an unassisted PEC system is designed to generate H 2 O 2 at the ZnO/TiâFe 2 O 3 photoanode while performing an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the Fe(Co)âNC cathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H 2 O 2 production rate of 0.275 Âµmol min â1 cm â2 without applying any additional bias. Moreover, an unassisted PEC cell obtains a longâterm stability of 100 h. This work demonstrates new possibilities in designing efficient and stable PEC assemblies using lowâcost earthâabundant materials for lightâdriven catalysis.

Abstract Highâperformance bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the keystone for the industrialization of rechargeable zincâair battery (ZAB). In this work, the modulation in the spin state of Fe single atom on nitrogen doped carbon (Fe 1 âNC) is devised by Co 3 O 4 (Co 3 O 4 @Fe 1 âNC), and a mediate spin state is recorded. Besides, the d band center of Fe is downshifted associated with the increment in e g filling revealing the weakened interaction with OH * moiety, resulting in a boosted ORR performance. The ORR kinetic current density of Co 3 O 4 @Fe 1 âNC is 2.0â and 5.6 times higher than Fe 1 âNC and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, high spin state is found for Co in Co 3 O 4 @Fe 1 âNC contributing to the accelerated surface reconstruction of Co 3 O 4 witnessed by operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. A robust OER activity with overpotential of 352 mV at 50 mA cm â2 is achieved, decreased by 18 and 60 mV by comparison with Co 3 O 4 @NC and IrO 2 . The operando Raman reveals a balanced adsorption of OH * species and its deprotonation leading to robust stability. The ZAB performance of Co 3 O 4 @Fe 1 âNC is 193.2 mW cm â2 and maintains for 200 h. Furthermore, the allâsolidâstate ZAB shows a promising battery performance of 163.1 mW cm â2 .

Abstract Controlling the adverse effects of global warming on human communities requires reducing carbon dioxide emissions and developing clean energy resources. Fossil fuel overuse damages the environment and raises sustainability concerns. As a resourceârich element, cobalt oxide hybrids have attracted considerable attention as lowâpriced and ecoâfriendly electrocatalysts. Alkaline solutions disperse Co 3 O 4 easily despite its highly stable nature, which arises from the reverse spinel structures of Co. Metal oxides, nickel foam, polymeric frameworks, and carbon nanotubes have been successfully served to combine with the Co 3 O 4 constructions for improving the electrocatalytic performance. To date, no comprehensive study has systematically investigated the relation between the cobalt oxide hybrid's physicochemicalâelectronic aspects and its catalytic features. This review mainly focuses on material design, fabrication, morphology, structural characteristics, and electroactivity, considering the critical factors towards practical applications. The economic impacts of the constructions and their expected contribution to largeâscale utilizations are also demonstrated. Moreover, this research discusses the synergistic effects of crucial electrochemical parameters on sustainable energy production over the Co 3 O 4 âbased hybrids. Finally, some beneficial conclusive suggestions are made based on emerging factors for realâworld application. Future research in the field aiming at developing sustainable and clean energy production technologies can effectively benefit from the findings of this report.

Self-optimizing mixed metal oxides are a novel class of electrocatalysts for the advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we report the self-assembled cobalt and tungsten oxide nanostructures on the lab-synthesized copper oxide substrate via a one-step deposition approach. The resulting composite demonstrates remarkable self-optimization, achieving significantly reduced overpotentials and enhanced current densities. Mechanistic investigations reveal the origins of the boosted OER performance, highlighting substantial enhancements in OER kinetics, the electrocatalytically active surface area, surface wettability, and electrical conductivity. Interfacial restructuring of the electrocatalyst under operating conditions indicates the in situ formation of oxidized cobalt species as true active sites. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) analysis demonstrates the formation of *OOH as the rate-determining step of OER, and elucidates the self-activation mechanism originating from the adaptation of adsorbed oxygen intermediates binding site from tungsten to cobalt. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the self-optimization mechanism and advances the knowledge-driven design of efficient water-splitting electrocatalysts.

Abstract The electrochemical conversion of CO 2 into CO represents a promising strategy for mitigating excessive global greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, achieving industrialâscale electrochemical CO 2 âtoâCO conversion with enhanced selectivity and reduced energy consumption presents significant challenges. In this study, a borateâenhanced molten salt process for CO 2 capture and electrochemical transformation is employed, achieving over 98% selectivity for CO and over 55% energy efficiency without the necessity for complex and costly electrocatalysts. Cathodic CO 2 electroâreduction (CO 2 ER) with the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an overall current density of 500 mA cm â2 using nonânanostructured transitionâmetal plate electrodes at 650 Â°C is coupled. By regulating the electrolyte's oxoâbasicity with earthâabundant borax (Na 2 B 4 O 7 ), a borateâenhanced electrolyte is established that accelerates the overall electrochemical reaction efficiently. This system involved a series of wellâdesigned target borate species (BO 3 3â , BO 2 â , and B 4 O 7 2â ) that acted as mediators shuttling between the cathode and anode, favoring CO as the primary cathodic product. Manipulating the atmosphere above the anode facilitated a spontaneous transformation of borates, further enhancing OER performance with longâterm operational stability over a cumulative period of 50 h, while also reducing overall energy consumption. This work presents a costâeffective strategy for the industrialâscale production of CO derived from CO 2 , contributing to a lower carbon footprint by establishing a sustainable borateâmediated closed loop.

One challenge remaining in the development of Ir-based electrocatalyst is the activity-stability paradox during acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), especially for the surface reconstructed IrOx catalyst with high efficiency. To address this, a phase selective Ir-based electrocatalyst is constructed by forming bridged W-O moiety in NiIrOx electrocatalyst. Through an electrochemical dealloying process, an nano-porous structure with surface-hydroxylated rutile NiWIrOx electrocatalyst is engineered via Ni as a sacrificial element. Despite low Ir content, NiWIrOx demonstrates a minimal overpotential of 180 mV for the OER at 10 mAÂ·cmâ2. It maintains a stable 300 mAÂ·cmâ2 current density during an approximately 300 h OER at 1.8 VRHE and shows a stability number of 3.9 Ã 105 noxygen Â· nIrâ1. The resulting W â OâIr bridging motif proves pivotal for enhancing the efficacy of OER catalysis by facilitating deprotonation of OER intermediates and promoting a thermodynamically favorable dual-site adsorbent evolution mechanism. Besides, the phase selective insertion of W-O in NiIrOx enabling charge balance through the W-O-Ir bridging motif, effectively counteracting lattice oxygen loss by regulating Ir-O co-valency. One challenge remaining in the electrocatalysts for acidic water electrolysis is the activity-stability paradox. Here, the authors report a facile approach to tackle the challenge by introducing a bridged W-O moiety in NiIrOx electrocatalyst, enhancing the efficacy and stability simultaneously.

Abstract The development of new energy conversion and storage technologies has contributed to the widespread use of renewable energy. However, new methodologies for electrochemical energy storage systems remain to be developed. This study presents a facile, low-cost, scalable, and environmentally friendly method for the synthesis of nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructures by hydrothermal methods using lotus root extract. The different volumes of lotus root extract were tested on NiO nanostructures (sample 1, sample 2) using 1 mL and 2 mL amounts of the extract, respectively. Therefore, phytochemicals from lotus extract have influenced the surface morphology, crystal quality, optical band gap, electrical conductivity, and surface active sites of NiO nanostructures. Sample 2 of the NiO nanostructures was found to be highly active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and showed an overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a durability of 30 hours at 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, sample 2 of NiO has shown specific capacitance of 1503.84 F/g at 2 A/g as well as cycling stability over a period of forty thousand GCD cycles. The percentage specific capacitance retention were highly improved up to 100.6%. An asymmetric energy storage device has been constructed using NiO sample 2 as the anode electrode material, demonstrating excellent capacitance of about 700 F/g at 5 A/g. For the asymmetric supercapacitor device, a power density of 20000 W/kg and an energy density of 245 Wh/kg were obtained. In a study of cycling stability for 40000 GCD cycles, it was observed that the asymmetric device retained 96.86% of its specific capacitance. A significant contribution was made to the electrochemical performance of sample 2 of NiO by phytochemicals derived from lotus extract.

Direct electrooxidation of propylene using waterâoxidation intermediates represents a promising route for propylene glycol production. Unfortunately, this economic and environmentally friendly process suffers from low yield and poor Faradaic efficiency resulting from the mismatched oxidative capacity of reactive oxygen species and pronounced side reactions. Herein, we developed an earthâabundant metalâbased nanocluster CuOxâmodified MnO2 catalyst for the efficient electrooxidation of propylene into propylene glycol, achieving a remarkable production rate of 63.0 g/m2/h and 95% Faradaic efficiency at 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxygen vacancyâmediated water activation on CuOxâMnO2 in synergy with the activated interfacial lattice oxygen drove the propylene oxidation to a novel *OOH pathway rather than the traditional *OH route. Additionally, the interfacial interactions intensified the propylene adsorption and polarization for its activation. This work offers new insights into the mechanism of electrocatalytic propylene oxidation and presents great opportunities for the synthesis of commercial chemicals based on earthâabundant metal catalysts and renewable electricityâdriven route.

Electrocatalysis is crucial for sustainable energy solutions, focusing on energy harvesting, storage, and pollution control. Despite the development of various electrocatalysts, understanding the dynamic processes in electrochemical reactions is still limited, hindering effective catalyst design. In situ Raman spectra have emerged as a critical tool, providing molecular-level insights into surface processes under operational conditions and discussing their development, advantages, and configurations. This review emphasizes new findings at the catalystâelectrolyte interface, especially interface water molecule state, during the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in recent years. Finally, the challenges and future directions for in situ Raman techniques in electrocatalysis are discussed, emphasizing their importance in advancing understanding and guiding novel catalyst design.

In the present study, we used a simple and efficient microwave-assisted NaBH4 reduction method to generate unsupported and antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO)-supported metallic iridium nanoparticles (Ir-NPs). The effects of pretreatment on the support and iridium precursor oxidation state in two different salts (IrCl3Â·nH2O and (NH4)2IrCl6) were investigated to produce efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolysis. Electrocatalysts with an Ir loading of 40 wt % supported on pristine ATO and acid-treated ATO were synthesized, and the performance was compared with the unsupported, synthesized, and commercial electrocatalysts. The Ir-NPs loaded on the support surface with 98% reaction yield and narrow size distribution, while without the support, somewhat agglomerated Ir-NPs were generated. A strong metalâsupport electron interaction at the junction of the Ir support, promoting the electrocatalyst stability and activity, was achieved for the supported electrocatalysts obtained from both precursors. The best electrocatalyst has demonstrated an excellent OER activity of 597 A gIrâ1 compared to that of 305 A gIrâ1 for a commercial IrO2 benchmark and a high potentiodynamic accelerated stress test stability (OER activity retention: 76% compared to 31% for commercial IrO2). The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the prereaction strong adsorption of the iridium precursor on the support surface, resulting in postreaction highly dispersed small NPs over the support surface generating strong metalâsupport interaction at the junction of Ir-ATO.AT.

Although iridium-based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, their exorbitant cost and scarcity severely restrict their widespread application. Herein, we introduce a promising alternative to iridium: zinc-doped ruthenium dioxide (TE-Zn/RuO2), which exhibits remarkable and enduring activity for acidic OER. In situ characterizations elucidate that the dynamic cycling of zinc dopants serves as both electron acceptors and donors, facilitating the activation of Ru sites at low overpotentials while thwarting peroxidation at high overpotentials, thus concurrently achieving heightened activity and robust stability. Additionally, the incorporation of zinc induces weakened RuâO covalency, thereby stabling *OOH intermediates and instigating a sustained adsorbate evolution mechanism, dramatically stabilizing the RuO2 lattice. Importantly, the TE-Zn/RuO2 catalyst as an anode exhibits good stability over 300 h at a water-splitting current of 500 mA cmâ2 in the PEMWE device, underscoring its considerable promise for practical applications.

Achieving largeâscale, lowâcost hydrogen production through proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a key strategic direction in the energy revolution. However, the high potential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and acidic environment seriously limit hydrogen production efficiency. RuO2âbased catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their unique electronic structure and exceptional activity in the OER. Nevertheless, their durability remains insufficient for longâterm PEMWE and hydrogen generation. This paper explores the fundamental causes of catalyst degradation and strategies to enhance catalyst stability under different reaction pathways. Additionally, the importance of PEMWE components, including bipolar plates and membrane electrode assemblies, in improving system stability and efficiency is emphasized, highlighting their role in largeâscale applications of PEMWE. Looking forward, research efforts should prioritize the optimization of both catalysts and system components to achieve a balance between performance, cost, and longâterm durability. By addressing these factors, we can unlock the full potential of PEMWE technology and make hydrogen a viable, largeâscale solution for clean energy production.

The direct enhancement of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a magnetic field is a novel strategy for high-efficiency alkaline water electrolysers. The influence of a magnetic field on either electrochemical equilibria or electron-transfer kinetics remains controversial, partially due to the difficulty of eliminating the mass-transfer related effects. In this work, a magneto-electrochemical system, which contains a thin-layer flow cell allowing a forced convection flow, is designed to decouple the magnetic effects on mass transfer from those on the reaction kinetics. When OER is catalyzed by magnetic materials, the active species on the surface, rather than the composition and magnetic property of the bulk material, determine the magneto-enhancement of the reaction kinetics. The enhancement at monometallic active sites follow the order Ni3+ < Co3+ < Fe3+, corresponding to the change in kinetic overpotential (ÎEk) of 2.7, 18.8, and 42.9 mV at 1 mAÂ·cm-2, respectively. It was assumed that a magnetic field acts on the spin moments of active sites, leading to variations in the d-band center and the electrochemical equilibria. Here we show that the magneto-enhancement follows the same trend of the average spin moments in the order Ni < Co < Fe. Thus, the spin state of active sites determines the ÎEk on magnetic electrocatalysts.

Abstract The high overpotential and unsatisfactory stability of RuO 2 âbased catalysts seriously hinder their application in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a Ru@RuO 2 core/shell catalyst doped with atomically dispersed Mn species, denoted as Ru@MnâRuO 2 , is reported, which is prepared by a facile oneâpot method. Detailed structural characterizations confirm that Mn is homogeneously and atomically distributed in RuO 2 shell, which causes lattice contraction of RuO 2 . The asâprepared Ru@MnâRuO 2 exhibits a very low overpotential of 190 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm â2 and an excellent stability of 360 h, far surpassing the control samples Ru@RuO 2 without atomically dispersed Mn dopants and homeâmade RuO 2 nanoparticles without metallic Ru core. With the further assistance of density functional theory calculations, the enhanced OER activity of Ru@MnâRuO 2 is attributed to multiple synergistic effects, including the MnO x âRu (oxide shell) synergy, MnO x âRu (metal core) synergy, and the Ru (core)âRuO 2 (shell) synergy. Besides, the atomically dispersed Mn doping can increase the formation energy of soluble Ru cations, thus leading to the excellent stability of the Ru@MnâRuO 2 catalyst. This work shines light on the design of electrocatalysts with multiple synergistic effects towards efficient acid water splitting.

Bidirectional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are key for molecular oxygen-centric renewable energy transduction via metal-air batteries. Here, a molecular cobalt complex is covalently tethered on a strategically functionalized silica surface that displayed both ORR and OER in alkaline media. The detailed X-ray absorbance spectroscopy (XAS) studies indicate that this catalyst retains its intrinsic molecular features while playing a central role during bidirectional electrocatalysis and demonstrating a relatively lower energy gap between O

The synergistic electrochemical properties of a rational design transition metal oxide can improve its efficiency. However, the optimal synergistic effect of transition metal oxide nanostructures toward energy storage and conversion is still unsatisfactory. Herein, a simple, efficient wet chemical synthesis method is promoted for the incorporation of iron and cobalt ions into the nickel oxide matrix as (FeâCo-doped NiO), with excellent high energy storage and electrocatalytic OER performance. Importantly, the correlation between varying amounts of FeâCo-doped NiO electrodes and catalysts with different surface morphologies, crystallographic phases, and electrochemical activities was investigated. Benefiting from strong synergistic action, rich oxygen vacancies, oxidation behavior, transferred ion diffusion, and morphology, the 5 wt % Fe and Co-doped NiO electrode (5 wt % FeâCoâNiO) exhibit a better specific capacitance of 5419.3 F gâ1 at a current density of 2 A gâ1, which is better than that of the pristine NiO (530.4 F gâ1). Similarly, a 5 wt % FeâCoâNiO//5 wt % FeâCoâNiO symmetric device provides a superb volumetric energy power density (47.9 Wh kgâ1/545.8 WK gâ1). It also demonstrates durable redox cycle life with 92.86% retention after 10,000 redox cycles scanned at a current density of 10 A gâ1. At the same time, a panel consisting of 42 red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a voltage of approximately 1.5 V has been successfully illuminated for five min, exhibiting a high level of illumination intensity. This was accomplished by connecting two symmetric supercapacitor devices in series. This demonstrates the significance of the as-grown 5 wt % FeâCo-doped NiO electrode for commercial applications. Furthermore, compared to the pristine NiO (680 mV and 146 mV sâ1) catalyst, the 5 wt % FeâCoâNiO electrocatalyst shows impressive intrinsic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 50 mA cmâ2 and a small Tafel slope of 85.6 mV decâ1, approving the importance of bimetallic ion doping in water splitting activity. Additionally, the 5 wt % FeâCo-doped NiO nanostructured catalyst presents the highest turn-on-frequency (1.64 sâ1) and electrochemically active surface area (84.75 mF cmâ2) values, thus indicating the specific efficacy of each active site. Also, a 5 wt % FeâCo-doped NiO catalyst has maintained steady performance for more than 115 h. This work offers a deep understanding of the impact of optimal bimetallic doping through the synergistic effect on energy storage and water splitting performance of the NiO electrode/catalyst for commercial practices.

ABSTRACT As for the high sustainable solar hydrogen production via water splitting, transition metal doping on an oxide photoanode in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells has been recognized as an effective approach. However, conventional thermalâdiffusionâmediated doping strategies face the challenge of resolving sluggish catalytic kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its practical utilization for the synthesis of photoanode films. Herein, we introduce facile ultrafast flameâboosted doping of Mo into a BiVO 4 (FL MoBVO) film for 20 s to achieve an efficient PEC OER. Mo elements in a lowâvalence state (i.e., Mo 6â Î´ ) and Mo 6+ are successfully doped into the photoanode, which manipulate the energy band structure, facilitating the downward shift of band edges and promoting the surface catalytic kinetics. Consequently, the flameâboosted Moâdoping results in superior PEC performance in a mild environment with neutral electrolyte without introducing any other additives or coâcatalysts, where the photocurrent density at 1.23 V RHE under 1 sun illumination in pH 7 is outstandingly enhanced, over 9âfold higher than that of a pristine BiVO 4 . The flameâboosted doping induces significantly enhanced photoexcited charge transport and catalytic reaction kinetics performances simultaneously. Our report provides the effective strategy boosting both the thermodynamic and kinetic charge migration properties for sustainable materials.

Ni-Co-based oxides (Ni-Co-O) are promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to their adaptable structures, affordability, abundance, and strong electrochemical performance. While various studies explored the structure-activity relationships and OER mechanisms in these catalysts, comprehensive anode development requires a systematic workflow covering all stages of catalyst optimization. Here, we present an integrated approach for characterizing commercial Ni-Co-O nanomaterials using a combination of analytics during processing, in operando, and post-catalysis to gain insights into parameters influencing anode performance. Key findings include the critical impact of catalyst ink optimization through solvent matrix screening, enabling high-quality electrode layers via ultrasonic spray coating on Ni plates. These Ni-Co-O layers, tested as anodes in alkaline OER, were further enhanced by plasma post-processing, resulting in binder-free surfaces with increased porosity and wettability compared to untreated samples. Notably, plasma treatment also promoted a more redox reversible catalyst structure, improved Fe uptake efficiency, and led to a significantly enhanced OER activity by reducing the overpotential by ~43 mV at 100 mA/cmÂ² compared to untreated samples. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic evaluation approach, from catalyst powder to post-mortem analysis, that enabled us to discover how plasma post-processing can yield binder-free electrodes with superior electrochemical properties.

The production of storable hydrogen fuel through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, marine, geothermal, and wind energy presents a promising pathway toward achieving energy sustainability. Nevertheless, stateâofâtheâart electrolysis requires support from ancillary processes which often incur financial and energy costs. Developing electrolysers capable of directly operating with water that contains impurities can circumvent these processes. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and durable electrolysis of saline water to produce chlorine gas (Cl2) and hydrogen using structurally ordered IrB1.15, synthesized through ultrafast joule heating. IrB1.15 exhibits remarkable performance, achieving overpotentials of 75 mV for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and 12 mV for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities of 10 mA cmâ2. Moreover, IrB1.15 displays a durability of over 90 h towards both CER and HER. Density functional theory reveals that IrB1.15 has adsorption energies significantly closer to 0 eV for Cl and H, compared to IrO2 and Pt/C. Furthermore, inâsitu Raman investigations reveal that Ir in IrB1.15 serves as the active center for CER, while the introduction of B atoms to Ir lattices mitigates the formation of absorbed hydrogen species on the Ir surface, thereby enhancing the performance of IrB1.15 in HER.

Abstract Solar hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production has garnered increased research interest owing to its safety, costâeffectiveness, environmental friendliness, and sustainability. The synthesis of H 2 O 2 relies mainly on renewable resources such as water, oxygen, and solar energy, resulting in minimal waste. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) stands out among various oxide semiconductors for selective H 2 O 2 production under visible light via direct twoâelectron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and twoâelectron water oxidation reaction (WOR) pathways. Significant advancements have been achieved using BiVO 4 âbased materials in solar H 2 O 2 production over the last decade. This review explores advancements in BiVO 4 âbased photocatalysts for H 2 O 2 production, focusing on photocatalytic powder suspension (PS) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems, representing the main approaches for heterogenous artificial photosynthesis. An overview of fundamental principles, performance assessment methodologies, photocatalyst and photoelectrode development, and optimization of reaction conditions is provided. While diverse strategies, such as heterojunction, doping, crystal facet engineering, cocatalyst loading, and surface passivation, have proven effective in enhancing H 2 O 2 generation, this review offers insights into their similar and distinct implementations within the PS and PEC systems. The challenges and future prospects in this field are also discussed to facilitate the rational design of highâperforming BiVO 4 âbased photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for H 2 O 2 generation under visible light.

Abstract The NiFeâoxy/hydroxides (NiFeO x H y ) have emerged as promising candidates for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but suffer from irreversible metal dissolution to pose a great challenge to longâterm stability. Here, a selfâsupported electrode of NiFeO x H y /FeNiO x /SSâA (substrateâetched stainless steel, SSâA; interlayerâamorphous Fe 3 Ni 1 O x oxide; catalytic layerâamorphous Ni 3 Fe 1 O x H y ) is fabricated and presents rare selfâhealing property of surface cracks, as well excellent activity and stability. It is found that crack repair is driven by the redeposition of dissolved Fe and Ni ions from the amorphous interlayer involved in the OER process because no similar behavior is observed in Feâfree and crystalline interlayerâsupported NiFeO x H y . Moreover, the repair performance is dependent on current density and electrolysis time, with 71% of surface cracks being repaired after 72 h operated on an industrial level of 500 mA cm â2 . It needs to be emphasized that the irreversible dissolution of Fe and Ni from the catalytic layer of NiFeO x H y still occurs but is effectively suppressed. It is demonstrated that the construction of an amorphous FeNiO x oxide interlayer in selfâsupported electrodes plays an important role in improving the stability and is expected to open up an opportunity for the design and develop highly efficient and durable alkaline OER catalytic electrodes.

Abstract Rutile RuO 2 is recognized for its outstanding acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and notable cost advantage compared to iridium oxide for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, the unsatisfactory stability of RuO 2 hinders its practical application. Here, we report a lattice modulation strategy to enhance both the OER activity and stability of RuO 2 . Interestingly, the newly synthesized Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 âRuO 2 , with Mo doped first and then Nb, presents the greatest lattice spacing and possesses an overpotential of merely 205 mV at 10 mA cm â2 , which significantly outperforms Nb 0.05 Mo 0.15 âRuO 2 (239 mV), where Nb was doped first followed by Mo, as well as the initial RuO 2 (323 mV). Remarkably, Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 âRuO 2 requires only 1.76 V to achieve 1 A cm â2 and exhibits exceptional stability in PEMWE testing, with a voltage rise of only 58 mV at 200 mA cm â2 for more than 80 h.

Abstract Spin configuration and coordination environment changes have emerged as promising strategies to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. However, achieving the precise and gradual regulation of both spin states and coordination environment to elucidate the structure-activity relationship remains a key priority and is rarely reported. In this work, we successfully induce the gradual transition of spin states of Fe sites from low spin state to a medium spin state and ultimately to high spin state by meticulously adjusting coordination environment within NiFe-MOF, while the Ni sites still keep a low spin state. Experimental and theoretical calculations confirm the precise regulation of spin polarization and electrons migration from the Fe-t2g to the Fe-eg orbitals with a reduced coordination saturation, which optimizes the spin orbital exchange interactions between Fe and Ni ions and facilitates adsorption of reaction intermediates. The NiFe-MOF-D3 with unique NiO6-FeO4 geometric structure exhibits low overpotential of 328 mV@1 A cm-2 and 365 mV@1.5 A cm-2 in alkaline medium. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline electrolyzer also presents remarkable activity (1.77 V@500 mA cm-2) and lower cost ($ 0.94) than the target of U.S. Department of Energy ($ 2.00).

Abstract Developing stable and costâeffective electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting is essential for advancing sustainable hydrogen production. In this work, CuBP microparticle clusters (MPCs) electrocatalyst is demonstrated on a Ni foam substrate, fabricated by using a oneâpot hydrothermal approach followed by postâannealing treatment. The optimized CuBP electrode exhibits impressive activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), showing overpotentials of 49 and 220 mV at 50 mA cm â2 in 1 m KOH, which are comparable to benchmark Pt/C and RuO 2 electrodes. The bifunctional CuBP achieves a cell voltage of 1.52 V at 50 mA cm â2 , outperforming the Pt/C||RuO 2 systems and also demonstrating excellent stability over 120âh operations. At 2000 mA cm â2 , a voltage of 3.12 V is required in CuBP||CuBP configuration whereas the hybrid Pt/C||RuO 2 design exhibits a significantly lower cell voltage of 2.25 V at 2000 mA cm â2 . The superior catalytic behavior of the CuBP electrode can be attributed to the high active surface area due to the microâparticle topology, the optimal balance of Cu, B, and P, and the enhanced conductivity achieved through vacuum annealing. Overall, the CuBP electrode is highly efficient and has significant potential to replace traditional RuOâ electrodes.

ABSTRACT One of the most mature technologies for green hydrogen production is alkaline water electrolysis. However, this process is kinetically limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Improving the OER kinetics requires electrocatalysts, which can offer superior catalytic activity and stability in alkaline environments. Stainless steel (SS) has been reported as a costâeffective and promising OER electrode due to its ability to form active NiâFe oxyhydroxides during OER. However, it is limited by a high FeâtoâNi ratio, leading to severe Feâleaching in alkaline environments. This affects not only the electrode activity and stability but can also be detrimental to the electrolyzer system. Therefore, we investigate the effect of different Niâcoatings on both pure Niâ and SSâsupports on the OER activity, while monitoring the extent of Feâleaching during continuous operation. We show that thin layers of Ni enable enhanced OER activities compared to thicker ones. Especially, a less than 1 Âµm thick Ni layer on an SSâsupport shows superior OER activity and stability with respect to the bare supports. Xâray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals traces of oxidized Fe species on the catalyst surface after OER, suggesting that Fe from the SS may be incorporated into the layer during operation, forming active NiâFe oxyhydroxides with a very low Fe leaching rate. Utilizing inductively coupled plasmaâoptical emission spectroscopy, we prove that thin Ni layers on SS decrease Fe leaching whereas the Fe from the uncoated SSâsupport dissolves into the electrolyte during operation. Thus, OER active and stable electrodes can be obtained while maintaining a low Fe concentration in the electrolyte. This is particularly relevant for application in highâperformance electrolyzer systems.

Mixed-metal nickel-iron, NixFe materials draw attention as affordable earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here nickel and mixed-metal nickel-iron metal-organic framework (MOF) composites with the carbon materials ketjenblack (KB) or carbon nanotubes (CNT) were synthesized in situ in a one-pot solvothermal reaction. As a direct comparison to these in situ synthesized composites, the neat MOFs were postsynthetically mixed by grinding with KB or CNT, to generate physical mixture composites. The in situ and postsynthetic MOF/carbon samples were comparatively tested as (pre-)catalysts for the OER and most of them outperformed the RuO2 benchmark. Depending on the carbon material and metal ratio the in situ or postsynthethic composites performed better, showing that the method to generate the composite can influence the OER activity. The best material Ni5Fe-CNT was synthesized in situ and achieved an overpotential (Î·) of 301 mV (RuO2 Î· = 354 mV), a Tafel slope (b) of 58 mV/dec (RuO2 b = 91 mV/dec), a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 7 â¦ (RuO2 Rct= 39 â¦) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95% (RuO2 FE = 91%). Structural changes in the materials could be seen through a stability test in the alkaline electrolyte and chronopotentiometry over 12 h showed that the derived electrocatalysts and RuO2 have a good stability.

Extended hydrogen initiatives promote the urgency of research on water splitting technologies and therein oxygen evolution reaction catalysts being developed. A route to access a ZrF4 supported high-entropy fluoride catalyst using a facile sol-gel route is presented. The high-entropy character of the catalyst was confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) as well as inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Additional investigations on the local structure were performed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The catalyst shows significant potential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media with a current density of 100 mA cm-2 at approximately 1.60 V, thus outperforming benchmark materials such as IrO2, despite a significant reduction in electrochemical mass loading. A potential mechanism is suggested based on free energy calculation using DFT calulations.

Abstract Acidic seawater electrolysis offers significant advantages in high efficiency and sustainable hydrogen production. However, in situ electrolysis of acidic seawater remains a challenge. Herein, a stable and efficient catalyst (SPTTPAB/IrO 2 ) is developed by coating iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) with a microporous conjugated organic framework functionalized with sulfonate groups (âSO 3 H) to tackle these challenges. The SPTTPAB/IrO 2 presents a âSO 3 H concentration of 5.62 Ã 10 â4 mol g â1 and micropore below 2 nm numbering 1.026 Ã 10 16 g â1 . Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the conjugated organic framework blocked 98.62% of Cl â in seawater from reaching the catalyst. This structure combines electron conductivity from the organic framework and proton conductivity from âSO 3 H, weakens the Cl â adsorption, and suppresses metalâchlorine coupling, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity. As a result, the overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is only 283 mV@10 mA cm â2 , with a Tafel slope of 16.33 mV dec â1 , which reduces 13.8% and 37.8% compared to commercial IrO 2 , respectively. Impressively, SPTTPAB/IrO 2 exhibits outstanding seawater electrolysis performance, with a 35.3% improvement over IrO 2 to 69 mA cm â2 @1.9 V, while the degradation rate (0.018 mA h â1 ) is only 24.6% of IrO 2 . This study offers an innovative solution for designing highâperformance seawater electrolysis electrocatalysts.

This study explores the impact of short-term annealing on the thermal stability and mechanical properties of oxygen-free copper subjected to high-pressure torsion (HPT). Copper samples were deformed through HPT with varying numbers of turns at room temperature and subsequently subjected to short-term annealing at temperatures of 398 K and 423 K. Microstructural analysis revealed that annealing led to grain growth and a reduction in dislocation density, with samples processed with fewer HPT turns exhibiting more significant grain coarsening. The microhardness measurements indicated a reduction in hardness after annealing, particularly at the edges of the discs, suggesting recrystallization. Samples processed with 10 HPT turns demonstrated higher thermal stability and less grain growth compared to 1/2-turn samples. The findings suggest that post-HPT short-term annealing can be used to tailor the balance between strength and ductility in oxygen-free copper, enhancing its suitability for industrial applications.

Copper molybdenum-based selenides (CuMoSe) as promising hydrogen evolution catalysts have been widely applied in the electrocatalytic splitting of water, while their limited active sites and relatively poor oxygen evolution activity restrict their further application as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts. Here, we report a simple hydrothermal method to fabricate rodlike NiCuMoSe arrays on nickel foam (NixâCuMoSe/NF), the morphology of which is determined by Ni2+ ions because Ni2+ can promote the growth of the rodlike structure. Furthermore, the phase transformation from CuSe to CuSe2 is triggered by adjusting the Ni2+ ion content of the growth solution. Due to the morphology control and phase component modulation, the prepared Ni2.5âCuMoSe/NF possesses effective catalytic activities of the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) with overpotentials of 89/183 mV at 10 mA cmâ2 in 1 M KOH, and the cell (composed of Ni2.5âCuMoSe/NF as both the cathode and anode) can provide a current density of 10 mA cmâ2 at a low cell voltage of 1.50 V with a stability of 110 h. This work will advance the development of transition metal electrocatalysts for effective overall water splitting.

Abstract The Glycerol Electrooxidation Reaction (GEOR) is a promising alternative to oxygen evolution in electrochemical processes like hydrogen production and CO 2 reduction. Although GEOR has attracted increasing attention, its oxidation kinetics in alkaline media are not well understood. In this study, electrochemical characterization and kinetic analysis were conducted using nickel foil as the electrocatalyst. Four galvanostatic conditions (1, 3, 5, and 10 mA cm â2 ) were evaluated to study product distribution. Increasing the current density from 3 to 5 mA cm â2 led to a fivefold decrease in formate production, indicating a shift in GEOR selectivity within the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) region. At 10 mA cm â2 , formate remained as major product, followed by glycolate and glycerate, while tartronate and oxalate production were significantly inhibited, reducing the total Faradaic Efficiency (FE) by half relative to 5 mA cm â2 . Rate constants showed increased kinetics for glycerate, glycolate, oxalate, and tartronate as current increased, surpassing formate production at 5 mA cm â2 . Spectroelectrochemical measurements revealed the reaction order for GEOR (Î± GEOR ~1) and OER (Î± OER ~3), showing that GEOR proceeds via a more efficient oxidative pathway, requiring interaction with just one NiOOH species, while OER involves three highly oxidized Niâspecies.

Degradation tests represent a significant bottleneck in electrochemical technology development, occasionally requiring tens of thousands of hours. Thus, reliable degradation forecasting in a short time frame is a game-changer in accelerating the establishment of future electrochemical devices. Herein, we show a multidimensional kinetic model for electrocatalyst degradation by quantifying the relationship among potential, current, and time, applicable under various conditions. Aiming to predict reliable degradation behaviors in shorter experimental timeframes and inspired by modern weather forecasting methods, we integrated Bayesian data assimilation with our model to expedite multidimensional parameter optimization. Consequently, we achieved accurate and robust forecasting of electrocatalyst lifetime by employing oxygen evolution reaction as a representative system: it takes just 300 h to obtain the final lifetime of close to 1000 h even with environmental noise. This data-driven approach can accelerate our understanding of the microscopic electrochemical mechanisms and simultaneously directly bridge this understanding to develop next-generation energy technologies.

Abstract Despite the great success in deploying metalâorganic frameworks (MOFs) as efficient electrocatalysts, the low adoption of operando methods hinders the understanding of underlying mechanism. By leveraging the subtle refractive index evolution, including both the real and the imaginary parts, an entirely new concept of a labâonâfiber operando method and its feasibility for âpristineâimmersionâoperandoâpost analysisâ of electrocatalyts are demonstrated. Concurrent collection of absorption spectra and surface plasmon resonance is achieved by engineering fiberâoptic waveguides to simultaneously induce guided light attenuation and plasmonic coupling. In situâformed Co hydroxide and oxide reactive intermediates in zeolitic imidazolate frameworkâ67 (ZIFâ67) electrocatalyst are optically identified, which shows its underlying selfâreconstruction conversions at different stages during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions, and address the gap in knowledge concerning whether ZIFâ67 is a precatalyst for real catalyst production. This illuminating operando method offers intriguing opportunities to collect all the observables in a single fiber, provides an exciting potential of a new class of device with longâsought integration and miniaturization capability, and is expected to enable the electrocatalysis community to conquer challenges with conducting multimodal operando experiments outside the laboratory.

Abstract The layered double hydroxide (LDH) captivates the starlight of electrochemical waterâsplitting applications due to its stacked layers and larger surface area. A novel approach is reported to integrate CoFeâLDH/NiAlâLDH heterostructure through a singleâstep in situ transmogrification, harnessing the benefits of LDH. The in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that aluminum (Al) doping promotes the formation of highâvalent Co III/IV âO active species concentration in LDH, whereas without Al dopants, the catalyst predominantly exhibit Ni II/III âO species and underperform the catalytic activity. The projected density of states is very close to the Fermi level positions in Alâdoped samples which significantly enhance the electron transfer processes. The MottâSchottky studies confirm that both Al40 CoFe30 and Al60 CoFe20 catalysts are pâtype semiconductors, exhibiting a distinct redox behaviors under applied bias. At positive bias, Al60 CoFe20 undergoes downward band bending (accumulation), and align the Fermiâlevel near the water oxidation potential, which promotes the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The negative bias causes upward band bending (deep depletion) in the Al40 CoFe30, and shifts the Fermiâlevel near the water reduction potential, and hence facilitates hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Overall, this study highlights the importance of manipulating Fermiâlevel alignment in LDH catalysts through strategic metal doping to achieve targeted waterâsplitting reactions.

The development and comprehensive understanding of nickel chalcogenides are critical since they constitute a class of efficient electro(pre)catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and value-added organic oxidations. This study introduces a knowledge-based facile approach to analogous NiE (E = S, Se, Te) phases, originating from molecular Î²-diketiminato [Ni2E2] complexes and their application for OER and organic oxidations. The recorded activity trends for both target reactions follow the order NiSe > NiS > NiTe. Notably, NiSe displayed efficient performance for both OER and the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, exhibiting stability in OER for 11 days under industrially pertinent conditions. Comprehensive analysis, including quasi in situ X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy, in combination with several ex situ techniques, revealed a material reconstruction process under alkaline OER conditions, involving chalcogen leaching. While NiS and NiSe experienced full chalcogen leaching and reconstruction into NiIII/IV oxyhydroxide active phases with intercalated potassium ions, the transformation of NiTe is incomplete. This study highlights the structureâactivity relationship of a whole series of analogous nickel chalcogenides, directly linking material activity to the availability of active sites for catalysis. Such findings hold great promise for the development of efficient electrocatalysts for a wide range of applications, impacting various industrial processes and sustainable energy solutions.

Abstract Iridium (Ir) is the most active and durable anode catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, their largeâscale applications are hindered by high costs and scarcity of Ir. Lowering Ir loadings below 1.0 mgcm â2 causes significantly reduced PEMWE performance and durability. Therefore, developing efficient low Irâbased catalysts is critical to widely commercializing PEMWEs. Herein, an approach is presented for designing porous Ir metal aerogel (MA) catalysts via chemically dealloying IrCu alloys. The unique hierarchical pore structures and multiple channels of the Ir MA catalyst significantly increase electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and enhance OER activity compared to conventional Ir black catalysts, providing an effective solution to design lowâIr catalysts with improved Ir utilization and enhanced stability. An optimized membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with an Ir loading of 0.5 mg Ir cm â2 generated 2.0 A cm â2 at 1.79 V, higher than the Ir black at a loading of 2.0 mg Ir cm â2 (1.63 A cm â2 ). The lowâIr MEA demonstrated an acceptable decay rate of â40 ÂµV h â1 during durability tests at 0.5 (>1200 h) and 2.0 A cm â2 (400 h), outperforming the commercial Irâbased MEA (175 ÂµV h â1 at 2.0 mg Ir cm â2 ).

The study of chemical evolution is of paramount importance for understanding the galaxies evolution. Models and observations propose an inside-out mechanism in the formation of spiral galaxy disks implying a negative radial gradient of elemental abundances when represented in logarithmic scale. However, observed chemical abundance gradients, in some instances, deviate from a single linear negative straight line, revealing inner drops or outer flattenings, particularly in more massive galaxies. This study analyzes oxygen abundance gradients in spiral galaxies based on observations from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Our focus is specifically on examining oxygen abundance gradient profiles, as obtained with data from HII regions, with a special emphasis on the inner radial gradient. We employ an automated fitting procedure to establish correlations between the physical properties of galaxies and bulges and the presence of these inner drops, seeking for potential explanations for these gradient variations. We find that the different criteria used in the literature to distinguish HII regions from other ionization sources in the galaxy, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, significantly impact the results, potentially altering abundance gradient profiles and uncovering galaxies with distinct inner drops. Additionally, we analyze the abundance radial gradients to investigate the impact of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) decontamination on oxygen abundances over the featuring inner drops. We observe that DIG, concentrated mainly in the central regions of galaxies, can modify oxygen abundance gradient profiles if left unaddressed.

Measuring the abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules has been a primary focus in studying the atmospheres of hot Jupiters, as doing so can help constrain the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. The C/O ratio can help reveal the evolution and formation pathways of hot Jupiters and provide a strong understanding of the atmospheric composition. In the last decade, high-resolution spectral analyses have become increasingly useful in measuring precise abundances of several carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules. This allows for a more precise constraint of the C/O ratio. We present four transits of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b observed between 1.45 $-$ 2.45 $\mu$m with the high-resolution Immersion GRating InfraRed Spectrometer (IGRINS) on the Gemini-S telescope. We detected H$_2$O at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3.51. We tested for the presence of CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$, but we did not detect these carbon-bearing species. We ran a retrieval for all four molecules and obtained a water abundance of $\log_{10}(\text{H}_2\text{O}) = -2.24^{+0.57}_{-0.48}$. We obtained an upper limit on the C/O ratio of C/O $<$ 0.95. These findings are consistent with previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.

In an ongoing effort to understand planet formation the link between the chemistry of the protoplanetary disk and the properties of resulting planets have long been a subject of interest. These connections have generally been made between mature planets and young protoplanetary disks through the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. In a rare number of systems, young protoplanets have been found within their natal protoplanetary disks. These systems offer a unique opportunity to directly study the delivery of gas from the protoplanetary disk to the planet. In this work we post-process 3D numerical simulations of an embedded Jupiter-massed planet in its protoplanetary disk to explore the chemical evolution of gas as it flows from the disk to the planet. The relevant dust to this chemical evolution is assumed to be small, co-moving grains with a reduced dust-to-gas ratio indicative of the upper atmosphere of a protoplanetary disk. We find that as the gas enters deep into the planet's gravitational well, it warms significantly (up to $\sim 800$ K), releasing all of the volatile content from the ice phase. This change in phase can influence our understanding of the delivery of volatile species to the atmospheres of giant planets. The primary carbon, oxygen, and sulfur carrying ices: CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and H$_2$S are released into the gas phase and along with the warm gas temperatures near the embedded planets lead to the production of unique species like CS, SO, and SO$_2$ compared to the protoplanetary disk. We compute the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, CS, and H$_2$CS in our model and find that their values are consistent with previous observational studies.

Herein, we report the rational synthesis of porous g-C3N4 co-modified with oxygen (O) and fluorine (F) for the first time. Incorporating colloidal SiO2 during thermal polymerization introduces lattice oxygen, forming CâO bonds, while post-treatment with NH4Â·HF2 establishes CâF bonds. The dual incorporation of O and F elements extends visible light absorption and effectively promotes the separation and transport of photoexcited charge carriers. Consequently, the co-modified g-C3N4 (O,F-g-C3N4) achieves a 13.2-fold increase in H2 evolution rate compared to pristine g-C3N4. This synthesized O,F-g-C3N4 is then dispersed in waterborne polyurethane (WPU) to create an anti-corrosive coating for Q235 carbon steel substrates. Water resistance, mechanical property, and electrochemical characterization analyses reveal that the O,F-g-C3N4/WPU composite coating exhibits remarkable corrosion resistance with a high protection efficiency of 90.23%. This work offers a straightforward approach for developing highly efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts and corrosion-resistant coatings.

Stars with initial mass above roughly 8 $M_ odot $ will evolve to form a core made of iron group elements, at which point no further exothermic nuclear reactions between charged nuclei may prevent the core collapse. Electron capture, neutrino losses, and the photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei trigger the collapse of these stars. Models at the brink of core collapse are produced using stellar evolution codes, and these pre-collapse models may be used in the study of the subsequent dynamical evolution (including their explosion as supernovae and the formation of compact remnants such as neutron stars or black holes). We upgraded the physical ingredients employed by the GENeva stellar Evolution Code, GENEC, so that it covers the regime of high-temperatures and high-densities required to produce the progenitors of core-collapse. Our ultimate goal is producing pre-supernova models with GENEC, not only right before collapse, but also during the late phases (silicon and oxygen burning). We have improved GENEC in three directions: equation of state, the nuclear reaction network, and the radiative and conductive opacities adapted for the computation of the advanced phases of evolution. We produce a small grid of pre-supernova models of stars with zero age main sequence masses of $15M_ odot $, $20M_ odot $, and $25M_ odot $ at solar and less than half solar metallicities. The results are compared with analogous models produced with the MESA code. The global properties of our new models, particularly of their inner cores, are comparable to models computed with MESA and pre-existing progenitors in the literature. Between codes the exact shell structure varies, and impacts explosion predictions. Using GENEC with state-of-the-art physics, we have produced massive stellar progenitors prior to collapse. These progenitors are suitable for follow-up studies, including the dynamical collapse and supernova phases. Larger grids of supernova progenitors are now feasible, with the potential for further dynamical evolution.

Semiconducting heterostructures are considered promising candidates for meeting specific environmental challenges, such as greener or decarbonated production of energy. However, optimizing the performance of these hybrid systems largely depends on the fine understanding of the mechanisms by which they are formed in relation to their mode of preparation. We report herein the synthesis of nanosized semiconducting heterostructures of ZnS@ZnO shell-core nature; this is from well-controlled preformed ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) modified via anion exchange process using (TMS)2S. The formation of these ZnS@ZnO heterostructures has been investigated in depth, shedding light specifically on the sulfidation mechanism and its dynamics. Our study reveals the dynamic evolution of the nanomaterial in the sulfidation process, evidencing that it is both driven by the initial presence of oxygen vacanciesâacting as gateways for sulfur atomsâand also by the action in the medium of (TMS)2S, which as a sulfurizing agent behaves also as an oxygen atom extractor. The structural modification of the preformed monocrystalline ZnO nanomaterial into a polycrystalline ZnS hollow nanostructure occurs via amorphizationâcrystallization steps, which clearly depends on the amount of (TMS)2S in the reaction. This morphological transition to a hollow structure has been followed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 17O), and notably oxygen atoms at the interfaces of ZnS@ZnO heterostructures have been identified and quantified. Consistently, our study clearly establishes the link between the preparation mode of the ZnS@ZnO heterostructures and the modification of their optical band gaps as a function of their composition. The variation in optical properties, and the bowing of the band gap, depends on the sulfidation level, and this mode of sulfidation is clarified step-by-step by a DFT computational approach of surface and interface processes that is fully supported by the experimental characterization (XRD, WAXS, EDX line-analysis, HRTEM, STEM-HAADF) of these materials.

The question as to why deoxidized SrTiO3âÎ´ becomes metallic and superconducting at extremely low levels of oxygen vacancy concentration has been a mystery for many decades. Here, we show that the real amount of effused oxygen during thermal reduction, which is needed to induce superconducting properties, is in the range of only 1014/cm3 and thus even lower than the critical carrier concentrations assumed previously (1017â1019/cm3). By performing detailed investigations of the optical and electrical properties down to the nanoscale, we reveal that filaments are forming during reduction along a network of dislocations in the surface layer. Hence, a reduced epi-polished SrTiO3âÎ´ crystal has to be regarded as a nano-composite consisting of a perfect dielectric matrix with negligible carrier density, which is short-circuited by metallic filaments with a local carrier density in the range of 1020/cm3. We present that electro-degradation leads to a more pronounced evolution of filamentary bundles and thus can generate a superconducting state with higher TC than thermal reduction. These findings indicate that traditional homogeneous models of superconductivity in self-doped SrTiO3âÎ´ need to be revised, and we propose an alternative explanation taking into account the coexistence of metallic dislocation cores with polar insulating regions allowing for polaronic coupling.

Abstract A resistive switching device with precise control over the formation of conductive filaments (CF) holds immense potential for highâdensity memory arrays and atomicâscale inâmemory computing architectures. While ion migration and electrochemical switching mechanisms are well understood, controlling the evolution of CF remains challenging for practical resistive randomâaccess memory (RRAM) deployment. This study introduces a systematic approach to modulate oxygen vacancies (OV) in HfO 2 films of Ag/HfO 2 /Ptâbased RRAM devices by controlling the substrate temperature. At 300 Â°C, the HfO 2 film exhibits a dominant monoclinic phase with maximum OV concentration, which plays a key role in achieving optimal multilevel resistive switching behavior. Selfâassembled nanochannels in the HfO 2 films guide CF evolution, and the diffusion of Ag at inside these films suggests a synergistic interplay between OV and Agâº ion migration for reseting the voltageâcontrolled resistive states. This approach addresses the endurance/retention tradeâoff with an impressive R on /R off ratio of â8000 while demonstrating growth temperatureâdriven OV modulation as a tool for multiâbit data storage. These findings provide a blueprint for developing highâperformance oxideâbased RRAM devices and offer valuable insights into multilevel resistive switching mechanisms, paving the way for future lowâpower, highâdensity memory technologies.

Interactions between magma oceans and overlying atmospheres on young rocky planets leads to an evolving feedback of outgassing, greenhouse forcing, and mantle melt fraction. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the solidification of oxidized Earth-similar planets, but the diversity in mean density and irradiation observed in the low-mass exoplanet census motivate exploration of strongly varying geochemical scenarios. We aim to explore how variable redox properties alter the duration of magma ocean solidification, the equilibrium thermodynamic state, melt fraction of the mantle, and atmospheric composition. We develop a 1D coupled interior-atmosphere model that can simulate the time-evolution of lava planets. This is applied across a grid of fixed redox states, orbital separations, hydrogen endowments, and C/H ratios around a Sun-like star. The composition of these atmospheres is highly variable before and during solidification. The evolutionary path of an Earth-like planet at 1 AU ranges between permanent magma ocean states and solidification within 1 Myr. Recently solidified planets typically host H2O- or H2-dominated atmospheres in the absence of escape. Orbital separation is the primary factor determining magma ocean evolution, followed by the total hydrogen endowment, mantle oxygen fugacity, and finally the planet's C/H ratio. Collisional absorption by H2 induces a greenhouse effect which can prevent or stall magma ocean solidification. Through this effect, as well as the outgassing of other volatiles, geochemical properties exert significant control over the fate of magma oceans on rocky planets.

Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.

The escalating demand for advanced structural materials with superior wear and corrosion resistance in aeronautical and military applications has spurred interest in amorphous alloys, particularly metallic glasses, due to their non-crystalline atomic configurations and exceptional mechanical properties. High-Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) spraying, a high-performance thermal spray technology, has emerged as a robust solution for enhancing the surface integrity of these materials by delivering dense, well-bonded coatings. This study investigates the integration of HVOF in reinforcing amorphous materials, with a specific focus on augmenting wear resistance under extreme mechanical stresses and improving corrosion protection in hostile environments. Key parameters such as particle velocity, flame temperature, and spray distance are analyzed to optimize coating quality while preserving the amorphous phase. The article delves into the microstructural evolution during deposition, assessing the resultant performance improvements through empirical data and computational models. Findings indicate that HVOF reinforcement significantly enhances the operational longevity of amorphous materials, positioning them as viable candidates for high-stress, corrosive conditions in military aviation, defense systems, and aerospace components.

Red supergiants may lose significant mass through steady winds and episodic eruptions in the final 100-1000 years before the core collapses, shaping their circumstellar environment. Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and distant circumstellar material (CSM) can generate shocks, which can energize the ejecta and serve as a key power source during the nebular phase of the SN. In the present work, we investigate the nebular spectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the recently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. This marks the first supernova spectrum captured with WEAVE. In this spectrum, H$\alpha$ exhibits a peculiar evolution, flanked by blueward and redward broad components centred at $\sim\pm 5650\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ from the rest velocity of H$\alpha$, which are seen for only a few SNe to date. These features indicate energy deposition from shocks generated by the interaction of ejecta with a CSM expelled nearly 350 $-$ 640 years pre-explosion. Comparisons of the +363 d spectrum with model spectra from the literature, that include varying shock powers, suggest a shock power of at least $\sim 5 \times 10 ^{40}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ at this epoch. Additionally, analysis of the [O I] doublet, along with other prominent emission lines, provides evidence for clumpiness, dust formation, and asymmetry within the ejecta and/or the surrounding CSM. These emission lines also helped to constrain the oxygen mass ($\approx0.19^{\scriptscriptstyle +0.08}_{\scriptscriptstyle -0.04} M_\odot$), He-core mass ($<3 M_\odot$) and the zero-age main sequence mass ($\lesssim 12 M_\odot$) of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf. The comparison with other Type II SNe highlights SN 2023ixf's unique shock interaction signatures and evidence of dust formation, setting it apart in terms of evolution and dynamics.

Elemental abundances, particularly the C/O ratio, are seen as a way to connect the composition of planetary atmospheres with planet formation scenario and the disc chemical environment. We model the chemical composition of gas and ices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5\,Myr since its formation to study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth, and phase transitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code FEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution and turbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving component interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation and advection of four volatile species: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. We demonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures on the distribution of volatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one species, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total C/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We identify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for planet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide range of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much narrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value of 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that transiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety of disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with directly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk regions. We show that the ice-phase C/O$\approx0.2-0.3$ between the CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines corresponds to the composition of the Solar system comets, that represent primordial planetesimals.

We present numerous aspects of the evolution of the LP 890-9 (SPECULOOS-2/TOI-4306) planetary system, focusing on the likelihood that planet c can support life. We find that the host star reaches the main sequence in 1 Gyr and that planet c lies close to the inner boundary of the habitable zone. We find the magma ocean stage can last up to 50 Myr, remove 8 Earth-oceans of water, and leave up to 2000 bars of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, if the planet forms with a hydrogen envelope as small as 0.1 Earth-masses, no water will be lost during the star's pre-main sequence phase from thermal escape processes. We find that the planets are unlikely to be in a 3:1 mean motion resonance and that both planets tidally circularize within 0.5 Gyr when tidal dissipation is held constant. However, if tidal dissipation is a function of mantle temperature and rheology, then we find that planet c's orbit may require more than 7 Gyr to circularize, during which time tidal heating may reach hundreds of terawatts. We thus conclude that the habitability of planet c depends most strongly on the initial volatile content and internal properties, but no data yet preclude the viability of an active biosphere on the planet.

Hydrogen peroxide is inevitably produced at the hydrogen electrode in both the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) when platinum-based catalysts are used. This peroxide attacks and degrades the membrane, seriously limiting its lifetime. Here we review some of our previous efforts to suppress peroxide production using PtFe as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst and PtCo as a hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalyst. The mechanisms, which involve the chemical reaction of adsorbed hydrogen with oxygen, are examined using density functional theory. The onset of excess peroxide production at 0.1 V above the reversible potential has not been adequately explained thus far, and therefore a new mechanism is proposed here. This involves a unique reaction site including hydrogen adsorbed at (110) step edges adjacent to (111) terraces on the Pt surface, as well as on Pt alloys and other metals such as Rh and Ir. This mechanism helps explain the recent finding of the Wadayama group that Ir single crystal surfaces such as Ir(111) and Ir(110) produce little peroxide during the HOR. It also points the way toward the design of new catalysts for the hydrogen electrode that suppress peroxide production while retaining high HOR and HER activity.

Using the atmospheric pulsation code written by George Bowen, we have performed a parameter study examining the effects of modifying various parameters of models of oxygen-rich AGB atmospheres pulsating in the fundamental and first-overtone modes. For each pulsation mode, we have examined the effects of adjusting the dust condensation temperature, dust condensation temperature range, pulsation amplitude, dust opacity, and metallicity. Our model grids are generated with the constraint that their luminosities are chosen to span the range of observed mass loss rates at a chosen mass. The dust condensation temperature, pulsation amplitude, and dust opacity have strong effects on the ultimate location and shape of the final model grids in the mass luminosity plane. The mass loss rate evolution of the fundamental and first-overtone mode models show a significant difference in behavior. While the fundamental mode models exhibit the typically assumed powerâlaw relation with mass and luminosity, the first-overtone mode models show significant non-power law behavior at observed mass loss rates. Effectively, models in the first-overtone mode require somewhat higher luminosities to reach the same mass loss rates seen in fundamental mode models of the same mass, consistent with observed AGB stars.

Electrochemical humidity (ECH) sensors that integrate power generation and humidity sensing have attracted great research attention in recent years. However, the design of high-performance ECH sensors faces many challenges. Namely, the working mechanism of the ECH sensors is still controversial, and related self-powered applications have not been well implemented. To overcome these limitations, this study constructs an ECH sensor with high power-generation and humidity-sensing performance using the KCl/carbon black/halloysite nanotubes (KCl/CB/HNTs) as a humidity-sensing electrolyte. The proposed ECH sensor has a wide humidity-sensing response of 10.9%-91.5% relative humidity (RH), and a single ECH sensor can output 1.46 V with a maximum power of 133.2 Î¼W at 91.5% RH. Particularly, the unprecedented mixed chemical reactions at the positive electrode, including the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction, are analyzed using multiple characterization and testing techniques. The analysis results provide solid experimental evidence for the current controversial working mechanism of ECH sensors. Due to the advantage of high-power generation, the proposed ECH sensor can be used for self-powered humidity detection. This study provides a valuable reference for improving the power generation of ECH sensors and solid evidence for clarifying their working mechanism, which could be beneficial for guiding the future development of ECH sensors.

ABSTRACT Polymerâderived SiOC materials are widely regarded as a new generation of anodes owing to their high specific capacity, low discharge platform, tunable chemical/structural composition, and good structural stability. However, tailoring the structure of SiOC to improve its electrochemical performance while simultaneously achieving elemental doping remains a challenge. Besides, the lithium storage mechanism and the structural evolution process of SiOC are still not fully understood due to its complex structure. In this study, a hollow porous SiOCN (HpâSiOCN) featuring abundant oxygen defects is successfully prepared, achieving both the creation of a hollow porous structure and nitrogen element doping in one step, finally enhancing the structural stability and improving the lithium storage kinetics of HpâSiOCN. In addition, the formation of a fully reversible structural unit, SiO 3 CâN, through the chemical interaction between N and Si/C, showcases a strong lithium adsorption capacity. Taking advantage of these combined benefits, the asâprepared HpâSiOCN electrode delivers a reversible specific capacity of 412 mAh g â1 (93% capacity retention) after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g â1 and exhibited only 4% electrode expansion. This work offers valuable mechanistic insights into the synergistic optimization of elemental doping and structural design in SiOC, paving the way for advanced developments in battery technology.

Abstract Phosphorus (P) availability throughout geologic time has likely impacted the co-evolution of life and Earthâs environments. Phylogenetic data suggest that phosphate was the primary P-source for microbial life during the Archean, but phosphite, a reduced form of P, became relatively more important leading up towards the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) in the Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic. However, seawater phosphite concentrations during this time, and the potential processes driving this shift in P utilization, are unknown. Here, we performed laboratory experiments simulating the precipitation of banded iron formations (BIFs) as hydrous ferric oxyhydroxides (HFO) in deionized water, diluted seawater, and seawater containing phosphate and phosphite. We also measured phosphite concentrations in BIF samples from four Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic formations. Our results indicate a weaker removal of phosphite compared to phosphate by HFO irrespective of solution chemistry. Paired with measurements of phosphite (up to 0.05â250 ppm) in BIFs, we estimate that seawater phosphite concentration at the onset of the GOE could have reached up to 0.01â0.17 ÂµM. We propose that the preferential removal of phosphate relative to phosphite by HFO, coupled with microbial competition for P facilitated by oxygenic photosynthesis, might have created phosphate-depleted environments, prompting life to exploit alternative P sources such as phosphite.

The anthropogenic influences of historical shipwrecks on the marine environment remain largely uncharacterized, particularly for wrecks located at depths of ~50 meters and lost over 80 years ago. Below 50 meters, the marine environment transitions from the euphotic to the mesophotic zone, where reduced light, significant changes in oxygen levels, and increased pressure may alter microbial communities and metabolic pathways. Understanding these shifts can provide insights into the adaptation and evolution of microorganisms. Sediment samples were collected by a team of divers from nine wreck sites off the coast of Malta, varying in depth from 5 to 100 meters. All sampling was conducted with the consent and authorization of the Government of Malta for the collection of marine genetic resources. Chemical analyses and metabarcoding techniques were employed to assess how shipwrecks influence microbial diversity and community composition in the surrounding sediments. Alpha ( Î± ) diversity of microbial communities was higher in sediments adjacent to the shipwrecks compared to those collected over 100 meters away from any wreck site. Across all nine wreck sites, sediment size emerged as the most significant driver of microbial diversity, followed by frame type and the presence of oil leaks. This study demonstrates that shipwrecks, varying in depth, frame type, and country of origin, significantly influence the microbial ecosystems and sediment chemistry of their surrounding environment. The findings suggest that shipwrecks act as focal points for ecological and chemical changes, contributing to the dynamic interactions between historical artifacts and marine ecosystems.

As global energy consumption continues to rise, mitigating anthropogenic climate change demands the search for carbon-neutral energy sources to cut down on our reliance on fossil fuels. Sunlight-driven water splitting using particulate photocatalysts represents a promising and sustainable approach for the large-scale production of green H2. In their Frontiers in Science Lead Article, Hisatomi and colleagues [1] provide comprehensive yet succinct insights that lay a crucial foundation for the development of future H2 generation systems through particulate photocatalysis. They focus on key aspects such as photocatalyst stability, efficient H2 recovery, the safe design of reactor systems, and advancement in technologies for the separate production of H2 and O2 from H2O. The authors have developed heterogeneous photocatalysts capable of efficiently splitting H2O into H2 and O2 in the near-UV region, highlighting the ideal structure and properties of cocatalyst/photocatalyst hybrid systems for overall water splitting (OWS) [2]. Photocatalyst materials have also been identified to split H2O with longer wavelengths of visible light, but their apparent quantum yield (AQY) values remain low, mainly due to difficulties in fine-tuning their material properties [3]. New techniques have been introduced to harness visible light for Z-scheme OWS by combining distinct photocatalysts. In addition, efforts are underway to develop reactors for large-scale applications and routes to extract pure H2 from oxyhydrogen mixture saturated with H2O vapor [4]. The authors finally emphasized the importance of creating standardized methods for measuring solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency, stressing that leading researchers in photocatalysis should drive this initiative, given its current low technology readiness level. The notable progress highlighted largely stems from over four decades of research in the field of OWS, with much of this work spearheaded by the authors themselves. At this pivotal juncture, where there is an unprecedented demand for scalable solar fuel production technologies, the influence of their research is anticipated to extend far beyond the scope of solar-driven catalysis and engineering, impacting a broad spectrum of industries. This viewpoint endeavors to spark a critical discussion on the challenges associated with translating laboratory success into largescale implementation of photocatalytic OWS.Current maximum STH efficiencies for photocatalytic OWS systems are close to 1%, attained under laboratory conditions with constrained testing durations and remain considerably distant from real-world settings. In 2021, Domen et al. conducted a large-scale experiment (on a 100 m 2 scale) by immobilizing Al doped SrTiO3 photocatalysts on panels and generating 600 L of H2 on a sunny day using a commercial separation membrane, reaching an optimal STH efficiency of 0.76%. This work highlights both the potential for safely generating H2 on a large scale and the significant challenges facing its actual application [4]. While the reported system can continuously produce H2, the current efficiency levels are still insufficient to make this technology viable for large-scale H2 production at this stage. Thus, realizing higher solar-toenergy conversion efficiencies remain the primary focus to make practical implementation of photocatalytic OWS feasible. In the search for suitable photocatalysts, an absorption limit over 600 nm coupled with an AQY value exceeding 60% are the necessary benchmarks for reaching the goal of 10% STH efficiency [5]. Conversely, band gap (Eg) reduction diminishes the ability of photocatalysts to facilitate redox reactions. Hence, it is crucial to strike a balance between lowering the Eg to extend light absorption and increasing it to generate stronger driving potential to promote H2O splitting. Metal (oxy)nitrides and oxysulfides have been shown to be effective for photocatalytic OWS under light with wavelengths up to 600 nm. However, these photocatalysts generally display low efficiencies and limited chemical stability. Recent progress on metal-free carbon nitride photocatalysts for H2O splitting presents a promising alternative to these inorganic semiconductors [6,7].Enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency typically involves hybridizing photocatalysts with cocatalysts. These cocatalyst materials assist in carrier separation and transport while providing active sites and speeding up water-splitting reactions [8]. However, most photocatalysts for OWS rely on rare or expensive materials, such as platinum-group metals and other toxic inorganic components, as cocatalysts. This dependence on scarce resources limits scalability and increases costs, raising sustainability issues. For instance, Rh@CrOx (or Rh-Cr mixed oxide) and Ru/Ir-based oxides serve as cocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in these systems. Another concern is that the CrOx shell could potentially leach Cr 6+ ions during prolonged photo-irradiation, leading to not only catalyst deactivation but also environmental harm and health risks [9]. Although these rare and hazardous materials are used in minimal amounts, their inclusion still presents economic and environmental challenges. Given the limited production capacities of noble metals, widespread adoption of photocatalytic OWS technology could cause substantial market price increases due to rising demand and expectations. As highlighted in the lead article, precious cocatalyst materials can be recycled using standard metal recovery processes once the photocatalyst's lifecycle is complete. Nonetheless, there is a pressing need to develop cost-effective, earthabundant cocatalysts that offer performance similar to noble metals to eliminate the need for additional recycling steps. If using noble metals is necessary, one possible solution is to alloy at least one platinum-group metal with another or with a more widely available metal.Bimetallic systems can alter their electronic structure, resulting in a catalytic performance that surpasses that of their individual parent metals [10].Author 1 et al. Short title/running header 6 Similar to the previous concerns with cocatalysts, although immobilizing photocatalysts on substrates or sheets has demonstrated scalability and effectiveness in advancing OWS, attention must also be directed toward the disposal problems related to future water-splitting systems. Although the scalability and efficiency of photocatalysts are well established, it is of equal importance to probe how to address their environmental impact. Again, the key question is that can photocatalysts and other essential components in these systems be restored or regenerated? More specifically, the photocatalysts should endure multiple operational cycles with only minor losses in efficiency. Developing recycling protocols that do not involve dismantling the entire system can be an excellent solution to minimize operating and maintenance costs. Materials approaching the end of their service life must be disposed of correctly to mitigate environmental and health risks.Lastly, one of the biggest challenges in the practical implementation of photocatalytic OWS systems is integrating them with existing energy infrastructures, especially when it comes to safely storing and transporting generated H2 to avoid contamination and operational risks.Hisatomi et al. emphasized that after H2 is separated and recovered, it can be used in various catalytic reactions to create other value-added chemicals and fuels. This approach is more practical for safe handling and transportation compared to managing H2 as the final product [1]. In this context, governments will play a crucial role in setting safety and environmental standards for the secure production, storage, and potential transport of surplus H2. Investments in key infrastructures by governments will further accelerate the adoption of photocatalytic OWS. Strong political commitment is crucial for implementing regulations and policies, such as setting H2 production standards and providing tax incentives, to make green H2 more competitive-similar to the approach taken with other emerging technologies. For example, Germany's National Hydrogen Strategy envisions a comprehensive H2 infrastructure by 2030. This involves plans to build over 1,800 kilometers of new and repurposed pipelines dedicated In summary, although significant progress has been made in photocatalytic OWS technology, challenges remain, particularly in achieving higher STH efficiencies and addressing both economic and environmental sustainability concerns. The development of cost-effective, earthabundant photocatalysts and cocatalysts, alongside standardized methods for efficiency measurement, will be crucial for the future scalability of these systems. Furthermore, the environmental impact of the future water-splitting systems must be thoroughly investigated in order to ensure their sustainability, minimize potential ecological risks, and create efficient recycling and disposal protocols that comply with environmental safety regulations. With continued research, political support, and partnerships between industries, the shift from laboratory breakthroughs to scalable photocatalytic H2 production systems holds promise for contributing to global decarbonization efforts.

Abstract. Within the oligotrophic subtropical oceans, summertime DIC drawdown despite nutrient limitation in surface waters and subsurface oxygen consumption in the absence of Redfieldian stoichiometric nitrate release are two phenomena still awaiting a full mechanistic characterization. The distribution, intensity and seasonality of these phenomena are identified with preformed nitrate as a tracer, where negative preformed nitrate (NPN) anomalies below the euphotic zone correspond to oxygen consumption without Redfieldian NO3- release, and positive performed nitrate (PPN) anomalies found within the upper 100 m occur where O2 is produced without stoichiometric NO3- drawdown. Â Many processes that may contribute to these anomalies including N2 fixation, non-Redfieldian DOM cycling, vertically migrating phytoplankton, heterotrophic NO3- uptake and vertical NO3- injection events have been measured or modelled, yet generally cannot fully account for the magnitudes of preformed nitrate anomalies and excess DIC drawdown observed in many oligotrophic subtropical waters. One other candidate process thatÂ may contribute to both phenomena is the formation of carbon-rich transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie-stainable particles (CSP) from dissolved organic precursors in surface waters and their subsequent remineralization below the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). However, few data exist to quantify exopolymer production and vertical distributions in oligotrophic oceans over an annual cycle, which is necessary to understand their potential role in the evolution of seasonal preformed nitrate anomalies and DIC drawdown. To investigate the significance of exopolymer formation and export to North Pacific subtropical gyre biogeochemistry, we undertook a multi-year time-series (Jan 2020 â Sep 2022) analysis of TEP, CSP and total dissolved polysaccharides concentrations at Station ALOHA (22Â° 45â,158Â° W), and along a transect from 22Â° 45â to 31Â° N to measure latitudinal variability in June 2021.Â  Exopolymer C:N stoichiometry at Station ALOHA varied between 16.4 â 34.3, with values being more carbon-rich in summer; ratios were higher (32â38) toward the gyre centre at 31Â° N. TEP concentrations were consistently elevated in surface waters through SpringâAutumn (4â8 ÂµM C after carbon conversion) at Station ALOHA with lower concentrations (~1.5â3 ÂµM C)Â  and more uniform vertical distribution during winter, indicating that TEP accumulated in surface waters may vertically sink and be exported with winter mixing. The accumulation of TEP in surface waters through SpringâAutumn and its subsequent export may account for 6.5â20 % of net community production (NCP), helping reduce the estimated imbalance of N supply and N demand at this site to <10 %. The upper ocean TEP cycle may explain 22â67 % of the observed PPN/NPN anomalies, helping to close the C, N, and O2 budgets at station ALOHA, while leaving room for significant contributions from other processes such as vertically migrating phytoplankton and heterotrophic nitrate uptake to be further validated. These results suggest that exopolymer production and cycling may be more important to open ocean carbon biogeochemistry than previously expected, with considerable seasonality and spatial variability influenced by physical processes and phytoplankton activity.

CASE REPORT An 80-year-old man with a history of ischemic heart disease presented with hematemesis, retrosternal chest pain, dysphagia, and weight loss. His medication included tramadol hydrochloride, which was recently added for lower back pain, and various cardiovascular drugs. He did not have a history of gastrointestinal disease nor did he smoke or drink alcohol. On examination, his blood pressure was 165/103 mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%. Laboratory tests revealed a low hemoglobin level and elevated C-reactive protein and lactate. Imaging showed an esophageal mass with severe narrowing and suspected malignancy (Figure 1).Figure 1.: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Panel (A) Coronal, Panel (B) Axial. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showing an eccentric esophageal tumor on the left at carina level with severe narrowing of the lumen (white arrows).The patient underwent an endoscopy, revealing a large, necrotic lesion highly suspicious for a tumoral mass (Figure 2, panel A-C). However, a second endoscopy the next day showed multiple deep ulcerations, suggesting severe pill-induced esophagitis rather than a neoplasm (Figure 2). Biopsies confirmed ulcerative esophagitis with polarizable foreign material, consisting with the diagnosis of pill-induced esophagitis, but no malignancy (Figure 3). The esophagitis was suspected to be attributed to tramadol, which can impair esophageal motility and prolong medication transit time.1Figure 2.: Panel (A), (B), and (C) (from proximal to distal): first esophagogastroduodenoscopy with documentation of a bulky and necrotic tumoral lesion starting midesophageal over a length of 15 cm distally, obliterating the entire lumen. Panel (C) showing large blood clot formation more distally in the esophagus. Panel (D), (E), and (F): second esophagogastroduodenoscopy with documentation of multiple very deep ulcerations (black arrow) with the impression of fistula (white arrow). Adherent to the ulcerations, large clot formation could be seen. Panel (G), (H), and (I): third esophagogastroduodenoscopy with documentation of ongoing positive evolution of the esophagus with the presence of large superficial ulcerations (black arrow). Panel (J), (K), and (L): fourth esophagogastroduodenoscopy at 1 month after the initial presentation with documentation of healing of the previously documented extensive ulcerations. Presence of some superficial mucosal tears (black arrow).Treatment involved proton-pomp inhibitors and discontinuing tramadol, with follow-up endoscopies showing progressive healing. This case underscores the importance to consider pill-induced esophagitis in patients with odynophagia, dysphagia, retrosternal chest pain, or hematemesis and to rule out malignancy. Pill-induced esophagitis has an excellent prognosis after conservative treatment.2,3Figure 3.: TopâHematoxylin and eosin stain (Ã40).
