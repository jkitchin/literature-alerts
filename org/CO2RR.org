CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to generate valuable chemicals in acidic electrolytes can improve the carbon utilization rate in comparison to that under alkaline conditions. However, the thermodynamically more favorable hydrogen evolution reaction under an acidic electrolyte makes the CO2RR a big challenge. Herein, robust metal phthalocyanine(Pc)-based (M = Ni, Co) conductive metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) connected by strong metal tetraaza[14]annulene (TAA) linkage, named NiPc–NiTAA and NiPc–CoTAA, are designed and synthesized to apply in the CO2RR in acidic electrolytes for the first time. The optimal NiPc–NiTAA exhibited an excellent Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 95.1% and a CO partial current density of 143.0 mA cm–2 at −1.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in an acidic electrolyte, which is 3.1 times that of the corresponding metal–organic framework NiPc–NiN4. The comparison tests and theoretical calculations reveal that in-plane full π–d conjugation MCOF with a good conductivity of 3.01 × 10–4 S m–1 accelerates migration of the electrons. The NiTAA linkage can tune the electron distribution in the d orbit of metal centers, making the d-band center close to the Fermi level and then activating CO2. Thus, the active sites of NiPc and NiTAA collaborate to reduce the *COOH formation energy barrier, favoring CO production in an acid electrolyte. It is a helpful route for designing outstanding conductive MCOF materials to enhance CO2 electrocatalysis under an acidic electrolyte.

Carbon-loaded metal nanoparticles (NPs) are widely employed as functional materials for electrocatalysis. In this study, a rapid thermal shock method was developed to load various metal nanoparticles onto carbon supports. Compared to conventional pyrolysis processes, Joule heating enables rapid heating to elevated temperatures within a short period, effectively preventing the migration and aggregation of metal atoms. Simultaneously, the anchoring effect of defective carbon carriers ensures the uniform distribution of NPs on the carbon supports. Additionally, nitrogen doping can significantly enhance the electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix and strengthen the metal-carbon interactions, thereby synergistically improving catalyst performance. When used as electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, bismuth-, indium-, and tin/carbon-carrier-based catalysts exhibit excellent Faraday efficiencies of 92.8%, 86.4%, and 73.3%, respectively, for formate generation in flow cells. The influence of different metals and calcination temperatures on catalytic performance was examined to provide valuable insights into the rational design of carbon-based electrocatalysts with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

Electrochemical H2 generation and CO2 reduction address the energy and environmental crisis plaguing the world. An efficient electrocatalyst would require the lowest overpotential for these reactions. Given its position on the volcano plot near platinum, palladium presents itself as a viable alternative for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the activity is limited by a high overpotential. It is also a good electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to the favorable position of the d-band center. Nevertheless, the CO poisoning of the active site results in low electrocatalytic stability. Herein, we report a Ni-incorporated palladium catalyst, NiPd, which reduces water to H2 at a very low overpotential of 25 mV (η10). Furthermore, it reduces CO2 to formate with a very high faradaic efficiency of 97% at a potential of −0.25 V (vs RHE). DFT studies show that Ni inclusion leads to the facile activation of CO2 due to a bent adsorption configuration at the catalyst surface. The NiPd catalyst exhibits a strong and stable performance for HER (400 h) as well as for CO2RR (9 h) with high structural integrity as proven by postreaction characterization studies.

Abstract Exploration of molecular catalysts with the atomic‐level tunability of molecular structures offers promising avenues for developing high‐performance catalysts for the electrochemical co‐reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrite (NO 2 − ) into value‐added urea. In this work, a binuclear cobalt phthalocyanine (biCoPc) catalyst is prepared through chemical synthesis and applied as a C─N coupling catalyst toward urea. Achieving a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 47.4% for urea production at –0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), this biCoPc outperforms many known molecular catalysts in this specific application. Its unique planar macromolecular structure and the increased valence state of cobalt promote the adsorption of nitrogenous and carbonaceous species, a critical factor in facilitating the multi‐electron C─N coupling. Combining highly sensitive in situ attenuated total reflection surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the linear adsorbed CO (CO L ) and bridge adsorbed CO (CO B ) is captured on biCoPc catalyst during the co‐reduction reaction. CO B , a pivotal intermediate in the co‐reduction from CO 2 and nitrite to urea, is evidenced to be labile and may be attacked by nitrite, promoting urea production. This work demonstrates the importance of designing molecular catalysts for efficient co‐reduction of CO 2 and nitrite to urea.

Abstract Emissions of microbially produced methane from lake sediments are a major source of this potent greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. The rates of methane production and emission are believed to be influenced by electron acceptor distributions and organic carbon contents, which in turn are affected by anthropogenic inputs of nutrients leading to eutrophication. Here we investigate how eutrophication influences the abundance and community structure of methane producing Archaea and methanogenesis pathways across time-resolved sedimentary records of five Swiss lakes with well-characterized trophic histories. Despite higher methane concentrations which suggest higher methanogenic activity in sediments of eutrophic lakes, abundances of methanogens were highest in oligotrophic lake sediments. Moreover, while the methanogenic community composition differed significantly at the lowest taxonomic levels (OTU), depending on whether sediment layers had been deposited under oligotrophic or eutrophic conditions, it showed no clear trend in relation to in situ distributions of electron acceptors. Remarkably, even though methanogenesis from CO2-reduction was the dominant pathway in all sediments based on carbon isotope fractionation values, taxonomic identities, and genomes of resident methanogens, CO2-reduction with hydrogen (H2) was thermodynamically unfavorable based on measured reactant and product concentrations. Instead, strong correlations between genomic abundances of CO2-reducing methanogens and anaerobic bacteria with potential for extracellular electron transfer suggest that methanogenic CO2-reduction in lake sediments is largely powered by direct electron transfer from syntrophic bacteria without involvement of H2 as an electron shuttle.

Abstract Due to new environmental and cost challenges in the oil and gas industry, operators are looking for solutions to save costs and reduce their CO2 footprint. The main objective of this project was to find a solution to save time in the plug and abandonment (P&A) operation and reduce the CO2 footprint in a manner that can be applied in future P&A operations in the Norwegian Waters. The first step was to perform a detailed engineering analysis of the new solution, comparing it with the standard P&A technique. Technical requirements, associated costs, additional risks, equipment, NORSOK D010 requirements and blend designs were considered. After this analysis, the decision was made to go for the new P&A solution. This implied placing one long cement plug in one go (1425m) using a sacrificial drill pipe and a disconnect tool. The cement plug was tailored to achieve competent slurry properties for the job, such as fluid loss (FL), free fluid (FF), thickening time (TT), wait on cement (WOC), etc. Pre-job laboratory tests were conducted to assess the suitability of this blend for the new technique. The project was then planned, and the proper tools, equipment, and slurry design were selected for the job. A detailed cost analysis compared a conventional P&A method, which implied placing 5 – 6 plugs, versus the new method of placing one long plug in one go with a sacrificial pipe and a disconnect tool. The HSE aspects were evaluated, significantly reducing rig time, slop generation, CO2 footprint and people's exposure in the red zone. The job was performed as planned, observing normal circulation throughout the whole cement job and a clear indication of the dart landing and the tool release. The well barrier was verified by tagging and pressure test after WOC confirmed hard cement and isolation at the theoretical top of the cement. This new P&A method has been used for five jobs in Norway in the last two years. No issues have been recorded. The tool was disconnected as planned, confirming its reliability. Substantial rig time savings and HSE improvements have been achieved on all jobs so far. Improved HSE and reduced CO2 emissions can be achieved with this new P&A method. The paper will also show the advantage of the tool compared with conventional P&A methods and how important this can be for both environmental improvements and cost reductions.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has been a global concern over the past few decades due to the increase in the demand of energy, a major source of which is fossil fuels. To mitigate the emission issues, as well as to find a solution for the energy needs, an ample load of research has been carried out over the past few years in CO2 reduction by catalysis. Bismuth, being an active catalyst both photocatalytically and electrocatalytically, is an interesting material that can be formed into oxides, sulphides, oxyhalides, etc. Numerous works have been published based on bismuth-based materials as active catalysts for the reduction of CO2. However, a proper understanding of the behavior of the active facets and the dependence of morphology of the different bismuth-based catalysts is an interesting notion. In this review, various bismuth-based materials will be discussed regarding their activity and charge transfer properties, based on the active facets present in them. With regard to the available literature, a summarization, including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis as well as photoelectrocatalysis, will be detailed, considering various materials with different facets and morphologies. Product selectivity, varying on morphological difference, will also be realized photoelectrochemically.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np‐Ag/Sn‐Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np‐Ag/Sn‐Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90% energy efficiency and a 100% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (ΔE = 1.4 V), outperforming state‐of‐the‐art Au and Ag‐based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

The stable operation of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers is known to be hindered by the accumulation of bicarbonate salt, which are derived from alkali metal cations in anolytes, on the cathode side. In this study, we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the correlation between the CO2RR activity and the transported alkali metal cations in MEA electrolyzers. As a result, although the presence of transported alkali metal cations on the cathode surface significantly contributes to the generation of C2+ compounds, the rate of K+ ion transport did not match the selectivity of C2+, suggesting that a continuous supply of high amount of K+ to the cathode surface is not required for C2+ formation. Based on these findings, we achieved a faradaic efficiency (FE) and a partial current density for C2+ of 77% and 230 mA cm−2, respectively, even after switching the anode solution from 0.1 M KHCO3 to a dilute K+ solution (<7 mM). These values were almost identical to those when 0.1 M KHCO3 was continuously supplied. Based on this insight, we successfully improved the durability of the system against salt precipitation by intermittently supplying concentrated KHCO3, compared with the continuous supply.

The effect of the CO2:C2H6 feed ratio, the relative Lewis acidity of reducible and unreducible catalytically active metal oxide supports with and without Fe3Ni1 alloy nanoparticles on the activity, selectivity and stability for the CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (CO2-ODHE) is investigated. To circumvent the influence of the typically dissimilar textural properties of the supports in bulk form, overlayer oxide supports of V, Cr, Ga, Ti or Sm coated on a common γ-Al2O3 carrier were employed. Separately, (Ni0.75Fe0.25)Fe2O4 precursor nanoparticles were synthesized via a nonaqueous surfactant-free method, sonication-deposited onto supports and reduced in situ into an Fe3Ni1 alloy microstructure of bcc and fcc mixed phases captured with in situ XRD. When exposed to carbon dioxide at 255 °C, a selective re-oxidation of the bcc phase via CO2 dissociation is observed, while the fcc phase stays stable and only partially re-oxidizes above 525 °C. Upon exposure to CO2-ODHE conditions, the initial activity of the bare supports increases with increasing acid site strength, but this activity is rapidly lost in case of the strongly acidic supports. Comparison of the C2H4 and CO selectivity indicate direct dehydrogenation is preferred over the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway and is initially occurring in combination with some CO-forming routes, possibly the dry reforming of C2H6. This CO forming route is significant over the most acidic and reducible VOx@Al2O3 support in the early stages of operation. The addition of the Fe3Ni alloy increases the conversions of both C2H6 and CO2 across all supports, with a notably stronger effect observed on CO2 conversion especially over the highly acidic and reducible VOx@Al2O3 and CrOx@Al2O3. As a result, the CO selectivity is increased due to ethane dry reforming activity over the latter supports while CO2-ODHE activity is observed over the supports with intermediate and weak acid sites.

Abstract A key strategy for minimizing our reliance on precious metals is to increase the fraction of surface atoms and improve the metal-support interface. In this work, we employ a solvent/ligand/counterion-free method to deposit copper in the atomic form directly onto a nanotextured surface of graphitized carbon nanofibers (GNFs). Our results demonstrate that under these conditions, copper atoms coalesce into nanoparticles securely anchored to the graphitic step edges, limiting their growth to 2–5 nm. The resultant hybrid Cu/GNF material displays high selectivity in the CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) for formate production with a faradaic efficiency of ~94% at -0.38 V vs RHE and a high turnover frequency of 2.78 × 10 6 h -1 . The Cu nanoparticles adhered to the graphitic step edges significantly enhance electron transfer to CO 2 . Long-term CO 2 RR tests coupled with atomic-scale elucidation of changes in Cu/GNF reveal nanoparticles coarsening, and a simultaneous increase in the fraction of single Cu atoms. These changes in the catalyst structure make the onset of the CO 2 reduction potential more negative, leading to less formate production at -0.38 V vs RHE, correlating with a less efficient competition of CO 2 with H 2 O for adsorption on single Cu atoms on the graphitic surfaces, revealed by density functional theory calculations.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is chosen for its ability to streamline production processes and design freedom. This reduces material waste, enables rapid prototyping, and facilitates intricate geometries, ultimately offering cost-effective and customizable solutions for manufacturing complex components in diverse industries. Overlapping melting trajectories result in a low-quality surface (Ra=~13.34 μm) in the laser metal deposition (LMD) of the Ti64 alloy. Therefore, post-processing is often essential for AMed parts for engineering applications. Milling trials were conducted on AMed specimens under four environmental conditions: dry, flood, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), and cryogenic medium. The machinability was evaluated in terms of the cutting temperature, machined surface roughness, tool wear, chip morphology, and microhardness. The flank wear under cryogenic CO2 condition is 52.78-54.29% lower than dry condition, 33.86–36.24% lower than flood cutting, and 23.64–26.86% lower than MQL. The outcomes show that cryogenic cooling augments the tool life and the surface integrity of milling LMD parts. Moreover, the hardness under cryogenic CO2 was higher, indicating dimensional stability and maintenance of shape integrity under applied loads.

Review Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate Electrocatalytic C-N Coupling for Sustainable Production of Urea Litao Jia, and Fanghua Li * School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China * Correspondence: fanghuahope01@hit.edu.cn Received: 15 December 2023; Revised: 17 January 2024; Accepted: 19 February 2024; Published: 5 March 2024 Abstract: The electrocatalytic co-reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3−) for urea synthesis under environmental conditions offers a promising solution for achieving sustainable environmental management. Besides, electrochemical urea synthesis is an alternative approach for cleaner production of urea compared to the conventional urea industrial production process with high energy consumption and pollution. However, lower urea yield, lower selectivity and unclear C-N coupling reaction mechanism are still the main challenges to its large-scale application. In this review, we focus on accurate and reliable detection methods and evaluation criteria for urea products, recent progress on CO2 and NO3− electrocatalytic co-reduction synthesis of urea, rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts, and C-N coupling reaction mechanism of urea electrochemical synthesis under atmospheric conditions. This review could contribute to the development of electrochemical urea synthesis via effective remediation of CO2 and NO3−.

In this work, we introduce ZeroCarbon - ZC, a startup focused on contributing to the reduction of environmental impact through the neutralization of carbon emissions from online purchases. Our process involves connecting individuals who wish to make online purchases with affiliated companies to contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. These purchases are neutralized through carbon credits that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The use of ZC’s platform has mitigated environmental impacts, as we neutralized 169,000 kilograms of CO2 from purchases made by 8,000 users, in partnership with 224 affiliated stores. Unlike other similar service options on the market, ZeroCarbon calculates only the emissions related to the type of product purchased. This work offers insights on the carbon footprints of conventional and online retail from a ”natureback” perspective.

The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) is extensively regarded as a promising strategy to reach carbon neutralization. Copper sulfide (CuS) has been widely studied for its ability to produce C1 products with high selectivity. However, challenges still remain owing to the poor selectivity of formate. Here, a Bi/CeO2/CuS composite was synthesized using a simple solvothermal method. Bi/CeO2–decorated CuS possessed high formate selectivity, with the Faraday efficiency and current density reaching 88% and 17 mA cm−2, respectively, in an H-cell. The Bi/CeO2/CuS structure significantly reduces the energy barrier formed by OCHO*, resulting in the high activity and selectivity of the CO2 conversion to formate. Ce4+ readily undergoes reduction to Ce3+, allowing the formation of a conductive network of Ce4+/Ce3+. This network facilitates electron transfer, stabilizes the Cu+ species, and enhances the adsorption and activation of CO2. Furthermore, sulfur catalyzes the OCHO* transformation to formate. This work describes a highly efficient catalyst for CO2 to formate, which will aid in catalyst design for CO2RR to target products.

Transportation significantly influences greenhouse gas emissions—particularly carbon dioxide (CO2)—thereby affecting climate, health, and various socioeconomic aspects. Therefore, in developing and implementing targeted and effective policies to mitigate the environmental impacts of transportation-related carbon dioxide emissions, governments and decision-makers have focused on identifying methods for the accurate and reliable forecasting of carbon emissions in the transportation sector. This study evaluates these policies’ impacts on CO2 emissions using three forecasting models: ANN, SVR, and ARIMAX. Data spanning the years 1993–2022, including those on population, GDP, and vehicle kilometers, were analyzed. The results indicate the superior performance of the ANN model, which yielded the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 6.395). Moreover, the results highlight the limitations of the ARIMAX model; particularly its susceptibility to disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, due to its reliance on historical data. Leveraging the ANN model, a scenario analysis of trends under the “30@30” policy revealed a reduction in CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in the transportation sector to 14,996.888 kTons in 2030. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in the fields of strategic planning and sustainable transportation development.

Pledges at recent climate summits fall short for 1.5°C warming. Here, we calculate the CO2 emissions reduction required to stay below 1.5°C, considering available data on current emissions up to 2022, extending the time horizon to 2300, and using an approach different from the carbon budget to offer another perspective on what is required to stay below 1.5°C. For a 50% chance of staying below 1.5°C during this century, fossil fuel and industry CO2 emissions need to decrease linearly by about 5% per year, in line with other recent studies. However, extending the time horizon to 2300 leads to chances dropping to 30% for the same decarbonization scenario without sustained carbon dioxide removal beyond levels needed for offsetting residual CO2 emissions. We further show that the chances of staying below 1.5°C of global warming critically hinge on the assumed future land-use CO2 emissions and mitigation of non-CO2 forcers.

Abstract Fuel combustion for electricity generation emits a mix of health- and climate-relevant air emissions, with the potential for technology or fuel switching to impact multiple emissions together. While there has been extensive research on the co-benefits of climate policies on air quality improvements, few studies have quantified the effect of air pollution controls on carbon emissions. Here we evaluate three multi-pollutant emission reduction strategies, focused on sulfur dioxide (SO2) controls in the electricity sector. Traditional “add-on” pollution controls like flue gas desulfurization (FGD) reduce SO2 emissions from coal combustion but increase emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and carbon dioxide (CO2) due to heat efficiency loss. Fuel switching from coal to natural gas and renewables potentially reduces all pollutants. We identified 135 electricity generation units (EGUs) without SO2 controls in the contiguous US in 2017 and quantified the unit-level emission changes using pollution control efficiencies, emission rates, fuel heat input, and electricity load. A cost-benefit analysis is conducted, considering pollution control costs, fuel costs, capital and O&M costs, the monetized health benefits from avoided multi-pollutant, and the social cost of carbon as the benefit for carbon reduction. We find that add-on SO2 controls result in an average annual net benefit of $179.3 million (95% CI: $137.5-$221.0 million) per EGU, fuel switching from coal to natural gas, $432.7 million (95% CI: $366.4-$498.9 million) per EGU; and fuel switching from coal to renewable energy sources, $537.9 million (95% CI: $457.1-$618.9 million) per EGU. Our results highlight multi-pollutant emission reduction strategy as a cost-effective way to synergistically control air pollution and mitigate climate change.

The use of biodiesel for common rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engines is very difficult, because its viscosity affects on CRDI systems leading to the high engine knock. Thus, the main aim of the research is to study the performance and emission characteristics of a CRDI diesel engine at a constant speed of 1,500 rpm and different loads, operated with diesel mixed with palm-oil biodiesel at 20% (B20) combined with adding alcohols (5% of ethyl acetate and bioethanol increased from 5 to 20%). Results of exhaust emissions and performance parameters from using B20-bioethanol-ethyl acetate blends compared with fuel baselines (regular diesel and B20) were changed. The B20-bioethanol-ethyl acetate blends increased the releases of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO) but the reduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and black smoke (BS) compared with fuel baselines. Meanwhile, performance parameters from using these fuel blends were different. Outstandingly, B20 mixed with 5% of bioethanol and 5% of ethyl acetate had the highest engine performance and the lowest CO and BS emissions, but it released the CO2 and NO levels higher than fuel baselines.

Abstract This paper assesses the role of natural gas in the global energy transition and industrial decarbonization, specifically in the power and industrial sectors, where natural gas holds substantial importance both at present and well into the future. An overview of the current societal relevance of natural gas will be presented, and an assessment of natural gas contributions to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions/reductions will be presented. The opportunities and repercussions of fuel switching is illustrated through a detailed case study in the United States highlighting the importance of Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) for natural gas to have a more significant role in energy transitions and decarbonization efforts. This research presents a comprehensive approach, combining data analysis, literature review, and development of a case study to examine the significance of natural gas on the energy transition. Methods include assessing the share of natural gas in global emissions and analyzing fuel switching scenarios. The study draws on data from open sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Our World in Data and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to support its findings and conclusions. Natural gas, while contributing significantly to global CO2 emissions, emerges as a crucial transitional fuel for reducing emissions in the short term. Fuel switching, particularly from coal to natural gas, is identified as a key strategy for achieving immediate emission reductions. But the switch implies an increase in demand for natural gas. The study reveals that the United States (U.S.) has witnessed substantial emissions reductions through coal-to-gas switching, emphasizing the economic and environmental benefits. However, the ultimate goal remains a shift towards electrification and low-carbon sources for long-term sustainability. CCUS becomes crucial in advancing sustainable power and heat within the energy and industrial sectors and can be deployed with appropriate policy frameworks and incentives using current technology and infrastructure, making it a crucial bridge to decarbonization. This research introduces insights into the cooperative relationship between coal, natural gas, renewables and the role of CCUS, emphasizing their complementary roles in energy transitions. The potential of natural gas as a flexible and reliable transition energy source is explored, particularly in the U.S. industrial sector. The study also delves into the role of CCUS in decarbonizing power and heat generated by the use of natural gas in power generation and industrial settings. The need for a phased approach to energy transitions and policy support is highlighted. Research funding, financial incentives or carbon cap, and greenhouse gases (GHG) reporting are essential components for advancing carbon capture technologies. The study concludes by emphasizing the evolving role of natural gas in the context of global, regional, and national climate objectives, considering factors such as technology advancements, market conditions, policy support and necessary timelines for substantive reductions in CO2 emissions required by intergovernmental agreements such as the Paris Accord.

Dam reservoirs are exposed to a loss of water storage capacity due to the phenomenon of siltation. This particularity can be expressed by the siltation of reservoirs and the entrainment of particles transported by watercourses. Siltation of reservoirs is a critical state which causes a reduction in the storage capacity of dams. Algeria is characterized by a semi-arid climate, which annually loses a considerable volume of water storage. The carbonation of concrete is influenced by a number of parameters which accelerate its kinetics. These parameters are the porosity of the concrete, the quantity of lime contained in the cement, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the humidity of the environment. It should be noted that, water being the vector for moving aggressive agents, carbon dioxide can only diffuse through the concrete if the latter is not completely saturated and not perfectly dry at the same time. Another factor increasing the permeability of concrete is the amount of limestone added to the cement during its manufacture at the factory. This permeability allows the diffusion of CO2 or other aggressive agents in the concrete. The addition of limestone to cement must therefore be used with caution. The objective is to propose economically competitive and easy-to-implement formulations which allow the valorization of these materials in the making of ordinary concrete by partial substitution of cement (10, 20 and 30%) and its influence on the progress of long-term carbonation after six years of curing in the open air. The sediment is treated by calcination at 750°C to make it active. Natural carbonation tests were carried out on the study concretes in order to evaluate their durability. The results obtained confirmed the possibility of producing concretes incorporating calcined sludge at dosages of up to 30% without compromising the quality of these concretes from the point of view of behavior in the face of attacks by the dissolution of carbon dioxide from the air in the interstitial solution of concrete, meeting economic, ecological and technological objectives.

Capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) is still a major obstacle in the fight against climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To address this problem, we employed a simple Friedel–Crafts alkylation to investigate the effectiveness of porous organic polymers (POPs) based on triphenylamine (TPA) and trihydroxy aryl terms derived from chloranil (CH), designated as TPA-CH POP. We then treated the TPA-CH POP with (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (3-MPTS), forming a TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite to enhance CO2 capture. Utilizing FTIR, solid-state NMR, SEM, TEM, along with XPS techniques, the molecular makeup, morphological characteristics, as well as physical features of TPA-CH POP and the TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite were thoroughly explored. Upon scorching to 800 °C, the TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite demonstrated more thermal durability over TPA-CH POP, achieving a char yield of up to 71.5 wt.%. The TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite displayed a 2.5-times better CO2 capture, as well as a comparable adsorption capacity of 48.07 cm3 g−1 at 273 K. Additionally, we found that the TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite exhibited an improved CO2/nitrogen (N2) selectivity versus the original TPA-CH POP. Typical enthalpy changes for CO2 capture were somewhat increased by the 3-MPTS coating, indicating greater binding energies between CO2 molecules and the adsorbent surface. Our outcomes demonstrate that a TPA-CH POP composite coated with MPTS is a viable candidate for effective CO2 capture uses. Our findings encourage the investigation of different functional groups and optimization strategies.

Abstract Sustainable development demands a fundamental transformation in energy generation, requiring innovations in subsurface management and geomaterial manufacturing. Cement plays a crucial role in facilitating this transition on two fronts. Firstly, as carbon dioxide (CO2) storage emerges as a promising strategy for mitigating emissions from large-scale industrial operations, its effective implementation relies not only on identifying suitable reservoirs with proven storage capacities but also on the performance of wellbore cement in providing long-term mechanical and hydraulic sealing. Secondly, the production of cement demands an environmentally conscious alternative to traditional Portland cement (PC) capable of both curbing CO2 emissions during the calcination process and bolstering the resilience of wellbore casing under pressure. Our research adopts a dual-pronged approach. We investigate the chemical interactions between supercritical CO2 and cement, analyzing their effects on cement porosity, permeability, strength, and failure mechanisms. Concurrently, we explore the properties of a low-carbon cement formulation derived from a volcanic blend composition. This formulation aims to reduce reliance on limestone as a primary resource, thus cutting emissions and minimizing reactivity with CO2. Our findings reveal that exposure to CO2 triggers well-documented carbonation reactions in Portland-based cement, commonly used in older and legacy wells. These reactions lead to calcite mineralization within the cement pore space, resulting in decreased porosity, reduced permeability, and increased strength. While these outcomes show promise for effectively sealing stored CO2 and furthering sustainability goals, it is crucial to note that increased strength does not necessarily correlate with improved toughness. Our findings underscore that calcite mineralization exacerbates cement brittleness and damage, evident from crack propagation detected through acoustic emissions (AEs) monitoring. Over time, crack development worsens fluid flow and heightens the susceptibility of calcite to dissolution in the presence of acidic fluids generated by continuous CO2 injection. Conversely, the volcanic-based formulation yielded lightweight cement samples with density ranging from 1100 kg/m3 to 1300 kg/m3 and a remarkable CO2 reduction of up to 85%. The microstructure resulting from the volcanic blend composition enables ductile mechanical behavior, with peak strength and permeability ranging between 30MPa to 46MPa and 680μD to 30μD, respectively, thus appearing promising when cement is exposed to CO2.

The integration of renewable energy sources with fuel synthesis represents a transformative approach to addressing the twin challenges of energy sustainability and climate change. This review presents a conceptual framework for coupling renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and biomass, with fuel synthesis processes to produce sustainable, zero-carbon fuels. The framework emphasizes the use of renewable electricity for water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, key steps in synthesizing hydrogen and other synthetic fuels. The conceptual framework highlights the importance of advanced catalysts in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of these chemical reactions. Innovations in nanostructured catalysts, hybrid materials, and biomimetic approaches are discussed for their potential to significantly improve the performance and durability of catalytic processes. Additionally, the framework underscores the role of advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling in understanding and optimizing catalyst behavior. This integration necessitates addressing technical challenges associated with scaling up production processes from laboratory to industrial levels. These challenges include ensuring the stability and longevity of catalysts under operational conditions, managing the intermittency of renewable energy sources, and developing robust systems for capturing and utilizing carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the economic viability of these integrated systems is critical, requiring cost-effective solutions that leverage earth-abundant materials and optimize the overall energy efficiency. The environmental benefits of integrating renewable energy with fuel synthesis are substantial, offering a pathway to significantly reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. The production of synthetic fuels using renewable energy can lead to a closed carbon cycle, thereby mitigating the impact on climate change and contributing to a sustainable energy future. Future directions in this field involve interdisciplinary research to further enhance catalyst performance, develop new materials, and refine process integration strategies. A roadmap for future development includes prioritizing areas such as improved catalyst design, efficient CO2 capture technologies, and the integration of electrochemical and photochemical systems. This abstract concludes by underscoring the transformative potential of renewable energy-fuel synthesis integration, envisioning a future where sustainable energy practices become the cornerstone of global energy systems.

The role of electricity is becoming significant in our advancing world. Currently, Ireland’s energy mix heavily relies on carbon-polluting fossil fuels, posing an environmental challenge. As per the Paris Agreement 2015, Ireland is ambitiously targeting to meet net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 and a 51% reduction by 2030. The country is shifting towards renewable energy sources to generate power to achieve this target. With abundant wind energy available, Ireland can meet its goal. However, due to the intermittent availability of wind energy, an energy backup for power generation is necessary. The use of curtailed or dedicated wind for producing hydrogen gas through electrolysis, and storing it in underground salt caverns is one approach to the problem. Northern Ireland has a rich source of Permian salt deposits offering a better place to store hydrogen which can be withdrawn for electricity generation, or used as fuel in transportation sectors. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the hydrogen systems can scrutinise the environmental impact of carbon emissions. This study analyses routes to reduce the environmental impact by evaluating polluting hotspots during the construction and operation phase of the system. This paper compares the impacts of the LCA on a hydrogen system which consists of a wind energy source for hydrogen production through electrolysis, transportation in pipelines and compression before storing it in salt caverns. A comparative analysis is carried out with the LCA of the hydrogen system with an electrical grid supply source. The results show that the impacts contributed by a renewable source are less than the electricity from the grid for the island of Ireland.

Purpose This study conducts an analysis of the interplay between governance quality, environmental expenditure of the government, and pollution emissions (measured as CO2 emissions) within the BRIC economies. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing the FMOLS model and marginal effects, we investigate the influence of governance quality and environmental expenditure on environmental quality (CO2 emissions) over the period 1996–2020. We took data for Brazil, Russia, India and China. We excluded South Africa due to its due to its small economic size relative to other BRIC economies, sluggish industrial growth and deteriorating foreign trade which gives contrast outliers to our data. Findings Results indicate that government investments in environmental protection contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions. However, the effectiveness of these expenditures is contingent upon the quality of governance. This underscores the significance of robust governance for realizing meaningful reductions in air pollution through environmental spending. Further, increase in GDP per capita and the industrial sector's share of GDP are associated with a significant rise in CO2 emissions across BRIC economies. Conversely, FDI and trade openness exhibit a negative impact on CO2 emissions, with this effect gaining greater resilience when accounting for governance factors. Research limitations/implications Like any other studies, the present study also suffers from some limitations. First, besides air quality, environmental quality encompasses multiple dimensions and various characteristics such as water purity, noise pollution, open space access, visual effects of buildings etc. But the present study included only CO2 (air quality) as a proxy of environmental quality due to various problems of data and methods. Second, CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission, which is the dependent variable in our model, is actually influenced by various quantitative and qualitative (both natural and man-made) factors. We included only nine independent variables. However, we could not include many variables due to lack of consistent data. Third, this study included only four countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) and excluded South Africa which is a member of the BRICS block due to its economic size, sluggish industrial growth and deteriorating foreign trade which gives contrast outliers to our data set of the four BRIC countries. Therefore, the future research may be carried out by addressing those issues for better understanding of the environmental problems, governance and policies thereon. Practical implications (i) Establish environmental governance committees – The four BRIC countries including South Africa should form a committee comprising government, civil society, and private sector representatives for comprehensive oversight and collaboration in environmental governance. (ii) Invest in capacity building for environmental institutions – Allocate resources to enhance environmental institutions' capacity through training, data improvement, and enforcement strengthening. (iii) Implement green procurement policies – Encourage green procurement in government agencies to drive demand for eco-friendly products and services, promoting sustainable practices. (iv) Incentivize green technology development – Offer tax credits or subsidies to stimulate green technology adoption, including renewable energy and sustainable agriculture. (v) Promote sustainable urban development – Prioritize sustainable urban strategies like public transportation investment and green space promotion to mitigate urbanizations' environmental impacts. (vi) Enhance cross-border cooperation – Foster collaboration on transboundary environmental issues among four BRIC nations including South Africa, including joint research and policy responses. (vii) Promote green finance and investment – Mobilize green finance to support sustainable development projects through instruments like green investment funds and bonds. Originality/value This study distinguishes itself by offering a unique analysis of both individual and combined effects of governance and environmental expenditure on environmental quality. Additionally, it encompasses various dimensions of governance, an aspect rarely explored in the BRIC countries.

A new approach for the thermal reduction of tin dioxide (SnO2) in the carbon/sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) system is demonstrated. The process of tin smelting was experimentally optimized by adjusting the smelting temperature and amounts of the chemical components used for the thermal reduction of SnO2. The numbers obtained are consistent with the thermodynamic characteristics of the system and molar fractions of reactants derived from the proposed mechanism of the SnO2 thermal reduction process. They reveal that the maximum yield of tin is obtained if masses of C, Na2SO3 and SnO2 are approximately in the ratio 1:2:3 and the temperature is set to 1050 °C. The key role in the suggested mechanism is the thermal decomposition of Na2SO3. It was deduced from the available experimental data that the produced sulfur dioxide undergoes carbothermic reduction to carbonyl sulfide—an intermediate product involved in the bulk reduction of SnO2. Replacing sodium sulfite with sodium sulfate, sodium sulfide and even elemental sulfur practically terminated the production of metallic tin. The kinetic analysis was focused on the determination of the reaction orders for the two crucial reactants involved in the smelting process.

Abstract This study focuses on the impact of China’s carbon tax on carbon emission behavior under the background of “double carbon”, using big data simulation analysis. The study utilizes the DICE model, combined with general equilibrium theory, to conduct in-depth theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of the carbon tax policy. It is found that the optimal carbon tax rate should be flexibly adjusted in combination with social and economic development and technological progress, and the optimal tax rate gradually rises from RMB 2.83/tonne of carbon dioxide to RMB 17.62/tonne from 1997 to 2023. Simulation results show that increasing the carbon tax rate can effectively promote the low-carbon emission reduction behavior of enterprises and thus achieve the emission reduction target. Under the fixed carbon tax policy, a 50% tax rate can significantly improve environmental quality and economic output. In contrast, steady-state values of output and carbon emissions decrease with the increase of tax rates. At the same time, the combination of carbon trading and carbon tax can more effectively incentivize enterprises to reduce carbon emissions. The results of the study show that a flexible and reasonable carbon tax policy can significantly affect carbon emission behavior, which is of great significance for realizing China’s “double carbon” goal.

Abstract In China, coal-fired power generation is still the main mode of electricity supply. However, the large amount of coal use exacerbates environmental and sustainability issues. To achieve the “dual-carbon” goal, significant reductions in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from fossil-fueled power generation will be necessary before a transition to cleaner energy can occur. Therefore, the reaction kinetics of the CCLC process was researched by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which led to the activation energies of 57.58 kJ/mol and -34.26 kJ/mol for the FR and AR reactions. This is of great significance for reducing CO 2 emissions and improving energy conversion efficiency.

Hydrogen is an industrial raw material both for the production of chemicals and for oil refining with hydrotreating. It is the subject of increasing attention for its possible use as an energy carrier and as a flexible energy storage medium. Its production is generally accomplished in Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) plants, where a gaseous mixture of CO and H2, with a limited number of other species, is obtained. The process of production and purification generates relevant amounts of carbon dioxide, which needs to be removed due to downstream process requirements or to limit its emissions to the atmosphere. A work by IEAGHG focused on the study of a state-of-the-art Steam Methane Reforming plant producing 100 kNm3/h of H2 and considered chemical absorption with MethylDiEthanolAmine (MDEA) solvent for removing carbon dioxide from the PSA tail gas in a baseline scheme composed of the absorber, one flash vessel and the regeneration column. This type of process is characterized by high energy consumption, in particular at the reboiler of the regeneration column, usually operated by employing steam, and modifications to the baseline scheme can allow for a reduction of the operating costs, though with an increase in the complexity of the plant. This work analyses three configurations of the treatment section of the off gas obtained after the purification of the hydrogen stream in the Pressure Swing Adsorption unit with the aim of selecting the one which minimizes the overall costs so as to further enhance Carbon Capture and Storage in non-power industries as well.

Abstract A new type of carbon monoxide sensor is designed to address the issue of cross interference of nitrogen oxide gas in the exhaust emissions of underground diesel engine rubber-tired vehicles with electrochemical carbon monoxide sensors, which leads to frequent false alarm accidents. The hardware circuit design of the DC-DC voltage reduction power supply circuit, display circuit, component signal processing circuit, etc. is detailed, At the same time, the sensitive components used in the sensor adopt a special gas filtration membrane design. Six types of gases, including hydrogen sulfide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen, ethylene, and acetylene, were sequentially introduced in the laboratory for experimental analysis of multi-gas cross-interference performance. The experimental results have shown that the new carbon monoxide sensor can filter out nitrogen oxide gas, thereby solving the impact of underground rubber tire vehicle exhaust on the accuracy of carbon monoxide gas detection. It has broad prospects for promotion and application in coal mines underground.

The long-term performance of lime-stabilised earthworks is a major concern for the sustainability and durability of infrastructure. The manuscript presents a comprehensive investigation into the impact of carbonation and leaching on lime-stabilised soil by focusing on the mechanical, chemical, and microstructure changes. The study employed accelerated carbonation experiments with carbon dioxide levels at 3% for 7 days on lime-treated soil cured for up to 365 days. For leaching experiments, the treated samples were subjected to water percolation under a hydraulic head of 15 kPa for 14 pore volumes of flow. The results showed that carbonation reduced the compressive strength and stiffness of lime-treated soil, impacting its load-bearing capacity. The micro-level analyses revealed carbonation of cementitious gels and excess carbonate precipitation to cause a reduction in particle-to-particle bonding and loss of mechanical strength. The ingress of moisture into lime-stabilised soil led to leaching and the dissolution of cementitious gels. The effects of water percolation were insignificant for specimens cured for extended periods due to their reduced hydraulic conductivity, which resulted in enhanced cementation over leaching. Further, presaturation or treatment with a higher lime content reduced the extent of leaching. The study reveals that exposure of short-term cured or soil treated with inadequate lime content to carbon dioxide or moisture can affect their engineering properties, contrary to the design expectations.

Sedation and general anesthesia produce profound changes in respiratory function, with the degree of change depending on drugs employed, species involved, depth of anesthesia, surgical procedure, and the health of the individual animal. Of greatest concern is significant reductions in gas exchange causing inadequate oxygen delivery to vital tissues and/or carbon dioxide removal from the body. It is important for the clinician to understand the physiologic effects of oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, in addition to their indications and contraindications, to maximize their benefits and minimize any potential negative effects associated with their use in the perianesthetic period. This chapter also discusses considerations for anesthetic management of patients with underlying respiratory diseases that require anesthesia for a variety of procedures.

CCUS is internationally recognized as one of the three major pathways to achieve carbon neutrality goals. It is an important choice for realizing zero emissions from large-scale fossil energy utilization and a feasible technological solution to offset carbon emissions in industries such as power, steel, and cement where emissions reductions are challenging. Systematic analysis of the development and policy evolution of the CCUS industry at home and abroad can provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for China&apos;s energy transition and development under the background of carbon emission peaking and achieving carbon neutrality. Guided by the strategic goals of national energy security, carbon emission peaking, and achieving carbon neutrality, this study aims to analyze the global development process and stage characteristics of the CCUS industry, investigate the supporting policies in the CCUS field and their evolution patterns, summarize the current status and trends of the CCUS industry at home and abroad, and provide reference for the implementation of national energy green and low-carbon transformation and the construction of a new energy system. In terms of industry, European and American countries emphasize national-level technological guidance and macro-control. The United States has introduced the progressive 45Q tax credit policy, and the European Union has included CCUS in its carbon trading system. The US National Carbon Capture Center provides a testing environment and facilities for CCUS technology research and development, and has established a carbon dioxide industry cluster and transportation hub. In terms of policies, tax credits and carbon trading policies in Europe and America have attracted various types of capital investment, establishing a relatively complete legal framework system. These regions have been leading in CCUS technology research and deployment, holding dominant positions and decision-making power in mainstream international CCUS organizations such as the CSLF, IEA, GCCSI, and OGCI. This study benchmarks the forward-looking and strategic development status of the CCUS industry at home and abroad, elucidates the challenges facing CCUS industry development, and proposes future trends and policy support needs for the CCUS industry. The research reveals that Europe and America emphasize national-level technological guidance and macro-control, focusing on the construction of regional industrial networks and having established a relatively complete legal and regulatory framework system. Compared to other countries, China needs to establish national-level guidance on CCUS development, regional carbon dioxide capture and transportation networks, and enact specific laws, regulations, and technical standards for CCUS.

Abstract As a highly developed region, Guangdong province has substantial industrial emissions. Its subtropical monsoon climate, characterized by abundant hydrothermal conditions, contributes to a substantial biomass potential. The adoption of potential biomass-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, such as biochar, presents an opportunity to mitigate emissions and work towards carbon neutrality in the future. However, the current state of the land carbon balance and the CDR potential of biochar in Guangdong province remains unclear. We first calculated the land carbon balance based on inventory data. Then we estimated the CDR potential of biochar derived from agricultural residues, forestry residues, and bioenergy crops cultivated on marginal lands in Guangdong province using life cycle analysis (LCA). Results show that Guangdong province has not yet achieved carbon neutrality, with a net emission (carbon emissions remaining after offsetting by carbon sinks) of 925.63 Tg CO 2 e (CO 2 equivalent, 1Tg = 10 6 t) in 2021. Emissions from energy consumption account for the highest proportion, contributing 83.8% of total emissions. In the highest biomass utilization scenario, the maximum CDR potential of biochar derived from all biomass types reaches 84.30 Tg CO 2 e yr -1 , which could offset 9.11% of net carbon emissions in Guangdong province. Our findings provide crucial guidance for setting emission reduction targets and implementing effective mitigation strategies in Guangdong province under temperature warming.

The goal of “double carbon” (namely “peak carbon dioxide emissions” and “carbon neutrality”) proposed by China for the first time is an important layout in the Tenth Five-Year Plan, and it is also the key goal to realize the green and sustainable development of mobile communication networks in the future, and it is also the foundation for China’s international carbon asset pricing right and the world carbon trading platform. Among them, the difficulty in realizing green communication lies in maintaining the growth of business volume. Reduce network energy consumption and carbon emissions. This paper studies the green communication technology from the perspective of energy saving and emission reduction on the mobile communication network side and the perspective of the integrated architecture of communication network and multi-energy energy network. The research results show that the key to realize green communication technology lies in the mutual matching of network resources, energy resources and business distribution, while the existing technology can only achieve one-way matching of network resources and business distribution. Or the one-way matching of energy resources and service distribution. Based on this, this paper proposes a native green grid architecture with communication, perception and energy fusion, which has the ability of energy perception and service perception, supports the two-way matching method of network resources, energy resources and service distribution, and realizes the continuous growth of service while significantly reducing the energy consumption and carbon emissions on the mobile communication network side by eliminating the randomness and suddenness of service distribution and energy distribution.

Introduction: Execution of COVID-19 lockdown measures caused variations in air pollution worldwide. This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 stringency measures on the spatio-temporal dynamics of air pollution in Mumbai, India, using a comprehensive two-and-a-half-year pandemic period dataset. Materials and methods: We classified the pandemic period into 7 phases and 21 sub-phases based on the severity of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) Stringency Index (SI). Optimized Hotspot analysis (OHS) and Ordinary Least Square Regression models explored the spatio-temporal fluctuations and the effect of stringency measures on air quality. Results: The R2 value varied; with the best model R2 of 0.61 for Particulate Matters (PM10) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and lowest of 0.23 for Sulfur dioxide (SO2). A 10-point increase in SI caused a 3-7% reduction in air pollutants. Substantial reduction in average PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and Carbon monoxide (CO) was observed throughout the COVID-19 phases. Meteorology and SI collectively caused maximum reduction of 82.6%, 72.7%, 53.8%, 52.2%, 49.1%, 28.4% for NO2, PM2.5, PM10, NH3, CO, and SO2 respectively, during complete or extreme lockdown phases. Except SO2, seasonality significantly influenced the pollutant concentrations. Winter was the worst period while monsoon was the best. OHS identified central Mumbai wards as hotspots and areas close to the national park as coldspots. Conclusion: PM10, NO2 and CO were more affected by SI measures than NH3 and SO2. For a rapid emergency response to high PM10, implementation of SI, very high (≥ 80 score) and above is advised. Findings of this study have significant public health policy implications, especially among global south nations.

Large volumes of waste are generated from the manufacture of slabs, roofing, and tiles using slate stone. The use of waste in the construction industry is prevalent due to the environmental advantages associated with the implementation of circular economy standards. This paper examines the production of Portland cement CEM II using heat-treated slate waste. The fineness index results were 10.95% for the 75-μm sieve and 23.53% for the 45-μm sieve. Assessment of reactivity using mechanical methods showed that mortars produced with 20% slate waste (SW) achieved a strength of 42.35MPa and a mechanical index of 84.93%. Direct measurements (FTIR), along with chemical methods (Frattini Test and Saturated lime test), confirm the pozzolanic activity of the slate waste. The environmental impact assessment demonstrated a reduction in the carbon dioxide emission rate by 21.49% (6.54E+02 kgCO2-eq/t) with the use of Portland cement CEM II/CSW. The valorization of slate waste can contribute to the availability of an alternative source of raw material and the reduction of natural resource consumption. However, further studies on mechanical performance and durability are necessary for this waste to be applied in structural cementitious matrices.

Abstract Despite the importance of understanding the urban emission characteristics of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollutants, few studies have conducted integrated assessments across diverse urban environments. Herein, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the emission characteristics of GHGs and air pollutants in seven cities in the Northern Hemisphere using ground‐based Fourier transform spectrometers. Our analysis primarily focused on emission ratios of excess column‐averaged dry‐air mole fractions of carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) (∆XCO:∆XCO 2 ) and those of methane (CH 4 ) to CO 2 (∆XCH 4 :∆XCO 2 ). We found that the emission ratios varied significantly across cities. Xianghe (China) and Pasadena (USA), known for severe air pollution, showed the highest emission ratios. Notably, Seoul (South Korea) showed lower ∆XCO:∆XCO 2 (3.32 ± 0.10 ppb/ppm) but relatively higher ∆XCH 4 :∆XCO 2 (4.85 ± 0.04 ppb/ppm), which was comparable to the ∆XCH 4 :∆XCO 2 value of Xianghe (5.15 ± 0.10 ppb/ppm), suggesting that targeted CH 4 reduction strategies may be required for climate change mitigation in Seoul.

Small Cu clusters are excellent candidates for the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR), and their catalytic performance is expected to be significantly influenced by the interaction between the substrate and cluster. In this study, we systematically investigate the CO2RR for a Cu3 cluster anchored on Janus MoSX (X = Se, Te) substrates using density functional theory calculations. These substrates feature a broken vertical mirror symmetry, which generates spontaneous out-of-plane polarization and offers two distinct polar surfaces to support the Cu3 cluster. Our findings reveal that the CO2RR performance on the Cu3 cluster is strongly influenced by the polarization direction and strength of the MoSX (X = Se, Te) substrates. Notably, the Cu3 cluster supported on the S-terminated MoSTe surface (Cu3(S)@MoSTe) demonstrates the highest CO2RR activity, producing methane. These results underscore the pivotal role of substrate polarization in modulating the binding strength of reactants and reaction intermediates, thereby enhancing the CO2RR efficiency.

Syngas produced from biomass fuels is studied for renewable energy in combustion engines. Syngas used in dual fuel modes can reduce diesel consumption in diesel engines, but exhaust products are increased. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can increase fuel efficiency and decrease exhaust emissions. Therefore, the research aims to study the performance and emission of a diesel-engine generator at 3,000 rpm and various loads, fueled with dual fuel modes by adding syngas, air, and EGR. Syngas was generated from wood pellet by a downdraft gasifier. Flow rates of syngas and air were added at 93 lpm and 86 lpm, respectively. EGR was expanded from 0.36 to 1.92 lpm. The best engine performance in dual fuel modes was found at 3.82 kW. The increase of syngas, air, and EGR flow rates led to the changes of engine performance and exhaust products. Regular diesel combined with syngas-air-EGR blend by increasing syngas, air, and EGR at 93 lpm, 86 lpm, and 0.84 lpm led to the addition of engine performance and the reduction of exhaust emissions. Outstandingly, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitric oxides, and particulate matter were decreased by 2.98%, 10.08%, 12.64%, and 2.60%, respectively. The regular diesel saving was raised by 43.33% compared with the mode of only regular diesel.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full‐cell voltages, and cost‐effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH‐fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a results, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64% at 260 mA cm‐2, with a CO2‐to‐C2H4 single‐pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32% at 140 mA cm‐2 — nearly 1.3 times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM‐MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE‐MEA electrolyzer reduces the full‐cell voltage to 2.3 V at 100 mA cm‐2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.

Abstract The global energy system is in transition. It is attempting to reach net‐zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The systemic changes mean that the role of bioenergy will change. The potential of bioenergy to make a flexible contribution to the energy system is key for the achievement of global emission reduction ambitions and the functioning of the low‐carbon energy system and economy. As the volume of sustainably available biomass resources is limited, defining the contributions from bioenergy to a low‐carbon energy system and finding balances – and ideally synergies – between the different possible energy and climate system services that biomass can provide will be very important. The recognized system services include, among others, the flexible operation of bioenergy plants to integrate variable renewable energy sources and to provide negative carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Interest in flexible operation of bioenergy value chains, bioenergy with carbon capture and utilization as well as synergies with renewable hydrogen‐based value chains has increased recently. The objective of this paper is to present a holistic definition of flexible bioenergy as a system service based on the work conducted in International Energy Agency (IEA) Bioenergy Technology Collaboration Programme's Task 44 Flexible Bioenergy and System Integration, and to provide some practical examples. The paper also presents the different bioenergy system services and considers their definitions and interactions, as this is important in energy system design. The definition of flexible bioenergy shows that the flexibility provision from bioenergy goes far beyond the traditional definition of providing short‐term flexibility in the power sector. Indicators to demonstrate the value of services as well as further quantitative assessment of synergies and trade‐offs are needed to valorize the different services from bioenergy and create viable business cases.

Against the backdrop of global climate change and the "dual carbon" target, cities have a significant responsibility to achieve carbon reduction targets. As a crucial urban agglomeration in northern China, effectively balancing economic growth with CO2 emission reduction to achieve high-quality economic development remains a significant challenge that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region should address both presently and in the future. The objective of this study is to utilize nighttime lighting data and energy consumption information to quantify the CO2 emissions of diverse cities within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region spanning from 2006 to 2020. The research aims to analyze the spatial progression patterns of CO2 emissions across these urban centers, identify key determinants and their interrelations, and delve into the underlying mechanisms pivotal for advancing carbon mitigation strategies within urban agglomerations. The results indicate that: with an exception in Beijing where CO2 emissions slightly decreased compared to 2006, CO2 emissions increased across cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region by 2020. High-value CO2 emission areas are primarily concentrated in central of the study area, exhibiting negative spatial correlation characteristics. Based on its urban development positioning, it is imperative for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration to formulate and implement carbon reduction strategies on innovative development, industrial upgrading, and ecological protection among other aspects towards coordinated low-carbon development.

Abstract The carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) for the synthesis of high‐energy‐density and high‐value multi‐carbon (C 2+ ) products has demonstrated considerable potential for practical applications. In this work, we design a novel copper oxide foam (OD‐Cu foam) catalyst through a high‐temperature calcination process, characterized by a substantial specific surface area. The distinctive three‐dimensional structure of the OD‐Cu foam catalyst and the metal oxide particles covered on its surface provide abundant active sites. The total Faradaic efficiency of 57.3% for C 2+ products over the OD‐Cu foam is achieved at −0.85 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Furthermore, the partial current density for C 2+ products over the OD‐Cu foam reaches 44.1 mA cm −2 at −0.95 V versus RHE, surpassing significantly that both of Cu foam (3.4 mA cm −2 ) and copper oxide foil (OD‐Cu foil) (1.6 mA cm −2 ). In addition, the integrated structure of the OD‐Cu foam, which does not require complex preparation processes, facilitates its application in CO 2 RR. These results underscore the significance of three‐dimensional structure and high specific surface area, emphasizing the considerable potential of this catalyst for effective and sustainable CO 2 conversion.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to valuable C2+ chemicals has been demonstrated to be an effective and sustainable method using Cu-based catalysts. However, Cu catalysts still suffer from certain limitations, including high overpotential, low selectivity, and competitive hydrogen evolution. To achieve the valuable ethanol (C2H5OH) product from the CO2ER, a novel tandem catalyst featuring gradient doping of Cu in concave Pd nanoparticles (GD-PdCu1.8 NPs) was designed in this study. Electrochemical tests conducted on the GD-PdCu1.8 electrode reveal a nearly 100% faradaic efficiency (FE) for liquid products and a high FE of 40.0% for C2H5OH at the extremely low potential of −0.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Furthermore, in-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the underlying mechanism, indicating that gradient Cu doping in Pd can effectively facilitate the abundant formation of *CO, which then promotes the C–C asymmetric coupling step and ultimately leads to the production of C2H5OH with high selectivity. This study unveils the novel gradient doping of the tandem catalyst strategy to enhance multicarbon product selectivity at a relatively low overpotential for CO2ER, which can inform the rational catalyst design in the sustainable carbon cycle with high energy efficiency.

Ridesplitting has the potential to enhance transportation efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions from ridesourcing services by matching multiple shared rides to the same trip. However, an inappropriate matching can significantly diminish the environmental performance of ridesplitting. This study aims to propose a shared ride matching approach to low-carbon and electrified ridesplitting. Firstly, feasible ridesplitting trips within time constraints are identified and represented using a shareability network. Subsequently, the CO2 emission reduction of each feasible ridesplitting trip is calculated by comparing it with its corresponding single ride alternative. To maximize the total CO2 emission reduction from ridesplitting trips, an optimization model for shared ride matching is established and solved using a graph-theoretic algorithm. Additionally, a priority assignment policy is designed to preferentially assign available electric vehicles to feasible ridesplitting trips that have greater potential for emission reductions. Comparative experiments conducted in Chengdu, China show that the proposed model can achieve higher levels of CO2 emission reduction without compromising service quality in ridesplitting operations. Furthermore, significant improvements in emission reductions can be achieved by implementing the priority assignment policy instead of a random assignment policy for electrified ridesplitting trips, particularly when electric vehicles are limited. Finally, the effects of maximum tolerable delay and electric vehicle penetration are further analyzed to provide valuable insights for government authorities and ridesourcing companies aiming to enhance both the economic and environmental benefits associated with ridesplitting.

Nowadays, the burning of fossil fuels, particularly petroleum, natural gas, and coal, meets the rising need for power and fuels for automobiles and industries.This has given rise to ecological and climate challenges.This thesis explores these issues from three distinct perspectives: (i) experimental, (ii) computational, and (iii) process simulation, with a focus on studying CO2 as an alternative and economically viable raw material.Firstly, the experimental study is focused on the synthesis, characterization, and testing of novel catalysts for electroreduction of CO2 and oxalic acid, an intermediate product of CO2.Electrocatalysts based on Cu supported by citrus (orange and lemon) peel biomass are prepared.These catalysts exhibit activity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, emphasizing the effectiveness of biomasses, particularly orange peels, as environmentally friendly precursors for sustainable and efficient electrocatalysts.In addition, graphitic carbon nitrides/TiO2 nanotubes (g-C3N4/TiNT) composites are prepared for the electrocatalytic reduction of oxalic acid to glycolic acid, revealing superior electrocatalytic properties compared to pristine TiNT.Characterization by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electronic microscopy were performed for all the prepared electrocatalysts.Delving into the reduction of CO2 on Cu catalysts, a computational study about the synthesis of methanol on Cu(111) surface is performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.A systematic study is carried out to define the activation energies of the elementary reactions by using mGGA DF.Consequently, it is shown that the rate-controlling step is CH3O* hydrogenation and the formate pathway on Cu(111) proceeds through the HCOOH* intermediate.Finally, the process simulation, performed by using the software Aspen Plus 11 from AspenTech Inc., is based on the comparison of a catalytic (oxidation of ethylene glycol) and an electrocatalytic process (CO2 electroreduction chain) to synthesize glycolic acid.An economic analysis of the operational and investment costs reveals that the catalytic process is more cost-effective due to the current instability of electrocatalysts and proton exchange membranes, resulting in increased maintenance costs and, consequently, higher prices for the product.

The development of low-temperature CO2 methanation catalysts with excellent performance has been challenging. Herein, we report a CoAlO catalyst derived from layered double hydroxide (LDH) that modulates the Co species of a multifunctional catalyst through a reduction process. The CoAlO catalyst with a surface-coated CoO film achieved CO2 conversion up to 29.0 % at 160 °C, which was superior to that of noble metal catalysts. The multiple characterizations were used to reveal the relationship between the catalytic activity and the chemical state of Co species. The results showed that the reaction followed the H-assisted activation pathway, where the rate of formate intermediates generation determined the overall reactivity. Meanwhile, the reduction–oxidation (RO) process in the catalyst preparation and the water generated in the reaction could reduce the size of Co particles, which were favorable for CO2 activation. This work offers a promising catalyst design for low-temperature methanation reaction.

In March 2023, Pakistan's Cabinet approved a Clean Air Policy which established ambient air quality targets and identified priority actions in the major air pollutant-emitting sectors. This work describes a quantitative air pollutant and greenhouse gas mitigation modeling assessment at national and subnational scale that provided evidence to inform Pakistan's Clean Air Policy. Air pollutant emissions are quantified historically (2010–2021) and projected to 2050 for baseline (without implementation of mitigation measures) and for scenarios which model the implementation of 18 specific mitigation measures. The assessment identified five major air pollutant-emitting sources nationally: Households (35% national total primary PM2.5 emissions), Transport (5%), Industry (16%), Agriculture (17%), and Waste (24%). Pakistan's Clean Air Policy identifies a priority mitigation measure for each of these sectors, which collectively could reduce national PM2.5 emissions by 36.4% in 2030 compared to the baseline. Full implementation of all 18 mitigation measures would reduce primary PM2.5 emissions by 80% in 2050 compared with the baseline. Developing a Clean Air Policy was committed to in Pakistan's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to help achieve Pakistan's climate change commitment while improving public health. This study shows that the Clean Air Policy could also have benefits for Pakistan meeting its climate change goals, with an estimated 5% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and 42% reduction in methane emissions achievable by 2050 from full implementation of the actions evaluated in this assessment. As Pakistan's Clean Air Policy is implemented, progressively updating this air pollutant and climate change mitigation assessments can help track progress on its achievement.

Abstract CO2-hydrate formation in porous media diminishes injectivity, which is crucial for sustained high-rate CO2 injection in geological sequestration, posing risks throughout the value chain. Confined water in small pores induces a shift in the CO2-hydrate envelope, especially in high-porosity, low-permeability chalk structures. This study aims to establish a CO2-hydrate envelope in chalk and explore the impact of brine salinity and other gases on hydrate formation. Experiments are conducted using a well-designed coreflooding rig, where a core sample is mounted with separate brine and CO2 inlet lines to minimize hydrate formation outside the porous media. Precise temperature monitoring and simultaneous injection of CO2 and water guarantee both phases' presence, with temperature reduction leading to CO2-hydrate formation. CO2-hydrate formation is tracked through pressure difference and electrical resistivity responses within the core. Preliminary findings demonstrate the repeatability and reproducibility of results, with observed heat release during hydrate initiation and subsequent temperature increase. Significant differential pressure increase indicates injectivity loss during CO2-hydrate formation, mitigated by elevated temperature, restoring core permeability. Temperature-dependent variations in hydrate formation and dissipation are noted, with ongoing experiments exploring the impact of brine salinity and non-CO2 gases on the hydrate envelope. Restricting water into small pores alters the CO2-hydrate envelope's stability, particularly in high-porosity, low-permeability chalk structures, warranting careful consideration due to limited experimental data available in the literature.

Analyzing building loads and energy-efficient retrofits is crucial for effective energy management and sustainable development. Strengthening the identification and analysis of factors that impact energy consumption is informative for devising appropriate measures. In order to address the current limitations in analyzing building energy consumption, the present study proposes a combination of the arc elasticity analysis method with CO2 storage technology. By introducing sensitivity and arc mean elasticity indices, the cooling and heating loads of building energy consumption can be analyzed. Subsequently, a CO2 refrigeration system and compression process can be designed to optimize the storage of CO2 and facilitate its role in energy conservation and reduction of energy consumption. Thus, the research aims to fulfill the potential of CO2 in promoting energy efficiency and reducing consumption. The study utilized software simulation and experimental analysis to examine the impact of the proposed method. The findings revealed a positive correlation between the heat transfer coefficient and the building's annual heat load. In addition, the maximum data variation of the building's cold load was a mere 0.05 per cent, and the relative discrepancy between the software simulation and the actual load values was less than 10 per cent. The exterior building's total cold load value showed a difference of more than 25 per cent when cooled with CO2 intervention compared to the non-intervention result. Furthermore, the building's maximum load reduction reached 3.4 per cent when uniformly varying the thickness of the insulation layer from 40 mm to 100 mm. The proposed method demonstrates a positive impact on building energy sensitivity analysis. Its energy loss design for various parts of the building could offer useful references for practical engineering designs.

Recently, CO2 emissions have increased, and energy generation accounts for 42.5% of worldwide CO2 emissions, making it a serious problem owing to global warming and environmental change. To address this, power-generating units are increasingly aiming to reduce emissions while minimizing costs. The primary goal of this research is to develop a complete UC method that not only optimizes the operation of an 11-generator thermal power plant but also contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions. In this paper, a weighted sum method was used to combine multiple objectives into a single objective through weighted combinations. An efficient hybrid algorithm to support unit commitment (UC) decisions is introduced in this context. The model addresses the significance of CO2 emissions, recognizing the need to reduce the environmental impact of power generation. Finally, the study emphasizes decision-making processes that support thermal power plant operations with integrated PV systems.

Closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle by means of the sustainable electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) toward formate (FA) is a promising strategy for CO2 abatement, clearing the path toward a carbon neutral future. Currently, three possible reaction pathways have been identified for the eCO2R toward FA, all of which are initiated by the adsorption of CO2 on the electrocatalyst's surface. Therefore, a possible strategy to enhance the availability of CO2 near the active sites is to combine an active electrocatalyst material (here, SnO2) with a known carbon capture medium (here, nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (N-OMC)). SnO2 was introduced in situ during the N-OMC synthesis, yielding SnO2-N-OMCs. We approached the state of the art for Sn-based N-doped carbon electrocatalysts in terms of performance under industrially relevant currents with an average FEFA of 59% for SnO2-N-OMC (6) and 61% for SnO2-N-OMC (2). Moreover, the SnO2-N-OMC electrocatalysts require a low overpotential, courtesy of the N-OMC support, compared to the state of the art, for the selective conversion of CO2 toward FA at the industrially relevant current density of 100 mA cm–2. Additionally, the 24 h stability of the best performing SnO2-N-OMC electrocatalysts is explored, and pulverization/agglomeration and in situ SnO2 reduction are identified as major degradation pathways, allowing future research to be steered more accurately toward more stable Sn-based electrocatalysts for the eCO2R toward FA. An optimal combination of both the SnO2 species and the N-OMC carbon capture medium could result in a synergistic effect, especially when utilization of the N-OMC support material is optimized to morphologically stabilize the SnO2 active species.

Cementing is one of the most crucial operations in an oil well since it fixes the casing and prevents fluid migration across permeable zones. However, the material used in this process, Class G cement, faces exposure to various agents during and after its curing process, particularly at greater depths where temperatures and pressures are elevated. Exposure of this cement to elements like brine, H2S gas, and CO2 gas tends to compromise the material's durability and the well's integrity. Consequently, exposure to these agents leads to modifications in the cement paste's physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Thus, investigations into the influence of these agents are crucial to ensure the integrity of the cement sheath. In this study, Class G cement pastes were exposed for three months in an autoclave under elevated pressure (20 MPa) and temperature (88 °C) in a brine-saturated environment with either H2S or CO2 at different stages. The research investigated mechanical behavior through uniaxial and triaxial compression tests, physical properties through porosity and micro-computerized tomography tests, and chemical properties through X-ray diffraction and pH tests. The study demonstrates that confining pressure significantly affects the deformation of samples exposed to brine+H2S and brine+CO2, causing plastic deformations at confining pressures above 20 MPa even before applying deviatoric stresses. Exposure to acidic gases also leads to a 27% reduction in compressive strength for brine+H2S and a 45% reduction for brine+CO2, affecting the elastic moduli due to potential micro-defects originating from the curing process and chemical reactions induced by the presence of the acidic gases.

Facing the current sustainability challenges requires reduction in building stock energy usage towards achieving the European Green Deal targets. This can be accomplished by adopting techniques such as fault detection and diagnosis and efficiency optimization. Taking an Estonian school as a case study, an occupancy-based algorithm for scheduling ventilation operations in buildings is here developed starting only from energy use data. The aim is optimizing the system’s operation according to occupancy profiles while maintaining a comfortable indoor climate. By relying only on electricity meters without using carbon dioxide or occupancy sensors, we use the historical data of a school to develop a DBSCAN-based clustering algorithm that generates consumption profiles. A novel occupancy estimation algorithm, based on threshold and time-series methods, then creates 12 occupancy schedules that are either based on classical detection with an on-off method or on occupancy estimation for demand-controlled ventilation. We find that the latter replaces the 60% capacity of current on-off schedules by 30% or even 0%, with energy savings ranging from 3.5% to 66.4%. The corresponding costs are reduced from 18.1% up to 62.6%, while still complying with current national regulations for indoor air quality. Remarkably, our method can immediately be extended to other countries, as it relies only on occupancy schedules that ignore weather and other location-specific factors.

Human skin-derived ECM aids cell functions but can trigger immune reactions; therefore it is addressed through decellularization. Acellular dermal matrices (ADMs), known for their regenerative properties, are used in tissue and organ regeneration. ADMs now play a key role in plastic and reconstructive surgery, enhancing aesthetics and reducing capsular contracture risk. Innovative decellularization with supercritical carbon dioxide preserves ECM quality for clinical use. The study investigated the cytotoxicity, biocompatibility, and anti-inflammatory properties of supercritical CO 2 acellular dermal matrix (scADM) in vivo based on Sprague Dawley rat models. Initial experiments in vitro with fibroblast cells confirmed the non-toxic nature of scADM and demonstrated cell infiltration into scADMs after incubation. Subsequent tests in vitro revealed the ability of scADM to suppress inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) presenting by the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1. In the in vivo model, histological assessment of implanted scADMs in 6 months revealed a decrease in inflammatory cells, confirmed further by the biomarkers of inflammation in immunofluorescence staining. Besides, an increase in fibroblast infiltration and collagen formation was observed in histological staining, which was supported by various biomarkers of fibroblasts. Moreover, the study demonstrated vascularization and macrophage polarization, depicting increased endothelial cell formation. Alteration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was analyzed by RT-PCR, indicating the reduction of MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 levels over time. Simultaneously, an increase in collagen deposition of collagen I and collagen III was observed, verified in immunofluorescent staining, RT-PCR, and western blotting. Overall, the findings suggested that scADMs offer significant benefits in improving outcomes in implant-based procedures as well as soft tissue substitution.

One carbon neutralization measure applied in the concrete sector is the use of artificial carbonate in concrete for immobilization. This CO2 reduction technology corresponds to the CO2 emitted during concrete production. When considering the marketability of these technologies, especially for newly developed products in the carbon market, it is essential to quantify the amount of CO2 fixed as inorganic carbonate. Additionally, as a representative test specimen for concrete containing aggregate, a φ100 × 200 mm cylinder specimen is conventionally used for physical property evaluation. To evaluate the amount of CO2 fixed in one batch of concrete, a mass far from that of the conventional chemical analysis sample may need to be analyzed. Therefore, in this study, we investigated a pulverization process for concrete analytical materials. We also propose a new analytical apparatus that can be used to measure large cylinder specimens. Experimental results showed that the newly developed analyzer, equipped with a mass balance and CO2 and H2O gas analyzer for large cylinders, exhibited excellent analytical variability and measurement speed performance. It was also inferred that the homogenization process is necessary to grind the entire cylindrical concrete specimen into a fine powder and homogenize it to improve the representativeness of the concrete.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is an important technology for mitigating the effect of climate change. It involves the capture of CO2 from a point source, transport it through pipelines and store it in geological reservoirs for permanent storage. CCUS enables the use of fossil fuel-based power plant sources that produce a steady amount of energy and the reduction of CO2 emissions from these sources simultaneously. While CO2 sources are easy to characterize, the storage parameters of geological reservoirs are more difficult to measure, thus, estimates are provided and used for planning large-scale CCUS systems. CO2 utilization can provide a means to delay CO2 emissions by converting it highly valuable products, however, its sequestration potential is highly uncertain. A systematic mathematical approach is needed to effectively plan CCUS systems considering the risks associated with the estimates in the characteristics of the geological reservoir and the sequestration benefits from CO2 utilization. In this study, an optimization model is developed for planning multi-period CCUS systems under neutrosophic environment. The model considers managing storage risk by maximizing satisfaction from minimizing risks, minimizing dissatisfaction from consequences brought by these risks, and minimizing indeterminacy from inaccuracy of storage characteristics estimates. For utilization, the model considers the satisfaction for CO2 utilization benefits, dissatisfaction for opportunity losses, and indeterminacy in sequestration potential. Two case studies are used to illustrate the model where a sensitivity analysis is performed to illustrate the effect of the different risk appetite on the optimal solution. These cases studies reveal important insights on scheduling operations between CO2 sources and sinks and the allocation of captured CO2 for storage and utilization. The model can be used to develop policies for considering the risks associated with these uncertainties and how it will be managed.

To learn more about the behavior of amine (NH2)-functionalized metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived noble metal catalysts in the removal of aromatic volatile organic compounds in air, benzene oxidation at low temperatures has been investigated using 0.2-, 0.8-, and 1.5%-platinum (Pt)/Universitetet i Oslo (UiO)-66-NH2. The benzene conversion (XB) of x%-Pt/UiO-66-NH2-R under dry conditions (175 °C) was 23% (x = 0.2%) < 52% (x = 0.8%) < 100% (x = 1.5%): 'R' suffix denotes reduction pretreatment using a hydrogen (10 vol %) and nitrogen mixture at 300 °C for the generation of metallic Pt (Pt0) sites and simultaneous partial MOF decomposition into carbon- and nitrogen-loaded zirconium dioxide. The prominent role of reduction pretreatment was apparent in benzene oxidation as 1.5%-Pt/UiO-66-NH2 did not exhibit catalytic activity below 175 °C (dry condition). The promotional role of moisture in benzene oxidation by 1.5%-Pt/UiO-66-NH2-R was evident with a rise in the steady-state reaction rate (r) at 110 °C (21 kPa molecular oxygen (O2)) from 1.3 × 10–3 to 5.0 × 10–3 μmol g–1 s–1 as the water (H2O) partial pressure increased from 0 to 1.88 kPa. In contrast, the activity was lowered with increasing RH due to catalyst poisoning by excess moisture (r (110 °C) of 6.6 × 10–04 μmol g–1 s–1 at 2.83 kPa H2O (21 kPa O2)). Kinetic modeling suggests that XB proceeds through the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism on the Pt/UiO-66-NH2-R surface (dissociative O2 chemisorption and the involvement of two oxygen species in benzene oxidation). According to the density functional theory simulation, the carbon and nitrogen impurities are to make the first XB step (i.e., hydrogen migration from the benzene molecule to the substrate) energetically favorable. The second hydrogen atom from the benzene molecule is also extracted effectively, while the oxygen derived from O2 facilitates further XB. The Pt0 sites dissociate the O2 and H2O molecules, while the product of the latter, i.e., free hydrogen and hydroxyl, makes the subsequent XB steps energetically favorable.

Abstract Using CO2 as a heat extraction medium from the subsurface offers several compelling advantages. These benefits result from CO2's distinct properties, notably its lower viscosity compared to water, as well as its pronounced density variations under varying pressures. Using CO2, it becomes possible to harness higher flow rates and density fluctuations to create a thermosyphon effect. These effects result in significant cost savings when contrasted with conventional water-based geothermal projects. To effectively predict and optimize the utilization of CO2 in geothermal applications, a precise understanding of CO2 properties and CO2-hydrocarbon gas-water mixtures become imperative. We conducted a series of highly accurate composition, viscosity and density measurements of CO2-methane-water mixtures. To prepare the mixtures, CO2 and CO2-methane gas was humidified in a saturating unit with accurate control of pressure and temperature. The humid gas was then directed through a capillary rheometer and an oscillating U-tube to measure viscosity and density of the mixtures. The outlet was equipped with a multi-stage gravimetric hygrometer to measure the water content and get the composition of the mixture. To ensure reproducibility and high quality of the data, the experiments were conducted repeatedly. Our research yielded data across a spectrum of CO2-methane-water properties. The measured water solubility in CO2 agreed with existing literature, while significantly extending the available dataset into the realm of high pressure and temperature conditions, pertinent to CO2 geothermal applications. This extension elucidated the non-linear relationship between solubility and pressure. Brine salinity has a noticeable impact on water solubility in CO2, causing up to a 15% reduction. Our investigation also established the relationship between water solubility and the CO2 content within CO2/Methane mixtures.Furthermore, our study precisely quantified the influence of CO2's water content on phase density and viscosity, revealing that while water's effect on CO2 density is modest, it engenders a substantial difference in CO2 viscosity, with variations of up to 9.1% observed between dry and water-saturated CO2. This paper addresses critical knowledge gaps pertaining to the modelling of CO2-methane-water fluids for CO2 geothermal applications. Our laboratory findings substantially enhance the dataset for water solubility in CO2 under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions. Furthermore, we shed light on the influence of brine salinity and gas composition, aspects that have not been extensively explored previously. Additionally, we unravel the impact of these properties on the density and viscosity of CO2-rich phases, enabling accurate predictions of volumetric and flow behaviour. Furthermore, this paper presents a comprehensive account of our experimental methodology and procedures. The results obtained have been rigorously cross verified with existing literature data, affirming the robustness of our chosen approach.

This study explores a green pathway for urea synthesis using plasma-ice interaction with gas mixtures of N2 + CO2 and NH3 + CO2. Electrical and optical emission spectroscopy were employed to characterize the plasmas, revealing that urea formation involves complex reactions driven by high-energy species, producing reactive nitrogen and carbon intermediates that further react to form urea. Physicochemical analyses of plasma-treated ice showed increased pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and reduced oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). Optimization of plasma process parameters (gas pressure, applied voltage, and treatment time) was performed to enhance urea formation. Among these parameters, plasma treatment time had the most substantial influence. Increasing treatment time from 20 to 60 minutes significantly impacted physicochemical properties: for N2 + CO2 plasma, pH increased by 21.05%, EC by 184.7%, and ORP decreased by 27.48%; for NH3 + CO2 plasma, pH increased by 27.37%, EC by 239.05%, and ORP decreased by 72.67%, respectively. The study shows that NH3 + CO2 plasma produces a significantly higher concentration of urea (7.7 mg L-1) compared to N2 + CO2 plasma (0.55 mg L-1). This is attributed to the direct availability and reactivity of ammonia, which simplifies reaction pathways and enhances intermediate formation. These findings highlight the potential of plasma-ice interaction as an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method for urea synthesis, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional processes.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active site may also boost catalytic performance. Here we have designed “negatively charged Ag (nc‐Ag)” active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only govern surface process by bonding with the intermediates), the nc‐Ag sites could manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with CO faradaic efficiency of 97%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

The 1,2-insertion reaction of CO2 into metal–hydride bonds of d6-octahedral complexes to give κ1-O-metal-formate products is the key step in various CO2 reduction schemes and as a result has attracted extensive mechanistic investigations. For many octahedral catalysts, CO2 insertion follows an associative mechanism in which CO2 interacts directly with the coordinated hydride ligand instead of the more classical dissociative mechanism that opens an empty coordination site to bind the substrate to the metal prior to a hydride migration step. To better understand the associative mechanism, we conducted a systematic quantum chemical investigation on the reaction between CO2 and fac-(bpy)Re(CO)3H (1–Re–H; bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) starting with the gas phase and then moving to THF and other solvents with increased dielectric constants. Detailed analyses of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) and intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs) reveal that the reaction is enabled in all media by an initial stage of making a 3c-2e bond between the carbon of CO2 and the metal-hydride bond that is most consistent with an organometallic bridging hydride Re–H–CO2 species. Once CO2 is bent and anchored to the metal-hydride bond, the reaction proceeds by a rotation motion via a cyclic transition state TS2 that interchanges Re–H–CO2 and Re–O–CHO coordination. The combined stages provide an asynchronous–concerted pathway for CO2 insertion on the Gibbs free energy surface with TS2 as the highest energy point. Consideration of TS2 as a rate-determining TS gives activation barriers, inverse KIEs, substituent effects, and solvent effects that agree with the experimental data available in this system. An important new insight revealed by the analyses of the results is that the initial stage of the reaction is not a hydride transfer step as has been assumed in some studies. In fact, the loose vibration of the TS that can be identified for the first stage of the reaction in solution (TS1) does not involve the Re–H stretching vibrational mode. Accordingly, the imaginary frequency of TS1 is insensitive to deuteration, and therefore, TS1 leads to no significant KIE.

Abstract This study explores a green pathway for urea synthesis using plasma-ice interaction with gas mixtures of N2 + CO2 and NH3 + CO2. Electrical and optical emission spectroscopy were employed to characterize the plasmas, revealing that urea formation involves complex reactions driven by high-energy species, producing reactive nitrogen and carbon intermediates that further react to form urea. Physicochemical analyses of plasma-treated ice showed increased pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and reduced oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). Optimization of plasma process parameters (gas pressure, applied voltage, and treatment time) was performed to enhance urea formation. Among these parameters, plasma treatment time had the most substantial influence. Increasing treatment time from 20 to 60 minutes significantly impacted physicochemical properties: for N2 + CO2 plasma, pH increased by 21.05%, EC by 184.7%, and ORP decreased by 27.48%; for NH3 + CO2 plasma, pH increased by 27.37%, EC by 239.05%, and ORP decreased by 72.67%, respectively. The study shows that NH3 + CO2 plasma produces a significantly higher concentration of urea (7.7 mg L-1) compared to N2 + CO2 plasma (0.55 mg L-1). This is attributed to the direct availability and reactivity of ammonia, which simplifies reaction pathways and enhances intermediate formation. These findings highlight the potential of plasma-ice interaction as an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method for urea synthesis, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional processes.

To investigate the influence of Ag and the loading of Ni species, Ni-Ag type catalysts were synthesized with varying Ni/Ag ratios (1, 1.5 and 2) using the coprecipitation method. The catalysts were extensively characterized using various techniques such as TG-DSC-SM, XRD, ICP, BET, SEM-EDX and TPR and subsequently tested in the CH4/CO2 reaction without any pretreatment. Regardless of the ratio employed, a phase mixture containing NiO and Ag was observed after calcination under air between 600 °C and 1200 °C. SEM analysis confirmed the presence of a close interface between Ag and NiO. The specific surface area was found to be significantly higher for the catalyst with lower Ni content (R = 1). TPR analysis demonstrated that the inclusion of Ag facilitated the reduction of Ni at lower temperatures. XRD analyses of the spent catalyst confirmed catalyst reduction during the reaction. Among the samples, a catalyst with Ni/Ag = 1 exhibited superior catalytic activity without any pretreatment under a reduction atmosphere, in which case the conversions of methane and CO2 at 650 °C amounted to 38 and 45 mol%, respectively, with H2/CO = 0.7 and 71 mol% of H2. The presence of Ag species enhances the stability of the Ni catalyst and improves catalytic performance in the dry reforming of methane.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active site may also boost catalytic performance. Here we have designed “negatively charged Ag (nc‐Ag)” active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only govern surface process by bonding with the intermediates), the nc‐Ag sites could manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with CO faradaic efficiency of 97%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

Aluminium industry stands out as a significant source of CO2 emissions, due partially to the high energy demand of the alumina extraction stage. Accordingly, this study explores the implementation of direct resistive heating of mid-temperature processes in alumina production as an alternative to decrease CO2 emissions. Additionally, two different strategies are evaluated to decarbonize alumina industry: the generation of renewable electricity through solar photovoltaic panels and the integration of a CO2 capture plant based on calcium looping technology. This work comprehends the modelling and sizing of these plants and the assessment of their economic performance through the calculation of their Net Present Value and their respective payback periods. The integration of both strategies into an alumina refinery model reveals that electrification of low and mid-temperature processes yields a 15 % reduction in CO2 direct emissions, whereas calcium looping demonstrates the potential to capture 97 % of emissions with a 7 % energy penalty. Also, economic assessments indicate substantial potential for improvement through in-site electricity generation via solar photovoltaic panels, exhibiting a payback time of 4.5 years. Conversely, the feasibility of a calcium-looping plant is hindered by high capital expenses, necessitating a longer payback period of 19–24 years. Sensitivity analyses underscore the suitability of in-site renewable electricity generation, whereas carbon emission taxes emerge as crucial in incentivizing carbon-neutral processes, with thresholds around 95–125 €/tonne of CO2. Despite potential deviations from real industrial settings, this study provides evidence for environmentally friendly strategies in alumina production that demonstrate limited adverse effects on economic performance.

This research aims to study and develop a model to demonstrate the causal relationships of factors used to forecast CO2 emissions from energy consumption in the industrial building sector and to make predictions for the next 10 years (2024–2033). This aligns with Thailand’s goals for sustainability development, as outlined in the green economy objectives. The research employs a quantitative research approach, utilizing Linear Structural Relationships based on a Latent Growth Model (LISREL-LGM model) which is a valuable tool for efficient country management towards predefined green economy objectives by 2033. The research findings reveal continuous significant growth in the past economic sector (1990–2023), leading to subsequent growth in the social sector. Simultaneously, this growth has had a continuous detrimental impact on the environment, primarily attributed to the economic growth in the industrial building sector. Consequently, the research indicates that maintaining current policies would result in CO2 emissions from energy consumption in the industrial building sector exceeding the carrying capacity. Specifically, the growth rate (2033/2024) would increase by 28.59%, resulting in a surpassing emission of 70.73 Mt CO2 Eq. (2024–2033), exceeding the designated carrying capacity of 60.5 Mt CO2 Eq. (2024–2033). Therefore, the research proposes strategies for country management to achieve sustainability, suggesting the implementation of new scenario policies in the industrial building sector. This course of action would lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions (2024–2033) from energy consumption in the industrial building sector to 58.27 Mt CO2 Eq., demonstrating a decreasing growth rate below the carrying capacity. This underscores the efficacy and appropriateness of the LISREL-LGM model employed in this research for guiding decision making towards green economy objectives in the future.

The CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2–ODHP) is a highly important reaction for not only producing large amounts of propylene but also consuming the CO2 resource. GaN/zeolite catalysts deliver preferable activity in the reaction. However, similar to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, there are shortcomings such as poor stability and coke accumulation, especially when operated at temperatures higher than 550 °C. Generally, carbon deposition is one of the main reasons for catalyst deactivation. The limited mass transfer greatly aggravates the deposited carbon formation, since carbon precursors could not be removed in time. In the present work, we modified zeolites with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores, which could offer a shorter diffusion distance and pore-rich structure to enhance the mass transfer. Thanks to this enhancement, the catalyst offers an initial propane conversion of 68.0% with a yield of 39.4% to propylene, surpassing other reported GaN/zeolite catalysts to data. Importantly, the catalyst showed a low loss rate of activity and a low amount of deposited carbon, which was easily regenerated compared with those of other catalysts without a short b-axis or hierarchical pores. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirmed that the reaction involves a coupling reaction of direct dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction via reverse water–gas shift reaction, and CO2 participates in the reaction. The present work sheds light on designing an efficient catalyst for CO2–ODHP via a mass transfer-boosted strategy and, importantly, is expected to provide inspiration in constructing a zeolite with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds great prospects for transforming CO2 into useful chemicals. However, there is still a long way to go to develop effective and affordable electrochemical CO2RR catalysts. In this work, a nickel-decorated nitrogen-doped biomass-derived porous carbon (Ni@N-BPC) catalyst was developed. The catalyst displayed a high specific surface area and superior CO2RR capability. The Faraday efficiency of CO exceeds ninety percent, ranging from a broad potential of 400 mV (−0.7 to −1.1 V vs RHE), reaching approximately 98.41% at −0.9 V vs RHE. The reaction pathway of CO2 conversion to CO on Ni@N-BPC was analyzed by the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy method. Based on theoretical calculations, the rate-determining step shifts from the *COOH creation to the *CO desorption step by Ni anchoring. Meanwhile, N doping modulates the electronic structure and facilitates charge transport, lowering the overpotential of the rate-determining step, thus facilitating the formation of CO. This work offers fresh perspectives on the development and utilization of biomass-derived carbon materials as CO2RR electrocatalysts.

CO2 geological sequestration in coal seams can be carried out to achieve the dual objectives of CO2 emission reduction and enhanced coalbed methane production, making it a highly promising carbon capture and storage technology. However, the injection of CO2 into coal reservoirs in the form of supercritical fluid (ScCO2) leads to complex physicochemical reactions with the coal seam, altering the properties of the coal reservoir and impacting the effectiveness of CO2 sequestration and methane production enhancement. In this paper, theoretical calculations based on ReaxFF-MD were conducted to study the interaction mechanism between ScCO2 and the macromolecular structures of both low-rank and high-rank coal, to address the limitations of experimental methods. The reaction of ScCO2 with low-rank coal and high-rank coal exhibited significant differences. At the swelling stage, the low-rank coal experienced a decrease in aromatic structure and aliphatic structure, and high-rank coal showed an increase in aromatic structure and a decrease in aliphatic structure, while the swelling phenomenon was more pronounced in high-rank coal. At the dissolution stage, low-rank coal was initially decomposed into two secondary molecular fragments, and then these recombined to form a new molecular structure; the aromatic structure increased and the aliphatic structure decreased. In contrast, high-rank coal showed the occurrence of stretches–breakage–movement–reconnection, a reduction in aromatic structure, and an increase in aliphatic structure. The primary reasons for these variations lie in the distinct molecular structure compositions and the properties of ScCO2, leading to different reaction pathways of the functional group and aromatic structure. The reaction pathways of functional groups and aromatic structures in coal can be summarized as follows: the breakage of the O–H bond in hydroxyl groups, the breakage of the C–OH bond in carboxyl groups, the transformation of aliphatic structures into smaller hydrocarbon compounds or the formation of long-chain alkenes, and various pathways involving the breakage, rearrangement, and recombination of aromatic structures. In low-rank coal, there is a higher abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures. The breakage of O–H and C–OH chemical bonds results in the formation of free radical ions, while some aliphatic structures detach to produce hydrocarbons. Additionally, some of these aliphatic structures combine with carbonyl groups and free radical ions to generate new aromatic structures. Conversely, in high-rank coal, a lower content of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures, along with stronger intramolecular forces, results in fewer chemical bond breakages and makes it less conducive to the formation of new aromatic structures. These results elucidate the specific deformations of different chemical groups, offering a molecular-level understanding of the interaction between CO2 and coal.

Electrolyte cations have been demonstrated to effectively enhance the rate and selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet their implementation in electrolyte‐free membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer presents significant challenges. Herein, an anchored cation strategy that immobilizes Cs+ on carbon vacancies was designed and innovatively implemented in MEA electrolyzer, enabling highly efficient CO2 electroreduction over commercial silver catalyst. Our approach achieves a CO partial current density of approximately 500 mA cm−2 in the MEA electrolyzer, three‐fold enhancement compared to pure Ag. In‐situ Raman and theoretical analyses, combined with machine learning potentials, reveal anchored Cs induces an electric field that significantly promotes the adsorption of *CO2− intermediates through performing muti‐point energy calculations on each structure. Furthermore, reduced adsorption of *OH intermediates effectively hampers competing hydrogen evolution reaction, as clarified by disk electrode experiments and density functional theory studies. Additionally, coupling our system with commercial polysilicon solar cells yields a notable solar‐to‐CO energy conversion efficiency of 8.3%. This study opens a new avenue for developing effective cation‐promoting strategy in MEA reactors for efficient CO2RR.

Electrolyte cations have been demonstrated to effectively enhance the rate and selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet their implementation in electrolyte‐free membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer presents significant challenges. Herein, an anchored cation strategy that immobilizes Cs+ on carbon vacancies was designed and innovatively implemented in MEA electrolyzer, enabling highly efficient CO2 electroreduction over commercial silver catalyst. Our approach achieves a CO partial current density of approximately 500 mA cm−2 in the MEA electrolyzer, three‐fold enhancement compared to pure Ag. In‐situ Raman and theoretical analyses, combined with machine learning potentials, reveal anchored Cs induces an electric field that significantly promotes the adsorption of *CO2− intermediates through performing muti‐point energy calculations on each structure. Furthermore, reduced adsorption of *OH intermediates effectively hampers competing hydrogen evolution reaction, as clarified by disk electrode experiments and density functional theory studies. Additionally, coupling our system with commercial polysilicon solar cells yields a notable solar‐to‐CO energy conversion efficiency of 8.3%. This study opens a new avenue for developing effective cation‐promoting strategy in MEA reactors for efficient CO2RR.

Agriculture has historically relied on fossil fuels as the primary source of energy, leading to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and exacerbating climate change. Brazil, as the third-largest producer and exporter of agricultural goods globally, plays a pivotal role in the transformation towards more sustainable practices. To this end, we propose a methodology to estimate CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions in agriculture, leveraging previous research on energy use in 23 crops in Brazil. The methodology aims to facilitate the comparison of emissions across different crops and production systems. Indirect emissions account for 36% of the total, while direct emissions account for 64%. Most direct emissions are due to the consumption of fertilizers and pesticides. The average emission per mass of product was 749.53 kg CO2-eq Mg−1, with cotton having the highest emissions and eucalyptus having the lowest emissions per product. The results highlight the importance of assessing GHG emissions from crops to identify emission reduction opportunities and promoting more sustainable agricultural practices. The study’s findings can inform policy recommendations and contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture practices globally, ultimately leading to a more environmentally friendly and economically viable agricultural sector.

The features of the adsorbent utilized for biogas purification are covered in this study. The aim of this study was to investigate the features of the banana stem adsorbent that may be applied to the adsorption process for the purification of biogas. The research involved the preparation of banana stem powder, the removal of lignin, the creation of adsorbents, and the purification of biogas using the adsorption technique. The adsorption contact time variations used were (30; 60; 90) minutes, with a biogas flow rate of 1 l/minute and a banana stem particle size of 20 mesh. Samples were analyzed by lignocellulosic content analysis, FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), and Gas Chromatography. According to the research findings, the adsorbent made from banana stems that can be used to purify biogas has a cellulose content of 47.5%, in the FT-IR analysis there is a shift in the peak number of stretching in the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid functional groups and has a surface structure of banana stem fiber that is orderly. The longer the contact time in the biogas purification process utilizing banana stem adsorbent with variations in adsorption contact time acquired, the more CO2 was adsorbed and the higher the CH4 concentration in the purified biogas. The biogas purification process resulted in a 39.893% reduction in CO2 content and the best contact time to produce the largest CH4 content was 90 minutes with the resulting CH4 content of 64.786%.

Abstract According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero report of 2023, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is projected to achieve an 8% reduction in cumulative emissions, with an estimated capacity of 6 billion tons per year by 2050. The purpose of this work is to estimate the magnitude of effort required to meet this projection, both from an economic and an energy point of view. Based on the post-combustion process of a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant and using Shell-Cansolv proprietary DC-103 solvent as a reference capture agent, an analysis of the energy requirements and economic costs associated with this technology has been conducted. This analysis includes parameters such as the energy surplus required for CO2 capture, Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) of the plant. Costs related to CO2 transport and storage have not been considered. The values obtained, applied to the IEA's climate neutrality goals, are essential for understanding the operational and economic challenges of post-combustion capture. In particular, considering the important role of CCS in the IEA report and considering the calculation made with the reference data, about 5000 plants would need to be built by 2050, equivalent to an average of nearly 200 plants annually. This would require an investment of $1.24 trillion according by the current available technologies. Moreover, an additional energy cost of about 25% for the CCGT plant would be required to capture the CO2 that has been emitted for the power production. This could also result in additional CO2 emissions, thereby reducing the net capture capacity of the system. These data illustrate the scale of commitment required to achieve the ambitious climate-neutrality goals, in which significant amount of economic efforts and energy resources will have to be drawn upon. It also highlights the urgency of investing in more efficient and sustainable CO2 capture technologies and strategies. This study provides quantitative data that can be useful in making informed decisions regarding the adoption and implementation of CCS technologies.

Previous studies have recognized the influence of crop cover and agricultural management on variables (soil temperature, soil moisture, and root biomass) that influence soil respiration. However, despite the influence of plant density and row spacing on these variables in the maize crop (Zea mays L.), their impact on soil respiration has received little attention. Thus, the aims of this study were (i) to investigate whether reducing plant density and row spacing influences soil respiration, and (ii) to identify the controlling variables (soil temperature and soil moisture) underlying this response. We conducted field experiments in Balcarce, Argentina, over two seasons. Treatments included (i) maize crops at high plant density (≈8 plants m−2) and narrow rows (0.52 cm, HDN), and (ii) maize crops at low plant density (≈6.5 plants m−2) and wide row spacing (0.70 cm; LDW). Leaf area index (LAI), soil CO2 fluxes, soil superficial temperature, and moisture (characterized by the water-filled pore space, WFPS) were assessed throughout the growing season. Grain yield and cumulative soil CO2 emissions were determined at the final harvest. Major findings relevant to understanding the influence of reducing plant density and wider row spacing on instant CO2 fluxes include: (i) LAI reductions were related to higher superficial soil moisture, which was consistent at LAI ≥ 3; suggesting higher decreases in water uptake than increases in soil evaporation, and in turn (ii) increments in soil moisture were associated with higher CO2 fluxes. While lower plant density and wider row spacing had notable short-term effects on WFPS and soil respiration fluxes, they did not significantly affect cumulative soil respiration throughout the growing season. However, the combination of this practice with low-yield potential genotypes that exhibit low stability to changes in resource availability can increase CO2 emissions per unit of grain yield. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of management practices on soil respiration and, consequently, on carbon cycling within agricultural ecosystems.

Abstract In 2021 the European Commission has proposed the Fit-for-55 policy package, requiring European countries to reduce their CO2 emissions by 55% with respect to 1990 by the year 2030, a first step to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Energy system modelling can be a valuable tool for national policymakers to choose the most appropriate technologies to achieve these goals efficiently. This article presents a model of the Italian power system realized employing the open energy modelling framework, Oemof. A Linear Programming Optimization is implemented to evaluate how to minimize system costs at decreasing CO2 emissions in 2030. The developed tool is applied to evaluate different research questions: i) pathway towards full decarbonization and power self-sufficiency of the electricity sector in Italy, ii) relevance of flexibility assets in power grids: li-ion batteries, hydrogen storage and transmission lines reinforcement. A 55% CO2 emissions reduction for the actual Italian power sector can be achieved through an increase of 30% of the total annual system cost. Achieving complete decarbonization and self-sufficiency increases significatively annual expenditures. However, cost mitigation is plausible through the integration of sector coupling methodologies or the adoption of a broader spectrum of technological solutions. Flexibility measures appear instrumental for decarbonization, particularly transmission lines, demanding a substantial expansion beyond the stated plans for 2030. This infrastructure is crucial in Italy to facilitate the transfer of renewable electricity generated in the Southern regions to the Northern areas, where a large portion of the electricity demand is located.

Precisely engineering point defects holds promise for the development of state-of-the-art photocatalysts for CO2 conversion. This study demonstrates the controllable creation of nitrogen vacancies (VNs) in the centers of heptazine rings of graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) via a photochemical-assisted nitrogen etching strategy. Spectroscopic analyses and theoretical simulations elucidate the photochemical process to hydrogenate the nitrogen situated at the center of the g-C3N4 heptazine ring and then release an ammonia molecule, accompanied by the photooxidation of the sacrificial agents. The catalyst with an optimal VNs concentration achieves a CO generation rate of 35.2 μmol g–1 h–1 with nearly 100% selectivity, comparable to the performance of the reported g-C3N4 materials. The remarkably improved photoactivity is due to the adjustments of the electronic structures and the midgap states of g-C3N4 by the delocalized π electron cloud created in the 12-membered ring surrounding the VN, which maximizes the light-harvesting efficiencies and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The VNs also activates the neighboring catalytic carbon centers to reduce the energy barrier for CO2 reduction. This work provides a good design concept to regulate catalytic activity by engineering point defects.

Abstract This report discusses experienced lower C2 / C2+ recovery in NGL recovery unit of Saudi Aramco Khursaniyah Gas Plant Department (KGPD). The experienced lower recoveries were due to the unplanned outage of HP gas and no available HP gas feed to NGL plant. This led to uneven flow distribution of the gas through splits and turbo expander side which ultimately led to lower utilization of critical heat integrations affecting the temperature profile of the demethanizer column and eventually led to a lower C2 recovery overall. However, KGP has evaluated and applied an initiative solution of recycling over 100 MMSCFD of sweet gas back to the NGL train through the start-up line. The innovative solution boosted the C2 recovery to 95% from 84%. This special mode of operation of recycling sweet gas held for 8 days and after preforming the enhancement it was observed that NGL production was increased by 6.5 MBD with a total quantity of 52,000 BBL. Moreover, fuel gas quality improved as a result of lower C2+ components resulted in CO2 avoidance by 52% which represents a reduction of to 70 KTons of CO2.

We developed a simple strategy for preparing IrSn bimetallic clusters encapsulated in pure silicon zeolites via a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis by using diethylamine as a stabilizing agent. A series of investigations verified that metal species have been confined successfully in the inner of MFI zeolites. IrSn bimetallic cluster catalysts were efficient for the CO selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the presence of excess O2. Furthermore, the 13CO temperature-programmed surface reaction results demonstrated that NO2 and N2O could form when most of the CO was transformed into CO2 and that Sn modification could passivate CO oxidation on the IrSn bimetallic clusters, leading to more reductants that could be used for NOx reduction at high temperatures. Furthermore, SO2 can also influence the NOx conversion by inhibiting the oxidation of CO. This study provides a new strategy for preparing efficient environmental catalysts with a high dispersion of metal species.

This paper reviews the work in the areas of optimization and efficiency enhancement of multi-energy systems (MES) for power-to-X conversion. The first study delves into the deployment of Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH2) within district-scale MES, emphasizing the role of PtH2 in achieving zero operational CO2 emissions, especially in systems with high renewable energy generation. The study also highlights the significance of heat pump efficiency, battery capital cost, and lifetime in influencing PtH2 implementation. The second investigation focuses on the integration of energy strategies for the transport and building sectors. It introduces a multi-objective optimization model that considers both sectors, aiming to minimize costs and life-cycle emissions. The findings suggest a potential transition from internal combustion engines to battery electric vehicles and a shift from gas boilers to heat pumps, leading to substantial emission reductions by 2050. Lastly, the third research explores the potential of power-to-gas (P2G) technology in enhancing the integration of renewable energy. By coordinating P2G with CO2-based electrothermal energy storage (ETES), the study demonstrates a significant improvement in the recovery efficiency of surplus wind power. Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of optimizing MES for sustainable and efficient energy conversion.

Abstract The global challenge of climate change has prompted significant steps to reduce CO2 emissions, guided by international agreements like the Paris Agreement, which set targets for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Acting too slowly could result in future losses and reputational issues, while moving too swiftly could jeopardize shareholder value due to the marginal profitability or potential losses resulting from technology challenges and the immaturity of many renewable projects. To navigate this complex landscape wisely, energy companies will benefit from developing Sequential Decision Making (SDM) policies to maximize value creation from decision flexibility under uncertainties. However, achieving this goal is not trivial. This necessitates the use of decision-analysis and optimization methods that deliver robust decision insights without prohibitive computational costs or delays. In this research, we propose a multi-objective SDM framework to model the dynamic energy landscape up to 2050, allowing exploration of various decision strategies related to different portfolios for allocating funds across three sectors: hydrocarbon, renewables, and CO2 reduction investments. This approach aims to maximize value during the transformation while accounting for uncertainties in hydrocarbon and renewable energy productions, energy prices, and production costs. The framework targets three main objectives: maximizing profit, minimizing CO2 emission, and enhancing competitive advantage. Our research evaluates the benefits of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve for the optimal investment decision policy for the SDM context. The sequential decisions of the energy company shape the virtual dynamic environment by influencing various variables. Subsequently, the environment responds with new variable states and immediate value feedback, reflecting the three defined objectives. Through repeated interactions, the RL algorithm navigates the extensive state space, learning the optimal decision policy amidst uncertainties.

Abstract The rate and severity of potential loss of CO2 injectivity in saline aquifers due to brine dry-out and salt accumulation near-wellbore is one of the main uncertainties in CCS project planning. Default parameters implemented in commercial reservoir simulators overestimate the degree of salt precipitation and resulting permeability impairment. The current study used lab and digital core analyses of Berea sandstone to estimate the petrophysical and dynamic properties for adjustment of predicted precipitation and flow reduction in reservoir simulation models of intermittent CO2 injection with aquifer drive. A set of 23 core plugs were subjected to repeated brine infiltration and drying for varying cycles and drying methods, and characterized by dried-state measurements of helium porosity, Klinkenberg permeability and mercury intrusion capillary pressure, plus non-destructive 3D X-ray imaging. In early cycles, permeability showed a gradual linear decrease with porosity loss, followed by a much steeper decline over later cycles, due to preferential accumulation of salt near the end faces. The plug-scale 3D porosity map was used to history match the flow experiments, to remove these end-effects from the salt-blocking porosity-permeability trend and generalized Kozeny-Carman exponent. High-resolution 3D imaging of a Berea subsample through an analogous sequence of small-scale brine infiltration-drying experiments was used to visualize the precipitated salt in pores, for pore-scale simulation of the porosity-permeability trend in the absence of larger-scale heterogeneities in salt distribution. Further, the co-flow of brine and CO2 during drainage and imbibition was also simulated in this salt-blocked image sequence, to generate curves of relative permeability and capillary pressure versus saturation of brine and dried salt. The resulting flow properties at pore- to plug-scale were integrated into a conceptual reservoir model to evaluate injectivity impairment caused by salt clogging.

Energy efficiency is crucial for the sustainable operation of industrial and urban sectors. However, practicing engineers seldom have access to open-source tools that can readily evaluate and compare scenarios. In this work, a novel web-based tool called ROSMOSE is developed and proposed for analyzing the energy efficiency of industrial and urban systems and comparing potential process integration options. This optimization framework computes and graphically represents the minimum energy requirements, the pinch temperatures, and the grand and integrated composite curves of process systems. Results are used to design utility systems that meet energy demands while minimizing a specified objective function such as total cost or environmental impacts. The Quarto environment, in which ROSMOSE is built, allows the integration of various open-source software and tools, such as database handling, process modeling suites, and optimization solvers, along with interactive data visualization and reporting tools. This paper discusses the application of ROSMOSE for the energy integration and total site optimization of a dairy process consisting of milk treatment, cream, and cheese production to demonstrate the tool features. Other integration options, such as the use of heat pumps or solar panels and the production of soft drinks or biogas, are proposed and evaluated. From 75% to 90% in fuel savings and up to 80% CO2 emissions reduction in the dairy plant are identified by optimizing utility integration. Moreover, complete electrification via heat pumps eliminates any gas needs and results in 85% energy savings and up to 96% CO2 emissions reduction. Activating renewable electricity sources, such as solar power, is plausible for this scenario. Finally, optimized waste management strategies lead to energy-autonomous production and net export of biogas to the grid but reduce cheese output due to prioritizing biogas production from whey. In this manner, decision-makers have access to a clear performance comparison for a list of system configurations to draw informed trade-offs. A similar approach could be adopted to aid decision-making for the design and operation of other industrial and urban energy systems using ROSMOSE.

Selectivity control of supported metal catalysts, which are most widely utilized in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, is of great scientific significance to obtaining the desired chemical product in a multipath reaction but has remained a grand challenging issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation from CH4 to CO can be tuned by a robust and unique support doping strategy by changing the reduction activity of H species over M/Ce1–xPrxO2−δ (M = Ru, Rh) in which metal (M) nanoclusters showed the same existence form on differently doped ceria nanorod supports. The CH4 selectivity of the catalyst decreased with an increase in the Pr content in the support. The selectivity of CH4 on Ru/CeO2 was higher than 90%, while on Ru/Ce0.2Pr0.8O2−δ, the selectivity of CO reached 80%. A variety of techniques, including steady-state isotope transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) type in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)–mass spectrum (MS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), had been applied in this work to analyze the structure–activity relationship between the doping of Pr and the selectivity of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru sites were not directly involved in the hydrogenation of carbon-containing intermediate species (including bicarbonate and formate) during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The active H species on the support sites, which are incorporated in RE3+–OH, directly contacted and reacted with the carbon-containing intermediate species. The introduction of Pr in the support weakened the reducing ability of the support, thus decreasing the reducing ability of H species on the surface of the catalyst, which further hindered the conversion of formate into CH4, resulting in the declined CH4 selectivity. Our study clearly revealed the important role of support in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction and proposed a strategy to modulate the reaction selectivity via support doping. By changing the redox performance of the support, the activity of H species on the support can be adjusted. Thus, the conversion of important reaction intermediates (such as formate) can be affected, so as to achieve precise regulation of the reaction products. We have provided a broader perspective for the selective catalyst design of heterogeneous catalysis and the reaction mechanism study of supported metal catalysts.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport industry, comprised almost entirely of CO2, account for around 23% of global emissions. Reducing these emissions is crucial, if countries are to meet their carbon reduction targets. Given that net zero carbon emissions are beginning to be enacted into various countries' laws, transport infrastructure owners now have time bound targets to meet. The accurate measurement of carbon currently expended by transport infrastructure is the first, and most critical, step of infrastructure owners' journey towards carbon reduction, as this Business as Usual carbon expenditure will form the basis for both carbon reduction measures and expansion of carbon measurement from limited embodied and construction scopes though to whole life cycle carbon assessment. This article provides an overview of a transferable method for calculating the carbon footprint of railway infrastructure assets, based on a novel carbon calculation data form. Use of this form will ensure a standardized and consistent approach in data collection methods, enabling the creation of carbon footprints for small scale case studies of individual railway earthworks (around 100 m linear length) with a specific focus on the construction life cycle stages. These stages form the basis for future expansions to the whole life cycle and therefore accuracy in carbon footprinting is vital. These figures can also be used for aggregation across multiple interventions, and again accurate data are required to ensure inaccuracies are not amplified.

Abstract As a key material for manufacturing clean energy technologies, steel is crucial for energy transition, but its production causes 2.6 Gton of CO2 emissions at global level each year. In 2020 the European Union (EU) set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, fostering innovation in the steel industry to reduce its environmental impact. However, a scenario-oriented and technologically comprehensive analysis assessing prospected environmental and market implications of steel decarbonisation strategies remains a gap, which is addressed in this paper. The analysis adopts a hybrid input-output-based LCA model built in the MARIO framework, extending the Exiobase database to represent the supply chains of the most promising low-carbon steelmaking technologies in the EU, such as hydrogen- or charcoal-injected blast furnaces and natural gas- and hydrogen-based direct reduction routes. The penetration of these technologies is explored by formulating scenarios resembling European climate targets. The results show a reduction in the carbon footprint of steel across all scenarios, ranging up to -26% in 2030 and to -60% in 2050. However, the extent of footprint reduction is highly dependent on the share of clean electricity in the European supply mix, highlighting the relevance of holistic decarbonization strategies. Economic implications affect steel prices, which rise up to 25% in 2030 and 56% in 2050, opening discussions on the need for suitable policies such as CBAM to avoid protectionism and encourage international technological progress.

Agricultural systems in the 21st Century face the double challenge of achieving climate neutrality while maintaining food security. Synthetic fertilizers rich in nitrogen (N-fertilizers) boost agricultural production at the expense of increasing climate impact. Public policies, such as the Farm-to-Fork (F2F) Strategy, aim to reduce the extensive use of N-fertilizers with the ultimate goal of achieving a climate neutral European Union (EU). However, the strong link between N-fertilizers and GHG emissions (i.e., CO2, CH4 and, especially, N2O) highlights the need to better understand the climate impact of this sector. The present study conducts a climate impact analysis of Spanish N-fertilizer sector for two periods: (i) from 1960 to 2020 using real data and (ii) from 2021 to 2100 considering five forecasted scenarios. The scenarios range from business-as-usual practices to a full accomplishment of the goals pursued by the EU's F2F strategy. The system's climate stability and neutrality are analysed for the different scenarios based on radiative forcing (RF) metrics. Additionally, the study evaluates the short-term impact of the EU decarbonization goals on the climate impact of the Spanish N-fertilizer sector. The results of the study illustrate that the long-lasting climate impact of N2O and CO2 emissions compromise the capacity of N-fertilizer sector to achieve climate stability and approach climate neutrality. However, the decarbonisation of transport and N-fertilizer production activities is an important driver to substantially reduce the life cycle CH4 and CO2 emissions in the Spanish N-fertilizer sector. The results also highlight that more severe reductions on N-cycles than those suggested by the EU's F2F are required, especially to reduce the long-lasting N2O emissions in the N-fertilizer sector. Overall, the study concludes that using RF-based metrics increases robustness and transparency of climate assessments, which is necessary for a higher integration of climate science within public policymaking.

The development of highly selective and energy efficient technologies for electrochemical CO2 reduction combined with renewable energy sources holds great promise for advancing the field of sustainable chemistry. The engineering of copper-based electrodes facilitates the conversion of CO2 into high-value multicarbon products (C2+). However, the ambiguous determination of the intrinsic CO2 activity and the maximization of the density of exposed active sites have severely limited the use of Cu for the realization of practical electrocatalytic devices. Here, we report a scalable strategy to obtain a high density of undercoordinated sites by maximizing the exposure of grain-boundary active sites using a direct chronoamperometric pulse method. Our numerical investigations predicted that grain boundaries modulate the adsorption behavior of *CO on the Cu surface, which acts as a key intermediate species associated with the production of multicarbon species. We investigated the consequence of grain-boundary density on dendric Cu catalysts (GB-Cu) by combining transmission electron microscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with electrochemical measurements. A linear relationship between the Faradaic efficiency of the C2+ product and the presence of undercoordinated sites was observed, which allowed to directly quantify the contribution of the grain boundary in Cu-based catalysts on the CO2RR properties and the formation of multicarbon products. Using a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, the high grain-boundary density Cu electrodes achieved a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 73.2% for C2+ product formation and a full-cell energy efficiency of 20.2% at a specific current density of 303.6 mA cm–2. The GB-Cu was implemented in a 25 cm2 MEA electrolyzer and demonstrated selectivity of over 62% for 70 h together with current retention of 88.4% at the applied potential of −3.80 V. The catalysts and electrolyzer were further coupled to an InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell to demonstrate a solar-to-fuel (STF) conversion efficiency of 8.33%. This work designed an undercoordinated Cu-based catalyst for the realization of solar-driven fuel production.

The injection of CO2 into subsurface reservoirs provides a long term solution for anthropogenic emissions. A variable injection rate (such as ramping the flow rate up or down) provides flexibility to injection sites, and could influence the amount of residual trapping. Observations made in cm-scale samples showed that starting at a low flow rate established a flow pathway across the core, leading to a long term reduction in pore space utilization, as increases in flux were accommodated with little change in saturation. In this work we assess the scalability of these observations by performing experiments with variable injection rates in larger samples: 5 cm diameter and 12 cm length, compared to 2.5 cm diameter and 4.5 cm length in our previous work (Spurin et al., 2024). We observed that starting at a low flow rate did not lead to a long term reduction in pore space utilization. Instead saturation increased significantly with increased flux, leading to a higher pore space utilization than experiments where injection started with the higher flow rate. The difference in observations depending on sample size and the role of heterogeneity highlights potential uncertainties in upscaling experimental observations to field-scale applications.

Abstract Well integrity plays an important role in any subsurface operation since the wellbore connects the target formation with surface facilities. Any compromising of well integrity may lead to unsafe operation, harm the environment, and may lead to complete failure of the project. This study introduces new built setup to study well integrity through permeability measurement of different wellbore components allowing new insights on the risk management of the geologic carbon storage projects. To study wellbore size sections like of casing-cement, cement-rock, or even casing-cement-rock, a large- scale facility was built at our underground laboratory at 150 m underground. The facility weighs approx. 3 tons with a length of 2 m, and a diameter of 0.7 m. It can handle samples of size 80 cm length and 30 cm diameter. Working pressure and temperature are up to 20 MPa, and 100 °C, respectively. The facility is equipped with two chamber real-time permeability measurement system that can determine the effective permeability of wellbore components based on transient method. Effective permeability of casing-cement composites is measured using CO2 at ambient and subzero temperatures to ensure the well integrity during CO2 injection in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Preparation of casing-cement samples requires special conditions to preserve integrity of the samples and avoid damage. The preliminary results show that the tested samples exhibit expected values of permeability at ambient temperatures (lower than 1×10−17 m2). Subzero temperatures, down to -11 °C have no effect on original permeability i.e., no increase in permeability after thawing. Pressure cycling experiments showed that the effective pressure and exposure time to CO2 play the most important role in permeability degradation. Furthermore, small pure cement cylinders (10 cm× 10 cm) were prepared and tested on a small-scale facility (analogous to the large-scale setup) to compare the results with the composites. In addition, the permeability of the composites was measured -before and after CO2 exposure- with H2 to account for the reduction in permeability due to the geochemical reactions. It was concluded that the permeability has decreased at least in one order from 10−18 m2 to 10−19 m2 owing to the reaction. The large-scale facility has been used for HYPOS (Germany) project and currently working for RETURN (EU) project as well. Its uniqueness is in the broad range of pressure and temperature working conditions and handling wellbore sections of the size 1:1. The results provide new insights into the risk management of storage projects saving time and cost.

The Rnf complex is the primary respiratory enzyme of several anaerobic prokaryotes that transfers electrons from ferredoxin to NAD+ and pumps sodium ions (Na+) across a membrane, powering ATP synthesis. Rnf is widespread in primordial organisms and the evolutionary predecessor of the Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqr)1. By running in reverse, Rnf reduces ferredoxin with NADH as reductant at the expense of the transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient and provides low potential electrons for nitrogenases as well as CO2 reductases. Yet, the molecular principles that couple the long-range electron transfer to the Na+ translocation across the membrane remain elusive. Here we resolve key functional states along the electron transfer pathway using redox-controlled cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that, in combination with biochemical functional assays and atomistic molecular simulations, provide key insight into the redox-driven Na+ pumping mechanism. We show that the reduction of the unique membrane-embedded [2Fe2S] cluster in the vestibule between the RnfA/E subunits electrostatically attracts the sodium ions, and in turn, triggers an inward/outward transition with alternating membrane access driving the Na+ pump and the reduction of NAD+. Our study unveils an ancient mechanism for redox-driven ion pumping, and provides key understanding of the fundamental principles governing energy conversion in biological systems.

The greenhouse environment represents a dynamic, nonlinear system characterized by hysteresis and is influenced by a myriad of interacting environmental parameters, posing a complex multi-variable optimization challenge. This study proposes a multi-objective adaptive annealing genetic algorithm to optimize above-ground environmental factors in greenhouses, addressing the challenges of variable environmental conditions and extensive heating and humidity infrastructure. Initially, after analyzing the multi-objective model of greenhouse above-ground environmental factors, including temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration, a comprehensive multi-objective, multi-constraint model was developed to encapsulate these factors in greenhouse environments. Subsequently, the model optimization incorporated multi-parameter coding of decision variables, a fitness function, and an annealing dynamic penalty factor. Validation conducted at Yangling Agricultural Demonstration Park revealed that the application of multi-objective adaptive annealing genetic algorithms (schemes 1 and 2) significantly outperformed the single-objective genetic algorithm (scheme 3) and the traditional genetic algorithm (scheme 4). Specifically, the improvements included a reduction in average temperature rise by 2.64 °C and 5.29 °C for schemes 1 and 2, respectively, equating to 20 % and 34 % decreases. Additionally, average humidification reductions of 2.39 % and 3.9 % were observed, alongside decreases in the total lengths of heating and humidification pipes by up to 2.99 km and 0.443 km, respectively, with a maximum reduction of 14 % in heating pipes. The integration of an annealing dynamic penalty factor enhanced the adaptive climbing ability of schemes 1 and 2, improving static stability and robustness. Furthermore, the number of iterations required to achieve convergence was reduced by approximately 170–240 times compared to schemes 3 and 4. This reduction in iterations also resulted in a significant decrease in running time by 5–13 min, corresponding to time savings of 31 %–56 %, thereby achieving further optimization.

Animal agriculture is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful environmental impacts, which underscores the need to shift away from the consumption of animal-based products. One promising nudge intervention is making plant-based meals the default option, so we tested this approach at six different university events across four academic institutions for effecting sustainable dietary change. Event attendees pre-selected their meal on one of two randomly assigned RSVP forms: one with a plant-based default and one with a meal with meat default. The results from our randomized controlled trial showed that participants had a 43-percentage point greater probability of selecting the plant-based meal when it was indicated as the default option. This effect was similar across events and academic institutions, which indicates that this default intervention is generalizable and can be successfully implemented at university events. The combined effect of using plant-based defaults at these six events was an estimated reduction of 104,387 kg of CO2 emissions, 299.9 m2 of land use, 959.0 g of nitrogen use, and 259.5 g of phosphorus use, which represent roughly 45–46.2% reductions in harmful environmental impacts relative to the meals chosen when using a meat default. Given the significance and magnitude of these environmental benefits, our results support the widespread implementation of plant-based defaults for helping universities improve their sustainability.

Electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and solvation effects can alter the free energies of ionizable functional groups in proteins and other enclosed porous architectures, allowing these nanostructures to tune acid-base chemistry as needed to support specific functions. Herein, we expand on this theme to examine how metal sites (M = H2, ZnII, CoII, CoI) affect the pKa of benzoic acid guests bound in discrete porphyrin nanoprisms (M3TriCage), which were chosen as model systems for better understanding how porous metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts might influence H+ transfer processes that are needed to support many important electrochemical reactions (e.g., reductions of H+, O2, or CO2). Lewis acidic CoII and ZnII ions increase the Brønsted acidities of the guests by 4 and 8 pKa units, respectively, while reduction of the CoII sites to anionic CoI sites produces an electrostatic potential that lowers acidity by ca. 4 units (8 units relative to the CoII state). Lacking functional metal sites, H6TriCage increases the acidity of the guests by just 2.5 pKa units despite the 12+ charge of the host and contributions from other factors (hydrogen bonding, pore hydration) that might stabilize the depro-tonated guests. Thus, the metal sites have dominant effects on acid-base chemistry in the M3TriCages, providing a larger pKa range (12.75 to ≥24.5 in CD3CN) for the encapsulated acid than attained via other confinement effects in proteins and artificial porous materials.

Centrifugal pumps consume majority of energy used by the electric motor driven systems among all end users of the industrial sector. Only in European region, a 1% improvement in efficiency (η) of the centrifugal pump is capable enough to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 572 tons per day. The prime motive of this research is to assess the applicability of the novel back cavity filling (BCF) in reducing the disk friction losses of centrifugal pumps without changing the pump's original design. By adding a solid ring to the bearing housing's back-cover plate, the BCF was applied to a medium specific speed pump (Ns = 54 rpm), resulting in a 1 mm back axial clearance from 13 mm. Numerical simulations and experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of BCF on pump performance under two conditions: with and without BCF at best efficient point (BEP) and various partload conditions for 1450 rpm (rated) as well as 1000 rpm. Pump performance characteristics were enhanced by BCF at both rpms for the whole flow rate range. At 1450 rpm, BCF resulted in an average 0.74% increment in total head, 2.08% reduction in input torque, and 2.70% increment in overall efficiency over the flow rate range. While an average 2.04% improvement in total head, 1.33% reduction in input torque, a 3.30% enhancement in overall efficiency were obtained at 1000 rpm. Performance parameter enhancement was higher at lowest part load compared to the BEP on rated rpm.

ABSTRACT: Green fiscal policies are becoming prominent policy instruments for achieving energy transition. However, while the effectiveness of these policies on renewable energy outcomes have been well documented, the economy-wide impacts are rarely studied. This study examines the economy-wide and environmental impacts of renewable energy production subsidy in Nigeria. The study provides a novel modeling framework for analysing fiscal and other incentives for green energy in Nigeria by incorporating self-generated electricity, which is a major component of electricity supply in Nigeria, into a macroeconomic model. The study uses a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to analyse the effectiveness and economic impacts of renewable energy production subsidy in Nigeria. CGE models are commonly used to assess the economy-wide impacts of public policy. Specifically, the PEP-1-1 model, which is a static single-country model, is used for the analysis. The model is calibrated on Nigeria's updated social accounting matrix (SAM). The results of the analysis show that renewable energy production subsidy is effective in enhancing the development of the renewable-electricity sector and encouraging the use of renewable electricity but does not significantly reduce the use of conventional electricity sources. The subsidy, if financed by public deficit, has positive impacts on real economic outcomes such as GDP, household income, welfare, and employment, but has a smaller effect on CO2 emissions. In contrast, the economic effects are mostly negative, but the CO2 emissions-reduction effects are larger if the subsidy is financed by reallocation of public expenditure. In addition, the effects on sectoral outputs are mixed. The results of this study can be used by policy makers to ascertain how to finance green subsidies in fiscally constrained and energy-poor developing countries. Specifically, policy makers should take cognizance of economic and feedback effects when designing and implementing environmental policies. Beyond Nigeria and the specific case of fiscal subsidies, the modeling framework presented in this study can be applied to other green energy policies and can be adapted to other developing countries.

The escalating issue of light pollution in urban environments poses multifaceted challenges, affecting not only the nocturnal sky but also exerting intricate influences on plant physiology. This study delves into the physiological responses of an urban ornamental tree, Populus alba L. clone DI-1, to varying intensities of streetlamp LED night lighting (NL), a shift from traditional High-Pressure Sodium lamps. The investigation "sheds light" on the molecular pathways underlying observed physiological regulations, aiming to offer a comprehensive understanding of the manifold effects of NL on this tree species. NL altered tree architecture, i.e. increased branch length and diameters, underscoring the dynamic response of trees to nocturnal artificial lighting conditions. Regarding tree physiology, the NL-triggered net CO2 assimilation (Pn) during the night resulted in limitations in stomatal conductance during daylight hours. This led to a reduction in Pn, particularly during dawn, hindering the quantum yield for the reduction of end acceptors of PSI. Changes in chlorophyll a-to-b proportion and overall concentration, electron transport chain, and gene expression further highlight the intricate interplay between NL and plant metabolic regulation. Notably, the increased gene expression of sugar transporters in both NL trees suggested a responsive shift in sugar and starch metabolism. This was reflected in the absence of a starch accumulation during daylight hours in NL leaves. The study emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to urban lighting, considering its profound impact on photosynthesizing citizens. These findings highlight the pressing need for the development of innovative lighting spectra with reduced impact on plant physio-chemistry while ensuring visibility for citizen safety.

While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber‐Bosch process, the high bond energy of N≡N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low‐temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the activated nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal‐organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe‐based catalyst MIL‐100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4 mmol g‐1 h‐1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL‐100(Fe) during the plasma‐driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe‐O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL‐100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL‐100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate‐limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

Dietary fibre (DF) is important for overall health and disease prevention. However, the intake of DF in Westernised countries is below the recommended level, largely due to the excessive consumption of low-fibre foods. Fortifying staple foods, such as bread, with dietary fibre ingredients is one approach to closing the fibre gap in our diet. However, incorporating purified and chemically modified fibre ingredients into food is challenging. This study unveils interactions between soluble–fermentable (arabinoxylan), insoluble–fermentable (resistant starch type IV) and insoluble–unfermentable (cellulose) fibre ingredients and their impact on bread quality using Response Surface Methodology. This resulted in an optimised mixture of these fibre ingredients that can coexist within a bread matrix while maintaining quality characteristics comparable to white wheat bread. The partial replacement of flour with fibre ingredients led to an interference with the gluten network causing a reduction in gluten strength by 12.4% and prolonged gluten network development time by 24.4% compared to the control (no fibre addition). However, the CO2 retention coefficient during dough fermentation was not affected by fibre ingredient inclusion. The fibre content of the white bread was increased by 128%, with only a marginal negative impact on bread quality. Additionally, the fibre-fortified bread showed a lower release of reducing sugars during in vitro starch digestion. This study illustrates the synergy of different types of fibre ingredients in a bread system to advance in closing the fibre gap.

Microbial grouting technology based on microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a new soil improvement method. This technique involves injecting bacteria and a cementation solution into soil pores to generate CaCO3 precipitation, thereby enhancing soil strength. Studies on microbial grouting from the aspects of experimental studies, theoretical models and engineering applications were extensively reviewed. Factors such as grouting methods, grouting rate, cementation solution concentration, and pH significantly influence the size and distribution of CaCO3. The three-phase grouting method enhances bacterial adsorption and soil strength. The higher grouting rate (grouting rate greater than reaction rate) and low pH (pH is not lower than 4) facilitate the uniform distribution of CaCO3. The size of CaCO3 and the soil strength increase with increasing cementation solution concentration. The existing models were established based on equilibrium flow, which overlooks the reduction of solute migration distance caused by the non-uniformity of the medium. Micro-structural analysis shows that CaCO3 precipitation between adjacent soil particles acts as a matrix supporting to increase soil strength. Microbial grouting technology can employ CaCO3 precipitation to seal wellbore cracks for CO2 storage and cement soil particles for slope stability and foundation improvement. Finally, the challenges encountered in microbial grouting technology were discussed.

Institutions of higher learning in South Africa are grappling with occasional power outages in lecture halls, leading to disruptions in academic activities and occasional loss of lecture hours. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of a grid-connected solar PV/Li-ion battery microgrid (μG) system aimed at maintaining a constant power supply to selected lecture halls at a university in the Western Cape, South Africa. The microgrid design, modelling, and simulations, conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, include the solar PV, Li-ion battery, energy consumption of the lecture halls (load profile), boost converter, bidirectional converter, and grid. Using the detailed design, modelling, and simulation, the study evaluates the economic and environmental impacts of integrating μGs, focusing on enhancing energy reliability, reducing operational costs, and mitigating CO2 emissions. The results indicate that integrating the microgrid resulted in a significant 51% reduction in energy cost and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 530 kgCO2e per hour. In Cases 2 and 4, where the battery supplied power, the annual battery degradation costs are 6.08% and 14.9% of the initial cost, respectively. The μG ensures an uninterrupted power supply and improves the overall reliability of the university’s energy infrastructure. It promotes environmental sustainability goals of zero emissions and maintains continuous academic activities during grid outages. Furthermore, it fosters a conducive learning environment, supports innovation and creativity in sustainable energy technologies, and sets a standard for other higher education institutions to integrate renewable energy-powered μGs.

The Shimensi super-large tungsten polymetallic deposit is located in the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous Porphyry–Skarn tungsten ore belt in the south Yangtze metallogenic belt. There are three types of mineralization: veinlet-disseminated type, thick quartz vein type and hydrothermal cryptoexplosive breccia type. Based on geological studies, this paper presents new petrographic, microthermometric, laser Raman spectroscopic and hydrogen and oxygen isotope research on the fluid inclusions from the deposit. The results show that there are five different types of fluid inclusions: liquid-rich inclusions, vapor-rich inclusions, pure liquid inclusions, pure vapor inclusions, and fluid inclusions containing a solid crystal. The homogenization temperatures of the fluid inclusion range from 140 °C to 270 °C, the salinities are 3 wt.%–5 wt.% NaCleq and the densities of ore-forming fluid range from 0.64 g/cm3 to 0.99 g/cm3. For the analyses of laser Raman spectroscopy, the ore-forming fluids can be approximated by a Ca2+-Na+-SO42−-Cl− fluid system with small amounts of CO2, CH4 and N2. Otherwise, the data of the pressure, pH and Eh show a fluid metallogenic environment of low pressure, weak acid and weak reduction. The values of the homogenization temperature in the three types of orebodies suggest that the mineralization is characterized by a decrease in temperature under the conditions of fluid immiscibility. The H-O isotope values are interpreted to indicate that the ore-forming fluids are mainly composed of magmatic water, and meteoric water is added with the process of magma rising.

Density functional theory (DFT) modeling has been useful to electrocatalyst research, yet simulating the complexities of the electrode–electrolyte interface hinders progress in understanding reaction mechanisms and the underlying kinetics. Though many approaches to incorporating electrochemical double layer (EDL) features in DFT calculations have been developed, uncertainty in interfacial solvent properties and the distribution of ions leave the impact of the EDL on electrocatalytic kinetics unclear. Elucidating the sensitivity of DFT predictions to the EDL properties and model is crucial. Herein, we use an analytical Grand Canonical DFT framework (aGC-DFT) to quantify the sensitivity of potential-dependent activation energies to parameters of the EDL, incorporating a Helmholtz EDL model with varying dielectric constant (εr) and EDL width (d). We compute the activation barriers for OC–H, CO–H, and OC–CO bond formation from CO* on Cu. These elementary reactions are critical within the heavily debated reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction and are likely to impact overall activity and product selectivity. We show the aGC-DFT method produces consistent results with explicit GC-DFT calculations, while enabling probing of the EDL model sensitivity at a much lower computational cost. Reaction steps with significant dipole moment changes (i.e., CO–H bond formation) are highly sensitive to the chosen EDL parameters, such that the relative barriers of the OC–H, CO–H, and OC–CO bond formation steps depend significantly on EDL properties. Without knowledge of the interfacial properties of the EDL, there is substantial uncertainty in activation barriers and elementary reaction rates within a DFT analysis of electrocatalytic kinetics.

L-asparaginase (L-asnase) is a versatile enzyme with uses in food industry and medicine. Current study aimed to isolate L-asnase producing microorganism/s without urease and glutaminase and optimize L-asnase production. First, screening and isolation of L-asnase-producing bacterial strains that did not produce glutaminase and urease from chicken gizzards were performed. For this purpose, the enzyme producing bacteria were screened on the agar medium supplied with substrate and phenol red indicator dye. Among the isolated bacteria, 1 isolate showed L-asnase free of glutaminase and urease. The selected strain was identified by biochemical, morphological and 16s rRNA sequencing. The selected strain was identified as Bacillus atrophaeus by 16S rRNA sequencing. The effects of incubation temperature (30°C) and time (72 hours), medium pH (8.0) and nutritional sources (glucose and NaNO3) on L-asnase production were determined. L-asnase was purified with acetone, and its molecular weight was determined to be 42 kDa by SDS-Page. Enzyme kinetics were also calculated, and it was determined that Vmax was 43 μmol/mL/min and Km was 2.7 mM. L-asnase activity was highest at 40 ℃ and the optimal pH was 8.0. L-asnase activity was stimulated by Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ but inhibited by Co2+, Na+, Zn2+, and Hg2+. L-asnase was utilized to treat potato chips before they were fried in order to assess its capacity to mitigate acrylamide. The result was an 80% reduction in acrylamide concentration when compared to the untreated control. Based on these findings, it appears that L-asnase could have potential use in the food industry.

Catalytic lignin pyrolysis for hydrocarbon liquid fuel production offers a viable alternative to fossil fuels. This study investigated the effects of transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) modified composite molecular sieve catalysts on the pyrolysis product distribution and behavior of alkali lignin (AL). AL pyrolysis achieved the highest liquid product yield of 24.50% at 600 °C, with high temperatures favoring hydrocarbon product formation. Volatile gaseous products from AL pyrolysis included H2, CO, CO2, phenolic compounds, heteroatomic compounds, and hydrocarbons. Molecular sieve catalyst additions were all favorable to the increase in hydrocarbon content. Compared with ZSM-5 and SBA-15, catalysts processed through acid etching and metal modification exhibited optimized pore structure, acid site distribution, and catalytic performance. Metal-modified composite molecular sieve catalysts (FeZS, CoZS, NiZS, and CuZS) generated more liquid products and promoted hydrocarbon formation. Notably, Cu-modified ZS catalysts exhibited superior acid site distribution and specific surface area, considerably reducing oxygenated compounds in the products. A higher catalyst-to-feedstock ratio increased the number of catalytically active sites, facilitating the cracking and deoxygenation of oxygenated components and generating more hydrocarbon products. The highest hydrocarbon yield for AL with a catalyst-to-biomass ratio of 10:1 under CuZS was 92.25%, with 66.07% being monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and 61.72% benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX). Additionally, kinetic and thermodynamic analyses revealed a substantial decrease in the average activation energy (Eα) of AL and a reduction in entropy value with the CuZS catalyst, indicating enhanced pyrolytic reactivity of AL. Therefore, the proposed method is highly effective for producing highly selective hydrocarbons through catalytic pyrolysis of AL.

Abstract Considering future developments and plans of decarbonization, the H2 pipeline transport technology will play a key role, and it could also be implemented as a component of an integrated system with CO2 pipelines (i.e. blue hydrogen). A key aspect of H2 technology development is the possibility to use existing natural gas transport infrastructure to be retrofitted for H2 transport. It is recognized that the transport of natural gas mixtures containing a 10% of hydrogen content could be in general feasible in existing onshore natural gas pipeline systems with minor modifications. Higher hydrogen contents, however, appear to have a large impact on the system components, requiring significant modifications instead. The more important bottleneck is related to the utilization of carbon steel grades normally used for natural gas transmission pipelines. Most of literature sources report a higher susceptibility of high steel grades to hydrogen embrittlement, i.e. the loss of toughness in steel which results from adsorption of hydrogen. Corresponding to the loss of net material toughness is a reduction in fatigue life, causing crack growth and propagation. There is a need to complement existing standards on hydrogen piping, pipeline and their components part of the hydrogen value chain to fulfill the energy transition design scenarios and the need to reuse existing gas transport infrastructure to support the economics of the transition. This translates to the definition of a clear methodology to carry out the assessment of existing natural gas pipeline systems (both onshore and offshore), in such a way to identify the tolerance to hydrogen of the different system components. All the engineering disciplines need to be involved, including piping & materials, machinery, instrumentation, as well as loss prevention & safety. Since the potential transport service conversion is normally carried out in steps, starting from a low H2 content in the blend with natural gas up to possibly 100% H2, the number of affected components will increase during this evolution; some of them could be ready to tolerate 100% H2 from the beginning, others will need some modifications, while some will need a complete replacement. This paper presents a description of Saipem methodology, that has been applied to a number of conversion studies relevant to transport systems mainly located in Europe.

Abstract. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are powerful anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) with high global-warming potentials (GWPs). They have been widely used as refrigerants, insulation foam-blowing agents, aerosol propellants, and fire suppression agents. Since the mid-1990s, emissions of HFCs have been increasing rapidly as they are used in many applications to replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) whose consumption and production have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol (MP). Due to the high GWP of HFCs, the Kigali Amendment to the MP requires the phasedown of production and consumption of HFCs to gradually achieve an 80 %–85 % reduction by 2047, starting in 2019 for non-Article 5 (developed) countries with a 10 % reduction against each defined baseline and later schedules for Article 5 (developing) countries. In this study, we have examined long-term high-precision measurements of atmospheric abundances of five major HFCs (HFC-134a, HFC-143a, HFC-32, HFC-125, and HFC-152a) at Gosan station, Jeju Island, South Korea, from 2008 to 2020. Background abundances of HFCs gradually increased, and the inflow of polluted air masses with elevated abundances from surrounding source regions were detected over the entire period. From these pollution events, we inferred regional and country-specific HFC emission estimates using two independent Lagrangian particle dispersion models and Bayesian inversion frameworks (FLEXPART-FLEXINVERT+ and NAME-InTEM). The spatial distribution of the derived “top-down” (measurement based) emissions for all HFCs shows large fluxes from megacities and industrial areas in the region. Our most important finding is that HFC emissions in eastern China and Japan have sharply increased from 2016 to 2018. The contribution of East Asian HFC emissions to the global total increased from 9 % (2008–2014) to 13 % (2016–2020). In particular, HFC emissions in Japan (Annex I country) rose rapidly from 2016 onward, with accumulated total inferred HFC emissions being ∼ 114 Gg yr−1, which is ∼ 76 Gg yr−1 higher for 2016–2020 than the “bottom-up” (i.e., based on activity data and emission factors) emissions of ∼ 38 Gg yr−1 reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is likely related to the increase in domestic demand in Japan for refrigerants and air-conditioning-system-related products and incomplete accounting. A downward trend of HFC emissions that started in 2019 reflects the effectiveness of the F-gas policy in Japan. Eastern China and South Korea, though not obligated to report to the UNFCCC, voluntarily reported emissions, which also show differences between top-down and bottom-up emission estimates, demonstrating the need for atmospheric measurements, comprehensive data analysis, and accurate reporting for precise emission management. Further, the proportional contribution of each country's CO2-equivalent HFC emissions has changed over time, with HFC-134a decreasing and HFC-125 increasing. This demonstrates the transition in the predominant HFC substances contributing to global warming in each country.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems are promising approaches for sustainable fuel processing. PEC devices, like conventional photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV-EC) systems, utilize solar energy for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Contrary to PV-EC systems, PEC devices integrate the photoabsorber, the ionic membrane, and the catalysts into a single reactor. This integration of elements potentially makes PEC systems simpler in design, increases efficiency, offers a cost advantage, and allows for implementation with higher flexibility in use. We present a detailed techno-economic evaluation of PEC systems with three different device designs. We combine a system-level techno-economic analysis based on physical performance models (including degradation) with stochastic methods for uncertainty assessments, also considering the use of PV and EC learning curves for future cost scenarios. For hydrogen, we assess different PEC device design options (utilizing liquid or water vapor as reactant) and compare them to conventional PV-EC systems (anion or cation exchange). We show that in the current scenario, PEC systems (with a levelized cost of hydrogen of 6.32 $/kgH2) located in southern Spain are not yet competitive, operating at 64% higher costs than the PV-driven anion exchange EC systems. Our analysis indicates that PEC plants' material and size are the most significant factors affecting hydrogen costs. PEC designs operating with water vapor are the most economical designs, with the potential to cost about 10% less than PV-EC systems and to reach a 2 $/kgH2 target by 2040. If a sunlight concentrator is incorporated, the PEC-produced hydrogen cost is significantly lower (3.59 $/kgH2 in the current scenario). Versions of the concentrated PEC system that incorporate reversible operation and CO2 reduction indicate a levelized cost of storage of 0.2803 $/kWh for the former and a levelized cost of CO of 0.546 $/kgCO for the latter. These findings demonstrate the competitiveness and viability of (concentrated) PEC systems and their versatile use cases. Our study shows the potential of PEC devices and systems for hydrogen production (current and future potential), storage applications, and CO production, thereby highlighting the importance of sustainable and cost-effective design considerations for future advancements in technology development in this field.

Here, we comprehensively investigated methanol electrooxidation on Cu-based catalysts, allowing us to build the first microfluidic fuel cell (μFC) equipped with a Cu anode and a metal-free cathode that converts energy from methanol. We applied a simple, fast, small-scale, and surfactant-free strategy for synthesizing Cu-based nanoparticles at room temperature in steady state (ST), under mechanical stirring (MS), or under ultrasonication (US). The morphology evaluation of the Cu-based samples reveals that they have the same nanoparticle (NP) needle-like form. The elemental mapping composition spectra revealed that pure Cu or Cu oxides were obtained for all synthesized materials. In addition to having more Cu2O on the surface, sample US had more Cu(OH)2 than the others, according to X-ray diffractograms and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The sample US is less carbon-contaminated because of the local heating of the sonic bath, which also enhances the cleanliness of the Cu surface. The activity of the Cu NPs was investigated for methanol electrooxidation in an alkaline medium through electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The potentiodynamic and potentiostatic experiments showed higher current densities for the NPs synthesized in the US. In situ FTIR experiments revealed that the three synthesized NP materials eletcrooxidize methanol completely to carbonate through formate. Most importantly, all pathways were led without detectable CO, a poisoning molecule not found at high overpotentials. The reaction path using the US electrode experienced an additional round of formate formation and conversion into carbonate (or CO2 in the thin layer) after 1.0 V (vs. Ag/Ag/Cl), suggesting improved catalysis. The high activity of NPs synthesized in the US is attributed to effective dissociative adsorption of the fuel due to the site's availability and the presence of hydroxyl groups that may fasten the oxidation of adsorbates from the surface. After understanding the surface reaction, we built a mixed-media μFC fed by methanol in alkaline medium and sodium persulfate in acidic medium. The μFC was equipped with Cu NPs synthesized in ultrasonic-bath-modified carbon paper as the anode and metal-free carbon paper as the cathode. Since the onset potential for methanol electrooxidation was 0.45 V and the reduction reaction revealed 0.90 V, the theoretical OCV is 0.45 V, which provides a spontaneous coupled redox reaction to produce power. The μFC displayed 0.56 mA cm–2 of maximum current density and 26 μW cm–2 of peak power density at 100 μL min–1. This membraneless system optimizes each half-cell individually, making it possible to build fuel cells with noble metal-free anodes and metal-free cathodes.

To the Editor: Delirium is a common postoperative complication associated with multiple adverse clinical outcomes in older patients.[1] According to the time of onset, delirium in the postoperative stage can be divided into emergence delirium (ED) and postoperative delirium (POD). ED occurs during or immediately after awakening from general anesthesia, whereas POD is usually found during postoperative days 1–7. Assessing patients for ED provides the first clue of a possible postoperative neurocognitive disorder.[2] Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective α-2 receptor agonist that is increasingly used in the perioperative period to induce sedation, analgesia, anxiolysis, and sympathetic tone suppression. Previous studies suggested that DEX may be an effective intraoperative adjuvant drug, which can reduce agitation and improve recovery after orthopedic surgery in older patients.[3,4] However, few studies focused on the relationships between DEX and ED. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to explore the relationships between intraoperative DEX administration and the incidence of ED in older patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery, and examine the effects of DEX on the electroencephalogram (EEG) trajectories of older patients during the emergence period and its correlation with ED occurrence. We analyzed 240 older patients who aged ≥60 years (DEX-group, n = 120; saline [SA] group, n = 120). The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit and the Richmond Agitation and Sedation scale were used to evaluate the occurrence of delirium during emergence. We also recorded and analyzed EEG trajectories during awakening, compared the differences in emergence trajectories between the two groups, and explored possible mechanisms. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (No. PJ2021-14-16). The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100053491, Date of registration: November 22, 2021). Written informed consent were obtained from all the participants or their legal representatives. The inclusion criteria were as follows: aged ≥60 years, body mass index (BMI) 18–30 kg/m2, older patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia combined with nerve block anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) refused to participate in the study; (2) diagnosed with a psychiatric disease; (3) preoperative cognitive impairment (defined as Mini-CogTM score ≤2), language barrier, or inability to communicate; (4) preoperative history of chronic pain or opioid abuse; (5) oral intake of levodopa, donepezil hydrochloride, and antidepressants; or history of stroke or brain tumor; and (6) inability to complete the neuropsychological tests. DEX or SA were diluted in 0.9% saline up to a volume of 50 mL in identical syringes yielding a concentration of DEX of 1 µg/mL. Each group of patients received DEX or saline 0.4 mL/kg loading volume (pumped within 15 min), etomidate 0.2 mg/kg, sufentanil 0.4–0.5 μg/kg, and cis-atracurium 0.15–0.20 mg/kg for anesthesia induction. After the patients lost consciousness and the muscle relaxation was satisfactory, a laryngeal mask was placed. Tidal volume (6–8 mL/kg) and inspiratory ratio (1:2) were set to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide at 35–45 mmHg. Combined with a lower extremity nerve block, DEX or saline 0.3 mL·kg−1·h−1, remifentanil 0.1–0.3 μg·kg−1·min−1, and propofol 4–6 mg·kg−1·h−1 were used to maintain the depth of anesthesia (anesthesia index [Ai]) at 40–60 in each group. DEX and SA stopped 20 min before the end of the surgery. At the end of the operation, the patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after spontaneous breathing was restored. The patients received the standard emergence program after stopping the anesthetic drugs to minimize external stimuli (such as noise and oral sputum suction) during the emergence period. EEG data for the whole emergence period (from the cessation of intravenous anesthetics to PACU discharge) were extracted and analyzed. For each patient, the EEG spectrograms were computed using the multi-taper method implemented in Chronux toolbox. The time-series plots of α (8–12 Hz) and δ (1–4 Hz) peak power were extracted from the EEG spectrogram. Then, the hypnograms depicting changes in these states over time were evaluated to determine emergence trajectories. Hypnograms were drawn using three types of anesthesia: non-slow-wave anesthesia (nSWA), δ-dominant slow-wave anesthesia (ddSWA), and α-dominant slow-wave anesthesia (adSWA). nSWA was defined as both δ and α power ≤7 dB; otherwise, δ or α power >7 dB, and ddSWA and adSWA were defined as δ power >α power and δ power ≤α wave power, respectively. Spectrograms with corresponding hypnotic maps were visually assessed by the observer. Patients must remain in a specific state (such as ddSWA, adSWA, or nSWA) for at least 60 s to be included in the appropriate trajectory category: (1) ddSWA to adSWA to nSWA to wake, (2) ddSWA to nSWA to wake, (3) adSWA to nSWA to wake, (4) ddSWA to adSWA to wake, (5) ddSWA to wake, (6) adSWA to wake, and (7) nSWA to wake [Supplementary Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58].[5] Continuous variables were compared using the unpaired two-tailed t-test or the Mann–Whitney test, and categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Correlation between ED and POD was performed as a post hoc exploratory analysis based on a univariable logistic regression model. P <0.05 was statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A total of 260 participants were randomly allocated to the group [Supplementary Figure 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. No statistically significant differences in the basic characteristic data, surgery type, and duration of surgery or anesthesia were found between the two groups [Supplementary Table 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. Intraoperative data (including anesthetic or vasoactive drug use) did not differ significantly between the two groups [Supplementary Table 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. According to the modified intention-to-treat analysis (n = 246), ED occurred in 23.39% (29/124) of cases in the DEX group and in 36.07% (44/122) of cases in the SA group (P = 0.030). According to the per-protocol analysis (n = 240), the DEX group had a lower incidence of ED than the SA group (24.17% [29/120] vs. 36.67% [44/120], P = 0.035) [Supplementary Table 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. Despite the lack of difference in the patterns of emergence trajectory between the two groups (P = 0.173), more patients in the SA group experienced a similarly sudden transition from the slow-wave sleep (include emergence trajectories ddSWA to [adSWA], ddSWA, or adSWA) directly to wakefulness (P = 0.033) [Supplementary Table 4, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. Postoperative plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein increased significantly in both groups although the incremental change was significantly smaller in the DEX group (P <0.001) [Supplementary Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. Exploratory analysis showed a significant correlation between ED and POD (odds ratio [OR]: 8.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.75–19.72, P <0.001). Our results suggested that intraoperative use of DEX in older patients who underwent joint replacement (including knee and hip) reduced the incidence of ED but did not reduce the incidence of POD during the first 3 days after surgery. These results may support the adjuvant use of DEX for smooth emergence from anesthesia and further evaluation of the potential of DEX to reduce long-term cognitive dysfunction in older patients.[6] DEX reduced the levels of inflammatory factors after surgery. However, few patients in the DEX group experienced a similarly sudden transition from slow-wave anesthesia (include emergence trajectories ddSWA to adSWA, ddSWA, or adSWA) directly to wakefulness. The occurrence of ED was independently associated with an increased risk of developing POD. The possible mechanism by which DEX reduces ED in elderly patients is related to the reduction of perioperative inflammatory response in the DEX group and its effect on the emergence trajectory of EEG during the recovery period. The emergence trajectory of an abrupt transition from SWA to wakefulness can be compared to arousal during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. It was demonstrated to be often associated with parasomnias or sleep disturbances resulting from fragmented sleep.[7] Consistent with the common characteristics between sleep and anesthesia, the transition from deep sleep to wakefulness can also be observed in some NREM sleep abnormalities, such as, night terrors or sleepwalking.[8] In our research, more subjects of control group emerging from general anesthesia were observed to move progressively from SWA to awake [38 (50.7%) vs. 27 (33.8%)].The patients who spent emergence time less in nSWA were more likely to have severe pain, and express a degree of agitation in recovery.[9] The "non-preferred" type of emergence trajectory in which the brain transitions directly from SWA to waking status, as compared with the sleepness status, would characterize as a parasomnic or less desirable trajectory and re-establish conscious awareness.[10] This may be one of the explanations for a larger number of patients with ED in the control group during postoperative recovery. Whether effective measures to prevent ED can reduce POD and improve perioperative outcomes remains to be further validated by more high-quality RCT studies in the future.Our observations could help anesthesiologists identify patients at ED risks before the patients fully emerge from general anesthesia. Intraoperative EEG monitoring can provide a method to predict and prevent delirium in PACU, thereby improving postoperative prognosis. To summarize, further researches on the delirium interventions of the patients with delirium-related EEG patterns need to be explored.
