Abstract In this study, a cross‐linked boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photocatalyst containing a carbazole donor group designed for photoelectrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction is synthesized and characterized. The BODIPY‐based system, coated onto a platinum surface, is evaluated for its electrochemical and photocatalytic performance under light illumination. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry measurements reveals enhanced photocurrent responses, confirming the catalyst's ability to effectively drive CO 2 reduction. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) analysis identifies the formation of ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) as a major reaction product, showing that its yield increased with extended reaction times. Additionally, the photocatalyst demonstrates remarkable performance with significantly increasing turnover numbers (TON) and turnover frequencies (TOF) over time, indicating stable and sustained catalytic activity. With a Faradaic efficiency of 34.79% at a potential of ‐1.15 V, this BODIPY system exhibits both high activity and long‐term stability. The combination of efficient electron transfer and visible light absorption by the carbazole‐BODIPY donor‐acceptor structure positions this system as a highly promising candidate for sustainable CO 2 conversion applications.

Abstract This study focuses on investigating the sole impact of an external electric field on the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 -based materials. Typically, built-in electric fields are used to efficiently separate free energy carriers and improve the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors. The creation of such field requires modifications to the photocatalyst that alter various properties such as adsorption and optical characteristics. These modifications make it challenging to isolate and interpret the promotion effect associated with the electric field alone. The investigations were carried out in the gas-phase conditions in a specially constructed reactor equipped with two electrodes connected to a high – voltage that provides a field strength of up to 5.7·10 3 V/cm. The results showed that the effect of electric field promotion varied significantly depending on the properties of titanium dioxide, such as structure, adsorption, and presence of impurities. The strength and the type (direct or alternating current) of the electric field also played a determining role. The greatest promoting effect was observed for rutile, the photocatalytic activity of which under an electric field increased threefold in the process of reduction of CO 2 with water vapor.

The Cu cocatalyst supported on the surface of TiO2 photocatalysts has demonstrated unique activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The valence state of copper significantly influences the catalytic process; however, due to the inherent instability of copper’s valence states, the precise role of different valence states in CO2 reduction remains inadequately understood. In this study, CuOx/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized using an in situ growth reduction method, and we investigated the impact of various valence copper species on CO2 photocatalytic reduction. Our results indicate that Cu+ and Cu0 serve as primary active sites, with the selectivity for CH4 and CO products during CO2 photoreduction being closely related to their respective ratios on the catalyst surface. The adsorption and activation mechanisms of CO on both Cu+ and Cu0 surfaces are identified as critical factors determining product selectivity in photocatalytic processes. Furthermore, it is confirmed that Cu+ primarily facilitates CH4 production while Cu0 is responsible for generating CO. This study provides valuable insights into developing highly selective photocatalysts.

Abstract Increasing emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to the use of fossil fuels and ongoing deforestation are affecting the global climate. To reach the Paris climate agreement, in the coming decades low emission technologies must be developed, which allow for carbon removal on a Gt per year‐scale. In this regard, we propose the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to oxalic acid as a potentially viable pathway for large scale CO 2 utilization and storage. Combined with water oxidation, in principle this transformation does not need stoichiometric amounts of co‐reagents and minimize the necessary electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide.

Coupling desalination with electrocatalytic reactions is an emerging approach to simultaneously addressing freshwater scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the salt removal rate in such processes is slow, and the applicable water sources are often limited to those with high salt concentrations. Herein, we show high‐performance electrocatalytic desalination by coupling with electrochemical CO2 reduction using a carbon catalyst. A ZIF‐8‐derived carbon catalyst embedded with Cu nanoparticles delivers a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.3% for CO production at 288 μmol cm‐2 h‐1. The efficient CO2 electroreduction generates high current densities, which drive fast salt ion transfer across ion exchange membranes. The integrated device enables one of the quickest salt removal rates of 1043.49 μg cm‐2 min‐1 among various desalination methods. Drinking water can be obtained with an ion removal rate of 99% when natural seawater is used as the water source.

The results of a thermodynamic analysis of the course of chemical reactions of the stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide by CO gas and the gasification reaction of solid carbon (Bella-Boudoir) are presented. The goals of the work are to obtain eigenexpressions for calculating the numerical values of the Gibbs free energy depending on temperature using tabulated values of the standard enthalpies of formation and entropies of inorganic substances, as well as to construct graphical dependences of the Gibbs energy on temperature using formulas from literary sources and obtained expressions. Numerical values of the boundary temperatures are obtained above which the chemical reactions of the stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide by CO gas and the chemical reaction of gasification of solid carbon (Bella-Boudoir) can or cannot thermodynamically proceed. Considering the complete coincidence of the obtained data on the own (obtained) expressions using two (direct and indirect) methods, it is possible to consider with a significant degree of probability the numerical values of the boundary temperature for the reactions of stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide and gasification of solid carbon as reliable, which indicates the possibility of the reduction of Mn2O3 from MnO2, Mn3O4 from Mn2O3 and MnO from Mn3O4 by CO gas, the Bell-Boudoir reaction and the impossibility of the reduction of manganese from MnO by CO gas at the temperatures of the actual process in reduction furnaces. This also confirms that CO gas is not a manganese reducer at the last stage of stepwise reduction of MnO according to scheme (B), refuting any theories and assumptions about the possibility of reducing Mn from MnO by CO gas.

Received: 22 October 2024; Revised: 25 November 2024; Accepted: 27 November 2024; Published: 4 December 2024 Abstract: The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted significant attention as a promising strategy for storing intermittent energy in chemical bonds while sustainably producing value-added chemicals and fuels. Copper-based bimetallic catalysts are particularly appealing for CO2RR due to their unique ability to generate multi-carbon products. While substantial effort has been devoted to developing new catalysts, the evolution of bimetallic systems under operational conditions remains underexplored. In this work, we synthesized a series of CuxNi1−x nanoparticles and investigated their structural evolution during CO2RR. Due to the higher oxophilicity of Ni compared to Cu, the particles tend to become Ni-enriched at the surface upon air exposure, promoting the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At negative activation potentials, cathodic corrosion has been observed in CuxNi1−x nanoparticles, leading to the significant Ni loss and the formation of irregularly shaped Cu nanoparticles with increased defects. This structural evolution, driven by cathodic corrosion, shifts the electrolysis from HER toward CO2 reduction, significantly enhancing the Faradaic efficiency of multi-carbon products (C2+).

Methanogenic bacteria are strictly anaerobic archaebacteria that are defined by their ability to form methane as the end product of their energy metabolism. This group of organisms had been studied extensively because of their phylogenetic status as archaebacteria (Archaea)1-3 and because of their important ecological role in the anaerobic carbon cycle.4 The study of the biochemistry of methanogenesis is of particular interest because of the participation of several unique types of cofactors and a number of unusual types of enzymes.5-8 All methanogens belong to the euryarchaeotal branch of the Archaea forming phylogenetically rather distantly related major groups, the Methanococcales (e.g., Methanococcus voltae), the Methanobacteriales (e.g., Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum), and the Methanomicrobiales (e.g,, Methanosarcina barkeri). The phylogenetic diversity is also reflected by a great diversity in morphology, cell wall structure, and metabolic and physiological properties (for recent reviews see References 9 to 11). Most methanogens can be cultivated on mineral salt media containing various energy substrates (see below), and ammonia and sulfide generally serve as nitrogen and sulfur sources, respectively. Various trace elements proved to be essential for growth of methanogens, most notably nickel, cobalt, and molybdenum,12-14 which are components of various enzymes and coenzymes involved in methanogenesis, and Na+, which is involved in energy coupling (see below).

Density functional theory calculations are employed to investigate the effects of various metal dopants on thiolates‐protected transition metal nanoclusters (NCs) for CO2 reduction, focusing on deviations from the linear scaling relation between COOH* and CO* for high CO selectivity. We first explore the most favorable positions for different dopants in several M25 (M = parent metal) NCs and assess the potential for ligand removal under reducing conditions. Furthermore, we construct an activity volcano for CO production in D1M24 NCs (D = dopant), revealing that NCs composed of coinage parent metals with group 12 metal dopants exhibit the most significant deviation from the scaling relation. This behavior is attributed to the tendency of these NCs to bind COOH* in a bidentate form, which stabilizes the O atom of COOH* through interactions with the oxyphilic dopants. As a result, several group 12 metal doped coinage metal NCs are identified as new promising candidates for syngas production due to their high activity towards both CO and H2 production.

Concrete is the most widely used construction material globally. However, its production, particularly that of cement, is a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, contributing to approximately 8% - 10% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This study aims to analyze and compare the embodied carbon (eCO2) of various concrete strength grades commonly utilized in Indonesia to offer insights for enhancing sustainability in the construction industry. The methodology involved designing concrete mixes according to Indonesian standards and calculating carbon emissions for each component. The findings revealed that the eCO2 in the Indonesian concrete mixes was significantly higher than that reported in the UK and US databases. This higher carbon footprint emerges primarily due to the greater cement content found in the Indonesian mixes. Nevertheless, the current study demonstrated that using fly ash as a supplementary cementitious material can substantially reduce the eCO2, with the mix containing fly ash showing a 42% reduction in emissions compared to the mix without fly ash. This research emphasizes the necessity for the Indonesian construction industry to adopt sustainable practices, including optimized mix designs and the use of low-carbon materials such as fly ash. In doing so, significant reductions in the carbon footprint of concrete can be achieved, contributing to the global efforts to mitigate climate change and to promote sustainability in construction practices.

The main goal of this study is to develop charging stations that use solar energy as an environmentally friendly alternative, in order to reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions produced from burning fossil fuels. The method used is qualitative with data collection through system observation and analysis of solar panel performance with dual-axis technology that can follow the movement of the sun. The results of the study show that the use of solar panels equipped with dual-axis actuators can increase the efficiency of sunlight absorption, so that the power produced is more optimal. From the analysis, it was found that these stations not only provide an efficient charging solution, but also contribute to a reduction in carbon footprint, with the potential for significant reductions in CO2 emissions. The conclusion of this study shows that the development of solar energy-based charging station technology is a strategic step in supporting the transition to a more sustainable energy source in Indonesia.

Excessive emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), have garnered worldwide attention due to their significant environmental impacts. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) techniques have emerged as effective solutions to address CO2 emissions. Recently, direct air capture (DAC) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) have been advanced within the CCUS framework as negative emission technologies. BECCS, which involves cultivating biomass for energy production, then capturing and storing the resultant CO2 emissions, offers cost advantages over DAC. Algae-based CCUS is integral to the BECCS framework, leveraging algae’s biological processes to capture and sequester CO2 while simultaneously contributing to energy production and potentially achieving net negative carbon emissions. Algae’s high photosynthetic efficiency, rapid growth rates, and ability to grow in non-arable environments provide significant advantages over other BECCS methods. This comprehensive review explores recent innovations in algae-based CCUS technologies, focusing on the mechanisms of carbon capture, utilization, and storage through algae. It highlights advancements in algae cultivation for efficient carbon capture, algae-based biofuel production, and algae-based dual carbon storage materials, as well as key challenges that need to be addressed for further optimization. This review provides valuable insights into the potential of algae-based CCUS as a key component of global carbon reduction strategies.

Leather, a versatile material, faces high resource consumption and waste issues in production. This study explores the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as a green solvent for leather impregnation, assessing its impact on the leather’s chemical and physical properties. Furniture and upper shoe leathers were exposed to CO2 pressures between 100 and 250 bar at 40°C. Results show decreasing fat content with increased pressure, which correlates with reduced tensile strength - especially significant in upper shoe leather at 250 bar with a nearly 50% reduction in fat content from 7% to 3.7% and tensile strength from 480 N to 250 N. However, pressure treatment can also enhance tensile strength when fat reduction is low. The highest increase in tensile strength, from 110 N to 180 N, was observed for furniture leather following treatment at 100 bar. In industrial settings with lower CO2 surplus, fat extraction impacts are assumed to be minimal, suggesting significant potential for resource-efficient leather production using scCO2.

Due to its non‐toxic nature, cost‐effectiveness, and natural abundance, carbon dioxide (CO2) is increasingly recognized as a valuable C1 source in organic synthesis. In addition to the building block for molecular construction, the role of CO2 as a promoter or catalyst to enhance reaction rates and selectivity is gaining attention. Acting as a reversible covalent Lewis acid, CO2 can function as an activating group in the transformation of various compounds, such as alcohols and amines, facilitating the dissociation of hydroxyl or activation of amino. It can also modulate the reactivity of nucleophilic reagents, including H2O, N‐heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), cyanide (CN), and nucleophilic reductants like borohydride (BH4‐). When CO2 interacts with these nucleophiles, it can exhibit Brønsted acidity or hydrogen‐bond donating capabilities and can also act as a coordinating ligand to transition metals in its carboxylate form (‐CO2‐). In this review, we mainly summarize and classify the synthetic applications and mechanistic insights of CO2‐promoted reactions according to different functional groups and bonding types, which include: CO2‐promoted functional transformation of alcohols; CO2‐promoted functional transformation of amines; CO2–promoted reactions in protic solvent; CO2‐promoted reactions via adducts of CO2 and nucleophiles; CO2‐promoted reductive reaction.

Iran ranks among the 20 most polluted countries globally, with a significant portion of carbon dioxide emissions stemming from fossil fuel-burning power plants. While these emissions are often associated with electricity generation, this study focuses on an overlooked source: the electricity distribution system within cities. Operational teams responsible for outage elimination, maintenance, and asset development—such as transformers and meters—contribute to emissions by relying on vehicles that navigate congested urban traffic. This research examines economic factors including development coefficients, failure rates, geographic conditions, inflation, and maintenance costs to optimise carbon dioxide emissions in three key sectors: outage elimination, maintenance, and development. Using sensitivity analysis of these parameters from 2016 to 2020, we quantified and proposed reductions in CO2 emissions across these activities. Additionally, a comparison of failure and maintenance rates identifies the processes with lower emissions. The findings provide a framework for optimising urban electricity distribution systems, offering insights into mitigating pollution at the distribution level and improving environmental sustainability in megacities.

The actual climate crisis is forcing the development of new energy sources that mitigate the negative effects of the climate change. Because of that, the use of fossil fuels is expected to be significantly reduced in the coming decades. In this scenario, the production of renewable fuels that reduce the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) is one of the main world challenges. The present study focuses on synthetic gas production using carbon dioxide from the cement industry, and green hydrogen, simulating the process using Aspen to address the technical and economic viability of the synthetic gas production. Advanced techniques such as the calcium looping and oxycombustion were used to efficiently capture CO2 and generate a renewable fuel with a reduced carbon footprint. Moreover, the integration into the existing infrastructure in Spain optimizes the operational efficiency of the project. A detailed technical-economic analysis was carried out to evaluate the feasibility and associated costs, as well as a sustainability analysis that includes all the production steps from the CO2 capture to the use of synthetic gas, with the aim of quantifying the reductions in GHG. The versatility and adaptability of this research allows adjustments according to market demand and external conditions. Because of that, this research is expected to contribute significantly to sustainable development by providing an innovative solution for carbon capture and clean energy generation.

Деятельность человека, в том числе сельскохозяйственная, ведет к значительной продукции парниковых газов, среди которых доминирующее положение занимает CO2 . Увеличение концентрации парниковых газов в атмосфере ведет к негативным изменениям климата на Земле. Возделывание сахарной свеклы в ЦЧР отчуждает большое количество CO2 из атмосферы, связывая его в форме углеводов, что позволяет рассматривать свекловичный агроценоз как сток углерода. Основные агротехнические приемы, несмотря на некоторое количество выделения С-CO2 , не способны превысить его поглощение основной продукцией; это свидетельствует о том, что в свеклосахарном производстве эмиссия углекислого газа меньше, чем сток. Сохранение гумусового состояния черноземов, внесение рациональных доз удобрений, ослабление минерализации органических удобрений, известкование, заделка пожнивных и корневых остатков сахарной свеклы и культур-предшественников способствует снижению эмиссии углекислого газа из свекловичных агроценозов. Human activity, including agricultural one, leadstosignifi cant production of greenhouse gases, among which С-CO2 occupies a dominant position. Cultivation of sugar beet in the Central Black-Earth Region takes a great quantity of С-CO2 from atmosphere forming carbohydrate compounds that allows considering sugar beet agrocenosis as a carbon stock. Main agrotechnical methods, though evolving some С-CO2 quantity, do not able to exceed its absorption by main product. This is the evidence of the fact that, in sugar beet industry, carbonic acid gas emission is somewhat lower than the stock. Maintainance ofhumus state, application of rational fertilizer doses, reduction of organic fertilizers’ mineralization, and plowing of after-harvesting and root residues of sugar beet and preceding crops in soil promotes decrease of carbon dioxide emission from beet agrocenoses.

Wound healing as a result of a skin injury involves a series of dynamic physiological processes, leading to wound closure, re-epithelialization, and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The primary scar formed by the new ECM never fully regains the original tissue’s strength or flexibility. Moreover, in some cases, due to dysregulated fibroblast activity, proliferation, and differentiation, the normal scarring can be replaced by pathological fibrotic tissue, leading to hypertrophic scars or keloids. These disorders can cause significant physical impairment and psychological stress and represent significant challenges in medical management in the wound-healing process. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of exogenously applied carbon dioxide (CO2) on fibroblast behavior, focusing on viability, proliferation, migration, and differentiation to myofibroblasts. We found that CO2 exposure for up to 60 min did not significantly affect fibroblast viability, apoptosis rate, or proliferation and migration capacities. However, a notable finding was the significant reduction in α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expression, indicative of myofibroblast differentiation inhibition, following CO2 exposure. This effect was specific to CO2 and concentration as well as time-dependent, with longer exposure durations leading to greater reductions in α-SMA expression. Furthermore, the inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation correlated with a statistically significantly reduced glycolytic and mitochondrial energy metabolism, and as a result, with a reduced ATP synthesis rate. This very noticeable decrease in cellular energy levels seemed to be specific to CO2 exposure and could not be observed in the control cultures using nitrogen (N2)-saturated solutions, indicating a unique and hypoxia-independent effect of CO2 on fibroblast metabolism. These findings suggest that exogenously applied CO2 may possess fibroblast differentiation-reducing properties by modulating fibroblast’s energy metabolism and could offer new therapeutic options in the prevention of scar and keloid development.

In response to the issues of air pollution, temperature, and noise, this project attempts to create an air quality, temperature, and noise monitoring system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This system will comprise physical components and a web platform that delivers real-time environmental reports. Users can readily obtain information regarding air quality, temperature, and noise levels via this platform, which takes advantage of the internet's accessibility. This Internet of Things-based device monitors environmental quality in six high-traffic areas in Malang, Indonesia. The system uses various sensors to monitor air quality, temperature, humidity, dust levels, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and noise pollution in real-time. Data was collected during peak traffic hours, demonstrating the direct influence of car emissions on air quality. The findings show that some regions' CO and particulate matter levels surpass safe criteria, notably during peak traffic periods, but CO2, humidity, and noise levels are below acceptable norms. These findings highlight the necessity for urban air pollution reduction initiatives. Additional sensor calibration and communication modifications are recommended to increase system accuracy and dependability. This study gives significant insights for local authorities to manage urban environmental quality and safeguard human health.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere and the substrate for the photosynthetic fixation of carbohydrates in plants. Increasing GHGs from anthropogenic emissions is warming the Earth’s atmospheric system at an alarming rate and changing its climate, which can affect photosynthesis and other biochemical reactions in crop plants favorably or unfavorably, depending on plant species. For the substrate role in plant carbon reduction reactions, CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in air potentially enhances photosynthesis. However, N uptake and availability for protein synthesis can be a potential limiting factor in enhanced biomass synthesis under enriched [CO2] conditions across species. Legumes are C3 plants and symbiotic N fixers and are expected to benefit from enhanced [CO2] in the air. However, the concurrent increase in air temperatures with enhanced [CO2] demands more detailed investigations on the effects of [CO2] enhancement on grain legume growth and yield. In this article, we critically reviewed and presented the online literature on growth, phenology, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, productivity, soil health, and insect behavior under elevated [CO2] and temperature conditions. The review revealed that specific leaf weight, pod weight, and nodule number and weight increased significantly under elevated [CO2] of up to 750 ppm. Under elevated [CO2], two mechanisms that were affected were the photosynthesis rate (increased) and stomatal conductivity (decreased), which helped enhance water use efficiency in the C3 legume plants to achieve higher yields. Exposure of legumes to elevated levels of [CO2] when water stressed resulted in an increase of 58% in [CO2] uptake, 73% in transpiration efficiency, and 41% in rubisco carboxylation and decreased stomatal conductance by 15–30%. The elevated [CO2] enhanced the yields of soybean by 10–101%, peanut by 28–39%, mung bean by 20–28%, chickpea by 26–31%, and pigeon pea by 31–38% over ambient [CO2]. However, seed nutritional qualities like protein, Zn, and Ca were significantly decreased. Increased soil temperatures stimulate microbial activity, spiking organic matter decomposition rates and nutrient release into the soil system. Elevated temperatures impact insect behavior through higher plant feeding rates, posing an enhanced risk of invasive pest attacks in legumes. However, further investigations on the potential interaction effects of elevated [CO2] and temperatures and extreme climate events on growth, seed yields and nutritional qualities, soil health, and insect behavior are required to develop climate-resilient management practices through the development of novel genotypes, irrigation technologies, and fertilizer management for sustainable legume production systems.

Trees have been the foundation of life. Dependency of the human race on trees for food, timber, fuel wood, fodder, fiber and non-timber products has been in evidence since the pre-historic times. Apart from human utilization, trees are an important part of the ecosystem and help in carbon sequestration, climate change mitigation, converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen (O2), soil conservation, habitat for wildlife and human recreation. Many of the traditional medicine systems give much importance to the therapeutic potential of medicinal trees. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 80% of the global population relies on such traditional knowledge systems. Severe anthropogenic pressures such as rapid deforestation, change in land use patterns, over-exploitation, invasive species and climate change have resulted in reductions of these plant genetic resources. Biotechnological tools such as plant tissue culture offer an alternative method for successful mass multiplication and clonal propagation of superior and elite tree genotypes. Clonal propagation of trees provides a rapid means for producing planting stock for reforestation, afforestation and plantation programmes and conservation of rare, endangered and threatened plant genetic resources. The present chapter is an attempt at making a comprehensive study on the development of in vitro regeneration protocols of some of the important medicinal tree species and highlighting their significance, challenges in tree micropropagation and future prospects

Abstract. Developing effective global strategies for climate mitigation requires an independent assessment of green-house gas emission inventory at the urban scale. In the framework of the Dutch Ruisdael Observatory infrastructure project, we have enhanced the Dutch Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) model to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) plume emission and three-dimensional dispersion within the turbulent boundary layer. The unique ability to explicitly resolve turbulent structures at the hectometer resolution (100 m) makes DALES particularly suitable for detailed realistic simulations of both singular high-emitting point sources and urban emissions, aligning with the goals of Ruisdael Observatory. The model setup involves a high-resolution simulation (100 m × 100 m) covering the main urban area of the Netherlands (51.5°–52.5° N, 3.75°–6.45° E). The model integrates meteorological forcing from the HARMONIE-AROME weather forecasting model, background CO2 levels from the CAMS reanalysis, as well as point source emissions and downscaled area emissions derived from 1 km × 1 km emission inventory from the national registry. The latter are prepared using a sector-specific downscaling workflow, covering major emission categories. Biogenic CO2 exchanges from grasslands and forests are interactively included in the hectometer calculations within the heterogeneous land-surface model of DALES. Our evaluation strategy is twofold, comparing DALES simulations with: (i) the state-of-the art LOTOS-EUROS model simulations and (ii) in-situ Cabauw tower measurements and Ruisdael surface observations of the urban background in the Rotterdam area at Westmaas and Slufter. Our comprehensive statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of DALES in modeling the urban-scale CO2 emission distribution and plume dispersion under turbulent conditions, but also revealed potential limitations and areas for further improvement. Thus, our new model framework provides valuable insights into emission transport and dispersion of CO2, in support of emission uncertainty reduction using atmospheric measurements and the development of effective climate policies.

The International Energy Agency reports a surge of over 250 million tons in global carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector in 2022, reaching close to 8 gigatons, predominantly fuelled by increased passenger and cargo activities post the COVID-19 pandemic. The aviation sector, constituting 3% of human-induced CO2 emissions, played a pivotal role in this surge, highlighting the urgent need for transformative measures. The urgency of decarbonizing the aviation sector, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa is underscored, considering its projected contribution to global carbon emissions and the lack of policies to adopt green technologies in the African aviation industry. The paper delves into the transformative impact of Electric Vehicle (EV) in aviation, highlighting the potential of EV adoption in ground operations and emphasizing the need for a robust charging infrastructure. Drawing insights from global case studies, the paper underscores the feasibility and benefits of EV adoption in the aviation industry. Ghana's EV Policy emerges as a pioneering force in the aviation industry's journey towards decarbonization. By strategically harnessing the policy's momentum and lithium resources, Ghana can position itself as a leader in adopting sustainable technologies, contributing to broader international efforts for a greener future in air travel. The National EV Policy should therefore be actively implemented, fostering a phased transition to EVs in the transportation sector to achieve emission reduction goals by 2045. Collaboration between the government and stakeholders should be strengthened to ensure the successful integration of EVs into Ghana's aviation, aligning with global trends for a sustainable and environmentally friendly aviation sector.

In efforts to mitigate global warming, reducing greenhouse gas emissions represented by carbon dioxide, this paper introduces a stepped carbon trading mechanism for local Integrated Energy Systems (IES) that are not yet engaged in carbon trading markets as a tool for carbon emission rights trading. To minimize both overall system costs and carbon trading expenses, we propose a refined Power-to-Gas (P2G) model that includes a waste heat recovery process. In addition, all gas-fired units within the IES are retrofitted to support low-carbon operations, and a coupled operation mode of carbon capture power plants and P2G is introduced. To manage uncertainties in wind and solar power output, Latin hypercube sampling and K-means clustering methods are employed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling strategy significantly reduces system operating costs while realizing an ∼16.2% reduction in carbon emissions.

The report discusses the serious environmental issues Indonesia's growing economy and rising energy use have brought about. In addition to examining government initiatives to lessen these impacts through sustainable development regulations, the goals include evaluating the connection between economic indicators and environmental results. The research employs a mixed-approaches strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative analysis, which employs time series data from 1991 to 2020, focuses on carbon dioxide emissions per capita as the dependent variable and GDP and energy consumption per capita as independent variables. Multiple linear regression using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) evaluates these correlations. A thorough grasp of the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and environmental deterioration is provided by qualitative analysis, which entails a review of the literature to investigate government initiatives addressing environmental concerns. The study results show a substantial positive correlation between Indonesia's carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, energy consumption, and economic development. The analysis indicates that the ongoing economic activities driven by fossil fuel consumption will exacerbate environmental degradation without significant intervention, necessitating effective government policies for sustainable development and emission reduction. The study concludes that economic growth and energy consumption significantly contribute to Indonesia's environmental degradation, particularly through increased carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. It recommends that the government strengthen policies promoting sustainable energy use, increase investment in renewable energy technologies, and implement stricter regulations on industrial emissions. Additionally, fostering public awareness and education on environmental sustainability is crucial for effective long-term solutions.

Abstract The impact of global climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions on human production and life is becoming increasingly severe. New energy sources, led by wind and solar power, have become the backbone of reducing carbon emissions. The main focus of this article is to develop advantages such as multi-energy complementarity, efficient integration, flexibility and stability, and low-carbon environmental protection. While meeting the diverse energy needs of the energy consumption side, it is necessary to reasonably allocate resources on the energy supply side and effectively absorb renewable energy. To begin with, this paper develops a multi-time-scale economic dispatch model for a holistic energy system, focusing on collaborative carbon reduction between energy sources and loads. The upper layer serves as a long-term energy scheduling mechanism, dynamically updating electricity prices and conveying them to the lower layer model. The lower layer functions as a short-term energy scheduling component, directing load management according to electricity prices and providing feedback on the load plan to the upper layer model. Both the upper and lower-layer models strive to minimize the overall operational costs as their primary objective. Secondly, the probability distribution of wind and photovoltaic power is discretized using sequence operation theory. The CPLEX is used to solve the above model. Finally, taking a comprehensive energy system as an example, the impact of source load side carbon reduction measures on the system scheduling results under multiple time scales is analyzed.

To scale carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R), establishing a structure–property–performance relationship of the catalyst under the reaction conditions is a priority. Particularly in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers, knowledge about the valence state and coordination environment of the catalyst is of value yet limited. We developed an MEA electrolyzer that utilizes X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the structural evolution of Cu2O-derived catalysts under CO2R and compare the same catalysts in a flow cell. Additionally, we study the influence of CO reduction and incorporating Ag on the reconstruction of the catalyst. We find that the strong reduction environment in the MEA and feeding CO leads to reconstruction of Cu2O particles, favoring higher coordination and lower oxidation states, which coincides with a shift in the reaction selectivity from C2+ to hydrogen. Conversely, incorporating small amounts of Ag in the catalyst restricts the reconstruction. These findings advocate for in situ studies in zero-gap electrolyzers.

Abstract In 2022, shipping was responsible for around 706 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, up 5% from 2020 and back to 2017-2018 levels. To accelerate the energy transition and reduce emissions in this sector, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set ambitious goals requiring all stakeholders’ radical actions. Several solutions have been proposed such as cruise speed reduction, on-board installation of a Carbon Capture and Storage system, use of low/zero carbon fuels in conventional internal combustion engines, and introduction or replacement of the main and auxiliary engines with novel technologies. Thanks to their high energy conversion efficiency, and reduced environmental impact, the interest in fuel cell-based systems for shipping propulsion has been rising in the last few years. In this work, the replacement of fossil fuel-based marine engines with fuel cell technology is analysed from technical and environmental points of view. A preliminary technical assessment, aiming at defining different powertrain configurations, is performed by starting from the characterization of the selected ships, in terms of installed power, navigation routes, and load profiles. The feasibility of the proposed solutions is evaluated by considering the fuel consumption and the emissions avoided with respect to the conventional solutions.

The main goal of this review paper is to show the advantages and challenges of photovoltaic cells/modules/panels and scintillators towards carbon footprint reduction for ecological safety. Briefly, the various types of solar-driven CO2 conversion processes are shown as a new concept of CO2 reduction. The health toxicity and environmental effects of scintillators, along with risks associated with use and disposal, are presented, taking into consideration inorganic and organic materials. Factors affecting the durability and lifespan of scintillators and the carbon footprint of solar cell production are analysed, considering CO2 emission. Moreover, the technology of recycling photovoltaic modules and scintillators, along with a SWOT analysis of scintillation material toxicity, is presented to find the best solutions for clean technology and ecological safety. Finally, we offer recommendations for the areas where the most significant reductions in CO2 emissions are expected to be implemented in the future of green energy in industry, including ESG strategies.

This study uses the application of Pinch analysis to optimize an integrated electrolyzer and methanation system, a promising approach for producing green hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG). By leveraging renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, electrolysis is used to produce hydrogen, which reacts with captured carbon dioxide in the methanation reactor to form methane. This process not only allows for efficient energy storage but also supports the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. A key focus of this study is the optimization of thermal energy flows within the system, which has not been extensively addressed in the literature. Pinch analysis was applied to identify the critical Pinch point, which revealed the temperature at which the most efficient heat recovery could be achieved. The design of a tailored heat exchanger network led to significant improvements, including a 66.45% reduction in hot utility consumption and an 18.85% reduction in cold utility demand. Overall, the system achieved global energy savings of 31.02%. These results were compared with the existing literature, demonstrating that our approach offers comparable or superior utility savings while addressing challenges, such as the complexity of chemical reactions and system integration. This research highlights the potential for substantial operational cost reductions and increasing sustainability in industrial applications, contributing to the advancement of renewable energy technologies and the decarbonization of energy systems.

Urban spatial compactness is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable urban development. However, the potential of and variations in spatial compactness in county-level carbon reduction have been largely overlooked. Taking the county-level areas in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region as an example, after reviewing the dimensions, scales, and pathways of the existing research, we quantifies the spatial compactness from 2005 to 2015 in terms of density, morphology, and function. The results reveal that, firstly, BTH county-level areas’ carbon emissions, both per land area (CO2/L) and per capita (CO2/P), have generally risen. Heterogeneity varied across spatial compactness indicators: urban density and functional compactness increased, while morphological compactness showed a minor fluctuation. Second, the correlations with CO2/L were stronger than those with CO2/P, ranking from urban density, functional compactness > morphological compactness. Additionally, the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model revealed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the impact of spatial compactness on carbon emission intensity. The heterogeneity results provide insights into the mechanisms and general patterns of the differences in the factors influencing carbon emissions in four different types of county-level areas, namely, central, eastern, southern, and northwestern, offering policy guidance to promote the reductions in both CO2/L and CO2/P. This study is helpful for proposing urban spatial planning strategies for carbon reduction and formulating differentiated carbon reduction policies.

The focus of this study is to design and simulate a grid tied solar PV system for a higher institution of learning using University of Botswana, Faculty of Engineering and Technology building as a case. The grid-connected system aimed at reducing the energy bill and contributes to the reduction of the CO2 emissions. The system uses the physical data and PVsyst software and OpenSolar and google earth to determine the key parameters crucial for the design of the project. Technical performance analysis of the proposed rooftop PV plant showed that the energy injected into the grid, with consideration of all losses amounts to 480MWh/year with a substantial lifetime carbon reduction of 991.2tons. The economic evaluation of the designed system showed that the project is profitable at the discontinued payback period of 8.63 years and the annual energy bill reduction of 32% is achieved. These results are beneficial to institutions and any other entity that would like to migrate from their use of conventional power in that they will gain an insight on their CO2 emission reduction and contribution to the national quota, their expected energy and cost savings. Governments and utilities can also benefit from these results in integrating with their energy and CO2 emissions.

Innovative and sustainable solutions are increasingly necessary as concerns about fossil fuels’ environmental and economic impacts grow. Accordingly, this study aims to enhance vehicle internal combustion engine efficiency by producing oxy-hydrogen (HHO) from drain water from the vehicle air conditioning system and utilizing it as a secondary fuel. A 1600 cc Daewoo engine equipped with electronic fuel injection was employed as the test subject. Initially, the engine’s performance was evaluated using various gasoline variants, 80, 92, and 95. The 92-octane gasoline demonstrated the highest efficiency, achieving a peak power of 113 kW and torque of 190 Nm. The engine had an 11:1 compression ratio. Then, different flow rates of oxy-hydrogen, 50, 248, 397, and 480 mL/min, generated from the air conditioner drain were combined with 92 fuel. A significant improvement was observed with the increase in the flow rate of oxy-hydrogen gas to the 92 fuel. The results indicated that incorporating 480 mL/min oxy-hydrogen gas into the fuel led to an 8.7% reduction in fuel consumption, 5.5% enhancement in thermal efficiency, and 7.9% in volumetric efficiency. Greenhouse gas emissions reductions of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons were recorded as 18%, 9.2%, and 9%, respectively. At the same time, nitrogen oxides increased by 12.5%. Therefore, utilizing a vehicle air conditioner drain water to generate oxy-hydrogen gas fuel in conjunction with 92-octane gasoline is an efficient solution to reduce fuel consumption, enhance energy efficiency, and mitigate the adverse effects of pollution. This approach also contributes to progress towards a more sustainable future.

Carbon Capture Utilization Storage (CCUS) into geological storage (e.g., Enhanced Oil or Gas Recovery) provides a solution to reduce CO­2 emissions. However, it still remains a potential operational problem, such as sand problem phenomena in producer wells. This study observes the phenomenon of sand problems in production wells possibly triggered by CO2-brine-rock interactions on CO2 injection in rich dolomite sandstone reservoir. This research performs several experimental works (i.e., time-lapse dry mass measurements, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and elastic wave measurements) by using CO2-brine-rock batch experimental setup as well as geochemical simulation to observe mineral dissolution, pore structures alteration as well as rock physics alteration due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. We used an outcrop sample of dolomite-rich sandstone from the Air Benakat Formation, South Sumatera, Indonesia. Our experimental and simulation works show that dolomite dissolution (dolomite reduction of ~4% after 14 soaking days), secondary porosity development (11% of visible porosity improvement), as well as rock strength reduction, occur indirectly (shown by elastic wave velocity, i.e. and reduction of ~3.8% and ~4.4%, respectively) due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. Subsequently, the results of elastic wave velocity measurements were then used to modify a considerable sand onset prediction (sand-free envelope) model. The modified model showed that the production well was more prone to sand problems due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. Thus, it is concluded that the sand onset prediction model with considering CO2-brine-rock interactions could help to design a better sand management strategy in producer wells.

Ammonia production is a significant source of carbon emissions globally, particularly in the agricultural sector, where it is extensively used as a fertilizer. This research suggests a potential avenue to reduce the carbon footprint of corn production for biofuels in the US Corn Belt. Conventional methods of producing nitrogenous fertilizers derived from ammonia are responsible for the highest CO2 emissions in the life cycle of corn production. We estimate that the total CO2 emissions can be reduced from 3.09 kg CO2 to 2.07 kg CO2 per bushel of corn (33% reduction) when conventional ammonia is replaced with green ammonia. If conventional ammonia is replaced with blue ammonia with carbon capture and storage, the total CO2 emissions can be reduced from 3.09 kg CO2 to 2.27 kg CO2 per bushel of corn (26% reduction). Despite these environmental benefits, our economic analysis reveals that even with policy incentives such as the 45Q and 45V tax credits, low-carbon-intensity ammonia is not yet cost-competitive with conventional ammonia. Renewable (green) ammonia, for instance, remains significantly more expensive at $532 (2024 US Dollar) per metric ton with 45V incentives compared to conventional ammonia at $249 per metric ton. Blue ammonia, even with the 45Q credit, costs $289 per metric ton—still higher than conventional ammonia. However, when a tiered carbon tax of $85 per ton of CO2 is applied to conventional ammonia, raising its cost to $326 per metric ton, blue ammonia becomes cost-competitive, but green ammonia still lags behind. This highlights the need for carbon pricing policies to enable the shift toward lower-carbon ammonia production, as tax credits alone are insufficient to close the cost gap.

The conversion of CO2 emissions into valuable 3D printed carbon-based materials offers a transformative strategy for climate mitigation and resource utilization. Here, we 3D print carbon nanocomposites from CO2 using an integrated system that electrochemically converts CO2 into CO, followed by a thermocatalytic process that synthesizes carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which are then 3D printed into high-density carbon nanocomposites. A 200 cm2 electrolyzer stack is integrated with a thermochemical reactor for more than 45 h of operation, cumulatively synthesizing 37 grams of CNTs from CO2. A techno-economic analysis indicates a 90% cost reduction in CNT production on an industrial scale compared to current benchmarks, underscoring the commercial viability of the system. A 3D printing process is developed that achieves a high nanocomposite CNT concentration (38 wt%) while enhancing composite structural attributes via CNT alignment. With the rapidly rising demand for carbon nanocomposites, this CO2-to-nanocomposite process can make a substantial impact on global carbon emission reduction efforts. This work develops a method to sequester carbon emissions into valuable 3D printed materials. By combining a reactor cascade with advanced additive manufacturing, this system offers the ability for carbon utilization at scale, a crucial step for addressing climate change.

Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are ideal catalysts for carbon dioxide sequestration in efforts to alleviate climate change. Here, we report the characterisation of three α‐CAs that originate from the thermophilic bacteria Persephonella hydrogeniphila (PhyCA), Persephonella atlantica (PaCA), and Persephonella sp. KM09‐Lau‐8 (PlauCA) isolated from hydrothermal vents. The three α‐Cas, showing high sequence similarities, were produced in Escherichia coli , purified and characterised. Surprisingly, they revealed very different behaviours with regards to their thermostability profiles. PhyCA presented a more stable thermostability profile amongst the three, thus we chose it for rational engineering to improve it further. PhyCA's residue K88, a proton transfer residue in α‐CAs, was mutated to His, Ala, Gln and Tyr. A 4‐fold activity improvement was noted for variants K88H and K88Q at 30 °C, owing to the higher proton transfer efficiency of the replacement proton transfer residues. K88Q also proved more stable than PhyCA. K88Y did not increase activity, but notably increased thermal stability, with this enzyme variant retaining 50% of its initial activity after incubation for 1 h at 90 °C. Removal of the two main proton shuttles (variant H85A_K88A) resulted in diminished activity of the enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations performed for PhyCA and all its variants revealed differences in residue fluctuations, with K88A resulting in a general reduction in root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of active site residues as well as most of the CA's residues. Its specific activity and stability in turn increased compared to the wild type.

Direct converting low concentration CO2 in industrial exhaust gases to high-value multi-carbon products via renewable-energy-powered electrochemical catalysis provides a sustainable strategy for CO2 utilization with minimized CO2 separation and purification capital and energy cost. Nonetheless, the electrocatalytic conversion of dilute CO2 into value-added chemicals (C2+ products, e.g., ethylene) is frequently impeded by low CO2 conversion rate and weak carbon intermediates' surface adsorption strength. Here, we fabricate a range of Cu catalysts comprising fine-tuned Cu(111)/Cu2O(111) interface boundary density crystal structures aimed at optimizing rate-determining step and decreasing the thermodynamic barriers of intermediates' adsorption. Utilizing interface boundary engineering, we attain a Faradaic efficiency of (51.9 ± 2.8) % and a partial current density of (34.5 ± 6.4) mA·cm−2 for C2+ products at a dilute CO2 feed condition (5% CO2 v/v), comparing to the state-of-art low concentration CO2 electrolysis. In contrast to the prevailing belief that the CO2 activation step ( $${{CO}}_{2}+{e}^{-}+\, * \,\to {}^{ * }{CO}_{2}^{-}$$ ) governs the reaction rate, we discover that, under dilute CO2 feed conditions, the rate-determining step shifts to the generation of *COOH ( $${}^{ * } {{CO}}_{2}^{-}+{H}_{2}O\to {}^{ * } {COOH}+{{OH}}^{-}({aq})$$ ) at the Cu0/Cu1+ interface boundary, resulting in a better C2+ production performance. The development of catalysts that operate under low concentration CO2 resembling industrial waste gases holds promise for CO2 reduction. Here, the authors report a vacuum calcination approach for regulating the Cu0/Cu1+ density on Cu-based catalysts that can electro-catalyze low-concentration CO2.

The practice of cover crops has gained popularity as a strategy to improve agricultural sustainability, but its full potential is often limited by environmental trade-offs. Using meta-analytic and data-driven quantifications of 2302 observations, we optimized cover crop practices and evaluated their benefits for global agroecosystems. Cover crops have historically boosted crop yields, soil carbon storage, and stability, but also stimulated greenhouse gas emissions. However, combining them with long-term implementation (five years or more) and climate-smart practices (such as no-tillage) can enhance these services synergistically. A biculture of legume and non-legume cover crops, terminated 25 days before planting the next crop and followed by residue mulching, is the optimal portfolio. Such optimized practices are projected to increase agroecosystem multiservices by 1.25%, equivalent to annual gains of 97.7 million metric tons in crop production, 21.7 billion metric tons in carbon dioxide sequestration, and 2.41 billion metric tons in soil erosion reduction. By 2100, the continued implementation of optimized practices could mitigate climate-related yield losses and contribute to climate neutrality and soil stabilization, especially in harsh and underdeveloped areas. These findings underscore the promising potential of optimized cover crop practices to achieve the synergy in food security and environmental protection. Cover crops can improve agricultural sustainability. In this meta-analysis, the authors find that a biculture of legume and non-legume cover crops is optimal and may promote multiple agroecosystem services while mitigating climate-related yield losses by 2100.

Abstract This study analyzes the impacts of institutional quality on CO2 emissions for Korea, using an autoregressive distributed lags model. We investigate the long-run relationship between CO2 emissions, economic growth, energy consumption, renewable energy consumption, and various dimensions of institutional quality. Our findings suggest that improvement of selected dimensions of institutional quality, including control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and voice and accountability, can significantly contribute to CO2 emissions reduction. The results also support the validity of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and Korea has reached the turning point of CO2 emissions decline accompanied by economic growth. The analysis also indicates that renewable energy consumption has a positive impact on reducing CO2 emissions. These results underscore the critical role of effective institutions in fostering sustainable economic development and environmental protection in South Korea.

While widely acknowledged as the father of the Hydrogen Economy and worthy to be dubbed as grandfather of the Methanol Economy, John O’Mara Bockris (JOMB) continued to inspire important environmental advances to the end of his most creative life. His co-invention of what may turn out to be a ground-breaking US Patent 8,413,420 helps to open the way to capturing CO2 from automotive exhausts and its conversion to recyclable methanol fuel, thereby greatly reducing and possibly even reversing global warming. Most recently, in a letter dated shortly before his death, published herein as the Appendix, JOMB pointed to inexpensive mass production of methanol from natural gas via the syngas route which may lead to the displacement of gasoline by methanol as the main automotive fuel and to major reductions in global CO2 emissions.

Abstract: This article presents the application of the Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) method, enhanced with specifically tuned parameters using the Taguchi method, for optimizing bridge and viaduct designs. Unlike conventional approaches, the optimization in this study encompasses the entire structure rather than focusing solely on the deck. This approach is illustrated through case studies on two viaducts located in Atalaia and Mandaguaçu along the BR-376 highway in Paraná, Brazil. In Atalaia, the optimized solutions achieved reductions in construction costs by 10.5% to 22.7%, CO2 emissions by 8.9% to 21.2%, and extended the design service life by 24.0% to 540.7%. Similarly, in Mandaguaçu, the optimizations resulted in cost reductions ranging from 9.1% to 23.2%, decreases in CO2 emissions from 12.7% to 23.5%, and increases in the design service life by up to 540.7%. The study also revealed consistent patterns between the degrees of freedom and objective functions; specifically, larger cross-sectional dimensions tended to lower costs, while smaller dimensions were associated with reduced CO2 emissions. These findings illustrate the real-world performance improvements afforded by the optimization process, which not only reduces the global cost per year of service compared to the original designs but also enhances economic and environmental performance, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of MOPSO in structural optimization for sustainable infrastructure development.

Abstract The red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis has recently been recognized for its unique ability to significantly reduce methane emissions from ruminant animals when fed in small quantities. The main obstacle in using this seaweed as a methane‐mitigating feed supplement is the lack of commercially available biomass. Little is known about how best to grow this red alga on a commercial scale, as there are few published studies that have investigated the factors that influence growth, physiology, and overall performance. This study examined the effects of temperature and CO 2 enrichment on the growth, photophysiology, and concentration of bromoform, the secondary metabolite largely responsible for methane reduction in A. taxiformis . A series of single and multifactor closed culture experiments were conducted on A. taxiformis collected, isolated, and cultured from populations in Southern California. We identified the optimal temperature range to be between 22 and 26°C, with significant short‐term stress observed below 15°C and above 26°C. Carbon dioxide addition resulted in increased performance, when accounting for growth per CO 2 use. In general, we observed the highest bromoform concentrations in algae with the highest growth rates, but these results varied among experiments. These findings indicate that through environmental control and by addressing limiting resources, significant increases in biomass production and quality can be achieved.

In addition to excellent mechanical, physical and chemical parameters, magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC) composites offer numerous environmental benefits, particularly with regard to the necessary reduction of carbon dioxide emissions associated with the production of Portland cement based building materials. However, the limitation to the wider use of MOC is its low water resistance. Therefore, the possibility of improving the water resistance of magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC) composites by nano-adjustment using fluorographene (FG) was the subject of the research presented. A tannic acid (TA)-based surfactant was used to uniformly disperse the FG particles. The effect of FG added at the dosage of 0.2% and 0.5% by weight of the MOC binder in the MOC mixture was investigated and characterized by the assessment of the mechanical, basic structural and microstructural properties of the hardened composites. Particular attention was paid to the analysis of water resistance, for which the hygric parameters and the softening coefficient were measured after immersing the samples in water for 24 hours. The results obtained showed that FG in the amount of 0.2 wt% of the binder improved the water resistance, while 0.5 wt% of FG in the MOC binder gave results comparable to those of the reference sample. Since FG-doped MOC composites retained the excellent mechanical and structural parameters of MOC, the improvement in water resistance may enable them to more widely exploit their advanced properties and eco-efficiency in construction practice.

The paper discussed the current research on the applicability of biosorbents for the purification of biogas, particularly the decrease of H2S by using encapsulated or embedded biological biomass. This study investigated the potential of alginate-yeast biosorbent (AlgY) for biogas purification, focusing on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal. A biogas column test was conducted to compare the biosorption efficiency of AlgY and pure alginate beads. Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effects of column length, acquisition time, and biosorbent type were evaluated for CH4, CO2, and H2S removal. Results depicted significant H2S reduction, with AlgY achieving a p-value of < 0.0001 and a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9518). The relatively high correlation coefficient (R2) of the tested quadratic model of all the responses were recorded (R2; 0.5560, 0.5048, and 0.9518 for CH4, CO2, and H2S respectively). According to the studies’ preliminary findings, the type of biosorbent has a significant role in determining the biosorption effectiveness. The ANOVA of model terms depicted a significant p-value (p < 0.05) indicated a potential alginate-yeast (AlgY) biosorbent for H2S purification or reduction.

Smart grids are modernized, intelligent electricity distribution systems that integrate information and communication technologies to improve the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the electricity network. However, existing smart grids only integrate renewable energies when it comes to active demand management without taking into consideration the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper addresses this problem by forecasting CO2 emissions based on electricity consumption, making it possible to transition to renewable energies and thereby reduce CO2 emissions generated by fossil fuels. This approach contributes to the mitigation of climate change and the preservation of air quality, both of which are essential for a healthy and sustainable environment. To achieve this goal, we propose a transformer-based encoder architecture for load forecasting by modifying the transformer workflow and designing a novel technique for handling contextual features. The proposed solution is tested on real electricity consumption data over a long period. Results show that the proposed approach successfully handles time series data to detect future CO2 emissions excess and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

Climate change is a pressing global issue, leading to the establishment of various carbon reduction goals, and thus carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has attracted considerable attention. This article provides an overview of the primary carbon capture and storage technologies, explores their technical principles along with their pros and cons, and examines the challenges they encounter. There are three ways to capture carbon: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion. Post-combustion capture includes adsorption, absorption and membrane separation. Adsorption can be further categorized into four specific technologies: Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA), Pressure swing adsorption (PSA), Vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), and Electric swing adsorption (ESA). Absorption has physical and chemical types. Membrane separation is to filter the gas to CO2. Pre-combustion capture is to use physical solvents to separate the gas. Oxy-combustion uses pure oxygen to obtain CO2. There are three ways to store carbon, geo-sequestration, marine storage and mineralization storage. Geo-sequestration is to bury CO2 in a suitable state in the rock layer below the surface. Marine storage is to bury CO2 in various places in the sea in a classified manner. Mineralization storage refers to the use of solid waste rich in calcium and magnesium to mineralize CO2 and produce chemical products. There are three main challenges facing CCS technology: economically, the cost is too high with low benefits. The technology is not mature enough and will consume too much energy. Environmentally, there is a potential for ecological deterioration.

Complexes, where a doubly reduced CO22– (carbonite) ligand is spanned between a nickel(II) centre and a transition metal(II) ion (TM = Fe, Co, Zn) have been accessed. In non‐coordinating solvents the carbonite ligand exhibits a flexible coordination behaviour as observed by NMR spectroscopy and supported by DFT calculations. In particular the [Ni‐CO2‐Fe] representative replicates the respective entity in an intermediate formed during CO2‐conversion by the enzyme [Ni,Fe]‐CODH in many ways (structure, spectroscopic properties, reactivity). Our investigations reveal that transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C‐O bond cleavage. This may explain the choice of an iron(II) ion as part of the active site.

We identify corporate commitments for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions—green pledges—from news articles using a large language model. About 8% of publicly traded U.S. companies have made green pledges, and these companies tend to be larger and browner than those without pledges. Announcements of green pledges significantly and persistently raise stock prices, consistent with reductions in the carbon premium. Firms that make green pledges subsequently reduce their CO2 emissions. Our evidence suggests that green pledges are credible, have material new information for investors, and can reduce perceived transition risk.

We report JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations of TOI-1685 b, a hot rocky super-Earth orbiting an M2.5V star, during a full orbit. We obtain transmission and emission spectra of the planet and characterize the properties of the phase curve, including its amplitude and offset. The transmission spectrum rules out clear H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, while secondary atmospheres (made of water, methane, or carbon dioxide) cannot be statistically distinguished from a flat line. The emission spectrum is featureless and consistent with a blackbody-like brightness temperature, helping rule out thick atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Collecting all evidence, the properties of TOI-1685 b are consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo, with a dayside brightness temperature 0.98$\pm$0.07 times that of a perfect blackbody in the NIRSpec NRS2 wavelength range (3.823-5.172 um). Our results add to the growing number of seemingly airless M-star rocky planets, thus constraining the location of the "Cosmic Shoreline". Three independent data reductions have been carried out, all showing a high-amplitude correlated noise component in the white and spectroscopic light curves. The correlated noise properties are different between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors - importantly the timescales of the strongest components (4.5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively) - suggesting the noise is from instrumental rather than astrophysical origins. We encourage the community to look into the systematics of NIRSpec for long time-series observations.

In the current century, air pollution is known as one of the most critical environmental problems and it is important to find the relations of air pollution and human health. Various air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can negatively affect women’s fertility. An exhaustive electronic search was done from 2013 until July 2023 in PUBMED and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The following keywords were combined using Boolean hints in the databases queried: air pollution AND (fertility OR miscarriage OR embryo quality OR embryo development OR pregnancy OR implantation OR live birth). The randomized controlled trials, case-control and cohort studies analyzing the impact of air pollutants on fertility were included in the review. In this systematic review, a significant relation was found between the increase in air pollution and the reduction of fertility health, live birth rates, embryo quality, fertility, implantation rates, and miscarriage in exposed women. These results suggest low fertility health rates are associated with traffic-related air pollution. This review has concluded four components (particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur, and carbon monoxide) of traffic pollution that can impair women’s fertility. Air pollution harms women’s fertility. These effects affect gamete’s quality at the genetic and epigenetic level. These effects also alter fetal development. Studies have also reported an effect on fetal growth with increased miscarriages. Since air pollution is everywhere and has many sources, it seems necessary to increase the awareness of people and government officials, especially in hygiene and health, to limit air pollutants as much as possible.

Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value‐added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously. Yet, it remains an ongoing challenge due to the competition with thermodynamically more preferred ethylene production. Herein, we presented a CO2 reduction predilection switch from ethylene to ethanol (ethanol‐to‐ethylene ratio of ~5.4) by inherently implanting Cu sites with perfluorooctane to create interfacial non‐covalent interactions. The 1.83%F‐Cu2O organic‐inorganic hybrids (OIHs) exhibited an extraordinary ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) of ∼55.2%, with an impressive ethanol partial current density of 166 mA cm‐2 and excellent robustness over 60 hours of continuous operation. This exceptional performance ranks our 1.83%F‐Cu2O OIHs among the best‐performing ethanol‐oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts. Our findings identified that C8F18 could strengthen the interfacial hydrogen bonding connectivity, which consequently promotes the generation of active hydrogen species and preferentially favors the hydrogenation of *CHCOH to *CHCHOH, thus switching the reaction from ethylene‐preferred to ethanol‐oriented. The presented investigations highlight opportunities for using noncovalent interactions to tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, bringing it closer to practical implementation requirements.

The incorporation of waste glass as a component in clinker production presents a sustainable approach to addressing critical challenges in the cement industry, including the reduction of CO2 emissions and effective waste management. Waste glass, characterized by its high silica content and alkali properties, can serve as an alternative alkali source in clinker manufacturing, replacing traditional raw materials and regulating the alkali-sulphur ratio. This dual functionality not only optimizes the chemical balance in the kiln process but also enhances clinker quality by controlling phase formation. The utilization of waste materials in industrial processes is increasingly significant in promoting circular economy principles. Integrating waste glass reduces the dependence on natural raw materials such as limestone and clay, which are associated with high energy and CO2 emission intensities during production. Furthermore, waste glass contributes to a reduction in the carbon footprint of cement production by facilitating lower-temperature clinkering, thus cutting energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This study highlights the potential of waste glass as a viable alternative in clinker production, emphasizing its importance in achieving sustainability goals. Beyond the environmental benefits, adopting waste materials in industrial applications contributes to waste diversion from landfills, resource conservation, and cost efficiencies, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable development.

_ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 219309, “The Economics of CCUS Projects in Conjunction With Large Offshore Gas Projects,” by Chresten S. Meulengracht, SPE, NRG Models, and Deddy Hasanusi, Semesta Energi Services. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ The complete paper examines the economics of carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) projects, either standalone or in conjunction with large offshore gas projects, in Denmark, Indonesia, and Australia. An analysis of the legislation in these countries reveals to what degree the frameworks are defined to support CCUS projects. Economic-robustness analyses of the projects are performed to determine under which circumstances CCUS strengthens or weakens the business cases for the operators. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)/CCUS Legislation in Three Countries Denmark. Summary and History of Legislation. Denmark initiated its first CCS legislation by issuing permits in 2023 for CO2 storage exploration in the Danish North Sea to three companies with exclusive exploration rights for 6 years, extendable to 30 years if suitable storage locations are found. A significant initiative is the Greensand project, aiming to store up to 8 mtpa CO2 by 2030. These efforts are part of Denmark’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. The second bidding round for onshore CO2 storage has been completed, and licenses will be awarded in 2024. The Danish government has proposed a plan for onshore CCS to achieve reductions of at least 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030. CO2 Taxes. Denmark’s government has proposed a uniform CO2 emissions tax for businesses. However, not all companies will pay the same rate, according to the proposal. The government proposal, entitled Green Tax Reform, aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 3.7 million tonnes by 2030. The government proposes a CO2 tax of 750 kroner per tonne of emission. Companies covered by an EU quota system will receive a deduction and only will be required to pay half of the full amount. Companies in the mineralogical processing sector are to be given further discounts on the tax and only will pay 100 kroner per tonne of emissions. CCUS Incentives. The Danish Energy Agency has created two subsidy funds, the CCUS Fund and the Negative Emissions via CCS (NECCS) Fund, to support the deployment of CCS technology in Denmark. The CCUS Fund can support the capture of both fossil and biogenic CO2, while the NECCS Fund will exclusively support the capture of biogenic CO2. Indonesia. Summary and History of Legislation. Indonesia has introduced a comprehensive regulatory framework for CCS and CCUS in upstream oil and natural gas business activities. Regulation includes the rights, obligations, and liabilities of contractors to implement CCS technology in their oil and gas working areas, and the monetization of CCS projects and CCS activities closure. Indonesia aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, and CCS is seen as a promising means of reducing carbon emissions to achieve this goal. Furthermore, a presidential regulation allows CCS operators to set aside 30% of their storage capacity for imported CO2.

The construction industry is considered a strategic sector due to its importance in the economy, its export capacity, and its roots in local communities, where it provides quality employment. It is currently based primarily on the use of Portland cement, a building material obtained by calcining a mixture of limestone and clays at high temperatures. Large amounts of carbon dioxide are produced during the calcination process, which is problematic from an environmental standpoint, as carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse gases. Emissions from the production of Portland cement are mainly due to two sources. First, the burning of fuels to achieve the calcination temperature, and second, the decarbonization reaction that occurs during the calcination of limestone. Limestone, a calcium carbonate, transforms into calcium oxide when calcined, releasing large amounts of CO2. Major efforts are being made in the cement industry to reduce these emissions. One strategy focuses on natural inorganic materials that enhance the properties of the cementitious mixture through their hydraulic or pozzolanic activity, or both, known as supplementary cementitious materials. These materials reduce the amount of calcium oxide in the cement, known as the clínker factor, and therefore decrease the direct emissions generated during calcination. Among the supplementary cementitious materials are pozzolans, aluminosilicates of natural origin that do not have hydraulic properties but, when finely ground, react with the calcium hydroxide in cement in the presence of water, providing resistance and improving some properties of the cement. The main objective of the present work is to investigate different non-calcined natural materials as supplementary cementitious materials to obtain more sustainable cementitious products. For this purpose, different varieties of natural zeolites and other vitreous or zeolitized materials have been studied to replace various percentages of cement in mortars and concretes. The materials used were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Mortar and concrete specimens were subjected to compressive strength tests at different ages to assess their mechanical properties. Additionally, ultrasonic wave velocity tests, monitoring the setting temperature of the concrete specimens, and the complex conductivity (CC) geophysical method to monitor the cement products are used to enhance the understanding of cement reactions. The results indicate that pozzolanic materials are optimal raw materials for sustainable cement and mortar production. Despite a decrease in mechanical strength, the reduction in emissions and improvement of other properties make these materials a viable option from an economic, technological, and environmental perspective. RESUMEN La industria de la construcción se considera un sector estratégico, por su importancia en la economía, su capacidad exportadora, y su arraigo en las comunidades locales en las que ofrece empleo de calidad. En la actualidad está basada principalmente en el uso de cemento Portland, un material de construcción que se obtiene a partir de la calcinación de la mezcla de caliza y arcillas a alta temperatura. Durante este proceso de calcinación se producen grandes cantidades de dióxido de carbono, lo que supone un problema desde un punto de vista medioambiental, ya que es considerado uno de los principales gases de efecto invernadero. Las emisiones procedentes de la elaboración del cemento Portland son debidas principalmente a dos fuentes: la quema de combustibles para obtener la temperatura de calcinación y la reacción de descarbonatación que se produce durante la calcinación de la caliza, una roca rica en carbonato cálcico que al ser calcinada se transforma en óxido de calcio, desprendiendo grandes cantidades de CO2. En la industria cementera se están realizando grandes esfuerzos para reducir estas emisiones. Una de las estrategias se centra en el uso de materiales naturales inorgánicos que contribuyen a la mejora de las propiedades de la mezcla cementicia a través de su actividad hidráulica, puzolánica, o ambas, denominados materiales cementantes suplementarios. Con el uso de estos materiales se reduce la cantidad de óxido de calcio presente en el cemento, conocido como factor clínker, y por lo tanto, las emisiones directas generadas en la calcinación. Dentro de los materiales cementantes suplementarios se encuentras las puzolanas, aluminosilicatos de origen natural o artificial que no poseen propiedades hidráulicas, pero, que finamente molidas reaccionan con el hidróxido de calcio del cemento en presencia de agua y proporcionan resistencia y mejora en algunas propiedades del cemento. El principal objetivo del presente trabajo es el estudio de diferentes materiales naturales no calcinados como material cementante suplementario, para la obtención de productos cementicios más sostenibles. Para ello, se han estudiado diferentes variedades de zeolitas naturales y otros materiales vítreos o zeolitizados para sustituir diferentes porcentajes de cemento en morteros y hormigones. Los materiales utilizados se han caracterizado mediante microscopía electrónica de barrido (SEM), difracción de rayos X (DRX) y/o fluorescencia de rayos X (FRX). Se han elaborado probetas de mortero y hormigón con sustituciones de parte del cemento por estos materiales. Sobre estas probetas se han realizado ensayos de resistencia a compresión a diferentes edades, 7, 28 y 90 días en el caso de las probetas de mortero y 28, 9 y 180 días en las probetas de hormigón, llegando a la edad de 2 años de curado en dos de las mezclas estudiadas. Adicionalmente, se han realizado ensayos de velocidad de las ondas ultrasónicas, se ha monitorizado la temperatura de fraguado de las probetas de hormigón y se ha utilizado el método geofísico de conductividad compleja (CC), como métodos de monitorización de los productos del cemento para aumentar el conocimiento de las reacciones del cemento. A raíz de los resultados obtenidos se puede observar que los materiales puzolánicos en su mayoría son una materia prima óptima para la obtención de cementos y morteros sostenibles. A pesar de que el incremento de las resistencias mecánicas de las probetas de morteros y hormigones es más lento que en las probetas de cemento portland el descenso de las emisiones y la mejora de otras propiedades hacen de estos materiales una opción viable desde un punto de vista económico, tecnológico y ambiental.

Every household uses an average of around 360 litres of water each day. About 21% of a typical gas consumption is attributed to heating the water for showers, baths, and hot water from the tap. An environmentally friendly, low-cost device called the CombiSave valve can be used to manage gas and water consumption and should be fitted to most combination boilers to automatically control the flow of water every time a hot tap is turned on. This allows the boiler to heat the water faster and only return the flow to normal once a usable temperature is reached. An experimental test was conducted in the exemplar modern house of Liverpool John Moores University in order to assess the amount of water, energy, and CO2 reduction for varying temperatures and flow rates. The test was carried out for a duration of 9 hours during the daytime between June and October. Although the test was conducted over relatively warm months when ambient water temperatures were higher compared to winter months, results showed that good savings could be achieved through this product. The best savings for gas consumption and hence CO2 reduction were achieved at high water pressure and low temperature setting (40℃) of 36% compared with the case without combiSave. While water consumption was reduced by 56% at full flow rate and 45℃. Further research is needed encompassing multiple occupied dwellings with different family sizes and testing these in extreme weather conditions to see if similar results would be reflected.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">In the last decade, the increased global temperature, stringent regulations, and customer demand for high fuel economy have led to the accelerated development of alternative propulsion solutions, with particular focus on electrified vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the combination of electric machinery with conventional powertrains, allows diversifications of powertrain architectures. In addition, it has been demonstrated that engines employing advanced low temperature combustion concepts, such as dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), and able to operate on both renewable and conventional fuels, produce ultra-low nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions while maintaining thermal efficiency similar to conventional diesel operation at part load operating conditions. This study aims to investigate the potential of integrating a gasoline-diesel RCCI engine in an HEV in achieving reduced fuel consumption and lower NOx and PM emissions compared to a conventional diesel powertrain. In this work a combination of engine experimental data and a vehicle powertrain simulation tool (AVL CRUISE) is employed to determine the vehicle level emissions and performance of a commercial vehicle on the worldwide harmonised light-duty vehicles test cycle (WLTC). In order to assess the emissions, the powertrains are simulated utilising both conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engines as the primary power sources. For a series hybrid vehicle, NOx emissions decreased by 67% and soot emissions decreased by 70% compared to a CDC vehicle. However, the combustion efficiency decreased in the RCCI mode, resulting in a significant increase in total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Moreover, the implementation of the HEV technology results in decreased fuel consumption, leading to a 40% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions compared to the CDC vehicle. These results indicate the potential of HEVs, particularly when equipped with RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engines, to achieve reduced fuel consumption and emissions, thereby offering a promising solution for sustainable transportation.</div></div>

The transition to green energy and sustainable operations poses a key challenge for the mining industry, which has traditionally been known for its negative environmental impact. This manuscript researches the concept of the "green transition" in mining, focusing on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in methodological support for environmental restoration. The aim is to identify and analyze technological and methodological innovations that can facilitate the shift of mining operations towards more environmentally sustainable practices. The current challenges in the mining industry are analyzed, including carbon dioxide emissions, water pollution, and land degradation. Successful green transition projects in mining are presented, highlighting how the use of renewable energy sources and material recycling can reduce the environmental footprint of mining activities. The role of artificial intelligence in supporting these efforts is important. AI technologies, including machine learning and data analytics, can significantly enhance environmental monitoring and management processes. Specific examples of AI applications in predicting environmental risks are presented, optimizing resource use, and developing strategies for ecosystem restoration. AI algorithms enable more precise and efficient pollution monitoring, identification of optimal restoration sites, and assessment of the long-term effects of mining activities on the environment. Integration of AI into the mining industry can not only improve environmental performance but also contribute to economic benefits through cost reduction and increased efficiency. This paper emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach that includes collaboration between managers, engineers, ecologists, and AI experts to achieve sustainable development goals. Further research and investment in these areas are crucial for the successful green transition of the mining industry and the long-term preservation of the environment. This research contributes to the understanding of the potential of green transition in mining and the role of AI in achieving sustainable environmental solutions, providing a foundation for future studies and practical applications.

It is now accepted that gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) from the atmosphere are needed to avoid the threat of catastrophic climate change. Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a promising scalable CDR with a relatively small environmental footprint. But questions about DAC cost and energy use remain that are delaying the needed DAC policy decisions to create a mobilization effort like was done in the Manhattan Project and to address the Covid crisis. Global Thermostat (GT) has publicly claimed costs of under 50 dollars per tonne for mature GT technology deployed at a climate relevant scale. Why this low DAC cost is achievable will be addressed by a simplified analysis of generic DAC costs and using that analysis combined with experimental data to evaluate GT's DAC technology. A detailed cost analysis of different approaches to DAC by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found an approach to DAC that had a learning cost limit as low as 25 dollars per tonne GT's DAC technology will be shown in Appendix 1 to have the same performance characteristics of the lowest-cost DAC identified in the NAS study. Thus, like solar costs, DAC costs can be reduced by learning by doing, but in the case of DAC, only one order of magnitude in cost reduction is needed. Therefore DAC technology can reach its low learning by doing cost limit at a scale much smaller than necessary to address climate change. From a climate perspective, current DAC embodiments costs and scale have less relevance than their learning curve cost limit. While GT's technology has demonstrated the crucial performance parameters to achieve a low-cost DAC, no inference should be drawn that other approaches cannot achieve low or lower cost, if they can demonstrate the crucial performance parameters. Continued R&D on those performance parameters is needed.

Abstract Refrigeration sector including heat pumps, cryogenics and air conditioning is responsible for a share close 10% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a huge effort of the scientific and industrial community is needed on the development of technologies allowing to reduce the environmental impact of this sector. The use of CO2 as working fluid has great interest in food chain conservation and participates to the problem of the impact produced by the traditional synthetic fluids, recently oriented also to hydrocarbons. Main problem of plants using CO2 as working fluid is the low COP, which reduces even more in moderate or hot climate regions in which low temperature thermal energy is more required. To assess the benefits introduced by plant optimization and innovative technologies, many advanced thermodynamic models are developed in the last years. Anyway, few software platforms are developed for the comprehensive analysis of plant behaviour. To fill this gap, this paper presents the results of a theoretical and experimental research done on an industrial trans-critical CO2 refrigeration plant. The aim was to set up energy saving solutions finalized to mitigate the intrinsic low COP values. A detailed physically consistent model of the unit has been developed following an integrated zero and mono-dimensional thermo-fluid-dynamic approach. The propagative, capacitive, and inertial properties of the components have been considered, so going beyond of the theoretical approaches that are typical in the sector. A wide experimental characterization of the unit has been done with the aim to validate the model and to use it as tool to predict the effect on the COP of the operating variables. The reduction of the compressor absorption and the potentiality of the energy recovery from energy usually wasted have been analysed.

This research numerically investigates the heat transfer and flow patterns of supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2 ) in a six‐start spirally fluted tube. The research focuses on the geometrical optimization of the tube based on three key parameters: the groove depth ( e 1 ), the gap between the main tube and the outer sleeve ( e 2 ), and the thread pitch ( p ). The influence of these parameters on the heat transfer coefficient ( h ) and friction factor ( f ) was also investigated and analyzed. Furthermore, the study examined the overall impact of the gravity inclination angle (δ) on the thermal performance and flow velocity of the spirally fluted tube. The results indicated that the optimal geometrical parameters are as follows: e 1 / D = 0.33, e 2 / D = 0.04, and p / D = 8.33, yielding the highest values of h / h 8 /( f / f 8 ) in the spirally fluted tub. The change in e 2 has a more significant effect on turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and thermal performance than the change in e 1 . The p value showed a more substantial effect on the f value compared with the h value. Furthermore, the h value was positively correlated with the gravity inclination angle δ in the region where T b < T pc . In the region where T b > T pc , increasing the gravity inclination angle δ led to a reduction in h value. When δ < 0°, the h value experienced a slight increase. However, the h value showed a substantial variation when δ > 0°, and the near‐wall fluid experienced a reduced flow velocity because of the combined effects of gravity and buoyancy, leading to a decrease in heat transfer. Larger gravity inclination angles led to a more pronounced deterioration in heat transfer. This study is anticipated to provide a theoretical basis for the optimized design of heat exchangers and the enhancement of energy conversion efficiency.

In this paper the cylinder deactivation technique in spark ignition engines was investigated. The potential of this concept was analysed using engine working cycle simulation model AVL Boost. The engine power output regimes corresponding to the vehicle moderate constant driving speeds were considered and the results show that at that low load engine operating regimes cylinder deactivation can enable fuel economy improvement of about 6-13% and corresponding CO2 emission reduction. The angular speed variations of engine crankshaft under cylinder deactivation conditions were also analysed and it was found that the speed variations increase several times compared to the standard operation of the engine with all active cylinders.

Abstract Dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engines are capable of operating on both renewable and conventional fuels. They produce ultra-low nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions while maintaining thermal efficiency similar to that of conventional diesel engine operating at part load conditions. However, the engine needs to transition to the conventional diesel combustion (CDC) mode during high speed and high load operation due to the limited operating range of the engine in the RCCI mode. This study aims to compare a virtual vehicle level drive cycle-based fuel economy and emissions data for the RCCI (operating with both gasoline-diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG)-diesel) and CDC dual combustion mode engine. In this work a combination of engine experimental data and a vehicle powertrain simulation tool (AVL CRUISE) is employed to determine the vehicle level emissions and performance of a light-duty commercial vehicle on the world-wide harmonized light-duty test cycle (WLTC). The vehicle duty cycle results demonstrate ∼62% decrease in NOx and ∼36% reduction in soot emissions with the gasoline-diesel RCCI-CDC engine compared to conventional diesel only operation. A further 26% reduction of soot emission is observed with the CNG-diesel RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engine. However, the combustion efficiency decreased in the RCCI mode resulting in a significant increase in total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Despite the poor combustion efficiency and marginally reduced thermal efficiency of the RCCI mode, the fuel economy of the vehicle, with the RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engine, undergoing the WLTC drive cycle is comparable with the diesel only vehicle. Fuel economy of 21.2 km/l (diesel equivalent) and 21.6 km/l (diesel equivalent) are estimated with the gasoline-diesel and CNG-diesel RCCI-CDC modes, respectively, compared to 22.3 km/l (diesel) of conventional diesel only operation. Engine-out CO2 reduced by 7% in case of gasoline-diesel RCCI-CDC engine whereas, due to the lower carbon to hydrogen ratio in the CNG-diesel RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engine, engine-out CO2 reduced by 16% as compared to CDC only operation. However, when the global warming potential of methane was considered, the CO2 equivalent emissions for the CNG-diesel RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engine were 1.67 times higher than that for CDC.

This work analyses load profiles for East African microgrids, and then investigates the integration of electric two-wheelers and portable storage into a solar PV with battery microgrid in Uganda, East Africa. By introducing e-mobility and portable storage, demand side management strategic load growth can thus be achieved and electricity access can be expanded. Battery degradation is also considered. The results showed a 98.5% reduction in PV energy curtailment and a 57% reduction in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from 0.808 USD/kWh to 0.350 USD/kWh when the electric two-wheeler and portable storage loads were introduced. Such reductions are important enablers of financial viability and sustainability of microgrids. It is possible to avoid emissions of up to 73.27 tons of CO2/year with the proposed e-bikes, and an average of 160 customers could be served annually as off-microgrid consumers without requiring an investment in additional distribution infrastructure. Annual revenue could be increased by 135% by incorporating the additional loads. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying component costs, the battery lifetime, the interest rate, and the priority weighting of the additional loads. The battery costs were found to be a major contributor to lifecycle costs (LCC) and also have a big impact on the LCOE. The interest rate significantly affects the LCC as well.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has captivated widespread attentions, yet achieving the requisite efficiency, selectivity and stability for industrial applications poses a persistent challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in N‐doped carbon framework via a bottom‐up interfacial assembly strategy. The 2D mesoporous Ni‐N‐C catalyst showcases an ultrathin thickness (~6.7 nm) with well‐distributed 5 to 40 nm‐width mesopores in plane and a high surface area. As a result, the Ni single atom sites with a high density (~6.0 wt.%) are almost completely exposed and can be accessible, and the mass transfer can be greatly promoted even at high current densities. Thus, an industry‐level current density of 446 mA cm‐2 with > 95% CO selectivity in a flow cell can be obtained. Concurrently, the catalyst demonstrates an impressive stability, maintaining a 50‐hours continuous electrolysis in the membrane electrode assembly test and achieving an energy efficiency of 42%. Finite element analysis reveals that the 2D mesoporous design enhances CO2 diffusion, ensuring efficient adsorption and swift CO desorption at high current densities. Our study paves a way for the fabrication of 2D mesoporous single atom catalysts with nearly 100% accessibility and expedited mass transport.

China's commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060 relies on the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, with forestation targets designed to enhance carbon removal. However, the exact sequestration potential of these initiatives remains uncertain due to differing accounting conventions between national inventories and scientific assessments. Here, we reconcile both estimates and reassess LULUCF carbon fluxes up to 2100, using a spatially explicit bookkeeping model, state-of-the-art historical data, and national forestation targets. We simulate a carbon sink of −0.24 ± 0.03 Gt C yr−1 over 1994–2018 from past forestation efforts, aligned well with the national inventory. Should the official forestation targets be followed and extended, this could reach −0.35 ± 0.04 Gt C yr−1 in 2060, offsetting 43 ± 4% of anticipated residual fossil CO2 emissions. Our findings confirm the key role of LULUCF in carbon sequestration, but its potential will decline if forestation efforts cease, highlighting the necessity for emission reductions in other sectors to achieve carbon neutrality. China's 2060 carbon neutrality goal relies on forestation to enhance carbon removal. This study reconciles national and scientific LULUCF carbon flux estimates, projecting that continued forestation could offset 43% of CO2 emissions by 2060.

Marine sediments contain the largest reservoir of methane on Earth, with most of this methane being produced and consumed in situ by methane-cycling archaea. While numerous studies have investigated communities of methane-cycling archaea in hydrocarbon seeps and sulfate-methane transition zones, little is known about how these archaea change from the seafloor downward in the far more common diffusion-dominated marine sediments. Focusing on four continental margin sites of the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition, we here investigate the in situ drivers of methane-cycling archaeal community structure and metabolism based on geochemical and stable carbon-isotopic gradients, functional gene (mcrA) copy numbers and phylogenetic compositions, as well as thermodynamic calculations. We observe major vertical and lateral changes in community structure that largely follow changes in organic matter reactivity and content, sulfate concentration, and bioturbation activity. While methane-cycling archaeal communities in bioturbation and sulfate reduction zones are dominated by known methyl-dismutating taxa within the Methanosarcinaceae and putatively CO2-reducing Methanomicrobiaceae, the communities change toward dominance of known methane-oxidizing taxa (ANME-2a-b, ANME-2c, ANME-1a-b) in sulfate-methane transitions. Underlying methanogenesis zones were characterized by a change toward mainly physiologically uncharacterized groups, including ANME-1d and several new genus-level groups of putatively CO2-reducing Methanomicrobiaceae and methyl-reducing Methanomassiliicoccales. Notably, group-specific increases in mcrA copy numbers by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude from the sulfate reduction zone into the sulfate-methane transitions or methanogenesis zones indicate the thriving of several major methane-cycling archaeal taxa. Together our study provides insights into the community and pathway shifts vertically along the geochemical gradients and horizontally along the different sedimentary settings and their underlying drivers in continental margin sediments.

The aim of this work is to analyze the prospects of using hydrogen as an alternative to coke in blast furnaces in the context of decarbonizing the steel industry, particularly considering the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). It is shown that the widespread notion of a complete replacement of coke with hydrogen needs clarification, as there are technological limitations and economic challenges. According to the analysis of global experience, the use of hydrogen in blast furnaces allows for a reduction of CO2 emissions by 10-70%, which is particularly relevant in the context of CBAM, but requires significant capital investments in the modernization of production and the creation of infrastructure for the production and transportation of hydrogen. It is shown that the efficiency of hydrogen use, and therefore its potential for reducing the cost of carbon quotas within the CBAM framework, depends on the technology of its production, the method of injection into the blast furnace, and the conditions of blast furnace smelting.

Abstract Mongolia’s faces substantial challenges to reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions due to a reliance on coal to meet electricity, heat and other energy demand and large livestock emissions. Despite this, Mongolia has committed to reduce GHG emissions by 22.7% in 2030 compared to a baseline emission scenario. Greenhouse gas mitigation assessments for Mongolia have focussed on actions to achieve emission reductions by 2030, but not on the potential for further reduction over the longer-term. This study addresses this gap through the development of long-term (2050) GHG emission pathways for Mongolia. From a technical mitigation potential perspective, these pathways aim to inform what level of GHG reduction targets Mongolia could commit to for the period after its current target expires. Greenhouse gas emissions are quantified for historic years (2010-2019) for all major GHG emitting source sectors, and projected to 2050 based on the population and socioeconomic development outlined in Mongolia’s Sustainable Development Vision 2050. Finally, mitigation scenarios that model implementation of 49 specific mitigation measures are developed, to quantify their emission reduction potential. Without mitigation, GHG emissions were estimated to increase by 67% and 139% in 2030 and 2050, respectively, compared to 2019 levels (39 million tonnes CO2-eq emissions). Implementation of the 49 mitigation measures could reduce GHG emissions by 40% in 2050 compared to the baseline. This study highlights that post-2030, Mongolia could increase its climate change mitigation ambition. Renewable Electricity generation, and energy efficiency were the measures that could achieve the majority of these additional emission reductions. However, despite the achieve emission reductions in excess of those within current commitments, there remains a substantial gap between the emission reduction potential of technically feasible measures currently being considered in Mongolia’s climate change mitigation planning, and full decarbonisation.&#xD;

Due to legislations introduced to prevent global warming, vehicle manufacturers must find new ways to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper explores a way to reduce rolling resistance by heat-insulating and covering a truck’s wheelhouse. Truck tyre rolling resistance was measured at +5 °C ambient temperature for consecutive speed steps in a climate wind chamber with and without heat insulation. The study showed that by encapsulating and insulating the wheelhouse, already generated strain-induced heat could be kept in the tyre, consequently leading to reduced rolling resistance. The tyre shoulder temperature was monitored during the experiments along with the tyre pressure. When the wheelhouses were encapsulated, a significant reduction in rolling resistance and an increase in tyre pressure and temperature were measured at all evaluated speed levels.

The building sector is a major contributor to resource consumption, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable architecture offers a solution, leveraging Building Energy Modeling (BEM) for early-stage design optimization. This study explores the use of genetic algorithms for optimizing sustainable design strategies holistically. A comprehensive analysis and optimization model was developed using genetic algorithms to individually optimize various sustainable strategies. The optimized strategies were then applied to a pre-existing building in Kabul City, a region facing significant environmental challenges. To enhance accuracy, this study integrated energy simulations with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This research combines genetic algorithms with energy simulation and CFD analysis to optimize building design for a specific climate. Furthermore, it validates the optimized strategies through a real-world case study building. Optimizing the Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) and shading devices based on solar exposure significantly improved the building’s energy performance. South (S)-facing single windows and specific combinations of opposing and adjacent windows emerged as optimal configurations. The strategic optimization of building component materials led to substantial energy savings: a 58.6% reduction in window energy loss, 78.3% in wall loss, and 69.5% in roof loss. Additionally, the optimized pre-existing building achieved a 48.1% reduction in cooling demand, a 97.5% reduction in heating demand, and an overall energy reduction of 84.4%. Improved natural ventilation and controlled solar gain led to a 72.2% reduction in peak-month CO2 emissions. While this study focused on applicable passive design strategies, the integration of advanced technologies like Phase Change Materials (PCMs), kinetic shading devices, and renewable energy systems can further improve building performance and contribute to achieving net-zero buildings.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is considered a highly promising method to produce high‐value chemicals and fuels, contributing significantly the artificial carbon balance. Cu species exhibit a distinct role in the formation of C2+ products characterized by enhanced energy density. The limited selectivity of C2+ products, along with the inferior stability, and high overpotential demonstrated by single‐component Cu catalysts, hinders their applicability in industrial‐scale production. The implementation of a tandem strategy, which involves coupling the CO2‐to‐CO pathway using metal single‐atom catalysts (M‐SACs), etc., with the CO‐to‐C2+ conversion on Cu species, represents a novel approach for the efficient generation of C2+ products. Given the high cost and restricted availability of noble metals, M‐SACs have attracted substantial interest in tandem systems. The systematic analysis of the design principles and structure‐activity relationship is essential for the advancement of M‐SACs/Cu‐based tandem catalysts. Here we first introduce various prevalent design strategies of M‐SACs/Cu‐based tandem catalysts for ECO2RR and then systematically summarize the latest advancements of M‐SACs/Cu‐based tandem system, encompassing metal‐organic frameworks/Cu (MOFs/Cu), covalent organic frameworks/Cu (COFs/Cu), and nitrogen‐doped carbon support transition metal single atomic materials/Cu (M‐N‐C/Cu). Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities with the design and construction of M‐SACs/Cu‐based tandem catalysis for ECO2RR.

Abstract In the modern world, in the conditions of increasingly severe emission standards, increased oil prices and the political pressure to abandon internal combustion engines and implement electric vehicles, the search for alternative solutions for engines development is a key decision. One of these solutions currently accepted by European politicians is the use of biofuels. A highly promising fuel, which is at the very beginning of its research as an application in diesel engines, is the 1-decanol. Except for the higher viscosity and latent heat of vaporization, all its other properties are very similar to diesel fuel. One of the two ways to reduce viscosity is by blending it with another fuel, for which rapeseed biodiesel was chosen. The objective of the research is to investigate engine performance and emissions at different loads and engine speeds using decanol-biodiesel blends. Two types of blends were studied — Dec70B30 and Dec50B50. The study was conducted on a turbocharged diesel engine with common rail injection system. Compared to the diesel fuel, the results show a decrease in brake power up to 21.5%, increase in BSFC up to 19.96% at low and average loads and speeds, reduction of the CO2 emissions up to 23.33% while PM, HC and NOx emissions are variable in nature showing high increase or reduction depending the load, speed and used blend.

In natural photosynthesis, light-driven electron transfer across the thylakoid membrane enables efficient charge separation and the confinement of reaction spaces for generating NADPH and CO2 and oxidation of water. These reactions are complementary redox reactions and require different reaction conditions for optimal performance. However, current artificial photosynthesis studies only take place in the bulk and are sensitive towards oxygen and air, which limits their applicability under aerated and water-splitting conditions. Herein, we report light-driven electron transfer across a lipid bilayer membrane of liposome vesicles via a rigid oligoaromatic molecular wire that allows to electronically connect an oxidation and reduction reaction which are spatially separated by the membrane. The molecular wire has a simple, symmetric, easy-to-synthesize design based on benzothiadiazole and fluorene units and absorbs in the visible spectrum which makes it suitable for solar energy conversion. The model reactions in this study are light-driven NADH oxidation on one side of the membrane and light-driven reduction of an organic water-soluble dye in the bulk phase of liposomes. Additionally, the system is active in both aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres, rendering it ideal for aerobic conditions or reactions that produce oxygen such as solar-driven water splitting and artificial photosynthesis applications.

The increasing demand for high-grade manganese ores in various industries has led to a growing necessity to enhance the quality of lower-grade manganese ores with time. A representative manganese ore was collected from Um Bogma, Sinai, Egypt, and subjected to various characterization methods including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and ore microscopy. XRF analysis revealed a low Mn/Fe ratio of 2.81 (as elements), indicating a low ore grade. For suitability in Mn alloy production at the Sinai Manganese Company (SMC) plant in Abu Zenimah, southeast of Sinai, Egypt, this ratio should ideally exceed 5. Additionally, XRD and ore microscopy identified the mineralogical composition of the ore as pyrolusite, hematite, and manganite, with manganese patches embedded in a ferruginous groundmass at the textural scale. Three different reduction roasting techniques were evaluated, involving conventional heating in a furnace utilizing either CO – CO2 or charcoal as reducing agents, alongside reduction roasting with charcoal utilizing microwave technology. Following each technique, magnetic separation was employed, resulting in the production of high-grade manganese concentrates exhibiting high Mn/Fe ratios ranging from 19.8 to 27.45 and substantial Mn recovery rates ranging from 93.86% to 96.76%.

Introduction. Yoga breathing exercises that involve voluntary changes in pulmonary ventilation parameters can potentially influence cerebral circulation due to changes in CO2 content in arterial blood. Objective. To assess the effect of yoga breathing exercises with changes in pulmonary ventilation levels on blood flow parameters in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Methods. The study included 21 participants, with an average age of 39.5±8.7 years, who were capable of performing yoga exercises at respiratory rates (RR) of 3–3.5/min and 1–1.5/min. For 5 minutes, participants underwent three stages: free breathing (stage 1), breathing with RR=3–3.5/min (stage 2), and breathing with RR=1–1.5/min (stage 3). During stages 2 and 3, the «full breathing» technique, which involves maximum deep inhalation and exhalation, was employed. Respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (TI), minute ventilation (MV), end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PetCO2), and oxygen fraction in exhaled air (FeO2) were recorded using spiro-gas analysis. Transcranial duplex scanning was used to measure peak systolic blood flow velocity (Vps), end-diastolic blood flow velocity (Vd), time-averaged maximum blood flow velocity (TAMAX), and resistance index (RI) in the right MCA. The velocity variation index (VVI) was calculated for each stage. Results. Compared to stage 1 (free breathing), stage 2 (RR = 3–3.5/min) showed an increase in MV and FeO2, a decrease in PetCO2, and reductions in Vps, Vd, and TAMAX, with an increase in RI. VVI decreased statistically insignificantly. In stage 3 (RR = 1–1.5/min), compared to stage 1, there was an increase in PetCO2, a decrease in MV and FeO2, and increases in Vps, Vd, and TAMAX, with a decrease in RI. VVI increased significantly. Conclusions. Yoga breathing exercises at respiratory rates of 3–3.5/min and 1–1.5/min result in multidirectional shifts in ventilation and gas exchange parameters, leading to changes in arterial cerebral blood flow (a decrease and increase in blood flow velocity with an increase and decrease in MV, respectively). VVI, reflecting fluctuations in blood flow velocity, increases significantly with reduced MV, likely due to the vasodilatory effect of CO2.

Abstract Heating accounts for significant primary resource consumption and generation up to 30 % of total GHG emissions in the EU27. The ambitious emissions reduction goals outlined in the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 package necessitate not only the massive renovation of building stocks, but also reconstruction of heat generation and supply systems. With 76 % of the EU building stock located in urban areas, the renewal of urban heating systems is crucial. An easy-to-use methodology has been developed for managing long-term renovation programmes and regularly assessing renovation projects, thereby forming a comprehensive dynamic vision on the progress. This methodology enables flexible, rapid and, at the same time, sufficiently accurate and objective analysis of the potential and benefits of various heating system renovation projects and their variants at the pre-design stage, as well as their comparison according to efficiency. It employs a limited number of open indicators and does not require specialised knowledge in thermal physics, economics and/or construction. The developed methodology provides insights into (1) achievable heat consumption and primary energy savings, (2) reduction of dominant CO2 emissions, (3) changes in heating tariffs and costs, and (4) required investments. The methodology is intended for use by: (1) municipalities to streamline sustainable planning and management of urban heating systems and to facilitate interaction with owners of buildings and local heating systems, and (2) national authorities monitoring the implementation of national programmes under Fit for 55 .

Abstract Introduction: Telemedicine has emerged as a key tool to overcome socioeconomic disparities, expand healthcare access, and reduce environmental impacts. Its adoption surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, minimizing travel-related barriers and ensuring continuity of care. In Brazil, where regional inequities in healthcare access and pollution heavily affect public health, telemedicine holds significant promise. However, further research is needed to quantify its economic and environmental benefits. Moreover, examining how socioeconomic factors influence patients' preferences for telemedicine is essential. These correlations help identify patterns that may influence telemedicine adoption and provide deeper insights into how socioeconomic factors can affect access to and benefits from remote healthcare services. Objective: To evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of telemedicine use and the correlation of socioeconomic variables with telemedicine preference in patients with hip pathologies at a tertiary referral center in São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: A cross-sectional study (January-June 2024) analyzed telemedicine patients, collecting data on preferences, demographics, travel, and costs (transport and food). Avoided distance, time, and pollutant emissions were calculated using Google Maps and emission factors. Correlations were conducted between patients' preference for telemedicine and their socioeconomic data. Statistical analyses used Wilcoxon, chi-square, and logistic regression tests. Results: 148 patients participated, with 77.7% preferring telemedicine. The mean avoided travel distance was 168.84 km, with a mean time saving of 223.97 minutes. Patients using public transport and private cars saved, respectively, USD 12.62 and USD 28.95. Telemedicine also reduced pollutant emissions, avoiding approximately 7 tons of carbon dioxide. Telemedicine preference was positively associated with higher income (p = 0.0283). Other variables showed no statistically significant associations. Conclusion: Telemedicine led to significant time and cost savings, as well as a reduction in pollutant emissions. These findings demonstrate telemedicine’s potential to improve access and reduce environmental impacts.

Abstract. New regulations of sulfur emissions from shipping were introduced in 2020, reducing emissions of SO2 from international shipping by ∼ 80 %. As SO2 is an aerosol precursor, this drop in emissions over the ocean will weaken the total aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) that has historically masked an uncertain fraction of the warming due to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Here, we use four global climate models and a chemical transport model to calculate the ERF resulting from an 80 % reduction in SO2 emissions from international shipping relative to 2019 emission estimates. The individual model means range from 0.06 to 0.09 W m−2, corresponding to the ERF resulting from the increase in CO2 concentration over the last 2 to 3 years. The full uncertainty in the ERF due to the new regulation is not quantified but will very likely be high considering the contribution of uncertainties in shipping SO2 emissions, the sulfur cycle, the modelling of cloud adjustments and the impact of interannual variability on the method for calculating radiative forcing.

The article presents a sensitivity analysis of the carbon footprint for different modes of transporting neodymium magnets over a selected route, in the context of their environmental impact and sustainable development. Neodymium magnets, widely used in modern technologies such as wind turbines, are essential for renewable energy sources, making the selection of environmentally optimal transportation crucial. The calculations included road, rail, inland waterway, and air transport, using available emission calculators, which allowed for an analysis using averaged emission indicators for each mode of transport. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted with the SimaPro program to verify the consistency and accuracy of the results. The findings indicated that rail transport, with access to low-emission infrastructure and a reduced carbon footprint per unit of mass, is the most efficient option for CO2 emissions reduction, whereas air transport, despite its speed, generates the highest emissions per ton of cargo, making it the least environmentally friendly alternative. A t-test analysis was also conducted to statistically validate the results for each transportation option.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Incorporating ethanol and biodiesel into diesel fuel offers substantial benefits from bioenergy perspective. To assess the effect of these alternative fuels, a study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of Ethanol-Biodiesel-Diesel blends (BD7, E2B7, E5B7) on the performance and emissions of a diesel car under Modified Indian Driving Cycle (MIDC), Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC), wide-open throttle (WOT), and acceleration tests. A four-cylinder 1.5L Common Rail Turbo based diesel passenger car was selected for the study. The test findings revealed that under MIDC conditions, biodiesel blend (BD7) resulted in higher CO emissions compared to neat diesel, but these emissions decreased with the addition of ethanol (E2B7 and E5B7) due to ethanol's embedded oxygen content. While biodiesel lowered THC emissions, these emissions increased when ethanol was added. NOx emissions increased with biodiesel due to its higher cetane number and shorter ignition delay, and this trend persisted with the E5B7 blend. Under WLTC conditions, BD7 showed higher CO emissions. However, THC emissions decreased across all blends compared to neat diesel, while NOx emissions increased. CO2 emissions, on the other hand, decreased with all blends due to their lower carbon content and improved combustion efficiency. Despite a reduction in calorific value, a marginal improvement in fuel economy was observed. In terms of vehicle performance, the vehicle power remained consistent with improved acceleration time with respect to fuel blends. These results highlight the potential of ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends to reduce CO2 emissions and improve fuel economy, with the challenge of increased NOx. Long duration trials focusing on vehicle durability including fuel system’s performance, are needed to ensure the viability of these blends in diesel vehicles.</div></div>

Abstract An investigation of the performance and emissions of premixed combustion of a synthetic paraffinic kerosene sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) consisting of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) was conducted using a CRDI research engine with ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) as a reference. In a constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC), HEFA exhibited a shorter ignition delay, confirmed by its higher derived cetane number (DCN) at 58.6 compared to ULSD at 48. Further investigation was carried out at 5 bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) with the addition of EGR to control combustion and mitigate NOx. Methanol, a low reactivity fuel, was port fuel injected (PFI) at 50% with HEFA (by mass) and ULSD to investigate its cooling effect on in-cylinder temperatures as a means of mitigating NOx. Combustion pressure for HEFA was found to be greater than ULSD in most cases and occurred sooner. The apparent heat release rate (AHRR) was notably lower for HEFA than for ULSD in most cases, while the addition of methanol resulted in an increased duration of the low temperature heat release region for both HEFA and ULSD. With addition of EGR and PFI, several negative temperature coefficient regions were observed correlating with the pilot, primary, and tertiary direct injections. HEFA saw more than a 10% reduction in NOx than ULSD in CDC. The addition of EGR resulted in further reduction of NOx compared to ULSD at equal operating points. Implementing EGR and 50% methanol PFI with HEFA reduced NOx emissions by over 70% compared to ULSD in CDC. In all studied cases, CO2 emissions for HEFA were slightly reduced compared to ULSD at matched operating parameters, while CO increased compared to ULSD. Lastly, both ULSD and HEFA achieved a combustion efficiency of 97% in CDC at 5bar IMEP. The combustion behavior of the studied HEFA in combination with the emissions reduction suggests potential suitability as a substitute for ULSD in some applications.

Chemical weed control is a significant agricultural concern, and reliance on a limited range of herbicide action modes has increased resistant weed species, many of which use C4 metabolism. As a result, the identification of novel herbicidal agents with low toxicity targeting C4 plants becomes imperative. An assessment was conducted on the impact of 3-cyanobenzoic acid on the growth and photosynthetic processes of maize (Zea mays), a representative C4 plant, cultivated hydroponically over 14 days. The results showed a significant reduction in plant growth and notable disruptions in gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence due to the application of 3-cyanobenzoic acid, indicating compromised photosynthetic activity. Parameters such as the chlorophyll index, net assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), maximum effective photochemical efficiency (Fv&#039;/Fm&#039;), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (ϕPSII), and electron transport rate through PSII (ETR) all decreased. The A/PAR curve revealed reductions in the maximum net assimilation rate (Amax) and apparent quantum yield (ϕ), alongside an increased light-compensation point (LCP). Moreover, 3-cyanobenzoic acid significantly decreased the carboxylation rates of RuBisCo (Vcmax) and PEPCase (Vpmax), electron transport rate (J), and mesophilic conductance (gm). Overall, 3-cyanobenzoic acid induced substantial changes in plant growth, carboxylative processes and photochemical activities. The treated plants also exhibited heightened susceptibility to intense light conditions, indicating a significant and potentially adverse impact on their physiological functions. These findings suggest that 3-cyanobenzoic acid or its analogs could be promising for future research targeting photosynthesis.

Abstract The world needs reliable energy. As an industry, we supply that energy. Moreover, our product is one of the major contributors to increasing atmospheric CO2. Steam assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) technique alone contributes nearly 1.4 million barrels per day of oil production but with a range of steam oil ratios, the effectiveness of this production method is often challenged and seen as having high associated GHG emissions per barrel. We cannot solve this dilemma, but by better understanding the sciences of the reservoir and implementing new technologies at the primary level of production, we can help to be part of the solution. One production enhancement technique, injecting NCG at the late life SAGD wind down process is an effective but challenging operation due to high mobility of the gas and subsequent breakthrough at the production well. A new design of Autonomous inflow control valve's (AICV) can distinguish the difference in viscosity of the fluid, and therefore they can strongly choke and shut the NCG effluents zones as breakthrough occurs in the SAGD production well. The AICV design is truly autonomous based on Hagen-Poiseuille equation and Bernoulli's principle. The AICV is utilizing the difference in flow behavior in a laminar flow restrictor and a turbulent flow restrictor to differentiate fluids based on the difference in pressure drop between oil, water, emulsions, gas, CO2 and steam. This will allow the AICV to choke and/or shut off unwanted water, gas, CO2 and steam coming into the producer well. To understand the AICV behavior for a NCG breakthrough application, a laboratory experiment which illustrate the performance of AICV technology and reference orifice type ICD technology have been conducted. Laboratory experiment results illustrate the performance difference between AICV technology and reference orifice type ICD technology illustrate a significant, of more than 80% reduction, in NCG choking performance, when compared to the ICD type nozzle. The laboratory test performance results are used in reservoir simulations. Reservoir simulation results show that utilizing AICV in late life SAGD production well can significantly reduce NCG production and improve the recovery of SAGD operation by retaining more of the injected gas within the reservoir. In today's engineer's toolbox, a variety of new technologies exist that can help achieve the targets for late life SAGD. The new editions to Flow Control Device (FCD), Autonomous Inflow Control Valve (AICV), has evolved to the point that operators can operate in late life in a way that could demonstrate clear economic efficiencies with a reduced environmental impact. Reducing NCG breakthrough, greatly improves the economics and reduce greenhouse gas emissions for each barrel of oil produced thus reducing the carbon footprint and the impact to late life SAGD operation.

Batch-cell provides a quick way to test the performance of an electrochemical catalyst. A fundamental understanding of physics behind the batch-cell operation could shed light on parameters that either could be fine-tuned to get the desired performance, or by careful optimization, overall performance of the batch-cell could be improved. Therefore, a 1-D numerical model is developed to study the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) in a batch-cell with three different working electrode configurations: solid electrode (SE), gas diffusion layer electrode (GDLE), and glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Experimental results of two Cu-based catalysts are used to obtain the electrochemical kinetic parameters, and to validate the numerical model. Simulation results demonstrate that, both gas diffusion layer electrode, and glassy carbon electrode with porous catalyst layer (CL) have a superior performance over solid electrode in terms of total current density (TCD). Furthermore, we studied the impact of key parameters of batch-cell with glassy carbon electrode such as boundary layer thickness, catalyst layer thickness, catalyst layer porosity, electrolyte nature, and strength of an electrolyte on total current density at a fixed applied cathodic potential of -1.0 V vs RHE.

Abstract The metaturbidite‐hosted, ∼380 Ma Dufferin gold deposit, Meguma terrane, northeastern Appalachian Orogen (Nova Scotia, Canada) is an orogenic gold deposit with mineralized saddle reef‐type quartz veins hosted by metasandstones and black slates in a tightly folded anticline. Together with native gold inclusions, genetically related hydrothermal carbonaceous material (CM) in veins occurs as pyrobitumen in cavities and along fractures/grain boundaries proximal to vein contacts and wallrock fragments. Integrating several microanalytical methods we document the precipitation of gold via coupled fluid‐ f O 2 reduction (via interaction with CM) and pH increase. These changes in fluid chemistry destabilized gold bisulfide complexes, leading to efficient Au precipitation from a gold‐undersaturated (0.045 ± 0.024 ppm Au; 1σ; n = 58 fluid inclusions) aqueous‐carbonic fluid (H 2 O‐NaCl‐CO 2 ± N 2 ± CH 4 ). The proposed mineralization mechanism is supported by: (a) a complementary decrease in Au and redox‐sensitive semimetals (As, Sb), and increase in wall rock‐derived elements (i.e., Mg, K, Ca, Sr, Fe) concentrations in fluid inclusions with time; (b) a corresponding decrease in the X CO2 , consistent with CO 2 removal via reduction/respeciation and late carbonate precipitation; and (c) gold embedding in, or on, the surface of CM inside mineralized cavities and fractures. Despite mineralizing fluids transporting low concentrations of Au far from saturation, precipitation of gold was locally evidently high where such fluids interacted with CM, contributing to the overall gold endowment of Meguma deposits. This work re‐emphasizes CM as a potential prerequisite for efficient gold precipitation within the overall genetic model for similar orogenic metasedimentary settings globally where the presence and/or role of CM has been documented.

This study explores the optimization of bio-oil additives derived from the pyrolysis of Ulva lactuca algae, blended with RON 90 gasoline to enhance engine performance and reduce emissions. Addressing the urgent need for sustainable energy, the research focuses on a relatively unexplored area—using algae-derived bio-oils in gasoline engines. The study aimed to identify the optimal blend ratio of bio-oil and gasoline to improve engine metrics such as brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), thermal efficiency, and volumetric efficiency, while minimizing emissions like CO, CO2, and NOx. Experiments were conducted with bio-oil blended at 5%, 10%, and 15% by volume with RON 90 gasoline in a single-cylinder gasoline engine. Results showed that increasing bio-oil concentration led to improved fuel efficiency and thermal efficiency, along with significant reductions in CO and HC emissions. However, NOx emissions presented a complex trend, increasing at lower bio-oil ratios but decreasing significantly at the highest concentration. These findings suggest that algae-derived bio-oil can effectively enhance gasoline engine performance and reduce environmental impact, offering a novel, sustainable alternative fuel option. The study underscores the importance of optimizing blend ratios to maximize benefits and manage emissions, contributing valuable insights to sustainable energy research.

The present study explores incorporating biodiesel made from sunflower waste cooking oil (SWO) into petroleum diesel in varying concentrations. It examines various aspects, including energy, exergy, emissions, exergoeconomic and enviroeconomic factors, and the sustainability index (SI). Experimental findings indicate that higher biodiesel proportions in blends decrease thermal efficiency (ηth). Notably, D90WB10 (90% diesel and 10% biodiesel) demonstrates superior ηth, ranging from 14.98 to 29.37% across loads, closely resembling diesel (D100) values. Blends show significant reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (by 10.59–48.23%) and in unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions (by 10.34–27.58%) compared to D100 at full engine load. D90WB10 exhibits a maximum exergy efficiency of 27.22% at full load among all blends. Better exergoeconomic efficient fuel is indicated by lower relative cost difference (CR). Among all tested fuels, D100 exhibits the lowest CR value of 2.21. D100 exhibits the least annual CO2 emissions cost, whereas pure biodiesel (WB100) shows the highest, ranging from 55.46 to 144.86 USD/year across loads. The SI values for all tested fuels range between 1.281 and 1.393 at full engine load. Results indicate that blends of SWO biodiesel and diesel, particularly D90WB10, offer promising performance akin to diesel without significant modification.

Climate change has gained prominence following the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to keep it under 1.5 degrees Celsius. This agreement stresses the importance of collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience against climate impacts. In June 2023, the global average surface temperature reached a record high, with subsequent months also setting heat records. Mitigating global warming's adverse effects, such as rising temperatures and extreme weather changes, requires significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts in the energy sector have led to a decrease in CO2 emissions from 40.6 million tons in 2018 to 127.67 million tons in 2023. These efforts include enhancing energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy, and implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies In Indonesia, CCS regulations are outlined in Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 2 of 2023. CCS involves the capture, transport, injection, and permanent storage of carbon emissions. The management of state-owned assets related to CCS falls under the Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 140/PMK.06/2020, which addresses the transfer, utilization, and valuation of upstream oil and gas assets. This paper discusses the role of state asset management in the implementation of CCS in Indonesia, examining current regulations, challenges, and future prospects.

Approximately 10 billion tons of fine and coarse aggregate are manufactured worldwide annually, solely to be used as concrete for constructed structures. With approximately 80% of conventional concrete comprising sand and stone, activities in their extraction and relocation harm the natural environment. Manufacturing concrete causes substantial amounts of ecological damage and energy consumption. The replacement of natural aggregate with waste glass, therefore, theoretically removes this environmental damage and energy consumption. The research presented in this paper tested the theory that waste glass concrete aggregate represents a potential solution to curtail the adverse impact of concrete on the natural environment. Testing this theory entailed the review of the existing literature and analyses of the findings from a survey of 107 organizations situated in five countries within the concrete manufacturing supply chain. The findings of this research demonstrate that environmental implications exist with the use of both natural aggregate and glass waste. Significant CO2 reductions can be achieved by using glass as aggregate in concrete. This is found to be up to 60% and 65% for fine and coarse aggregates, respectively. In addition, using glass in its aggregate can potentially improve the strength of concrete. With a concrete grade of 20, an improved compressive strength test of up to 10 could be possible. Similarly, with concrete grades of 25 and 30, an improved tensile strength test of up to 9 could be possible. This depends on differences in the percentage of natural aggregate that has been substituted with glass.

The tooling industry develops solutions year by year seeking operational efficiency improvement. Resources consumption in construction sites has attention paid when costs reduction is the way to achieve competitiveness for residential and commercial units which face a market even more demanding. Customers and shareholders are asking beyond best prices and gains, they definitely want to have tangibility for what was qualitative benefit. Safety at work is no more merely number of accidents, it is severe days off expenses and loss of reputation. Guaranteed delivery is no longer unique efficiency variable, where doing more with less is a must. Recipes can be deferred and profits maximized if what the plan was carried out within less time and resources. Taking a typical metal support element for infrastructure utilities (water, electricity, compressed air, gas, among others) as an example, this article aims to demonstrate the significant potential for reducing energy consumption when modular system replaces welded one, mainly if considered battery powered tools. Elements fixed with screws, washers, sliders and nuts reduce the complexity of assembly with 72% less time and up to 83% less material, using less and 42% cheaper labor. With an investment in tooling about 1/5 to 1/3 lower than conventional welded solution, the work becomes safer and more ergonomic. Thanks to the structure&rsquo;s lower mass, the modular system saves CO2 emissions in transportation by 50% compared to the traditional solution.

Abstract The Compression Ignition of Directly Injected Natural Gas (CIDI NG) offers a potential 25% reduction in CO2 emissions due to its high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio compared to diesel, while achieving ultra-low PM formation with high efficiencies and load capability. The primary challenge of a CIDI NG engine is achieving suitable ignition temperatures, upwards of 1150K, and in-cylinder conditions required for the stable ignition and combustion of late cycle high pressure direct injection of the fuel over a wide operating range. This experimental study investigates CIDI NG combustion in a heavy-duty Single Cylinder Research Engine (SCRE). The SCRE uses a combination of ignition-enhancing technologies targeting the required conditions, including an increased compression ratio, intake charge heating, thermal barrier coatings, EGR, and NG pilot injection. Additionally, charge mixing is promoted through the refinement of the piston bowl geometry, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced soot formation. This study shows the effect of the implemented hardware technology (CR, Bowl Geometry, Thermal Barrier Coating) on the combustion at key operating conditions (low, medium, high load, high-efficiency operation, low emissions) of the NG CIDI engine. Stable combustion and engine operation were demonstrated over a wide load from 5.5 bar to a peak load of 25 bar IMEPg, and a maximum indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) of 48.8% at a load of 15.2 bar IMEPg was achieved. The work conducted with the single cylinder research engine shows that this operation is feasible and can become commercially available in the future.

Traffic congestion is a growing concern in urban centers worldwide, leading to significant delays, particularly for emergency vehicles such as fire trucks and ambulances. This not only increases emergency response time but also the risk of life and property loss. To address this issue, our research introduces a traffic control system that prioritizes emergency vehicle egress and mitigates intersection congestion. Other than validation through simulation, the system’s efficacy is further substantiated by real-world hardware implementation. The system employs an access point (AP) at intersections to receive location and direction data from approaching vehicles. Emergency vehicles are given precedence, while non- emergency vehicle data is used to adjust traffic light durations, thereby optimizing the traffic flow. The simulation results demonstrate the system’s reduced lane opening times and average waiting periods for emergency vehicles. Advancing from simulation to application, we have executed a real-world hardware validation at a high-traffic intersection. This phase entailed the precise installation and calibration of the necessary hardware components, transitioning from theoretical models to practical, operational technology. The hardware setup confirms the system’s practical viability and offers a more comprehensive assessment of its impact on traffic efficiency and emergency response times. This dual approach of simulation and hardware validation provides a thorough evaluation of the system’s capabilities, establishing a foundation for future traffic management solutions. Additionally, the implementation of the system leads to a notable reduction in CO2 emissions at intersections, contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">The market for battery-fitted electric cars continues to experience robust growth globally as well as in Indian market. During the charging process heat generation happen because of internal resistance of the battery cells and electrical connectors. Making an efficient battery cooling system is vital for all electric vehicles. One common cause of battery overheating is due to low cooling efficiency. So this research highlights the importance of scientifically designing coolant circuits and selecting appropriate coolant hose materials. Currently, EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) material is widely used for battery cooling hoses due to its design Flexibility, Compatibility with a 50:50 glycol-water mixture and Resistance to thermal and ozone cracking [<span class="xref">1</span>]. This study benchmarks EPDM hose technical properties with leading EV battery cooling plastic hose materials, such as mono layer polyamide, mono layer TPVs (thermoplastic vulcanizates) and PA PP two layer hose. Comparative experiments, including fluid compatibility, burst pressure, vacuum collapse, permeability, Aging, ozone resistance and mechanical property tests, were conducted on specimens made from these different materials. The results indicated that while EPDM performs adequately, it tends to degrade under the combined influence of air and coolant liquid stresses, particularly under thermal and mechanical conditions. Conversely, plastic materials TPV (Thermoplastic Vulcanizate) significantly improve all required functional properties like low internal surface friction, low outer surface condensation, enhancing recyclability, thus supporting end-of-vehicle-life sustainability, however excluding flexibility. The advanced manufacturing process of plastic hose also demonstrate a lower Co2 footprint compared to EPDM, because of low density, weight reduction by wall thickness reduction and with higher productivity rate. This research highlights the potential benefits of transitioning from EPDM to plastic materials for battery cooling hoses in electric vehicles, resulting in improved performance, environmental benefits, and increased manufacturing efficiency.</div></div>

Abstract To meet future energy sustainability and carbon neutrality requirements, disruptive changes to the current energy mix are expected. Renewable fuels, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), could play an important role in this context. To assess the potential of HVO, further quantitative research analyses are still required in order to emphasize the benefits (and drawbacks, if any) from a global perspective, rather than limiting the investigation to a single topic (e.g., emissions). For this purpose, HVO and conventional diesel were compared, in this study, running initially the engine with the same (diesel-oriented) calibration, before being optimized using purposely developed fuel-specific calibrations. In terms of exhaust pollutant emissions, HVO showed the potential to substantially reduce engine-out emissions of soot, HC and CO at low loads, while differences in exhaust emissions at higher loads proved to be mainly determined by the amount of oxygen available in the combustion chamber, rather than the specific characteristics of the fuels. HVO also demonstrated reductions in tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions, due to lower fuel consumption, even though the primary benefit of renewable fuels should be highlighted in a larger well-to-wheel analysis. In addition to emission analyses, since extensive investigations on the area of vibroacoustic behavior of engines running on renewable fuels are rare in the literature, a thorough comparison between regular diesel and HVO was carried out on this aspect. In this preliminary activity, the acoustic analysis focused solely on combustion noise, which was extracted by using dedicated signal processing techniques. This approach allowed the authors to focus on the noise contribution that is specifically influenced by the fuel characteristics. Furthermore, the vibrations of the engine block were evaluated. The results showed slightly lower levels of HVO in terms of both noise and vibrations.

Abstract The glass industry plays a pivotal role in modern manufacturing, providing essential materials for a multitude of applications ranging from construction to consumer goods. However, the substantial energy demands, primarily driven by the intense heat required to melt raw materials within furnaces, pose significant challenges. Traditionally, thermal energy is sourced from combustion processes in dedicated chambers. Yet, in the pursuit of efficiency and environmental sustainability, there is a growing preference for integrated systems. Notably, the utilization of electrode installations within glass baths emerges as a promising choice for direct melting augmentation through electricity in a more efficient way. This study introduces a sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, developed by the authors, tailored to simulate the real operation of a glass furnace. The model fully couples the reactive flow in the combustion space (the furnace) with convective motions within the glass tank including the effect of the electrodes. By changing the thermal energy from combustion with varying levels of electrode operation (keeping the same overall heat flux to the glass), the furnace behaviour is investigated. The research specifically examines the effects of electrode operation on crucial furnace parameters, including flame heat release and convective motions inside the glass bath, across different scenarios. Insights are gained into the complex interplay between electrode operation, thermal dynamics, and glass quality within the furnace environment. The findings of this study not only deepen the understanding of fundamental processes within glass manufacturing but also offer actionable insights for industry stakeholders. By elucidating the intricate relationship between electrode operation and glass melting process, this research provides practical guidance for optimizing furnace design and operation, enhancing efficiency and CO2 reduction, with the same product quality, in the glass industry.

The paper examines the perspectives of hemp use in the textile, food, construction, energy and other industries, where not only the fibrous part is used but also seeds, leaves, bark, and roots. The cultivation of hemp worldwide is analysed, and the current Ukrainian trend, particularly the dynamics of the production of technical hemp in Ukraine, is researched in terms of technical hemp plant growing, which seems less promising despite the vast and marvellous increasing demand for hemp-based products worldwide. The advantages of using hemp fibre in construction as an ecological, heat-, sound-insulating, ecological building material are given. A comparison of the technical hemp fibre-based mixtures with such traditionally used in Ukraine construction materials as brick and autoclaved aerated concrete blocks was carried out according to such indicators: environmental friendliness, compression and bending strength, biodegradation, installation period, thermal conductivity and thermal resistance of walls, average density, cost and fire resistance. The comparison of hemp fibre-based insulation materials with other insulating materials is also provided. The advantages of hemp fibre for hempcrete production are lower specific weight, high environmental friendliness, and other parameters. The economic prerequisites for using technical hemp in construction are presented, such as an increase in the diversity of new job places creation, stimulation of innovations in construction, and support and creation of local entrepreneurship. These steps would significantly increase the deductions and taxes for infilling local budgets from an economic point of view and lead to a reduction of energy consumption and sequestration in CO2 emissions in terms of sustainability. A conceptual diagram of the organisational and economic principles of the use of technical hemp in construction, which includes an analysis of the problems preventing the use of hemp fibre in construction, has been proposed.

Excessive fertilisation, improper nutrient management, and specific climatic factors are the main reasons for the high environmental risks associated with agricultural production in subtropical plateau regions. However, quantitative data of environmental impacts and emission reduction potential remain unclear. The development potential of such systems is likely to be significant. In that context, we conducted a case study in Yunnan Province, China, to quantify the environmental impact of crop production from 2002 to 2021. A life cycle assessment method was employed to identify the factors driving environmental impacts, and potential mitigation strategies were proposed. The yield and total nutrient input of grain crops in Yunnan Province increased over the 20-year period, and the environmental footprint of crop production in Yunnan Province was higher than that in other regions. The average annual mean greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil acidification potential (AP), and water eutrophication potential (EP) of crop production from 2002 to 2021 were 837 kg CO2-eq·Mg−1, 15.7 kg SO2-eq·Mg−1, and 2.71 kg PO4-eq Mg−1, respectively. Environmental emissions from crops mainly originate from the application of agricultural inputs (including fertilisers (N, P, and K), pesticides, seed, diesel fuels, and plastic film) during the crop life cycle. There was a significant correlation between surplus nitrogen and environmental impacts. Scenario testing showed that optimised nutrient management practices could increase crop yield and reduce environmental costs. GHG emissions, AP, and EP from the production of rice, wheat, and maize are expected to decrease by 43.0–59.5%, 51.5–64.5%, and 57.4–71.5%, respectively (scenario 4, S4). Based on these findings, we propose that com-prehensive agricultural management measures can reduce the negative impacts of crop production on the environment in subtropical plateau areas and help achieve sustainable agricultural development.

Abstract. The rapid response of foraminiferal assemblages to changing climate makes their shells an invaluable geological record of the past. However, the time frame over which foraminifera respond to climatic signals and the specific drivers influencing assemblage composition and abundance remain obscure. We focus on the impact of ongoing, anthropogenic climate change on planktic foraminifera in the California Current ecosystem, which would appear as a nearly instantaneous event in the sediment record. The Santa Barbara Basin sediment trap, located off the coast of California, USA since 1993, provides a 28-year record of particulate and foraminiferal flux to the basin’s seafloor. The sediment trap captures the superposition of the annual cycle of seasonal upwelling, Pacific multiannual El Niño-Southern Oscillation-driven temperature changes, and anthropogenically forced climate change. We present data on planktic foraminiferal flux collected between 2014–2021, at two-week intervals (164 samples, 60,006 individuals) and compare results to previously published data from 1993–1998. Consistent with previous studies, the most abundant species from 2014–2021 were Globigerina bulloides, Neogloboquadrina incompta, and Turborotalita quinqueloba, with peak fluxes occurring in the spring and summer. Lower fluxes and an increase in the abundance of N. incompta and subtropical species characterize the winter season. We find a 37.9 % decrease in total foraminiferal flux relative to the 1990s, primarily driven by a decrease in G. bulloides abundance. This decrease is accompanied by a 21.9 % overall reduction in calcium carbonate flux. We also find a decrease in the relative abundance of subtropical species (Globigerinoides ruber, Orbulina universa, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei) and their fluxes compared to the 1990s, contrary to expectations if assemblages and fluxes were to follow anthropogenic warming signals. We hypothesize that the observed decrease in subtropical species abundance and flux is likely related to an increase in acidification and in the timing and magnitude of upwelling along the California coast. The extremely rapid responses of foraminifera to ongoing changes in carbonate chemistry and temperature suggest that climate change is already having a meaningful impact on coastal carbon cycling. The observed decrease in particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) flux relative to particulate organic carbon (POC) flux may facilitate increased oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2.

Determining regional and global carbon cycles hinges on investigating the dynamic characteristics and influencing factors of soil respiration in various types of natural grasslands located in arid regions, and these characteristics are important indicators for assessing the structural and functional health of grassland ecosystems. Such investigations also provide theoretical support for carbon sink monitoring, energy conservation, emission reduction and low-carbon development in the western arid zone and are important for obtaining an in-depth understanding of the carbon cycle, as well as for ecosystem management, restoration and the reconstruction of arid areas. In this study, during the growing season (from May to October) of 2022, the LI-8100A automated soil CO2 flux system was used to measure the soil respiration rate (Rs), temperature from 1.5 m above the surface to depths of 5–25 cm (T, T5, T10, T15, T20 and T25) and the soil moisture content (SM) at a depth of 20 cm in four types of grasslands: lowland meadow, alpine meadow, temperate desert steppe and temperate steppe desert. Five replicates were established for each plot, and the responses of Rs to T and SM were fitted to construct the optimal regression model. The results revealed that (1) the daily average soil respiration was highest in the lowland meadow (0.07 to 5.76 μmol·m−2·s−1), followed by the alpine meadow (−0.57 to 0.95 μmol·m−2·s−1), the temperate desert steppe (−0.45 to 3.0 μmol·m−2·s−1) and the temperate steppe desert (−1.29 to 1.61 μmol·m−2·s−1); (2) the soil respiration rates of the four grassland types were significantly correlated with the temperature in the 5–15 cm soil layer, and the best model was an exponential function; the peak values generally appeared between 13:00 and 17:00 (h), with the minimum values at 2:00 or 8:00 (h); the maximum value was observed in July–August, and the minimum value was observed in October; and the soil respiration in the lowland meadow was higher than that in the other three types of grassland during the same period. The average variation intensities of the soil respiration from May to October were as follows: temperate steppe desert (91.78%) > temperate desert steppe (76%) > alpine meadow (58.77%) > lowland meadow (43.93%). (3) The partial correlation analysis revealed that when soil temperature was used as a control, the correlation between SM and soil respiration in the four types of grasslands changed, and the coefficient of determination (R2) increased to varying degrees, explaining up to 80% of the variation in the soil respiration in the lowland meadows. The correlation between soil respiration and the SM normalized to 10 °C explained up to 93.8% of the variation in soil respiration; the two-factor fitting equations revealed that the model with soil temperature and SM was superior to the single-factor model with either soil temperature or SM.
