Abstract As a frontier method for adjusting the electronic and geometric configurations of metal sites, lattice strain engineering plays a key role in regulating the interaction between catalytic surface and adsorbed molecules. Here, the research progress of strain effects in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is reviewed. Starting from the basic principles of strain effects in the CO 2 RR, the advanced in situ characterization techniques are summarized. The key effect of strain on the structure–activity relationship in CO 2 RR is comprehensively discussed. Subsequently, the electrocatalysts with different properties rich in strain are classified, including core–shell structure catalysts, alloys, transition metal compounds, and single‐atom catalysts. Finally, the obstacles encountered in the practical application of strain effect are proposed, and the future research direction of this emerging field is prospected.

Photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to fuel provides an ideal pathway to achieving carbon neutrality. One significant hindrance in achieving the reduction of CO2 to higher energy density multicarbon products (C2+) was the difficulty in coupling C–C bonds efficiently. Copper (Cu) is considered the most suitable metal catalyst for C–C coupling to form C2+ products in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but it encounters challenges such as low product selectivity and slow catalytic efficiency. Herein, we constructed a carbon defect on Cu-doped carbon nitride (Cu–CvN), as an efficient catalyst for photocatalytic CO2RR. The optimized catalyst (Cu–CvN-550) with a carbon defect shows high photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to ethanol, with an ethanol production rate of 122.6 μmol g–1 h–1 and a selectivity of 93.7%. The yield was 4.5 times higher than that of the Cu–CN-550 without carbon defect. The ratio of Cu+/Cu0 in Cu species changes regularly with calcination temperature, which was linearly correlated with the selectivity of the liquid product of CO2RR. DFT calculations combined with experimental results revealed that Cu doping promoted CO2 activation, followed by enhanced *CO adsorption and weakened hydrogenation and desorption. Carbon defects lower the free energy and greatly accelerate the *CO transfer process by promoting the formation of a six-membered ring intermediate state, serving as an intramolecular catalyst for *CO dimerization. Synergistic thermodynamic and kinetic interactions were realized through Cu doping and the introduction of carbon defects, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 for ethanol production.

The problem of greenhouse gas emissions has become increasingly severe, so energy conservation and emissions reduction have become a critical challenge for our society. In response to the challenge of lowering carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and transforming them into valuable energy molecules, this work explores the eco-friendly preparation of two-dimensional (2D) nanocopper-based catalysts. In this study, biomass was utilized as both the reductant and the capping reagent to prepare these catalysts. The structure and morphology of the resulting products were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Their crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The synthesis process of this type of nanomaterials was also studied. These copper-based catalysts were then evaluated for their efficiency in reducing CO2 into small energy molecules of HCOOH. A significant innovation of this study is using biomass as the reductant and capping agent, which guarantees the green synthesis process and exhibits great potential in converting CO2 into valuable energy molecules. This research is significant for creating new energy sources and protecting the environment.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has exhibited great potential in alleviating the issue of global warming and producing value-added products within industrial production levels. Nevertheless, diversified reaction preferences on the catalyst and tedious reaction pathways for several target products impede the progress towards industrialization. Therefore, it is particularly important to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the reaction preference (pathways and intermediates) and the structure of the catalyst and interface reaction, aiming to achieving effective generation of target product with high selectivity, high conversion rate and low overpotential. Cu has been considered as an extremely promising candidate for electrochemical CO2RR owing...[ Read more ]

The cement industry is one of the sectors that produces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to its raw material processing and energy requirements. CO2, as a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, contributes to global warming, leading to environmental, health, and economic losses. To address these issues, Indonesia is committed to reducing GHG emissions in the industrial sector by 2050. To effectively plan for the reduction of GHG emissions generated by companies, this study aims to quantify emissions from a cement company, representing the cement industry in Indonesia, to understand the current state of the company's carbon footprint and identify feasible mitigation measures. The cement industry utilizes a GHG quantification system to calculate emissions from raw material processing, thermal energy consumption, and electricity purchases. The calculation results from a cement company are used for system dynamics modeling with Vensim PLE software for the period from 2021 to 2050, under business-as-usual (BAU) conditions with various emission reduction strategies. The results show that GHG emissions under BAU conditions with emission reduction strategies do not achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. More intensive adoption of decarbonization technologies, research on process optimization, and government policies such as carbon taxes and carbon trading are required to achieve carbon neutral goals.

Carbon sequestration is emerging as a crucial strategy to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. While natural processes such as forests and oceans contribute to carbon storage, engineered approaches have gained significant attention due to their potential to enhance sequestration on a global scale. This review explores innovative carbon sequestration technologies, including Direct Air Capture (DAC), Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), soil carbon sequestration, ocean fertilization, and carbon mineralization. Each of these technologies offers unique opportunities to capture and store CO2, with varying degrees of feasibility, cost, and environmental impact, their promise, challenges such as high costs, storage capacity concerns, and ecological risks remain. The review also discusses the global implications of these technologies on climate change mitigation, emphasizing the need for integrated policies, international cooperation, and ongoing research to maximize their potential. Ultimately, carbon sequestration, when coupled with emission reduction strategies, can play a pivotal role in achieving long-term climate goals.

Electricity generation units (EGUs) emit a mix of health- and climate-relevant air emissions through coal combustion, with the potential to impact multiple emissions. Previous studies have focused on evaluating the cobenefits of climate policies on air quality, studies that consider how air pollution controls affect carbon emissions remain relatively sparse. To evaluate different emission reduction strategies' impacts on multiple air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2), here we apply a multi-pollutant analysis framework, focused on sulfur dioxide (SO2) controls on coal-fired EGUs in the United States (U.S.). Eighty-nine EGUs without SO2 controls in the contiguous U.S. as of 2020 are identified and investigated. Results show that add-on pollution controls like flue gas desulfurization (FGD) reduce SO2 emissions from coal combustion, but increase emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and CO2. A coal-to-natural gas transition reduces all pollutants except VOCs. A coal-to-renewable transition reduces all studied pollutants. We find that add-on SO2 controls could generate a total annual net benefit of $13.4 billion nationwide when considering a multi-pollutant portfolio of emissions, as compared with $32.9 billion total annual net benefits from coal-to-natural gas transition and $40.5 billion from coal-to-renewable transition. Our results highlight the potential of implementing the multi-pollutant analysis framework to evaluate multi-pollutant emission reduction strategies.

Microbes are crucial for the survival of life on Earth as they affect the major biogeochemical cycles that make our planet congenial for life, providing essential elements like carbon and nitrogen in required forms and quantities. Microbes also play a significant role as either generators or consumers of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ), and nitrous oxide (N2O), through various processes in our environment. The distribution of these chemicals on the Earth and in the atmosphere is severely reliant on the equilibrium of these microbial progressions. The consumption of GHGs by microbes is facilitated through their use as substrates in processes like photo/chemoautotrophy, methanotrophy, and nitrous oxide reduction. The CO2 emitted from the organic matter decomposition and terrestrial respiration is subsequently subjected to photosynthetic fixation partially and is mitigated through carbon sequestration into soil and biomass. The biogenic release of methane through the biological anaerobic decomposition of organic materials by methanogens constitutes an important source of atmospheric CH4, while methanotrophs, through CH4 oxidation, facilitate methane emission mitigation. The microbial nitrification denitrification processes are the significant source of N2O emission, while the N2Oreducing bacteria are responsible for decreasing N2O emissions via nitrous oxide reduction enzymatic processes. The complexity of the interactions between these microbes with neighboring biotic and bacterial variables in order to regulate Earth's greenhouse gas emissions is a factor that affects their activity. Hence, interdisciplinary approaches, including microbial ecology, environmental genomics, soil and plant sciences, etc., should be concentrated on mitigating greenhouse gases.

Ammonia, being 17.6% hydrogen by mass, is regarded as a hydrogen carrier and carbon-free fuel as long as its production methods rely on renewable energy sources. The production and combustion of green ammonia do not generate carbon dioxide, offering a promising avenue for substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a well-to-wake perspective. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for the development and validation of a thermodynamic model for a two-stroke low-speed marine engine incorporating a hybrid ammonia-diesel diffusion combustion system. The simulation tools are rigorously validated using experimental data obtained during diesel operation. Subsequently, the study explores various aspects of the novel ammonia-diesel combustion system, addressing combustion and emissions characteristics. The investigation incorporates diverse simulation scenarios involving direct fuel injection through dedicated valves into the cylinder head of a six-cylinder, turbocharged compression-ignition engine. The engine features two diesel injection valves, employed to initiate the combustion process, and two ammonia injection valves. Simulation scenarios include variations in the injection timing of the pilot diesel injector and the relative orientation of diesel and ammonia sprays. Case C emerges as the preferred configuration, demonstrating superior metrics in terms of combustion stability, air-fuel mixing, and emissions profile compared to other cases. The results indicate a reduction of CO2 emissions of approximately 95% in mass compared to the baseline diesel operation. Furthermore, notable reductions in NOx emissions are observed, preliminarily attributed to the lower flame temperature of ammonia. Despite the appearance of N2O emissions as a result of ammonia oxidation, the overall potential reduction in GHG emissions, in CO2-equivalent terms, exceeds 85% at selected operating points. This work contributes valuable insights into the optimization of cleaner propulsion systems for maritime applications, facilitating the industry’s transition toward more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices.

Rapidly increasing carbon dioxide emissions over the past decades and the possibility of further increases in coming decades has motivated global efforts to remove and sequester carbon from atmosphere. Among recent proposals for marine-based Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR), ocean iron-fertilization has been revisited, although its efficacy on a global scale remains uncertain. We thus assessed the carbon uptake efficacy in small (~GgC) and large (~PgC) scales in the global coupled earth system model, GFDL-ESM4.1. Our simulations indicate that large-scale fertilization yields greater carbon uptake efficacies than small-scale fertilization. Efficacies in large-scale fertilization are from 179% to 225% higher than small-scale fertilization in the Equatorial Pacific and Southern Ocean, but were more comparable in the North Pacific. Higher carbon uptake efficacies in large-scale fertilization are attributed to greater accumulation of dissolved iron within the fertilized region. While our results emphasize the carbon uptake efficacy benefits of a large-scale approach over the fertilized area, some of additional carbon uptake is compensated by reduced uptake in the non-fertilized oceans. This study finds that 80% and 85% of the carbon taken up in the Equatorial and North Pacific are compensated by decreases in carbon uptake elsewhere, implying that outside of the Southern Ocean major nutrients would have been taken up in non-fertilized regions, leaving little carbon additionality. This study puts into serious question the net benefits and further exposes risks iron fertilization, such as reduction of productions in the Equatorial Pacific, as a large scale mCDR approach outside of the Southern Ocean.

Today, carbon emission pollution is particularly serious. Greenhouse gases are produced all the time in every part of people’s lives, which directly leads to catastrophic global warming. Controlling carbon emissions is related to the fate of the entire earth, and countries around the world need to study the most effective and lowest-cost emission reduction methods as soon as possible. In this regard, this article comprehensively reviews the factors affecting global carbon emissions and analyzes the rising trend of carbon emissions in recent years. The article focuses on the mechanisms of major sources of carbon emissions such as transportation, urbanization, and industrial production, and their impact on the environment. The study found that the combustion of fossil fuels produces a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions and forest reclamation is the main reason for the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, which directly leads to climate change. In addition, the article also analyzes the potential impact of urbanization. This article emphasizes the importance of reducing carbon emissions through global cooperation, technological innovation, and policy intervention to promote sustainable development.

The global consensus to move towards carbon neutrality has been growing amidst turbulence, and the issue of carbon emissions has been an unavoidable topic for achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. The introduction of microalgae photosynthetic carbon sequestration technology optimizes the culture environment of microalgae through hydrodynamics and enhances the efficiency of light and carbon dioxide transfer, thus increasing the rate of photosynthesis and carbon sequestration effect of microalgae. Based on the biomechanical perspective, this study constructed a three-party dynamic evolution game model including agricultural subjects, enterprises and local governments, analyzed the mechanism of photosynthetic carbon sequestration by microalgae, the financing subsidy system and the carbon trading mechanism, and explored the strategic choices and behavioral evolution process of the agricultural subjects and local enterprises in the face of different policy incentives, and verified the conclusions by numerical simulation analysis. The study shows that: (1) the implementation of financial subsidy policies by local governments significantly increases the willingness of agricultural producers and enterprises to apply microalgae photosynthetic carbon sequestration technology, thus accelerating the process of agricultural carbon emission reduction; (2) the integration of energy enterprises and microalgae industry in the carbon trading market is conducive to the generation of renewable energy, and realizes a win-win situation for the government’s environmental benefits and the enterprise’s economic benefits; (3) the adoption of microalgae carbon sequestration by agricultural producers (3) The adoption of microalgae carbon sequestration technology by agricultural producers is conducive to the promotion of the virtuous cycle of soil microbial communities and the realization of crop income. This study evaluates the potential impacts of different policy combinations on agricultural carbon emission reduction based on the carbon trading mechanism, which can help promote the application of microalgae carbon sequestration technology and the implementation of agricultural carbon emission reduction.

In the global environment of carbon emission reduction, diesel engine emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other harmful gases seriously polluting the environment has been boycotted by governments around the world. Ammonia, as a clean, environment-friendly, easy-to-transport green energy, has broad application prospects. However, due to its poor combustion performance and high calorific value, there are some limitations in its application. In this paper, the mechanism, combustion characteristics and emission characteristics of an engine fueled with ammonia-hydrogen fuel and ammonia-carbon-based fuel are reviewed. Hydrogen fuel and diesel fuel with low ignition energy and fast laminar flame spread characteristics, can make up the shortage of pure ammonia fuel, reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. Among them, hydrogen ammonia fuel has become the mainstream and the most promising fuel, compared with pure ammonia fuel and ammonia diesel fuel has the advantages of clean, low transport costs, fast combustion and so on, will become the future engine main application fuel.

This study innovatively develops a multi-objective Markal-Macro model, which simultaneously considers three objectives: minimizing carbon emissions from energy consumption, minimizing carbon emissions from production processes, and maximizing societal welfare. Based on the Cobb–Douglas production function, we construct a production function of carbon emission and use it as a coupling equation of the Markal-Macro model (Markal is the abbreviation of market allocation, and Macro is the abbreviation of macroeconomy). This enables the coupling of the endogenous variables of carbon emissions and those related to maximizing societal welfare. By collecting relevant data on energy consumption, production outputs, and key economic indicators, five different scenarios are established. To enhance the computational efficiency of the simulation, we introduce a Firefly Algorithm into the penalty function method. The objective of our simulation is to explore the optimal carbon peak pathway for China. The results indicate that under the baseline scenario, China can achieve its carbon peak by 2029, with the peak value reaching approximately 12.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide. Finally, based on the simulation results, this study provides specific policy recommendations for China’s carbon peak pathway, addressing aspects such as industrial structure, energy consumption structure, the share of clean energy, economic growth targets, and the growth of emission reduction expenditures, while considering regional five-year plans and regional carbon peak strategies. From the aspect of the practical contributions, this article not only provides a set of methods for policymakers to make the Carbon Peak Implementation Plan but also offers an optimal path to improve the sustainable development for China.

Climate change, particularly CO2 emissions from the transportation sector, poses a significant global challenge. Promoting micro-mobility services, especially bike sharing programs, is crucial in addressing this issue. This study examines the environmental benefits of integrating bike sharing programs with public transportation by estimating the potential CO2 emission reductions through the avoided motorized trips approach. Data were collected via a commuter line passenger survey in the Yogyakarta Urbanized Area, resulting in 157 valid responses. The estimation considered specific data inputs: trip distance, emission factor, energy factor of transportation mode, and the number of people traveling by mode. Two scenarios related to bike sharing demand and commuter line ridership were employed. The findings reveal that bike sharing demand ranges from 16.03% to 48.08%. In terms of CO2 emissions reduction, the study indicates that avoided motorized trips through bike sharing as an egress mode can potentially reduce cumulative CO2 emissions by up to 567,158.35 tons CO2e by 2030. This reduction corresponds to 0.487% and 160.113% of the national and provincial reduction targets, respectively. These findings provide insightful information to promote sustainable transportation provision.

We present a novel electrochemical dicarboxylation of epoxides with CO2, characterized by the cleavage of two C–O single bonds. Not only are vinyl epoxides viable, but cyclic carbonates also serve as effective substrates, facilitating the synthesis of E‐configured adipic and octanedioic acids with high chemo‐, regio‐, and stereoselectivity. The synthetic practicality is further highlighted by the diverse functionalizations of the resulting multifunctional diacids. Mechanistic studies support the single‐electron transfer reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which undergoes radical addition to the vinyl moiety of epoxides. The subsequent reductive cleavage of two C–O bonds, coupled with a nucleophilic attack on CO2, culminates in the formation of the desired diacid products.

Capturing CO2 is highly valued in the field of organic synthesis, especially underdeveloped dual-CO2 conversion. In this study, we detail a novel reductive cyclization of 2-indolylanilines with dual CO2 as a difunctional reagent in the presence of PMHS [poly(methylhydrosiloxane)], delivering methyl-substituted quinoxalines. Furthermore, another chemoselective cyclization with 2-pyrrolylanilines is also realized by converting mono-CO2. Mechanistic investigations shed light upon the fact that this substrate-controlled divergence mainly depends on the formation of N-diacylative intermediates.

The carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies have shown promise for directly reducing the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere from significant point sources. This study aims to evaluate an integrated CCUS system in South Korea using three technologies: microalgae photocultivation, CO2 membrane separation, and carbon mineralization. LCAs showed the total GHG emissions, excluding carbon offset effects, were 358 kg CO2 eq/ton, with 95.8% from CO2 membrane separation. Microalgae and mineralization emitted 14.6 kg CO2 eq/ton (4.1%) and 0.371 kg CO2 eq/ton (0.1%), respectively. Including carbon offsets from CaCO3 production and CO2 utilization, the system's net emissions were -745 kg CO2 eq/ton. Further economic studies are needed, but the study confirmed the system's high GHG reduction efficiency through LCA, enhancing the potential use of CCUS technologies in urban CHP plants.

This study explores the factors driving CO2 emissions related to energy use in Fujian Province from 2000 to 2019, with an emphasis on long-term trends, short-term fluctuations, and spatial disparities. Utilizing annual data on CO2 emissions and various influencing factors from multiple cities within Fujian Province, we examine the factors driving long-term changes in CO2 emissions. To analyze short-term emission trajectories, we employ a temporal decomposition model, while spatial decomposition techniques are used to assess the variability in emission drivers across 9 prefecture-level cities over different years. Our findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and urbanization over the 20-year study period. Furthermore, short-term fluctuations indicate a gradual reduction in the impact of urbanization on the increase in CO2 emissions within the industrial, transportation, and household sectors in Fujian Province. Additionally, economic development, measured as per capita gross domestic product, is shown to significantly influence CO2 emissions. Efforts to reduce energy intensity, which refers to the amount of energy consumed per unit of economic output, in both the industrial and household sectors are identified as potential strategies for emission reduction. The variability in CO2 emissions among cities is primarily attributed to differences in energy intensity and population sizes. These insights are critical for formulating policies aimed at promoting low-carbon development, reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing sustainability throughout Fujian Province.

The article examines the impact of economic and environmental factors on the consumption of renewable energy sources (RES) in Kazakhstan. The study is based on a quantitative analysis of data, including adjusted net savings (ANS), the share of renewable electricity output (REO), and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions per capita. The dependent variable in this analysis is the share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption. The results of the regression analysis revealed the following relationships: an increase in the share of electricity production from renewable energy sources (REO) by 1% leads to an increase in their consumption by 0.119% (p < 0.01), which is associated with reduced production costs and improved accessibility. Adjusted net savings (ANS) also have a positive effect: their growth by 1% increases renewable energy consumption by 0.055% (p < 0.05), confirming the role of economic stability and investment in the development of green energy. At the same time, an increase in CO₂ emissions negatively affects renewable energy consumption, decreasing it by 0.154% for each additional ton of CO₂ per capita (p < 0.01), which is explained by the predominance of traditional hydrocarbon energy sources. The study highlights that the sustainable development of renewable energy sources requires a comprehensive approach, including the stimulation of its production, reduction of carbon emissions, and maintenance of economic stability. The results have practical value for the formation of Kazakhstan's state policy aimed at transition to sustainable energy and reducing environmental pressure.

The manufacture of ordinary portland cement (OPC) is responsible for approximately 4-8% of the total global Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. Recent CalTrans research resulted in changes to specifications to reduce the clinker content of OPC by using ground limestone creating a Portland Limestone Cement (PLC) that is compliant with ASTM C595-IL as one method to reduce the carbon footprint (approximately a 10% CO2 reduction) [1]. Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) may be able to be used to further reduce the clinker content in concrete, providing an additional 20 to 40% CO2 reduction depending on the volume of cement replaced and the SCM used. This project focused on reducing the carbon content using alternative SCMs.

Sewage sludge is a type of waste generated during the wastewater treatment process. If not properly disposed of, this waste can pose a risk to human health. This study explores the use of wastewater treatment sludge in the construction sector, with a focus on evaluating its impact on CO2 emissions and its contribution to sustainability. The findings suggest that, following the calcination process, wastewater treatment sludge acquires pozzolanic properties, which enable its partial incorporation into cement and concrete production. Moreover, the incorporation of wastewater treatment sludge into cement and concrete will contribute to both the reduction of CO2 emissions and the promotion of sustainability.

The CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is of great technical importance and enables the use (and thus removal from the atmosphere) of CO2, a greenhouse gas, in a value-adding process. Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts are a promising alternative to more active but toxic chromium oxide catalysts. Despite its common use, TiO2 has not been investigated as a support material for VOx in the CO2–ODH of propane. In this study, we elucidate the interaction between titania (P25) and vanadia in the reaction mechanism by analyzing the reaction network and investigating the catalyst using X-ray diffraction (XRD), multiwavelength Raman, UV–vis and diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. Besides direct and indirect ODH reaction pathways, propane dry reforming (PDR) is identified as a side reaction, which is more prominent on bare titania. The presence of VOx enhances the stability and the selectivity toward propylene by participating in the redox cycle, activating CO2 and leading to a higher rate of regeneration. Additionally, VOx catalyzes the conversion of anatase to rutile, which facilitates CO2 activation, thereby leading to an encapsulation of vanadium. At higher loadings, reducible VOx oligomers are present on the surface, facilitating some PDR, but less than on bare P25. As the main deactivation mechanisms of the catalyst system, we propose the reduction of the titania lattice and the consumption of vanadium, while carbon formation appears to be less relevant. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing the CO2–ODH reaction network and applying a multispectroscopic approach to obtain a detailed mechanistic understanding of CO2-assisted propane ODH over supported VOx catalysts.

Thailand's transport sector has been one of the highest CO2 emitters for several decades in the country due to the excessive increase in transport service demand and the high reliance on high-carbon-intensity petroleum fuels. This article discusses the potential of CO2 reduction in the transport sector in Thailand to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) is adopted to estimate the future energy demand and CO2 emission between 2020 and 2050. This study designs two main scenarios, namely the Baseline (BAS) and the Decarbonization (DEC) scenarios. The BAS scenario is developed in a business-as-usual approach with frozen technologies, while the DEC scenario is constructed as a CO2 countermeasure by including multiple low carbon technologies such as i) improving fuel economy efficiency of engines, ii) promoting electric vehicles (EVs), iii) utilizing fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), and iv) promoting mass transportation. The results indicate that by 2050, the transport sector's total energy demand will significantly increase to approximately 49,906 ktoe, with diesel, gasoline, and jet kerosene accounting for the majority of fuel consumption. In the BAS scenario, total CO2 emissions in the transport sector are estimated to be 119,737 ktCO2eq. By full implementation of the CO2 countermeasures and low carbon technologies in the decarbonization scenario, the total carbon emission in the transport sector is estimated to be 30,582 ktCO2 by 2050, which is in line with carbon neutrality pathways of Thailand. However, the nation-wide transport action plan should be developed in order to promote such sustainable transport technologies.

Abstract Li‐O 2 batteries urgently needs high discharge capacity and stable cycling performance, requiring effective and reliable bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Hovenia acerba Lindl ‐like heterostructure composed of cobalt sulfide and tin dioxide supported on carbon substrate (CoS/SnO 2 @C) is prepared via CO 2 laser irradiation technology. The half‐wave potential of CoS/SnO 2 @C for the ORR is 0.88 V, while the overpotential of the OER at 10 mA cm −2 is as low as 270 mV. The Li‐O 2 batteries employing the bifunctional CoS/SnO 2 @C catalyst displays a high discharge specific capacity of 3332.25 mAh g −1 and long cycling life of 226 cycles. Additionally, theory calculations demonstrate that the construction of heterostructure decreases energy barrier of the rate‐determining step (RDS) for both ORR and OER. Notably, SnO 2 behaves as the electronic promoter to optimize the electronic structure of heterostructure interface and triggers charge redistribution of CoS, which weakens the adsorption strength of the * O‐intermediates and allows to break the linear scaling relationship, thus further enhancing the catalytic performance of CoS/SnO 2 @C. This research furnishes directions for the design of heterogeneous catalysts, highlighting its great potential for application in rechargeable Li‐O 2 batteries.

Coastal wetlands, including freshwater systems near large lakes, rapidly bury carbon, but less is known about how they transport carbon either to marine and lake environments or to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane. This study examines how GHG production and organic matter (OM) mobility in coastal wetland soils vary with the availability of oxygen and other terminal electron acceptors. We also evaluated how OM and redox-sensitive species varied across different size fractions: particulates (0.45–1μm), fine colloids (0.1–0.45μm), and nano particulates plus truly soluble (<0.1μm; NP+S) during 21-day aerobic and anaerobic slurry incubations. Soils were collected from the center of a freshwater coastal wetland (FW-C) in Lake Erie, the upland-wetland edge of the same wetland (FW-E), and the center of a saline coastal wetland (SW-C) in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Anaerobic methane production for FW-E soils were 47 and 27,537 times greater than FW-C and SW-C soils, respectively. High Fe 2+ and dissolved sulfate concentrations in FW-C and SW-C soils suggest that iron and/or sulfate reduction inhibited methanogenesis. Aerobic CO 2 production was highest for both freshwater soils, which had a higher proportion of OM in the NP+S fraction (64±28% and 70±10% for FW-C and FW-E, respectively) and organic C:N ratios reflective of microbial detritus (5.3±5.3 and 5.3±7.0 for FW-E and FW-C, respectively) compared to SW-C, which had a higher fraction of particulate (58±9%) and fine colloidal (19±7%) OM and organic C:N ratios reflective of vegetation detritus (11.4 ± 1.7). The variability in GHG production and shifts in OM size fractionation and composition observed across freshwater and saline soils collected within individual and across different sites reinforce the high spatial variability in the processes controlling OM stability, mobility, and bioavailability in coastal wetland soils.

Two of the biggest problems worldwide are electrical energy and water, in this context the use of photovoltaic systems for the generation of electrical energy is increasingly profitable due to the constant reduction of prices in terms of the dollar watt and that supports the solution to the problem of energy supply at increasingly affordable prices. In this same scenario we have a reduction in CO2 emissions, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases, supporting the Kyoto protocol and the Paris agreement. On the other hand, the incorporation of ionized air for cleaning the photovoltaic modules allows the use of natural and demineralized water to be reduced to levels of around 98%, which allows us to be on par in saving solutions for this vital liquid.

CO2 emissions are major drivers of climate change, causing global warming, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss. They disrupt ecosystems, deplete resources, and threaten public health and economic stability. Reducing CO2 emissions is essential for climate stability and sustainability. This study explores the complex relationships between CO2 emissions and factors such as the transportation sector, electricity consumption, foreign direct investment (FDI), international trade, and gross domestic product (GDP). The focus is on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in Pakistan. Using time series data from 2000 to 2022. This study applies advanced econometric techniques, including nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). The findings highlight that increased electricity consumption, international trade, transportation activities, and FDI contribute to higher CO2 emissions. However, FDI can also help reduce emissions, particularly through investments in green technologies. This study emphasizes the importance of transitioning to renewable energy and adopting sustainable practices across sectors such as electricity, trade, and transportation. Specifically, transportation and electricity consumption were found to significantly impact CO2 emissions, with a 10% increase in transportation activities resulting in a 5% rise in emissions. Conversely, FDI can reduce emissions by approximately 3% per unit of investment, largely due to green technology adoption. Additionally, integrating renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies in transportation can lead to a 20% reduction in emissions. Policymakers and experts must prioritize strategies that promote renewable energy adoption and integrate sustainable practices to reduce CO2 emissions and ensure long-term environmental sustainability. This research is innovative in its analysis of the interconnected effects of electricity consumption, trade, transportation, and FDI on CO2 emissions. By applying sophisticated econometric methods, it highlights the potential of FDI, particularly green investments, to mitigate environmental damage. This study, focusing on Pakistan, offers insights into how economic growth can be balanced with environmental sustainability.

Environmental pollution is a major global challenge that can adversely affect ecosystems and human health. In developing countries, the lack of awareness and inadequate sustainable practices exacerbate pollution levels, making it imperative to identify long-term solutions. Here, education plays a crucial role in addressing this issue by raising environmental awareness, encouraging sustainable practices, and shaping policy reforms. Despite the importance of education in driving environmental change, the precise impact of education levels and expenditures on reducing pollution remains underexplored, especially in the ASEAN region. This paper addresses this issue by examining how education mitigates environmental pollution, focusing on both the level of education and expenditure on education. Using data from ten ASEAN countries covering the period from 1980 to 2022, this study employs three statistical methods—quantile regression (0.5), FMOLS, and Robust OLS—to analyze the relationship between education and CO2 emissions. The results consistently show a negative relationship between CO2 emissions and education, as measured by educational expenditure in primary, secondary, and tertiary education. These findings suggest that investing in education, regardless of the level, has a significant and direct impact on reducing CO2 emissions. By fostering a well-educated and environmentally aware population, ASEAN countries can achieve substantial reductions in CO2 emissions, contributing to global efforts to reduce environmental pollution.

Due to the limited availability of medical facilities and the urgency and irreplaceability of medical-seeking behaviors, the transportation processes used to access these resources inherently result in high carbon emissions. Unfortunately, pediatric medical facilities are among the least substitutable destinations, making it challenging to reduce travel-related CO2 emissions by traditional means such as decreasing travel frequency or optimizing transportation means. This study proposes enhancing the spatial allocation of pediatric medical facilities to effectively reduce travel-related CO2 emissions. This study selects 27 hospitals with pediatric departments in Tianjin as the research subject. It introduces a model for measuring travel-related CO2 emissions for pediatric medical-seeking, STIRPAT, and ridge regression models as well as conducts simulations under various scenarios to test the hypotheses. Therefore, methods for enhancing the spatial allocation of pediatric medical facilities are proposed. The results show that (1) travel-related CO2 emissions for pediatric medical-seeking are the highest in the city center, outpatient-related CO2 emissions surpass inpatient ones, and children’s hospital-related CO2 emissions are higher than those related to comprehensive hospitals, from which potential carbon reduction points can be explored; (2) children’s hospitals with multibranch and composite functional allocations can significantly reduce CO2 emissions; (3) comprehensive hospitals can further alleviate CO2 emissions from children’s hospitals by enhancing the medical level, transportation infrastructure, population distribution, and other spatial environmental factors; (4) from the perspective of low-carbon travel and equity, a spatial allocation strategy should be adopted for children’s hospitals that includes multiple branches and composite functions, while comprehensive hospitals should focus on service capacity, parity, supply–demand ratio, and the population density of children.

In the article, the state and dynamics of eco-innovation development in Ukraine and the European Union (EU) countries are examined, focusing on comparing the two regions. In the context of growing environmental challenges, such as climate change, eco-innovations are essential for achieving sustainable development, reducing CO2 emissions, and enhancing economic efficiency. The EU demonstrates a high level of research and development (R&D) investment and a transition to renewable energy sources. In Ukraine, there is a positive trend, although the pace of development is slower. The study conducts a regression analysis to determine the impact of R&D expenditures, the share of renewable energy, and CO2 emission levels on the eco-innovation index, confirming the significance of emission reduction as a key factor in stimulating ecological innovations. The results highlight the need to improve Ukraine’s state policy in the field of ecoinnovations, taking into account the European experience.

Abstract. During 2024, an intensive Δ14CO2 flask sampling campaign is being conducted at 12 stations across Europe as part of the CO2MVS Research on Supplementary Observations (CORSO) project. These Δ14CO2 samples, combined with CO2 atmospheric measurements, aim to improve fossil CO2 emission estimates across Europe through inverse modeling. In this study, we perform a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to assess the added value of this intensive campaign and explore different sampling strategies for optimizing fossil fuel emission estimates. The strategies focus on selecting samples for inversions based on their fossil CO2 and nuclear 14C composition. We evaluate three sampling approaches: (1) a base scenario using uniform sampling without specific selection criteria, comparing current methods with the addition of flask samples; (2) a strategy that selects samples with high fossil CO2 content; and (3) a combined approach that accounts for nuclear 14C contamination to reduce potential biases from nuclear facilities. Our results suggest that higher sampling density improves the accuracy of fossil CO2 estimates, especially during low-emission periods, such as summer. Increasing the number of samples reduces uncertainty, enhancing the robustness of inverse modeling outcomes. Selecting samples based on fossil CO2 contamination further refines the estimates, but the most significant uncertainty reduction occurs when nuclear contamination is also considered. This combined strategy effectively mitigates biases in regions with high nuclear activity, like France and the UK. These findings highlight the importance of increasing sampling frequency and strategically selecting samples to improve fossil fuel emission estimates across Europe.

BACKGROUND: Ammonia, as a carbon-free fuel, has attracted much attention from researchers in different countries and is considered one of the promising alternative fuels that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the fact that the properties of ammonia have been widely studied, the practical application of this type of fuel remains difficult. Additional research is needed to overcome problems, including low combustion rate, high emissions of nitrogen oxides and unburned ammonia. To stimulate the combustion process in the cylinder, it is possible to use hydrogen additive as an activator of the combustion of the ammonia-air mixture. This article is aimed at a computational study of the effect of replacing diesel fuel with ammonia on the characteristics and harmful emissions of an internal combustion engine. AIM: Computational study of the working process and harmful emissions from exhaust gases of a motor-tractor dual-fuel engine when operating on ammonia with the addition of hydrogen. METHODS: The object of the study was a modern automobile and tractor diesel engine YaMZ-53415. The calculations were carried out for the nominal operating mode of the engine. For three-dimensional modeling of the working process of a gas-diesel engine running on ammonia with the addition of hydrogen, the Ansys Forte software package was used, which was developed based on modern theoretical concepts of the physics of three-dimensional gas and liquid flows, fuel spray dynamics and combustion processes. RESULTS: Calculation of the working process of a dual-fuel engine running on ammonia with different ignition doses of diesel fuel showed that when the dose of diesel fuel is reduced from 100% to 5%, the engine power and efficiency are maintained, the maximum pressure in the cylinder is reduced by 26%, nitrogen oxide emissions and the amount of unburned ammonia increase. Calculation of the working process of a dual-fuel engine running on ammonia with hydrogen additive allowed us to determine the minimum hydrogen additive that ensures complete combustion of ammonia. CONCLUSIONS: Running a dual-fuel engine on ammonia results in a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, more than an order of magnitude, i.e. ammonia can become an alternative to hydrocarbon fuel to achieve carbon neutrality. The use of a small hydrogen additive — 0.4% allows to significantly increase the combustion rate of the ammonia-air mixture and ensures almost complete combustion of ammonia. Nitrogen oxide emissions when replacing diesel fuel with ammonia increase more than twice. To reduce them, it is necessary to use known methods - exhaust gas recirculation, SCR-neutralizer.

This paper presents a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of heat-integrated stripper (HIS) application in chemical absorption processes for CO2 capture, drawing insights from pilot plant studies and simulation analyses. Escalating concerns over carbon emissions prompts a growing interest in amine-based chemical absorption, a proven and promising technology not only for the power industry but also for sectors with hard-to-abate emissions, such as cement, metallurgy, refining, and fertilizer production. Additionally, it supports the capture of CO2 from biogenic carbon sources (BECCS).The HIS, integrating heat exchangers within the stripper offers a potential solution to alleviate energy demands. Pilot tests at TAURON Power Plants, using a mobile plant with a 1 TPD CO2 capture capacity, validated a 7% reduction in reboiler heat duty with HIS. Simulation analyses corroborated experimental findings, providing insights into gas-liquid phase behavior and desorption efficiency across the stripper.The economic evaluation revealed a 1.3% increase in initial capital costs, offset by 3.2% operational savings, suggesting a payback period of less than two years. By enhancing CO2 capture efficiency and reducing energy demand, HIS integration offers a practical pathway toward improving the sustainability and economic viability of carbon capture technologies, supporting the global transition to a net-zero energy future.

Abstract BACKGROUND This study focuses on the treatment of brewery waste slurries (BWS) with high chemical oxygen demand (COD) using a single‐chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC) inoculated with heat‐treated anaerobic seed sludge. A co‐substrate of 5 g L −1 glycerol was added, and carbon felt ( CF ) was employed as the anode material, enhanced through in situ polymerization of aniline (PANI/ CF ). Additionally, the adsorption of ruthenium dioxide nanoparticles onto the modified CF was assessed (PANI‐RO/ CF ). RESULTS Tests conducted at room temperature (19 °C to 22 °C) achieved an average COD reduction of 36%. The PANI‐RO/ CF electrode accumulated 24% more charge, resulting in the highest coulombic efficiency of 75.1%, significantly exceeding similar studies. However, the PANI‐modified anode generated more energy, exceeding that of the bare CF by more than double, reaching 57.1 mW m −2 . An optimized working volume was identified in relation to other reported works. Microbial population analysis revealed an interaction between Staphylococcus epidermidis and a rarely reported psychrophilic Bacillus species. After 30 h, lactic acid emerged as the main by‐product, with a concentration of 7.5 ± 0.6 g L −1 . CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight an optimization approach based on cell configuration and inoculum selection, as well as a significant valorization pathway that is frequently overlooked in the existing literature on brewery wastewater treatment using MFCs, particularly regarding the attractiveness of lactic acid production. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic analysis of wood pellet production and utilisation in gasification combined heat and power (CHP) systems, focusing on optimising the drying process and evaluating the impacts of varying plant scales. In line with Japan’s target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the research examines primary energy demand (PED), CO2 emissions, and financial viability across the wood pellet production (gate-to-gate) and CHP energy generation (gate-to-grave) stages. The results reveal that the drying process accounts for 35–39% of the total energy consumption in wood pellet production, with the heat source significantly influencing PED and CO2 emissions. Systems employing wood-fired boilers and wood pellet CHP for drying achieve reductions in PED by 12–26% and CO2 emissions by 14–31% compared to the conventional grid-supplied drying process. Economic analysis reveals that scaling up production enhances financial performance, with net income increasing by up to 20% and payback periods reducing to approximately 10 years in facilities producing 2.5 tons of wood pellets per hour. These findings highlight the critical role of optimised drying processes, plant scalability, and efficient supply chains in advancing sustainable wood pellet-based bioenergy systems that support Japan’s renewable energy targets.

The article considers the prospects for the development of hydrogen energy, in particular, the application of hydrogen production technology based on water splitting using the latest electrolysis technologies. Particular attention is paid to the innovative methodology proposed by the Israeli company H2Pro, which promises a significant reduction in the cost of "green" hydrogen by 2030 to the level of less than $1 per kilogram. This reduction in hydrogen prices by 60-80% will make it more competitive in the energy market, which can lead to widespread adoption of hydrogen technologies in various sectors of the economy. The technology developed by H2Pro uses the E-TAC (Electrochemical Thermally Activated Chemical Water Splitting) method, which consists of a two-step process for the production of hydrogen and oxygen. The first stage involves cold electrochemical splitting of water, which generates hydrogen and oxidizes the anode, while the second stage, thermally activated, regenerates the anode by releasing oxygen, without the need for additional electricity consumption. This technology makes it possible to reduce energy costs and increase the efficiency of the process, reaching an efficiency of 95%, which is a significant achievement in the field of hydrogen energy. The author of the article also draws attention to the importance of this achievement for the global transition to renewable energy sources. In particular, reducing the cost of hydrogen production with the help of such technologies can provide cheaper energy production than traditional energy carriers such as gasoline and diesel, and also become a key factor in the implementation of ambitious environmental initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to technological innovation, the article also discusses the need for infrastructure development for the storage, transportation and use of hydrogen, which remains one of the main barriers to its large-scale use. However, thanks to the efforts of companies such as H2Pro, which are actively working on improving production processes and reducing costs, hydrogen energy has a great chance of becoming an integral part of the energy system of the future. Thus, the development of hydrogen energy technologies, such as E-TAC, is an important step on the way to ensuring a clean and sustainable energy supply, which will contribute to reducing the environmental impact and ensuring the sustainable development of the world economy in the face of global climate change.

This paper investigates the integration of heat pumps for heating boiler feedwater and evaluates the impacts of feedwater temperature and condensate recovery rates on fuel consumption, energy efficiency, and CO2 emissions. The results show that using heat pumps significantly reduces boiler fuel consumption, especially when the feedwater temperature increases and the condensate recovery rate is high. The COP (Coefficient of Performance) of the heat pump gradually decreases as the water temperature rises; however, heating the water at lower temperatures yields better economic and energy efficiency. Economically, heat pumps provide substantial benefits, with maximum cost savings achieved at a water temperature of 75°C. Additionally, integrating heat pumps reduces CO2 emissions, particularly in boilers without condensate recovery, with the highest emission reduction reaching 17.8 kgCO2 per ton of steam. These findings demonstrate that using heat pumps is not only energy-efficient and cost-effective but also contributes to environmental protection by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Power plants are one of the main sources emitting the CO2 that is responsible for climate change consequences. Post-combustion carbon capture (PCC), particularly using an aqueous solution, is highly recommended to be used as a mitigation solution to reduce the emissions of CO2 from power plants. Although PCC is a promising solution, the process still needs further development to reduce the energy demand for solvent regeneration. This paper reviews the challenges related to the post-combustion processes and finds the correlations between selected variables addressed by several researchers. Moreover, this study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the reduction in energy demand and efficiency penalties. The research findings highlight the importance of considering two key drivers during the design of the PCC process. These are the absorber temperature and the type and amount of the selected solvent. Indeed, statistical analyses show that there is a correlation between the identified drivers’ values and the energy demand of solvent regeneration.

This study applied a life cycle assessment (LCA) and SimaPro software to calculate the carbon footprint of ecological plastic film in Qingcheng Town. The results indicate that the carbon reduction efficiency of ecological plastic film compared to 0.01 mm PE film ranged from 30.8% to 40.0%, without accounting for the substitution of humus for chemical fertilizers. When humus substitution was considered, the range increased to 70.2% to 74.2%. Ecological plastic film achieved the greatest emission reduction in the final treatment stage, accounting for 54.1% of total CO2 reduction, followed by the production stage at 44.8%, while the transportation phase contributed only 1.1%. Projecting to 2030, if half of the cultivated land in Shanxi Province uses ecological plastic film instead of 0.01 mm PE film, a 19.7% reduction in carbon emissions is expected. Full coverage with ecological plastic film could raise this to 39.4%. To encourage its adoption, the study suggests that the government offers financial subsidies to enterprises or farmers, promotes agricultural carbon taxes, or supports carbon trading. With a carbon price or tax exceeding 67.1 CNY/t, ecological plastic film achieves cost parity with 0.01 mm PE plastic film.

Horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HFCWs) are capable of eliminating organic matter and nitrogen while emitting less methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) than free water surface flow wetlands. However, the simultaneous removal of pollutants and reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from high-strength wastewater containing high levels of organic matter and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) has not get been investigated. The influent COD concentration affected the efficiency of nitrogen removal, GHG emissions and the presence of iron from iron ore, but the COD and TP removal efficiencies remained unaffected. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were significantly influenced by influent COD concentrations, whereas less N2O emissions were obtained during 7d. The highest CO2 and CH4 fluxes, along with the GHG emissions, were observed in HFCWs with COD concentrations of 375.6 mg/L and NH4+-N concentrations of 159.0 mg/L at a COD/N ratio of 2.4. Conversely, the lowest CH4 (–1.72 mg/m2/h) and N2O fluxes (0.13 mg/m2/h) were recorded in HFCWs with COD concentrations of 375.6 mg/L and NH4+-N concentrations of 162.4 mg/L at a COD/N of 4.5, although nitrogen removal was weak in these HFCWs. HFCWs at a COD/N ratio of 3.6 exhibited greater removal of nitrogen and other pollutants, along with a lower global warming potential (GWP). In conclusion, the concentrations of organic matter and NH4+-N in wastewater affected both pollutant removal and GHG emissions. The simultaneous enhancement of pollutant removal and the reduction of GHG emissions can be achieved in HFCWs with a COD/N ratio of 3.6.

Shale oil, a critical unconventional energy resource, has received substantial attention in recent years. However, systematic research on developing shale oil using mixed gases remains limited, and the effects of various gas compositions on crude oil and rock properties, along with their potential for enhanced oil recovery, are not yet fully understood. This study utilizes PVT analysis, SEM, and core flooding tests with various gas mixtures to elucidate the interaction mechanisms among crude oil, gas, and rock, as well as the recovery efficiency of different gas types. The results indicate that increasing the mole fraction of CH4 substantially raises the oil saturation pressure, up to 1.5 times its initial value. Pure CO2, by contrast, exhibits the lowest saturation pressure, rendering it suitable for long-term pressurization strategies. CO2 shows exceptional efficacy in reducing interfacial tension, though the viscosity reduction effects of different gases exhibit minimal variation. Furthermore, CO2 markedly modifies the pore structure of shale through dissolution, increasing porosity by 2% and enhancing permeability by 61.63%. In both matrix and fractured cores, the recovery rates achieved with mixed gases were 36.9% and 58.6%, respectively, demonstrating improved production compared to single-component gases. This research offers a theoretical foundation and novel insights into shale oil development.

This article analyses how energy sufficiency can be applied in tourism destinations. It begins by highlighting the importance of decarbonizing tourism for climate action, given the sector’s high CO2 emissions. Energy sufficiency, a key pillar of the energy transition, is defined as the voluntary reduction in energy demand within climate and CO2 emission constraints. The study investigates how stakeholders interpret and frame this concept, by focusing on strategies that align with the public image of the resort to reduce its energy requirements. The methodology includes semi-structured interviews with key players in Verbier—Val de Bagnes, focus groups with cooperation partners, participant observations at local meetings and events, and analysis of local documentation. Research was undertaken using living lab methods. The results reveal five main categories and eleven subcategories in which local stakeholders frame sufficiency, including oppositional framings, off-framings, selective framings, institutional framings, and disempowering framings. The article concludes with recommendations to reframe sufficiency in order to align with the destination’s strategy and representations. While energy sufficiency is often overshadowed by narratives of economic growth, technological innovation, and material abundance, it appears crucial to reframe these narratives and integrate post-growth strategies that prioritize sustainability in tourism planning.

The study on modifying catalytic properties by partially substituting nickel with ruthenium on the perovskite precursor CeNiO3 has been conducted in this work. Catalysts were synthesized using a coprecipitation method, and their physicochemical properties were evaluated through analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) and XRD were employed to assess the carbon deposition and coke type on the catalyst after 100 h TOS. All ruthenium-modified CeNi1–xRuxO3 (x = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10) catalysts showed good activity with CH4 and CO2 conversion rates exceeding 90% at 700 °C. Ru modification facilitated the incorporation of Ni and Ru into the ceria lattice, resulting in the formation of Ru–O–Ce and Ni–O–Ce bonds, which significantly enhanced the catalyst's sintering resistance and Ni reducibility. Moreover, the Ru-modified catalyst exhibited a considerable increase in specific surface area, reduced Ni crystallite size, emergence of highly active basic sites, and an increase in oxygen vacancies. However, excessively loading Ru lowers the Ni dispersion, resulting in metal agglomeration and decreased catalytic activity. The optimal substitution ratio of Ru was determined to be 0.05. Catalyst CeNi0.95Ru0.05O3 showed the highest BRM activity with conversion of both CH4 and CO2 of approximately 95% at 700 °C, compared to 88 and 90%, respectively, for CeNiO3 catalysts. The CeNi0.95Ru0.05O3 catalyst maintained good stability after 100 h of reaction with a 3 times lower coke accumulation rate compared to bare CeNiO3 perovskite. Thus, partially substituting Ru into the perovskite structure of CeNiO3 emerges as an effective strategy to improve the activity, durability, coke resistance, and sintering of the Ni catalyst in methane reforming reactions.

This chapter explores the environmental benefits and social challenges for the city of Dubai's public transport network electrification plan. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai is currently experimenting with the possibility of powering public buses with electric energy. The shift from fossil fuels to electric power has been experienced in many European cities with evidence of benefits for both the environment and citizens. The enhancement of public transport and the use of 'CO2-free' energy has made people less dependent on cars, reducing the amount of air pollution and easing traffic congestion on the roads. Air quality also improved significantly with direct and indirect results on people's health and life quality. In the pledge for a reduction of CO2 emissions, the coverage of the entire territory of Dubai with an interconnected transport system, fuelled by electric power, is an achievement to pursue. The authors show evidence of this statement using data collected from a number of European experiences. To simulate the feasibility of a similar model in Dubai, the authors consider different contextual situations, such as climatic variation, urban forms, and social and cultural characteristics of users, enhancing the specificities of present technological research in alternative energy sources. Electrified and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles are analysed and their potential and limitations explained based on data and tests conducted in Europe.

In this study, an ion monitoring system using ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) was developed to maintain nutrient solutions in closed-loop hydroponic systems within plant factories. Based on this monitoring system, an algorithm and individual ion supplementation system were developed to calculate the optimal amounts of ion replenishment for crop growth. The developed algorithms adopt distinct cost functions to achieve their respective goals. The ion balance-prioritized algorithm minimizes the cost function, which is defined as the sum of the squared differences between the target ion concentrations and the calculated ion concentrations. In contrast, the carbon emission reduction algorithm minimizes the cost function defined as the total carbon emissions, which are calculated by multiplying the individual salt supplementation amounts by their respective carbon emission coefficients. Simulation results demonstrated that the ion balance-prioritized algorithm achieved average errors of 5.5 ± 5.5%, 0.4 ± 0.5%, and 5.0 ± 11.2% for Ca, NO3, and K, respectively, showing superior performance in maintaining ion balance. Meanwhile, the carbon emission reduction algorithm achieved a total of 0.064 kg CO2, representing a 50.19% reduction compared to the ion balance-prioritized type. The developed algorithms and system are expected to reduce costs by minimizing nutrient and water usage through the recycling of waste nutrient solutions. Furthermore, they are anticipated to improve crop productivity by maintaining an optimal ion composition and to contribute to sustainable agriculture through carbon emission reduction.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is considered as one of the promising technologies because of the selective synthesis of fuels including methanol, methane, and ethylene. Particularly, Copper (Cu) has garnered huge interest as a CO2RR catalyst among other metal element due to its unique binding energy with reactive intermediates. In this study, the intricate connection between surface oxidation state, superficial transformation, and catalytic efficiency is investigated, with a focus on oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu) and Cu-based MOFs (Cu-MOFs) catalysts in particular. To enhance the understanding of their oxidation state, a novel microwave-assisted synthesis method for generating OD-Cu nanosheet is introduced. This method allows precise manipulation of the oxidation sta...[ Read more ]

Manufacturing is a crucial driver of economic growth, contributing approximately 17% to global GDP. This research investigates the impact of digitalization on manufacturing firms' competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and social inclusiveness, using Canon Inc.’s operations globally as a case study. Existing literature underscores the transformative potential of digital economics in the manufacturing industry; however, a comprehensive exploration of its impact on sustainability remains to be explored in detail. Employing a mixed-methods approach and Systems Theory as a theoretical framework, data was gathered from Canon's sustainability reports, financial statements, and online sources, focusing on the years 1997 to 2018. The study analyzes the implementation of digital technologies and their effects on profitability and sustainability outcomes. The research results indicate positive results with sustainable firms able to beat the competition in the long-run, as demonstrated by Canon’s revenue of approximately $36 billion in 2018 alongside significant reductions in CO2 emissions by 435,000 tonnes and a reduction in raw material usage by 314,000 tonnes. Additionally, Canon’s social initiatives, such as the Miraisha Programme, underscore its commitment to inclusivity. This study highlights the multifaceted benefits of integrating digital technologies in manufacturing, offering insights for firms aiming to balance profitability with sustainability.

Thailand has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, targeting the power generation sector, which contributes 35% of the country’s CO2 emissions, as a critical area for intervention. This study explores the transition toward carbon neutrality in power generation, focusing on fossil-fuel-based plants, particularly lignite and natural gas, which remain central to Thailand’s electricity production. A key strategy adopted by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is “Sink Co-creation”, which includes the deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies in existing and future lignite power plants, leveraging favorable storage conditions. Additionally, natural gas power plants exhibit significant CCS potential through source–sink matching mechanisms. This study finds that the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from fossil-fuel-based power plants could reach 17.07 MtCO2. Of this total, lignite power plants are projected to achieve a reduction of 3.79 MtCO2 by 2036, while natural gas power plants are expected to contribute an additional 13.28 MtCO2 in reductions by 2050. However, the realization of these reductions faces significant challenges, including the high costs associated with CCS implementation and limited investor interest, underscoring the critical need for sustained government support and policy incentives to facilitate progress toward carbon neutrality.

Environmental pollution and the gradual depletion of fossil fuels have recently shifted the focus to alternate fuels. Hence, more diversified research on alternate fuels is necessary to deal with the global energy crisis. Biogas extracted from biomass is an excellent alternative to fossil fuels due to its low cost and good mixing ability. It is mainly generated by anaerobic digestion of organic waste products in a digester tank. The present paper investigates the performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine in dual fuel mode with biogas as main fuel and diesel as pilot fuel without any engine modification. The main aspect of the paper is to critically study the effect of supplementation of biogas on diesel engine efficiency and emission level of important constituent gases such as CO2 and NOX. Our findings demonstrate that the essential performance result of engine, such as Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) and Mechanical Efficiency for the biogas-air mixture of 20% (DB20), was slightly decreased. At the same time, there was a reduction in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) compared to pure diesel. Furthermore, the exhaust emission of NOX and CO2 was lowered when the engine was operated in dual fuel induction mode. The results of engine performance were found to be better than the results of other researchers for engines of same specifications and operating conditions. Hence, biogas serves as a viable alternative fuel and contributes to cleaner combustion, offering a promising solution for reducing the environmental impact of diesel engines. The study provides critical insights into optimizing dual fuel systems for enhanced performance and sustainability.

The high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses distinctive thermal stability and electronic characteristics, which exhibits substantial potential for diverse applications in electrocatalytic reactions. However, accurately controlling the size of HEA still remains a challenge, especially for the ultrasmall HEA nanoparticles. Herein, we firstly calculate and illustrate the size impact on the electronic structure of HEA and the adsorption energies of crucial intermediates in typical electrocatalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) and NO3– electroreduction (NO3RR). Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, we synthesize a range of ultrasmall PtRuPdCoNi HEA nanoparticles with adjustable sizes (1.7, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9 nm) using a one‐step spatially confined approach. Specifically, HEA nanoparticles with 1.7 nm size (HEA‐1.7) endows a 16 mV overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm−2, yielding a mass activity of 31.9 A mgNM‐1 of noble metal in HER, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy can also be easily applicable to other reduction reactions attributed to the richness of metal components and size adjustability, presenting a promising platform for various electrocatalytic applications as advanced catalysts.

Solar energy is an important energy sector that plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse emission in different industrial sectors, including the leather sector, to control the pollution. Stringent environmental regulations of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in Indian tanneries are implemented as directed by regulatory authorities. The ZLD system resulted in the generation of saline rejected from membrane systems being evaporated by spending considerable energy. In this paper, the potential of solar energyfor evaporation of reject from ZLD in a closed accelerated solar dryer has been investigated. In this study, the evaporation of reject/ saline water using a solar dryer with different volumes has been experimented and the volume reduction and increase in Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are monitored during the drying period. It is evident that the closed accelerated solar dryer has shown an increase in evaporation rate with reduction in the volume of water in a given area. The outcome of this study would lead to avoidance of mechanical evaporators in case of smaller capacity ZLD plants and also reduce the amount of water to be evaporated in the Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) in case of larger ZLD plants. By the application of the accelerated solar dryer for the evaporator, the potential CO2 emission reduction due to replacement of different fuels used for evaporation of reject has been estimated to reduce the carbon footprint and to ensure the sustainability of the leather industry.

The fresh air unit (FAU) is one of control measures for reducing PM2.5 exposure for children in classrooms. Considering the fluctuations of ambient PM2.5 and varying classroom activities, traditional monitoring methods may be impractical for assessing long-term indoor PM2.5 levels. A well-mixed room modeling approach may offer a solution if the indoor PM2.5 generation rate (G) and non-ventilation removal rate (K) can be determined. This study develops a technique for quantifying both the G and K for classrooms equipped with FAUs. A typical elementary school classroom, installed with two FAUs and four electric fans, was selected to simultaneously monitor PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations both inside and outside the classroom. Significant reductions in indoor PM2.5 concentrations were observed. Although indoor CO2 levels exceeded outdoor levels, it remained well below the WHO's recommended limit. The first-order Runge-Kutta method and an iterative approach were adopted for determining G and K. The present study yielded G (GM (GSD)) as 10.7(2.1) and 19.2(1.2) µg/min respectively for lecture sessions and noon rest periods, and K consistently as 0. No significant differences were found between measured and predicted PM2.5 levels further supporting the appropriateness of the developed approach for quantifying PM2.5 concentrations in classrooms equipped with FAUs.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an efficient and novel strategy to reduce the amount of this greenhouse-effect pollutant gas in the atmosphere while synthesizing value-added products, all of it with an easy synergy with intermittent renewable energies. This study investigates the influence of different ways of combining electrodeposited Cu and Sn as metallic elements in the electrocatalyst. From there, the use of Sn alone or with a small amount of Cu beneath is investigated, and finally, the best catalyst obtained, which has Sn over a slight Cu layer, is evaluated in consecutive cycles to make an initial exploration of the catalyst durability. As a result of this work, after optimization of the Sn and Cu-based catalysts, it is possible to obtain more than 60% of the organic products of interest, predominantly CO, the main component of syngas. Finally, this great amount of CO is obtained under low cell potential (below 3 V), which is a remarkable result in terms of the cost of the process.

Koharticle FundamentalsShimada et al. (2) measured the electrical conductivities and electrical relaxation times of tetra-n-butylammonium (TBA) chloride and fluoride semiclathrate hydrates, which were compared to those of the TBA–bromide semiclathrate hydrate. Maruyama et al. (3) presents a novel approach of tritium separation from contaminated water of a typical nuclear power plant; the manuscript presents experimental data on the utility of a deuterium oxide (D2O)-based clathrate hydrate for this separation. Deunas et al. (4) presents molecular dynamics simulations to understand the behavior of methane hydrate dissociation upon temperature annealing. Han et al. (5) presents a paper on CO2 sequestration under the sea bed; the manuscript presents CO2 hydrate growth this in montmorillonite clay, with the effects of the water content, pressure, and clay content on CO2 storage investigated. Li et al. (6) presents a novel mix of kinetic promoters to enhance CO2 hydrate nucleation and growth. Coupling magnesium (Mg) with amino acid l-leucine (l-Leu) worked as a robust kinetic promoter, which could be very relevant for CO2 sequestration as hydrates. Energy ProductionNatural gas hydrates (NGHs) have garnered increasing attention as a potential future energy unconventional source due to the presence of large volumes of methane gas. A numerical model based on trial data from the South China Sea NGH project indicates that boosting well spacing and the number of wells in multicluster patterns improves productivity. (7)In a study using data from the W17 deposit in the South China Sea, Liu et al. (8) demonstrated that gas production rates are affected by the well location. Wells positioned at the top of the free gas layer (FGL) initially yield the highest production rates, but later stages benefit from improved rates in wells located in the lower middle section of the hydrate-bearing layer (HBL). Zhao et al. (9) examined the impact of constant-pressure overlying water on hydrate formation and dissociation, finding that water erosion significantly accelerates both the formation rate and the decomposition of hydrates.Choudhary et al. (10) used reservoir simulations and the Monte Carlo method to show that uncertainties in reservoir porosity have a substantial impact on gas recovery, while uncertainties in hydrate saturation have minimal effects. Rui et al. (11) designed a new microfluidic chip to investigate methane hydrate formation and decomposition mechanisms, focusing on hydrate phase transition and reformation. The results revealed different methane hydrate growth patterns and their connection to hydrate occurrence in sediments, providing insights into gas production. Cheng et al. (12) applied a thermo–hydro–chemical model and found that higher depressurization rates lead to increased gas production and greater fluctuations in the production rate, initially driven by flow dynamics and sensible heat and later by ambient heat transfer. Seo et al. (13) analyzed gas hydrate dissociation and production through X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, revealing that thermal stimulation enhances gas production rates significantly, while a low and constant depressurization rate helps maintain sediment stability.Zhao et al. (14) also showed that the subsidence of natural gas hydrate reservoirs during depressurization is primarily governed by pore pressure reduction and hydrate dissociation. Tamaki et al. (15) developed a three-dimensional (3D) geological model for the B1 sand gas hydrate reservoir in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, integrating seismic, well log, and core data. Their results revealed higher gas hydrate saturation in the upper layers and in areas with higher acoustic impedance, which affects permeability and production behavior, aiding in pre-assessment efforts.Moridis et al. (16) focused on numerical simulation strategies for a long-term depressurization test at the Hydrate-01 Stratigraphic Test Well in the B1 sand reservoir, concluding that optimal performance is achieved with a 10 m long well and a three-step depressurization scheme. Huang et al. (17) developed a dynamic composite sensible heat calculation method, showing that composite sensible heat increases with burial depth, enhancing gas production. Their work suggests prioritizing shallow to moderately buried reservoirs for optimized production performance. Wang et al. (18) presented a novel apparatus to measure the relative permeability of nitrogen gas (N2) and water in tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate-bearing Berea sandstone core samples. You et al. (19) report that pressure cores from the Gulf of Mexico showed degradation over 5 years, driven by methane diffusion and hydrate dissolution. SimulationGuo et al. (20) presented a simulation on depressurization-assisted CO2 replacement for simultaneous methane recovery and CO2 sequestration; in this study, they optimize the process and identify the sequence between replacement and depressurization for global hydrate exploitation. Kim and Yoon (21) discuss the importance of numerical modeling for a hysteretic behavior in multiphase flow. The authors present an algorithm based on elastoplastic return mapping, which is a numerically stable simulation of the intrinsic capillary hysteresis relevant for CO2 sequestration under the sea bed as gas hydrates. ApplicationsHan et al. (22) presents the formation of non-combustible pentafluoroethane gas hydrate and its application as a fire suppression agent for class-B-type fires induced by liquid substances. Real-time experiments, simulating small pool and pool fire incidents, were conducted, and performance of this hydrate-based fire retardant was benchmarked against well-known fire retardants, such as ammonium phosphate, etc. Dhamu et al. (23) evaluates CO2 hydrate formation in seawater in the presence of a mixed promoter "l-tryptophan and 1,3-dioxane"; this dual promotional effect additive was used to enhance the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrate growth. Raman spectroscopy was also used to probe the real-time CO2 dissolution in seawater in the presence and absence of this additive mixture. Prasad et al. (24) uses a simulated flue gas mixture (N2–CO2) as a direct flue gas injection (DFI) for simultaneous methane recovery and CO2 sequestration into natural-gas-hydrate-bearing sediments. This study employed a class 3 hydrate reservoir system mimicking a reservoir having a single hydrate-bearing layer with no underlying mobile fluid zone. Flow AssuranceThe formation of hydrates, which leads to the blockage of oil and gas production equipment and pipelines, remains a persistent challenge in the energy industry. This issue is particularly prevalent in long-distance, multiphase flow pipelines operating in low-temperature environments, such as deepwater and extremely cold regions. Sakurai et al. (25) studied the pressure drop and rheological behavior of methane hydrate slurries in water-dominant systems, showing that the pressure drop increases when hydrate volume fractions exceed 14%. This increase is influenced by the transition between turbulent and laminar flow. Their results indicated that, at lower hydrate fractions, aggregation of hydrates fills the entire pipe space, and the Bingham plastic model effectively described slurry behavior up to 19% hydrate volume.Liu et al. (26) developed a 3D hydraulic–thermal–chemical coupling model to predict the flow and heat transfer characteristics of hydrate slurries in horizontal pipes, incorporating temperature effects on particle evolution and flow behavior. Branco et al. (27) proposed a numerical methodology for predicting the dynamics of hydrate plug displacement under transient two-phase flow conditions. Their work highlighted the role of liquid slug accumulation and energy storage in insulating layers, showing that, while the liquid slug had little impact, energy storage significantly affected the temperature distribution and plug displacement velocity, which varied considerably depending upon operational conditions.Li et al. (28) explored the synergistic effects of thermodynamic inhibitors [methanol (MeOH) and monoethylene glycol (MEG)] and a kinetic hydrate inhibitor [poly(ethylene oxide-co-vinylpyrrolidone) (PEO-co-VP)], demonstrating that both thermodynamic inhibitors enhance the efficacy of PEO-co-VP, with MEG proving more effective than MeOH. The study concluded that combining high concentrations of MEG and PEO-co-VP can completely inhibit gas hydrate formation and broaden the effective subcooling range for kinetic inhibitors. Kannan et al. (29) developed a two-step mechanistic model to predict the dissociation time of gas hydrate plugs, integrating field data and thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor (THI) injection. Their model focused on heat and mass transfer changes across the plug and identified axial convection as the primary mechanism for plug dissociation in horizontal pipes. This model helps define safe operating conditions and protocols for hydrate plug remediation in deepwater production operations.This SI is part of the series of SIs on Recent Advances in Selected Energy Research Areas, launched by Energy & Fuels in January 2021.

The electrochemical reduction reaction (RR) of CO to high value multicarbon products is highly desirable for carbon utilization. Dual transition metal atoms dispersed by N-doped graphene are able to be highly efficient catalysts for this process due to the synergy of the bimetallic sites for C–C coupling. In this work, we screened homonuclear dual-atom catalysts dispersed by N-doped graphene to investigate the potential in CO reduction to C2+ products by employing density functional theory calculations. We have demonstrated that the two adsorbed CO species on bimetallic sites cannot directly couple unless one of the CO molecules is hydrogenated. All the dual metal atom catalysts prefer a similar coupling mechanism, i.e., the asymmetric coupling of *CO on the bridged site and *CHO on the top site, while the Ni2 and Cu2 catalysts exhibit much better performance with moderate adsorption energies and low energy barriers. The enhanced activities are attributed to the decrease of the energy levels of *CO 2p states that weakens the metal–C bonding and thus facilitates the feasible C–C coupling with both low reaction energies and low barriers. These insights have revealed the significant role of the hydrogenation of CO species prior to the coupling step and may provide a theoretical perspective to understand the generation of C2+ products in the CO2/CORR.

The issue of climate change is a global concern, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Indonesia, under the Paris Agreement, has set targets to reduce emissions by 29% independently and 41% with international support by 2030. At the local level, Palembang faces challenges in waste management, contributing to methane emissions, a GHG with 28 times the global warming potential of CO2. Although waste is not the largest source of emissions, Palembang, with over 1.6 million residents, must address this issue. This study analyzes GHG emission projections in Palembang’s waste management sector under different scenarios and offers policy recommendations for local authorities. Using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model, along with primary and secondary data, the results suggest that the most effective scenario for reducing emissions is a zero-landfill approach with full implementation of the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) concept. Projections show that this scenario could reduce emissions by 64% by 2030 and 71% by 2045 compared to the baseline. Prioritizing waste management with the 3R concept and waste sorting at the source is essential to meet emission reduction goals. This paper also recommends integrating waste reduction targets into regional planning and assessing financial capacity to support thermal waste treatment technology as a sustainable urban waste management solution.

Due to the significant amount of solid waste generated annually in China, the rational use of these wastes has become increasingly important. The production of foam ceramics is considered an effective method for the large-scale utilization of such solid waste. In this study, granite sawing mud was selected as the raw material, with SiC and MnO2 serving as foaming agent to prepare foam ceramics. The foaming behavior of sintered samples using different foaming agent was investigated to determine the most suitable type and amount of foaming agent for obtaining foam ceramics with excellent pore structures. Additionally, the effects of the foaming agent on the pore structure and physical mechanical properties of the foam ceramics were studied in detail. The results showed that SiC and MnO2 both resulted in the pronounced expansion to different extent, and increasing the content of foaming agent enhances foam expansion. The best dosage of SiC was 1%, the optimum additive amount of MnO2 is 2–3%. For SiC, the oxidation reduction reaction occurred between SiC and O2 to generate CO2/CO. For MnO2, firstly, the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3 occurred, and then the Mn2O3 dissolved in the glass melt and, subsequently, Mn3+ was reduced to Mn2+, leading to gas formation and foaming. Under the same dosage of foaming agent and preparation conditions, the sample prepared with SiC as the blowing agent has higher compressive strength, lower water absorption, and a more uniform pore structure.

Ligand-protected copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) with atomic precision have emerged rapidly due to their fascinating structural architectures and versatile catalytic properties, making them ideal for investigating structure–activity relationships. Despite their potential, challenges such as stability issues and limited structural diversity have restricted deeper exploration. In this study, three distinct Cu NCs were synthesized using a one-pot reduction strategy by carefully modifying reaction conditions. Intriguingly, the same p-toluenethiol ligand produced two different geometries, while varying ligand with m-aminobenzethiol—yielded clusters with similar geometric architectures. These NCs were evaluated for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, uncovering diverse catalytic activities and product selectivity. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the interplay between the core structure confinement and surface ligand environment governs their catalytic behavior. Specifically, the Cu11 NC with p-toluenethiol ligand exhibited selectivity toward HCOOH production (FEHCOOH~45% at -1.2 V vs. RHE), whereas substituting p-toluenethiol with m-aminobenzethiol shifted the selectivity to the competitive side reaction (FEH2~82% at -1.2 V vs. RHE). Conversely, altering the geometry of Cu18 NC while retaining the p-toluenethiol ligand decreased such selectivity (FEHCOOH~35% at -1.2 V vs. RHE). These findings highlight the tunability of Cu NCs for tailored catalytic applications through precise control of their structure and surface chemistry.

The energy transition currently defines the economic development of all market sectors, driven by technological progress and increasing environmental awareness. The requirements of a sustainable economy and green energy are evolving dynamically to address environmental challenges, emphasizing the reduction of CO2 emissions as well as energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. It is essential to study consumer attitudes toward products manufactured using green energy, including FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) products. The aim of this article is to examine the impact of the energy transformation, and consequently rising energy costs, on the decision-making process of consumers of FMCG products produced in accordance with the principles of sustainable development (including green energy). It explores the factors influencing their purchasing decisions and the role that generation plays in this process. Understanding how different generations respond to the energy aspects of economic functioning is crucial for the future development of the energy sector and the implementation of sustainable economic models. Therefore, it is essential to conduct research that demonstrates the extent of the influence of increasing consumer awareness of energy transformation within the framework of sustainable development.

Climate change and water scarcity are two global challenges. Coal mining is the main source of carbon emissions. The utilization of mine water resources and its carbon footprint calculation are of paramount significance in promoting water conservation and carbon reduction in mining areas. However, research on the carbon footprint and other environmental indicators across the life cycle of mine water in developing countries, such as China, remains limited. This study focuses on a representative mine water resource utilization system in China and describes the method used to calculate carbon emissions associated with mine water resource utilization throughout its life cycle. Based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and using on-site investigations and analysis of environmental indicators, the study evaluates the environmental impacts at different stages of mine water resource utilization, identifies key processes, and provides some improvement suggestions. The research results indicate that the life cycle carbon emissions of mine water amount to 2.35 kg CO2 eq per 1 m3. The water extraction stage highlights the potential environmental impact, including water use (WU) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). By substituting traditional power generation methods and incorporating intelligent dosing equipment to optimize chemical usage, the global warming potential (GWP) has been decreased by over 90%, and the GWP of chemical consumption has also witnessed respective reductions of 21.5% and 10.1%. This study can serve as a basis for calculating carbon emissions in mining areas and formulating strategies to reduce their environmental impact.

The buildings sector's energy demand and CO2 emissions are rising despite various energy standards and carbon disclosure initiatives. Drawing from the author's experience as the former buildings sector lead at the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), this paper investigates the suitability of the initiative's methodology and workflow for decarbonizing the sector. The paper demonstrates the incompatibility of current emissions accounting principles with the buildings sector and how this allowed companies to 'artificially' achieve emissions-reduction targets without tangibly improving the environmental performance of buildings. Given the sector's limited share of renewable energy, the paper critiques the initiative's disregard of buildings energy demand and questions how 'science-based' its interpretation of Net-Zero is. The paper introduces an alternative proposal whereby energy efficiency targets for buildings are derived from that share and, to be 1.5°C-aligned, companies within the sector must demonstrate that buildings they own, finance, or design comply with these targets.

The objective of this study is to perform an ex-ante assessment of the potential impacts of agro-environmental measures included in the post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), by estimating farmers’ responsiveness in adopting organic agricultural practices and an eco-scheme that incentivises extensive forage systems. This research is conducted by means of an Agent-Based Model (ABM), based on Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP), implemented in GAMS. The ABM facilitates the simulation of interaction among farmers, allowing for an analysis of farm heterogeneity. The PMP methodology adds a non-rational dimention to the farmers’ economic drivers. The model is calibrated using 2019 Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data specific to the Emilia Romagna region in Italy. Our findings reveal significant impacts on land use, with a notable decrease in cereal cultivation in favour of protein and fodder crops. Moreover, structural shifts are observed, notably a decrease in the number of small-scale farms. We also assess environmental and economic implications, observing a modest reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions per hectare, an increase in water demand, and an overall economic stability among farms, as indicated by changes in gross margin per hectare.

Abstract This article explores two primary questions: first, whether the issuance of green bonds contributes to environmental protection, particularly regarding their performance after the adoption of net-zero emission policies; and second, whether issuers of green bonds can have economic benefits. Using the Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to analyze green and conventional bonds issued from 2013 to 2023, the study finds no significant correlation between green bond issuance and CO 2 emissions following net-zero adoption. Nevertheless, our findings are important and deserve attention as they indicate that the carbon reduction policies have not exerted sufficient pressure on bond issuers to reduce emissions. At the same time, however, a closer examination of issuing entities reveals that those issuing only green bonds tend to have higher ESG ratings, lower CO2 emissions, and lower financing costs. This suggests that such issuers achieve substantial environmental benefits and economic advantages. In contrast, entities issuing both conventional and green bonds do not demonstrate the same environmental benefits. This finding raises concerns about potential greenwashing, suggesting that entities issuing both green and conventional bonds may engage in practices that contradict environmental protection while presenting their activities as environmentally friendly through green bonds. The study also highlights that the impact of bond features on ESG scores and CO 2 emissions varies significantly across different types of issuers. Finally, the paper recommends that policymakers strengthen carbon reduction policies, establish mechanisms to prevent greenwashing, and integrate CO 2 emissions and ESG factors into assessment systems. Additionally, it calls for special attention to the carbon emissions of entities in low- and middle-income countries, as well as those in the manufacturing sector, to support the healthy development of green finance.

This study investigates the potential of Potassium Feldspar-phosphate-based geopolymer concrete as a sustainable alternative to conventional concrete, addressing the environmental concerns associated with CO2 emissions during cement production. While geopolymer concrete offers a promising path toward sustainability, its performance often falls short of Portland cement concrete. This study investigates utilizing nano-silica to enhance the performance of geopolymer concrete. Potassium feldspar powder, metakaolin, and rice husk ash were combined to create a ternary mixture that included different amounts of nano-silica. The resulting geopolymer composition's mechanical characteristics were assessed. The mechanical qualities were evaluated using split tensile and compressive strength tests. The findings revealed that a 4% nano-silica dosage (GC-N4) yielded the most significant improvement in strength and durability. The GC-N4 mix performed superior in all metrics, demonstrating the highest compressive (42.86 MPa) and split tensile (3.8 Mpa) strengths. Reduction in water absorption and durability aspects were also optimum in GC-N4. These results highlight the potential of incorporating nano-silica into a ternary mix of potassium feldspar powder, metakaolin, and rice husk ash to significantly enhance the overall performance of geopolymer concrete, promoting its wider adoption as a sustainable construction material.

The article addresses the managerial challenges faced by Ukrainian industrial enterprises in the context of decarbonization and European integration. It systematically examines the key aspects of transitioning to low-carbon technologies and strategies required to align with European Union (EU) environmental goals, standards, and policies. Special emphasis is placed on the EUʼs carbon reduction targets, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and their impact on exporters of industrial goods, including Ukrainian companies. The study identifies strategic, operational, financial, and technological challenges that hinder decarbonization processes while highlighting opportunities for enterprises to adopt sustainable practices. The research underscores the importance of optimizing production processes through renewable energy sources, carbon capture technologies, and emission monitoring systems. Enterprises must address the costeffectiveness of transitioning to low-carbon technologies, ensure transparent CO2 emission reporting, and attract financial support for sustainable projects. Furthermore, the paper discusses the global carbon footprint and EU climate neutrality plans, including reducing emissions by 55% by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The study concludes that Ukrainian industrial enterprises need to integrate environmental management systems and prioritize innovation-driven solutions to maintain competitiveness in the EU market. Collaboration with international consulting firms, securing financing for decarbonization projects, and fostering corporate sustainability cultures are critical steps toward achieving compliance with EU standards and advancing environmental sustainability.

The application of hydrogen enrichment of palm oil-based biodiesel in a compression ignition engine was examined in this work. Synthesized from crude palm oil (CPO), biodiesel was first fed into a single-cylinder diesel engine. The intake manifold received hydrogen gas at flows of 2.5 L/min, 5 L/min, 7.5 L/min, and 10 L/min. Operating at a constant speed of 2,000 rpm, the single-cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine used The aim of this work is to assess the performance and emissions of a diesel engine utilizing hydrogen gas and CPO biodiesel fuels. This work examined engine performance and exhaust emissions using smoke emissions, exhaust temperature, power, thermal efficiency, and fuel economy. Addition of hydrogen improved emissions and performance. Optimal engine performance was achieved by adding 2.5 L/min of hydrogen, which resulted in a 20.12% increase in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and a 27.57% reduction in fuel consumption compared to biodiesel. The addition of hydrogen gas has a positive impact on exhaust emissions (HC, CO2, and smoke opacity), but has a negative impact on NO emissions. At elevated loads of 2.5 lpm hydrogen flow, emissions measured were 40.00 ppm, 0.04%, 4.20%, and 44.20%, respectively, alongside a 45.72% increase in NO emissions. Including hydrogen gas improves the diesel engines running on biodiesel's performance and exhaust pollutants.

A rise in population and societal changes have increased pressure on resources required to meet the growing demand for food and changing dietary preferences. The increasing demand for animal protein is concerning and raises questions regarding sustainability due to its environmental impact. Subsequently, scientists seek alternative proteins, such as microbial proteins (MPs), as an environmentally friendly choice. The production of MPs promotes benefits, including reducing deforestation and CO2 emissions. Several microorganism types, such as bacteria, yeast, fungi, and algae, use a variety of substrates for MP production, from agricultural residues to lignocellulosic biomass. These complex substrates, including lignocellulosic biomass, are converted to fermentable sugar through either chemical, physical, or biological methods. Indeed, fermentation can occur through submerged cultures or other methods. However, this depends on the substrate and microorganisms being utilized. MPs have properties that make them versatile and useful ingredients in various applications. Using residues and lignocellulosic biomass as raw materials for producing MPs offers sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and waste reduction advantages. These properties are consistent with the principles established by green chemistry, which aims to conserve resources effectively and operate sustainably in all areas. This review highlights the importance of studying manufacturing aspects and the characteristics associated with MPs, which can be implemented to solve problems and encourage novel methods in the global food/feed industry.

As the popularity of new energy vehicles increases and the transport network becomes increasingly linked to the energy system, the energy drive of electric and natural gas vehicles is directly dependent on the supply of the electrical network. Therefore, effective coordination of traffic flows can optimize energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions. This paper introduces an optimal scheduling model that integrates traffic flow and alkaline electrolyser operation to achieve economic efficiency and low carbon emissions. Firstly, a traffic flow model is developed, addressing path selection, parking queues and vehicle loads on gas and electricity systems, with the aim of reducing excessive emissions resulting from poor traffic distribution. Secondly, An electrolyser operation strategy is formulated for various conditions, enhancing system economics and dynamics. Finally, a two-stage low-carbon optimisation model is implemented.The first stage focuses on economic dispatch of the coupled electricity-gas system to minimize operating costs.In the second stage, a demand response model is developed to optimise the system by taking into account the integrated carbon price of the carbon emission streams. Tested in a modified energy transport network, the model demonstrates a CO2 reduction of 3.2 tons and a 14% improvement in economic efficiency.

Abstract Aim: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an ISO-standardized analytical tool developed to evaluate environmental performance of products and processes. The aquaculture industry is one of the largest and fast-growing industries in the agricultural sector because of its health benefits. However, this growth comes with fuel combustion technologies and other operations. Therefore, quantifying the level of impact caused by these processes is imperative. The study was aimed at carrying out an LCA for the production and processing of smoked fish using the University of Ibadan Fish Farm as a case study to identify environmentally detrimental production and processing hotspots. Methods: The approach employed for this study is the cradle-to-gate approach, which involves the operations from breeding/hatching to the packaging of smoked fish. Relevant data was obtained through site visitation and physical interviews. The data on energy and material resources used in the processes were modeled on GaBi9 (Holistic Balancing) software. The tool used to analyze the life cycle inventories of smoked fish production is TRACI (Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other Environmental Impacts) midpoint assessment and modeling was for 1kg functional unit of smoked fish. Four scenarios were drawn out for assessing the impact by varying the energy and material resources. Results: The total energy used in the smoking kiln for the one month under study was 35,660.16MJ. Six impact categories were measured for all four scenarios and the following categories had the highest impact in order of ascension; Global Warming Potential (GWP) (0.438, 0.243, 0.609, 0.624) kg CO2-Eqiv., Smog Air (0.0702, 0.288, 0.478, 0.277) kg O3-Equiv., Human Health Criteria Air (4.173e-03, 3.502e-04, 1.503e-03, 3.443e-03) kg PM10-Equiv. and Acidification Potential (AP) (2.19e-04, 2.88e-04, 3.37e-04, 5.68e-04) kg SO2-Equiv. The unit process with the highest impact on the environment for all four scenarios is the fish smoking process. Transportation and burning of charcoal also contributed to the emission of gases such as CO2, CO, CH4, N2O, SO2, NOx, VOCs, PMs, etc. Also, the use of Polyethylene (PE) and Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) plastics as packaging materials contribute to the release of heavy metals such; Cr, Cd, Ar, Zn, Cu, Pb, etc. into the environment for all four scenarios. Conclusion: The fish smoking process has the highest impact on the environment for all four scenarios. However other unit processes also have contributory effect. At the end of the study, it was recommended that renewable energy sources as well as energy from bio-waste should be explored for the smoking kilns to achieve cleaner production.

Abstract. Problem. The state of war in our country and a significant reduction in the production of new vehicles exacerbated the problem of increasing their operational resource due to repairs. Improving the quality and increasing the efficiency of transport vehicles involves, first of all, the fight against wear and tear, because the reason for their premature failure (from 75 to 90%) is significant wear and tear of parts. A significant number of parts of the main structural units of vehicles are exposed to cyclic loads, so it is quite reasonable to pay attention to the issue of increasing the fatigue strength of products. Considering the significant shortage and high cost of spare parts, an expedient and economically beneficial solution to these problems is the restoration and strengthening of the surface layers of products during repair The parts that mostly fail prematurely and require repair using rational methods of recovery include the bolts of fastening the wheels of buses - a very common vehicle that is intensively operated in very difficult conditions. The development of effective technological processes for the restoration of bolts with a simultaneous increase in the post-repair resource at the lowest costs is definitely an urgent issue, because it will prevent another possible premature failure in operation Goal. The purpose of the work is to restore and increase the post-repair resource of the bolts for fastening the disks of the rear wheels of the bus. Methodology. The subject of the study were the serial bolts for fastening the discs of the rear wheels of the bus made of 40X steel after quenching and tempering at 500-550º C with a trostite-bainite structure and a hardness of 35-37 НРС. For vibro-arc surfacing, electrode wire Нп-30ХГСА with a diameter of 1.2 mm was used. Food carbon dioxide was used as a protective gas, and a 5% solution of soda ash in water was used as an accelerating coolant. After surfacing, the surface was subjected to bombardment with low-energy (up to 3 keV) titanium ions in an argon environment at the Bulat - 3t installation. After the specified methods of bolt processing, the roughness and surface profile were evaluated, the microstructure was studied, and the mechanical properties were determined. The strength limit of the slotted part of the bolt was determined using special samples on the CD10 universal machine (made in Germany). Cyclic tests of welded samples were carried out according to the scheme "tension during rotation of the cantilever-loaded sample" on the UMP-02 machine. Tensile tests were performed according to standard methods. Originality. To increase the cyclic durability and wear resistance of bolts, a modern method of surface modification was used - ion bombardment with low-energy ions (without coating), which made it possible to strengthen the surface layer without losing plasticity. An increase in the resource was achieved due to a change in the state of the surface (obtaining ultrafine crystalline nano-sized grain, healing of surface stress concentrators), and a change in the mechanism of plastic deformation - from dislocation to rotational with grain-boundary sliding of ultra-fine grains. Practical value. The recommended mode of vibro-arc surfacing provides surface hardness for the possibility of further mechanical processing without additional thermal weakening, which increases the cost-effectiveness of the process of compensation of the worn surface layer. Modification of the surface by ion brombarbing after surfacing made it possible to increase the cyclic durability by 2 times, significantly increase the static strength without loss of plasticity, and increase the hardness to ensure wear resistance.

This study investigates the use of cotton ropes (CRs) as a sustainable and cost-effective substitute for synthetic fiber-reinforced polymers for concrete confinement, offering significant environmental benefits such as lower CO2 emissions and reduced energy consumption. The work evaluates the effectiveness of CR strips for confining concrete, including scenarios with recycled concrete aggregates (ReCA). Compressive strength improvements varied among specimens, with Specimen I-3F showing a 140.52% increase and Specimen II-3F achieving a 46.67% improvement. Strip configurations for Type I recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) outperformed full wraps on Type II RAC, exemplified by Specimen I-3S’s 84.51% improvement. Ultimate strain enhancements ranged from 915% to 4490.91%, driven by the significant rupture strain of cotton rope confinement. For Type I RAC, complete wrapping significantly outperformed strip configurations by 56%, 50%, and 32% in ultimate strength improvement for 1, 2, and 3 layers, respectively. The confinement ratio, varying from 0.10 to 0.70, greatly influenced the compressive behavior, with compressive strength normalized by unconfined strength increasing consistently with the confinement ratio. A minimum confinement ratio of roughly 0.40 is required to achieve an increasing second part in the compressive behavior. The initial parabolic branch was modeled using Popovics’ formulation, revealing an elastic modulus approximately 20% lower than ACI 318-19 predictions. The second branch was described using a linear approximation, and nonlinear regression analysis produced expressions for key points on the idealized compressive curve, enhancing model accuracy for CR-confined RAC. The R2 values for the nonlinear regression analysis performed on experimental results were greater than 0.90. This study highlights the effectiveness of neural network expressions to predict the compressive strength of CR-confined concrete. A strength reduction (ratio of full wrap and strip wrap height CRs) factor of 0.67 was proposed and used for strip-wrapped specimens. It was seen that the neural network models also predicted the compressive strength of partially wrapped specimens with reasonable accuracy using the strength reduction factor.

The green unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains 12–13 carbonic anhydrases (CAs). For a long time, the two closely related α-CAs of the periplasmic membrane CAH1 and CAH2 were considered to be the CAs with the highest CO2 hydration activity. The recombinant protein α-CA CAH3 (rCAH3) from the thylakoid lumen obtained in the present study showed more than three times higher activity compared to CAH1 and more than 11 times higher compared to previous studies with rCAH3. Long-term sustainability of the enzyme was observed at alkaline pH (>8), with maintenance of half of its activity at 4 °C for up to 50 days. Thermostability of rCAH3 indicated the retention of the activity at 20 °C for one hour at pH 9–10 with its ~50% decrease at pH 6–7. However, the residual activity of rCAH3 after incubation at an extremely high temperature (75 °C) for 15 min led to the formation of the double-hump graph with maxima at pH 6 and 9. The enzyme demonstrated high sensitivity to ethoxyzolamide and acetazolamide at nM concentrations, to Zn2+ and Cu2+ cations at 1 mM concentrations, and L-cysteine was able to completely inhibit CA activity of rCAH3 through reduction of sulfhydryl groups. Esterase activity of rCAH3 was well detected with values comparable to those of bovine CAII, but with a maximum at pH 8 instead of pH 9, which is usual for bovine CAII. The results indicated that CAH3 may be the most active CA of C. reinhardtii and that its role in the photosynthetic apparatus function could have been underestimated in previous works.

The framework of the methodology presented in this study is an effort to integrate and optimize the agro-industry sector, especially energy in biogas. In this study, the technique of the system in functional analysis is shown systematically to translate various energy requirements in the factory as criteria for performance and functional design to be integrated, optimized, and energy efficient. The case study results indicated that biogas power plants, with a capacity of 1.5 MW, can produce around 13,140 MWh per year. The annual return on investment (ROI) is around 37.13%. With this ROI value, the payback period is 31 months. The overall reduction of greenhouse gases is approximately 77,826 tons CO2 eq/year. The potential value of carbon trading is about USD 3,113,040 per year. This strategic model presents a novel approach by integrating biogas energy production with a customized wastewater treatment system adapted to biodigesters' effluent characteristics. It offers a sustainable, economically feasible, and scalable solution, combining resource recovery, waste minimization, and potential for carbon trading into a unified system. The novelty of this research lies in maximizing the utility of biogas plants by efficiently treating and reusing wastewater, creating a closed-loop, zero-waste process. Future research on hybrid systems integrating Biogas power plants by focusing on efficiency optimization, economic feasibility, environmental impacts, and innovative approaches like AI and blockchain could make the hybrid system a more robust, scalable, and sustainable solution. Thus, the framework based on the results of this study finds tools that can maximize and integrate energy sources, especially biogas, in the agro-industrial sector.

Due to the supply problems of fossil-based energy sources, the tendency towards alternative energy sources is relatively high. For this reason, the use of solar energy systems is increasing today. This study combines experimental data and machine learning algorithms to evaluate the energy performance of four different photovoltaic (PV) panel designs (monocrystalline, polycrystalline, flexible, and transparent) under harsh environmental conditions on Horseshoe Island (Antarctica). In this research, the effects of environmental factors, such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, on the panels were analyzed. Electrical power output of the PV panels are analyzed using six machine learning models. Random forest (RF) and CatBoost (CB) models showed the highest accuracy and reliability among these models. According to the experimental results, Monocrystalline PV provided the highest electrical power (20.5 Watts on average), and Flexible PV provided the highest energy efficiency (19.67%). However, Flexible PV was observed to have higher surface temperatures compared to the other panel types. Furthermore, using Monocrystalline PV resulted in an average reduction of 4.1 tons of CO2 emissions per year, demonstrating the positive environmental impact of renewable energy systems. Thanks to this study, renewable energy research for temporary stations in Antarctica will focus on explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence models that will provide an understanding of the factors affecting the energy performance of PV panels. The research results will be an important guide for optimizing energy consumption, management, and demand forecasting in temporary research stations in Antarctica.

With growing concerns over energy and heat-related mortality/morbidity rates, enhancing building performances is key to improving the health and well-being of building occupants while reducing CO2 emissions, in line with the UK Government’s Net-Zero targets. This study investigates the impacts of different retrofitting scenarios on overheating risk and energy performance in social housing for current and future climate conditions. Dynamic thermal simulations were carried out using Design Summer Year (DSY) weather files in DesignBuilder software for selected case study buildings. Winter performance was analysed using the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index, while summer results were assessed according to the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers Technical Memorandum 59 (CIBSE TM59) guidelines. The findings revealed that bedrooms, especially those facing south, were at high risk of overheating. Factors such as building construction, the number of exposed surfaces, and window area influenced the risks. External wall insulation outperformed internal wall insulation in improving summer comfort. In the winter, Passivhaus standards with natural ventilation ensured thermal comfort across all zones, with a 41–53% reduction in heating energy consumption under current weather conditions. The risk of overheating and associated health issues significantly increased for the future weather scenarios. Further investigation into ventilation strategies, occupant behaviour, and passive design is required to mitigate overheating risks while reducing energy consumption in buildings.

Agriculture may hold the key to a sustainable future. By efficiently capturing atmospheric CO2, we can simultaneously produce food, feed, biomass, and biofuels. For more eco-friendly soil processing practices, biofuels can replace diesel in agricultural machinery, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of crop production. Thus, biofuel production can be a sustainable solution for a future with a decreasing carbon footprint. This paper examines the possibility of replacing petroleum-based fuels with 100% biofuels to continue powering heavy-duty vehicles, where the use of electric vehicles is not the optimal solution. This study particularly focused on the operating scenario of heavy-duty engines under medium to high loads, typical of transport or soil processing in agriculture. Diesel was used as a benchmark, and each alternative, such as vegetable oil, methyl ester (B100), and methyl ester–ethanol blends (90B10E, 80B20E, and 70B30E), was tested individually. To find a sustainable fuel substitute, the goal was to identify a biofuel with a kinematic viscosity similar to that of diesel for a comparable spray process. Experimental results showed that an 80% methyl ester and 20% ethanol blend had a kinematic viscosity close to that of diesel. In addition to diesel, this blend resulted in a 48.6% reduction in exhaust gas opacity and a 6.54% lower specific fuel consumption (BSEC). The main aim of the tests was to find a 100% biofuel substitute without modifying the fuel injection systems of existing engines.

The article presents results of tests concerning the use of waste biomass-derived char as a partial substitute for solid fuel used in the iron ore sintering process (primarily coke breeze). The tests were performed in a system used for the physical simulation of the sintering process, making it possible for flue gases to be recycled back to the process. During the tests, particular attention was paid to the analysis of properties of flue gases with the simultaneous recirculation of these gases back to the process. The optimal fraction of char from biomass (i.e. not worsening either sintering process or sinter parameters) in the total fuel was determined on the basis of previous experience. It was found that the use of carbonised biomass improved the reducing properties of the sinter and had a positive effect on its strength. At the same time it was observed that the amounts of CO2 and NOx as well as of CO and CH4 emitted when using char were higher than those accompanying the use of coke breeze (only) as fuel. In order to reduce the impact of the char addition on flue gas parameters, sintering process-related tests also included the recycling of flue gas back to the sintering process. Flue gas properties were identified (both before dedusting and in the stack) using stationary flue gas analysers. The tests also included measurements of volatile organic compounds. The measurement results were used to determine the influence of the use of waste biomass-derived char on flue gas properties and primary parameters of the sintering process. The overall test results revealed failure to obtain expected reduction in the emission of undesirable compounds in off-gases (in relation to the use of the constant 15 % fraction of waste biomass-derived char and the gradual 45 % increase in the amount of off-gases recycled back to the process).

ABSTRACT The University of Lampung, commonly referred to as Unila, is known as a green campus with open green spaces featuring various types of vegetation, such as shrubs, trees, and grasslands. The university consists of several faculties, including the Faculty of Engineering. However, in recent years, land use changes have occurred within the Faculty of Engineering, where vegetated areas have been converted into built-up areas, such as the construction of retention ponds and new buildings. This change has impacted the available carbon stock. The reduction in vegetated land is directly proportional to the decrease in carbon reserves stored in plants, which contributes to climate change. In relation to climate change caused by deforestation and land degradation, it is necessary to conserve and manage vegetated lands, as well as enhance carbon reserves, to measure the extent of changes (reduction in carbon emissions) resulting from land conservation efforts (Hairiah et al., 2007). The more abundant the carbon stored in plant biomass; the more CO2 is absorbed by the plants. Biomass measurement can be conducted in two ways: non-destructively and destructively. The non-destructive method is considered effective because it requires less time, cost, and effort. One technology that can be used for biomass measurement is aerial photography using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, which tend to be effective and efficient. The Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach is an object-based method that has high accuracy in determining the available carbon stock due to dynamic changes in the extent of vegetated land in the Faculty of Engineering area at Unila between 2019 and 2024. The vegetated area on the OBIA-processed map in 2019 was 6.9886 hectares. In 2024, the vegetated area on the OBIA-processed map was 6.6652 hectares. The change in vegetated land between 2019 and 2024 was 0.3234 hectares, indicating a reduction in vegetated land due to infrastructure development in the Faculty of Engineering area. The calculation of stored carbon stock, based on field measurements, was 197.129764 tons of carbon per hectare. Keywords : Universitas Lampung, Vegetation, UAV, Carbon, OBIA ABSTRAK Universitas Lampung atau disebut dengan Unila merupakan universitas yang dikenal sebagai kampus hijau (green campus) yang memiliki ruang terbuka hijau dengan vegetasi berupa semak belukar, pepohonan serta padang rumput. Universitas Lampung terdiri dari beberapa fakultas, salah satunya fakultas teknik. Namun, belakangan tahun terakhir terjadinya alih fungsi lahan di fakultas teknik dari lahan vegetasi menjadi lahan terbangun seperti dibangunnya embung, serta gedung-gedung baru. Hal tersebut mempengaruhi jumlah cadangan karbon yang tersedia. Pengurangan area vegetasi secara langsung berhubungan dengan penurunan cadangan karbon yang terdapat pada tanaman, yang pada gilirannya berkontribusi terhadap perubahan iklim. Dalam konteks perubahan iklim yang disebabkan oleh deforestasi dan degradasi lahan, sangat penting untuk melaksanakan upaya konservasi serta pengelolaan lahan vegetasi, sekaligus meningkatkan cadangan karbon. Hal ini bertujuan untuk memahami sejauh mana perubahan (penurunan emisi karbon) terjadi akibat kegiatan konservasi tersebut (Hairiah dkk., 2007).Jumlah karbon yang tersimpan dalam biomassa tanaman merupakan indikator dari seberapa banyak CO2 yang dapat diserap. Terdapat dua metode untuk mengukur biomassa, yaitu metode non-destruktif dan destruktif. Metode non-destruktif lebih disukai karena efisiensinya dalam hal waktu, biaya, dan tenaga. Salah satu teknologi yang dapat digunakan untuk pengukuran biomassa adalah pemotretan udara dengan menggunakan drone (UAV), yang menunjukkan efektivitas dan efisiensinya. Pendekatan Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) adalah metode berbasis objek yang menawarkan akurasi tinggi dalam menentukan cadangan karbon yang tersedia akibat perubahan luas lahan vegetasi di Fakultas Teknik Unila antara tahun 2019 dan 2024.. Luasan vegetasi pada peta hasil pengolahan OBIA tahun 2019 luas vegetasi sebesar 6.9886 Ha. Dan untuk luasan vegetasi pada peta hasil pengolahan OBIA tahun 2024 luas vegetasi sebesar 6.6652 Ha. Hasil perubahan lahan vegetasi antara tahun 2019 dan 2024 sebesar 0.3234 Ha artinya terdapat pengurangan lahan vegetasi karena adanya pembangunan infrastruktur di area Fakultas Teknik. Perhitungan cadangan karbon tersimpan diperoleh berdasarkan pengukuran di lapangan sebesar 197.129764 Ton-C/ha Kata Kunci : Universitas lampung, Vegetasi, Karbon, UAV, OBIA.

Climate change is a global issue affecting communities in different parts of the world. Climate change is associated with extreme weather and climate patterns that affect the general health of the environment and humanity. The causes of climate change are both natural and anthropogenic. The human induced climate change has accelerated the emission of greenhouse gases that in turn cause global warming and climate change. The international community have initiated various interventions to minimize emission of greenhouse gases in order to maintain a healthier environment for sustainable development. One such initiative and/or interventions is the energy transition strategy that involves transition from a purely fossil fuel based to renewable energy-based economy. This paper therefore looks at the energy transition in Kenya. Specifically, the paper covers energy demand and supply, Mt CO2 emission; energy transitions process; constraints and opportunities. Kenya is going through a transition period in the energy sector and at the same time the country is striving to industrialize by the year 2023 being guided by the Country’s 2010 Constitution and the Vision 2030 which aims at transforming the country into a middle level economy. It is important that as the country strives to industrialize, the energy that drives the economy should be clean to enhance cleaner energy production. The country is a signatory to the landmark agreement of COP21 held in Paris, France in 2015. The country committed to observe the requirements of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to ensure the reduction of emission of greenhouse gases and has put in place various institutional and legal frameworks towards this end. One of the most recent frameworks is the Climate Change Amendment Act, 2023. The main objective of the study is to assess the energy transition process and associated challenges. The study uses an exploratory design and employed descriptive statistics in data analysis. Data was presented in the form of tables, graphs, and themes. The result indicates that energy transition in Kenya is ongoing through specific processes and technologies. The results also confirm existing challenges and recommends sustained effort for sustainable development.

Dear Sir, Moyamoya disease is a chronic, usually bilateral, vasculopathy with progressive narrowing of the terminal intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and circle of Willis leading to decreased blood supply to the brain resulting in chronic ischemia characterized by symptoms of transient ischemic attacks and stroke.[1,2] The usual presentation of moyamoya disease occurs in bimodal peaks, in the pediatric age group at 5–9 years of age and in adults at 35–39 years of age.[3] This disease has a rare occurrence in the infant population so nothing much is described in the literature about anesthetic management of moyamoya in infants.[4] We, hereby, discuss the anesthetic management of moyamoya disease in an infant posted for encephaloduroarteriomyosynosteosis procedure (EDAMS). An 11-month-old female, weighing 6 kg, was posted for an EDAMS procedure for moyamoya disease. The parents gave a history of multiple episodes of sudden clonic movements of the right upper limb (lasting for 1–2 min) till the seventh month of life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed severe attenuation of the bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery with A1 segment of the bilateral anterior cerebral artery with evident multiple lacunar chronic infarcts, encephalomalacia, and gliosis in bilateral cerebral hemispheres with multiple thalamo-perforating and lenticulostriate collaterals suggestive of moyamoya disease [Figure 1]. Routine investigations including complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum electrolytes, and renal function tests were normal. Her 2D echocardiography was normal. On examination, she also had microcephaly with fused fontanelles and overriding of sutures. The power was 4/5 in all limbs with increased tone in the right upper limb and lower limb and deep tendon reflexes of the right side were hyperactive grade +3. She was on tablet aspirin (25 mg), syrup clonazepam, and syrup levetiracetam.Figure 1: MRI image showing severe attenuation of bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid artery and middle cerebral arteryOn the day of surgery, she was calm and sleeping due to the morning dose of syrup clonazepam. She was shifted to the operation theater while in a state of sleep and there was no requirement of added sedation. All monitors were attached with pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure (BP), and nasopharyngeal temperature probe. She was induced with inj. fentanyl 12 mcg, inj. lignocaine (to avoid intubation response), inj. propofol 15 mg, and inj. atracurium 3 mg. Maintenance was done with O2/air (50:50) and sevoflurane to keep a minimal alveolar concentration (MAC 0.8). 4F triple lumen central line was inserted in right-sided internal jugular vein. Left radial artery was cannulated with 24-G arterial line for continuous BP monitoring. The vital parameters were maintained with mean arterial pressure (MAP) targeted above 55 mmHg. End-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained between 28 and 30 mmHg throughout the procedure. She was extubated smoothly at the end of the procedure and was shifted to neonatal intensive care unit for close observation. The goals of anesthesia in these surgeries included preservation of perfusion in areas prone to chronic ischemia by the maintenance of normothermia, normocarbia, normotension, prevention of hypoxia, and normal hematocrit.[5] Reduction in cerebral blood flow is less tolerated in pediatric patients than adults because children have a higher cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), hence they develop ischemia even if the cerebral blood flow is marginally reduced.[6] Any factor that reduces the cerebral blood flow like reduction in MAP or rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) should be specifically avoided in these patients as blood flow is already compromised. In our patient, the margin was even lesser due to the presence of fused sutures and microcephaly. Rise in ICP at various stages was prevented by shifting the child to OT in a sedated state, using lignocaine IV for attenuation of intubation response, smooth extubation, and good analgesia in the postoperative period. Invasive BP monitoring is required in such cases to continuously monitor for mean BP. To conclude, avoidance of factors leading to hypoxia and hyperventilation (crying, agitation), maintenance of cerebral blood flow, and normothermia are the keys to successful anesthetic management of moyamoya disease in the infant population.

The key areas of interest in respect of which analyses are provided within the context of the paper are sustainable business practices that can help drive the change towards a low carbon economy. The study focuses on advanced techniques for managing businesses to advance the link between economic development and environmental conservation to optimize economic and environmental performance. Furthermore, based on the features, discussed in the paper, it is possible to identify the meaning of the concepts making the organizations introduce sustainability factors, as well as the possible effect these decisions may have on their future performance. This paper explores the role of machine learning (ML) and data-driven business strategies in promoting sustainable business development within smart cities. By integrating ML models across various sectors such as energy management, transportation, waste management, water usage, public safety, and urban planning, cities can optimize resources, reduce environmental impact, and enhance overall efficiency. Results from implementing these strategies in a smart city context show a 10% reduction in energy consumption (from 200,000 kWh to 180,000 kWh), a 50% increase in renewable energy share (from 20% to 30%), and a 40% decrease in CO2 emissions (from 500 tons to 300 tons) due to the use of autonomous electric vehicles. In transportation, average traffic speed improved by 16.67% (from 30 km/h to 35 km/h), and public transport efficiency increased by 21.43% (from 70% to 85%). In waste management, waste collection costs were reduced by 20% (from $50,000 to $40,000), and the recycling rate increased by 40% (from 25% to 35%). Water usage efficiency rose by 12.5% (from 80% to 90%), while water leak incidents decreased by 60% (from 50 to 20). Additionally, predictive policing reduced crime rates by 40% (from 5 to 3 per 1,000 residents), and emergency response times improved by 33.33% (from 15 minutes to 10 minutes). Finally, urban planning efficiency increased by 25% (from 60% to 75%) in land use, and green space area expanded by 40% (from 50 to 70 square kilometers).

The possibility of charging and possibly discharging electric cars can influence not only the balancing of power demand profiles in the grid and the stabilization of voltage profiles but also the appropriate management of electricity within the grid of an industrial plant equipped with its own RES resources. For this purpose, the concept of “power supply modes” can be introduced, which involves intelligent demand-side management. Each technological process in an industrial plant should be assigned a specific level of importance and priority. These priorities can be numbered according to their importance (weights) and marked with appropriate colors. One thus obtains a qualitative assessment of energy consumption within the plant (demand side) through the lens of power modes. With respect to the ability to charge electric vehicles within the plant grid, such priorities can also be assigned to individual charging options. If a given RES has sufficient generation capacity during a particular time period, the cost of charging is low. However, if the RESs are not operational during a given period (e.g., nighttime in the case of photovoltaics or during calm weather in the case of wind turbines), vehicles can still be charged but according to a different priority, which, of course, involves higher costs. By having access to data on the generation capacity of distributed RESs and knowing the preferences of employees, including the number of electric cars and the expected periods of vehicle charging, it is possible to predict the degree of use of available green energy and manage it efficiently. The analyses presented in the article represent an original approach to the flexibility of operation not only of the electricity grid but also of the internal energy system of industrial plants. It offers a novel perspective aimed at maximizing the share of RESs in the overall energy balance and minimizing the costs associated with the operation of RESs. The theoretical opportunity of sustainable sharing with employees a dedicated charging mode named “free charging”, powered by RESs, could represent an appropriate solution for CO2 emission reduction within Scope 3, Category 3, “employee commuting”, according to the GHG Protocol requirements. The original methodology proposed in the article aligns with activities related to the energy transition.

Abstract Additive Manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized rapid prototyping and mechanical production in a range of different fields, including e-mobility and aerospace, as well as personalized medical devices. In an era dominated by increasing environmental awareness, requirements to reduce CO2 emissions and climate change associated with manufacturing energy consumption are paramount, further to the development of clean energy systems. With the aim of achieving cleaner production, accurate prediction of energy consumption during additive manufacturing processes is the first step in obtaining tangible reductions in manufacturing-related emissions. Energy optimization not only promotes environmental sustainability, but also gives an additional competitive advantage to additive manufacturing processes in today’s market, bringing considerable benefits to these technologies. The present work provides an in-depth study into energy consumption during additive manufacturing, applying a novel and highly accurate methodology for evaluating electrical energy usage during Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) as a test case for applying this approach to a wider range of additive manufacturing technologies such as Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Stereolithography (SLA) and others. FDM is renowned for its popularity in multiple sectors due to its versatility in achieving customized results at low cost with relative ease and safety. To date, the vast majority of scientific literature relating to additive manufacturing has focused on the mechanical properties of printed objects, topology optimization, support structures and energy consumption. Investigations into the energy consumption during additive manufacturing have mainly focused on the measurement and estimation of total energy consumption over the entire printing process based on general considerations and, in some cases, machine learning algorithms. The present study distinguishes itself from previous works by providing precise and detailed analysis of each individual step in the printing process. Experimental evaluation of each machine action was performed, allowing translation of the machine instructions (G-code) employed for printing an object into distinct energy contributions for each action during the process. This approach makes it possible to estimate the total energy consumption very accurately as the sum of all energy contributions, allowing an additional energy optimization parameter to be introduced. Such a detailed analysis allows the main drivers of energy consumption during FDM to be identified, leading to relatively simple solutions to dramatically reduce energy consumption during the process. The presented approach was developed as a test bed for detailed evaluation of energy consumption during additive manufacturing, with potential for application over a wide range of different technologies with similar approaches.

Anthropogenic climate change can affect forest ecosystems and is one of the causes of deforestation, which leads to desertification. Deforestation is one of the main drivers of climate change due to the release of large amounts of CO2 stored in forests and jungles. Rising temperatures, decreased rainfall and drought have negative impacts on the diversity of forest species, as well as on forest ecosystem goods and services. Thus, this research focuses on climate change and its impact on Mexico's forests, evaluating deforestation and its effects on climate change and, subsequently, the effects of that climate change on forests; and the role of forests in carbon sequestration. Aims: The objective of this study is to present a set of regional temperature, precipitation, and drought projections for Mexico under the IPCC's AR6 climate change scenarios, and to estimate the potential impacts on Mexico's forest resources. Methodology: The methodology consists of obtaining a set of regional projections of temperature, precipitation, vegetation, drought and soil moisture under the conditions of the IPCC AR6 climate change scenarios for Mexico, with the changes of the aforementioned variables the vulnerability of the forestry sector in Mexico will be evaluated through models of the influence of these factors. Results: Regional models for Mexico show temperature increases ranging from 0.5 to 5 °C, while the percentage change in precipitation will range from -20.3% to 13.5% depending on the scenario and period of analysis. The low soil moisture (mm), the negative changes of the NDVI and the SPEI12 show that the North, West and Bajío zones will present reductions in precipitation and temperature increase that will cause a severe deficit of soil moisture and water stress in the plants, considering these areas with scarce vegetation and the presence of semi-permanent meteorological drought. Under these scenarios, it is expected that practically the entire country will be subject to moderate droughts (Central and South) to extremely severe droughts (North) that will last and worsen between now and the end of the century. These conditions have already been recorded in Mexico's main forest areas and if adaptation and mitigation measures are not adopted, the country's forest resources are at risk. Likewise, in addition to the decrease in rainfall, it is estimated that it will be more intense with the presence of extreme events, which will increase the vulnerability of some basins throughout the country, in the Central and Northern areas with extreme drought events, while in the Southeast with floods. Conclusion: Temperate and cloud forests, xerophilous scrub and grasslands will be the most affected forest ecosystems in Mexico, to reduce the effects of climate change on forest resources, it is necessary to design and prioritize adaptation actions and implement mitigation measures that prevent the effects of climate change from intensifying in the most vulnerable regions of the country.

Background: CPAP has been shown to be particularly beneficial in the management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema by reducing both preload and afterload, thus decreasing the work of breathing and improving oxygenation. Methods: This study was a prospective observational study, conducted in the period from 2022 to 2024, assessing the effectiveness and safety of prehospital CPAP therapy use in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, administered alongside standard care. Results: In this study, 50 patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema were treated by physician-led emergency teams in the Canton of Sarajevo. CPAP significantly improved clinical parameters across all time points. Systolic blood pressure decreased from 151.0 ± 41.0 mmHg at initial contact to 138.4 ± 32.0 mmHg before transportation and further to 130.2 ± 28.5 mmHg upon hospital admission (p < 0.001). Diastolic pressure dropped from 85.6 ± 17.2 mmHg to 81.1 ± 15.2 mmHg before transportation (p = 0.018), with a slight further decrease to 80.2 ± 13.9 mmHg (p = 0.083). Heart rate fell from 114 ± 26.4 bpm to 111.3 ± 24.9 bpm before transportation (p = 0.003) and finally to 99.5 ± 18.2 bpm before hospital admission (p < 0.001). Respiratory rate decreased from 31.0 ± 10.2 to 28.0 ± 10.5 breaths/min (p = 0.002) and further to 22.6 ± 7.3 breaths/min (p < 0.001). End-tidal CO2 levels increased from 28.0 mmHg (23.5; 33.5) to 30.0 mmHg before transportation (p < 0.001), and to 35.0 mmHg (32.0; 37.5) before hospital admission (p < 0.001). Oxygen saturation improved from 79.0% (72.0; 81.0) to 84.0% before transportation (p < 0.001) and reached 94.0% (91.0; 98.2) before hospital admission (p < 0.001). VAS scores for dyspnea significantly dropped from 8.0 (6.0; 8.2) at initial contact to 6.0 (4.0; 8.0) before transportation (p < 0.001) and further to 4.0 (3.0; 5.0) before hospital admission (p < 0.001), indicating substantial symptom relief. ECG findings remained stable throughout the intervention. Conclusions: Prehospital CPAP therapy significantly improved clinical outcomes in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, including reductions in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and enhanced oxygenation and symptom relief. These findings support its broader use in emergency care, even during short transport times.

Connections link a sequence of three related research papers. The central article which links the other two papers has been published in Experimental Physiology. In a Connections article, an author (or authors) of the central article outlines its principal novel findings, tracing how they were influenced by the first article and how the central article has contributed to the developments made in the third article. The author(s) may also speculate on the direction of future research in the field. Connections articles aim to set the research in a wide context. Pulmonary ventilation (hereafter referred to as ventilation) is tightly regulated in response to changes in metabolic rate (i.e., O2 consumption and CO2 production), maintaining arterial O2 and CO2 partial pressures. Therefore, it is not surprising that ventilation increases proportionally with exercise intensity and thus metabolic rate. As exercise intensity increases, wherein acidosis is intensified, ventilation increases exponentially relative to metabolic rate such that arterial partial pressures of CO2 decrease (hypocapnia) to minimize acidosis. In addition to metabolic rate, elevations in core temperature appear to increase ventilation with concomitant hypocapnia at rest and during prolonged submaximal exercise, particularly in the heat. My colleagues and I in Japan have conducted several experiments to assess this response, which we term hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation in our recent studies. I believe the underlying mechanisms and physiological significance of this response during exercise in humans remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation during prolonged exercise in the heat might occur to maintain homeostasis by: (1) mitigating acidosis through hypocapnia; (2) increasing respiratory heat loss; and (3) increasing blood oxygenation by elevating the arterial partial pressure of O2 and by a leftward shift in the haemoglobin–oxygen dissociation curve mediated by hypocapnia. The latter adaptation counteracts the rightward shift of the haemoglobin–oxygen dissociation curve induced by hyperthermia, which compromises oxygen loading to the blood. It should be noted that hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation leads to: (1) reduced cerebral blood flow owing to hypocapnia; (2) increased oxygen cost of ventilation; and (3) elevated breathing effort, all of which can increase physiological and psychological strain, potentially impairing exercise tolerance and endurance performance. Therefore, I believe that interventions aimed at mitigating hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation could potentially reduce physiological and psychological strain, thereby enhancing exercise tolerance and performance in the heat. Fluid loss through sweating often exceeds fluid intake during prolonged exercise in the heat, causing dehydration. The key question is whether dehydration contributes to hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation during prolonged exercise in the heat. Addressing this question could clarify whether proper hydration attenuates hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation, thereby improving exercise tolerance and performance in these conditions. As discussed earlier, ventilation can facilitate heat loss by increasing evaporative and dry heat dissipation. In this context, animals such as dogs and cats increase their ventilation during heat exposure, a response known as panting, serving as their primary heat-loss response. During exercise with heat stress, panting animals must regulate their ventilation to accommodate both metabolic and thermal demands. In this regard, Baker and Nijland (1993) reported that in goats, severe dehydration (9.2% body mass loss!) reduced respiratory evaporative heat loss (hence body water loss) at given central blood temperatures during treadmill walking with lost weight compensated by weighed saddlebags. Their data suggest an attenuated panting response, which aligns with fluid-conservation mechanisms. It should be emphasized that panting animals and humans exhibit distinct differences in heat-loss responses. Humans have evolved sweating function, enabling prolonged exercise in hot conditions, such as marathon races during the Summer Olympic Games. In contrast, although goats are capable of sweating, this response is short lived owing to sweat gland fatigue. Additionally, the extent of water and heat loss through ventilation in humans is minimal compared with panting animals. Therefore, in humans, although dehydration is known to impair the sweating response as a means to conserve body water, it remains unclear whether dehydration similarly attenuates hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation. As part of my master's thesis, I investigated whether dehydration influences hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation during exercise in the heat in sedentary or physically active male participants who performed both a fluid replacement trial and a no-fluid replacement trial in random order (Fujii et al., 2008). Participants completed two bouts of cycling exercise (30–60 min) at 50% of peak oxygen uptake in the heat, with a long recovery period between the bouts. During the recovery period in the fluid replacement trial, participants consumed water containing 25 mosmol/L of sodium, whereas no fluids were consumed in the no-fluid replacement trial. After the first exercise, participants lost 2.5% of their body mass in the no-fluid replacement trial, whereas the sodium drink successfully restored body fluid levels to a euhydrated state in the fluid replacement trial. Consequently, participants performed the second exercise bout with different hydration levels in each trial. Although the heat-loss response of cutaneous vasodilatation was attenuated in the no-fluid trial versus the fluid replacement trial, the slope relating minute ventilation and core temperature, an index of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation, remained unaffected. Thus, we conclude that dehydration (2.5% body mass loss before exercise) does not influence hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation during exercise in humans. As a follow-up study, González-Alonso et al. (2023) reanalysed previous data from studies conducted in Copenhagen, Denmark and Texas, USA. Their participants were endurance-trained individuals (cyclists) who exercised for a longer duration (∼120 min) at a higher intensity (60%–70% of maximal O2 uptake) relative to our study. In addition, the extent of dehydration (∼4% body mass loss) and hyperthermia (∼39.5°C core temperature) was more severe than in our study. Consistent with our findings, they demonstrated that minute ventilation was closely related to core temperature and that dehydration alone did not affect minute ventilation during exercise, because fluid replacement and blood volume restoration had no impact on ventilation. Based on measured blood variables, they found that circulating catecholamines were positively correlated with minute ventilation during exercise in the heat. Interestingly, they also discovered that infusion of adrenaline, a hormone known to mediate increases in body temperature and ventilation at rest, to levels comparable to those observed during high-intensity exercise, increased both core temperature and minute ventilation during prolonged exercise in the heat. Therefore, sympathoadrenal activation might partly mediate hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation during prolonged exercise in the heat. Baker, M. A., & Nijland, M. J. (1993). Selective brain cooling in goats: effects of exercise and dehydration. The Journal of Physiology, 471, 679–692. Fujii, N., Honda, Y., Hayashi, K., Kondo, N., & Nishiyasu, T. (2008). Effect of hypohydration on hyperthermic hyperpnea and cutaneous vasodilation during exercise in men. Journal of Applied Physiology, 105, 1509–1518. Gonzalez-Alonso, J., Calbet, J. A. L., Mora-Rodriguez, R., & Kippelen, P. (2023). Pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange during prolonged exercise in humans: Influence of dehydration, hyperthermia and sympathoadrenal activity. Experimental Physiology, 108, 188–206. Based on combined data from our study (Fujii et al., 2008) and González-Alonso et al. (2023), dehydration does not appear to affect hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation, as indicated by the linear relationship between minute ventilation and core temperature, during prolonged exercise in the heat in humans. However, dehydration can impair heat-loss responses, accelerating core temperature elevations, as observed by González-Alonso et al. (2023), ultimately exacerbating hyperventilation. Therefore, minimizing dehydration through fluid ingestion before and during prolonged exercise in the heat can attenuate hyperventilation by preventing an excessive increase in core temperature, potentially improving exercise tolerance or endurance performance in hot conditions. Likewise, any intervention that reduces core temperature (e.g., heat acclimatization, cooling) could alleviate the physiological and psychological strain associated with hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation, possibly improving endurance performance in the heat. However, the potential advantages of body weight reduction owing to dehydration should also be considered when evaluating endurance performance in weight-bearing exercises, such as running. Lastly, I would like to highlight the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in future research. We do not yet know whether the aforementioned findings obtained in human studies (Fujii et al., 2008; Gonzalez-Alonso et al., 2023) apply to severe-intensity exercise. It should be noted that during severe-intensity exercise, O2 uptake and CO2 output drift over time, complicating the distinction between the effects of hyperthermia and metabolic stimuli on ventilation. It also remains uncertain whether similar results would be observed in different populations, such as elite athletes, older adults, children and females. Regarding females, both our study (Fujii et al., 2008) and the study by González-Alonso et al. (2023) tested males only, because limited attention was given to testing females when the original data in these studies were published [González-Alonso et al. (2023) reanalysed data initially published between 1996 and 2000]. Sole author. None declared. None.

The problem of climate change has not only acquired the significance as a global ecological and socio-economic problem, but more and more citizens are disturbed of it. In recent years, the fight for climate safety has increasingly been seen as a fight for democratic values. After all, only in a democratic state is the fight for climate protection perceived as an unconditional imperative. At the initiative of the citizens of Portugal, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers the case of Duarte Agostinho and Others v. Portugal and Others (39371/20) regarding emissions of greenhouse gases in Portugal and other 32 states, which, according to the applicants, lead to an increase in the level of global warming and negatively aﬀect the living conditions and health of the applicants. Obviously, the satisfaction of the application of the citizens of Portugal will create a precedent that will allow the citizens of one country to apply to the ECHR for climate damage compensation from any member state of the Council of Europe. Therefore, the growth of the legal capacity of citizens to protect their climate rights determines the need to improve legal mechanisms to strengthen control over the state of the climate. The negative impact on the climate is caused not only by such generally recognized industrial factors as industrial emissions, use of fossil fuels, etc., but also by many other types of human production activities that were previously not realized or considered insignificant. One of such types of production activity is agriculture. The issue of preventing or reducing the release of greenhouse gases in agriculture is becoming more and more important in the EU. In particular, in December 2019, the European Union introduced ambitious energy transition program — the European Green Deal, the implementation of which is designed to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. Adequate legal means are being sought in the EU to implement plans to achieve climate neutrality in agriculture as well. Thus, the European Commission plans to introduce an initiative that will include a new green business model to reward land managers for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. During the last decade, Ukraine's agriculture started also to be the sector with the sharpest tendency to increase greenhouse gas emissions. It is caused by the degradation of lands because of their intensive agricultural and other use, which leads to the release into the atmosphere of carbon accumulated in the soil during the thousand-year process of soil formation. Unfortunately, the compliance of Ukrainian legislation with EU law in terms of environmental and climate protection can be assessed as initial. In many new or updated national development strategies achieving climate neutrality is declared one of the priority targets. However, the legal acts of Ukraine do not contain eﬀective legal mechanisms for ensuring climate neutrality. There are no norms in the legislation of Ukraine that would regulate the climate-protective use of land, aimed at preventing or at least reducing carbon emissions into the atmosphere in the process of farming. Farmers of Ukraine also faced the negative consequences of soil degradation. Despite the lack of a suﬃcient legal basis in national legislation, they began to search for ways to minimize such soil degradation by improving methods of soil cultivation in agriculture. One such method is carbon farming. It is a direction of climate protection activities, which involves the use of land resources, in which CO2 is eﬀectively extracted from the atmosphere through plant photosynthesis and preserved in the form of organic matter in the soil and plant residues (carbon sequestration). In recent years, a new type of business activity has emerged in European countries — trading of reduced carbon emissions, and companies have appeared that oﬀer farmers to sell such reduced emissions. Recently, the international company Agreena entered the Ukrainian market, oﬀering domestic agricultural producers to sell to it the amount of carbon retained in soils in the process of carbon farming. The Agreena company provides measurement and independent verification of the amount of carbon retained by a farm in the soil and turns it into a financial instrument in the form of carbon certificates. Such a system encourages those who have excess emissions to pay for it and allows those who reduce these emissions to earn from such reduction. At the same time, cases of the use of carbon farming technologies by Ukrainian agrarians are occurred solely as an initiative of the farmers themselves, who are guided by the motives of social responsibility, the desire to improve the environment, devotion to democratic values, etc. This state of legal regulation of carbon farming relations is unsatisfactory. Ukraine must significantly improve its climate policy and climate protection legislation in the sphere of regulation of agrarian and land relations. Obviously, the best option for the introduction of legal regulation of carbon farming is to combine in the legislation clear rules of behavior of the subjects of such relations, the introduction of a system of legal and economic incentives for the subjects to achieve the goal of the corresponding legal regulation, the provision of state support to farmers in the transition to carbon farming technologies, and as well as the implementation of state control over compliance of farmers who received state support in the application of carbon farming technologies with the relevant legal norms. It is expedient to base the formation of legal regulation of carbon farming on the principle of climate neutrality, which provides that any actions of subjects of legal relations must comply with carbon farming indicators established by the state. However, it is advisable to start the formation of a legal mechanism for the introduction of carbon farming based on «soft» law — a system of legal norms that contain recommendations and incentives for the transition of agricultural producers from traditional methods of farming to the standards of carbon farming. The state should promote the use of carbon farming methods by agrarians by approving and distributing recommendations on use of carbon farming methods by agricultural enterprises and farms in order to systematize and bring to the attention of agricultural producers the available, practice-tested knowledge in the field of modern climate protection farming technologies. The next step in the formation of legal support for carbon farming should be the introduction into legislation of legal norms aimed at providing economic stimulation of farmers' transition to carbon farming standards. The basis of such norms may be the carbon certification of soil cover of fields declared as lands of carbon agriculture. The legal mechanism for the transition of agricultural producers to the standards of carbon farming should be suﬃciently simple and transparent. For its implementation, it seems appropriate to use the well-functioning system of the State Agrarian Register, which is an online platform for registering farmers who receive state support. Finally, as part of the legal mechanism for conducting carbon farming, might be provisions that regulate the carbon certification of agricultural producers who have switched to the principles of carbon farming. A clear system of carbon certification will ensure the implementation of eﬀective state control over the achieved volumes of carbon retained in the soil and will contribute to the introduction of targeted stimulation of agricultural producers. In the future, with an increase in the level of eﬀectiveness of state control over the use and protection of land with the use of advanced information technologies such as remote sensing of land and soil, the ratio between the norms of «soft» and «hard» law in the legal mechanism of conducting carbon farming will change to the benefit of the latter. Key words: climate, human rights, climate policy, green transition, carbon agriculture, land, law.
