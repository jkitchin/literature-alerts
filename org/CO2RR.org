Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction by CO2 reductases is a promising approach for biomanufacturing. Among all known biological or chemical catalysts, hydrogen-dependent carbon dioxide reductase from Thermoanaerobacter kivui (TkHDCR) possesses the highest activity toward CO2 reduction. Herein, we engineer TkHDCR to generate an electro-responsive carbon dioxide reductase considering the safety and convenience. To achieve this purpose, a recombinant Escherichia coli TkHDCR overexpression system is established. The formate dehydrogenase is obtained via subunit truncation and rational design, which enables direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalysis with a near-zero overpotential. By applying a constant voltage of −500 mV (vs. SHE) to a mediated electrolytic cell, 22.8 ± 1.6 mM formate is synthesized in 16 h with an average production rate of 7.1 ± 0.5 μmol h−1cm−2, a Faradaic efficiency of 98.9% and a half-cell energy efficiency of 94.4%. This study provides an enzyme candidate for high efficient CO2 reduction and opens up a way to develop paradigm for CO2-based bio-manufacturing. Thermoanaerobacter kivui-drived CO2 reductase (TkHDCR) requires hydrogen as substrate, which can lead to safety issue. Here, the authors engineered TkHDCR into an electro-responsive carbon dioxide reductase to harvest electrons from either an external mediator or a polarized electroactive surface.

In recent years, the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) has made many advances in C2+ production. Cu+/Cu0 site is beneficial for C‐C coupling process, but the oxidation state of copper cannot be well maintained during the reaction process, resulting in a decrease in catalyst activity. Based on this consideration, in this work, transition metal oxide CeO2 with a hollow cube structure and oxygen vacancies was introduced to stabilize and increase Cu+/Cu0 active sites (Ce1Cu2). The catalyst exhibits excellent CO2RR performance, with FEC2+ achieving 73.52% and jC2+ > 280 mA/cm2 at 1.26 V (vs. RHE). Ethanol is the main C2+ product and FEethanol reaches 39% at 1.26 V. The experimental results indicate that the presence of CeO2 provides a large number of oxygen vacancies and forming Cu+‐O2‐‐Ce4+ structure by the strong interaction of CeO2 and Cu NPs. The structure of Cu+‐O2‐‐Ce4+ and abundant oxygen vacancies lay a good foundation for the CO2 adsorption. Moreover, it increases the content of Cu+/Cu0 sites, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction, promoting the C‐C coupling interaction, thereby facilitating the generation of C2+ products. The DFT theoretical calculation further demonstrates that Ce1Cu2 is more inclined towards the ethanol pathway, confirming its high selectivity for ethanol.

The efficient conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) requires the development of stable catalysts with high selectivity and reactivity within a wide potential range. Here, the high-entropy metal sulfide CuAgZnSnS4 is designed for CO2 reduction with excellent performance (FEcarbon products ≥ 90%) in whole test potential windows (600 mV) based on the synergistic effect of the high-entropy metal sulfide. In particular, CuAgZnSnS4 exhibits better single-product selectivity with the highest FEHCOOH/FECO value (29.03) at −1.28 versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In combination with in situ measurements and theoretical calculations, it is further revealed that the synergistic effect of CuAgZnSnS4 realizes the controllable regulation of the surface electronic structure at Sn active sites, strengthening orbital interactions between *OCHO and Sn active sites. As a result, the effective adsorption and activation of *OCHO instead of *H are obtained, improving the single-product selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly. Our findings may complete the understanding of the synergistic effect for high-entropy materials in catalysis and offer new insight into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity.

Efficient CO2 utilization is a critical component of closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Most studies have focused on using pure streams of CO2. However, CO2 is generally only available in dilute streams, which requires capture by sorbents followed by energy intensive regeneration to release concentrated CO2. Direct utilization of sorbed-CO2 avoids the costly regeneration step. Furthermore, the sorbent-CO2 interaction can kinetically activate CO2 and tune its reactivity to access products that could otherwise be inaccessible with direct CO2 reduction. We demonstrate that an N-heterocyclic carbene, 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (DPIy), can capture CO2 from dilute streams (0.04% and 10%) to form 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium-2-carboxylate (DPICx) quantitatively. Electrocatalyst iron tetraphenylporphyrin chloride (Fe(TPP)Cl) typically reduces CO2 to CO; however, with DPICx as the substrate, the 8-electron reduced product methane (CH4) is produced with high (>85%) Faradaic efficiency and regeneration of the sorbent DPIy. In addition to the overall energy and capital advantages of integrated CO2 capture and conversion, these studies illustrate how sorbents can serve a dual purpose for both CO2 capture and chemical auxiliary to access unique products. CO2 has a spectrum of reactivity with different types of sorbents; these results reveal how sorbent-CO2 interactions can be leveraged for integrated capture and utilization platforms to access a wider range of CO2-derived products.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is emerging as a promising technology to address anthropogenic carbon emissions, with the searching of effective catalysts being the primary barrier toward industrial implementation. This review starts from the long-standing debates over the role of subsurface oxygen and positively charged metal sites (Mδ+) within oxide-derived catalysts. Thereafter, we focus on the strategy of constructing metal–metal oxide hybrid catalysts, which is enriched with M1–O–M2 heterojunctions that capable of maintaining a positive valence state of active sites and improving CO2 reduction performance. Specifically, advances in metal–metal oxide hybrid catalysts for CO2-to-C1 conversions are overviewed for selective CO, formate, or CH4 production, respectively. Thereafter, we summarize the interfacial engineering approaches for Cu/MOx hybrid catalysts aimed at selective C2+ production, including the interfacial boundary density, the morphology effect of MOx support, the choice of MOx, and their interaction manipulation with Cu sites. This review concludes with an outlook on the challenges and future directions for developing precisely controlled hybrid catalysts with an in-depth understanding of structure–performance relationship. Continued interdisciplinary collaborations from materials science, surface chemistry, analytical methodology, and theoretical modeling will be pivotal in overcoming existing challenges and pushing the frontiers of CO2 reduction research.

One of the most promising approaches in solving the energy crisis and reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions is artificial photosynthetic CO2 reduction. The electrochemical method for CO2 reduction is more appealing since it can be operated under ambient conditions, and the product selectivity strongly depends on the applied potential. Perovskites with ferroelectric properties strongly adsorb linear CO2 molecules. In this study, barium titanate (BaTiO3) perovskite is used as an electrocatalyst to promote CO2 activation and conversion to CO. Perovskite catalysts were prepared by ball‐milling followed by annealing at 900 °C for 4 to 6 h in an open atmosphere. The TEM and SEM study shows that the particle size varies in the range of 80‐200 nm. Mixed phases of BaTiO3 and BaTi5O11 supported on nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes are found to be highly active for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 89.4% at ‐1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl in CO2 saturated 0.5 KOH solution. This study concludes that mixed phases of BaTiO3 and BaTi5O11 are more active and highly selective for CO2 conversion to CO compared to single‐phase BaTiO3.

Developing effective electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 to CO is essential for enhancing the global carbon cycle. In this article, we report the synthesis of Cu3P/C nanomaterials, derived from the copper-based MOF (HKUST-1), using a novel phosphidation method. To enhance the copper contents in the final material, HKUST-1 is impregnated in Cu2+ solutions of various concentrations, followed by phosphidation. Cu3P nanoparticles fully embedded in hierarchical carbon have been confirmed by using transmission electron microscopy. These nanoparticles exhibit remarkable efficiency in the reduction of CO2 to CO. Among the various synthesized electrocatalysts, the optimal electrocatalyst, i.e., (5 M) Cu3P/C demonstrates outstanding performance, which shows 88% Faradaic efficiency for CO production. It also demonstrates a low overpotential (η) of only 177 mV, a high current density (j) of 60 mA cm–2, and long-term stability over 20 h at various potentials in 0.1 M KHCO3 medium, making it an excellent choice for CO2 reduction applications. The catalyst's exceptional selectivity for converting CO2 to CO is further validated by qualitative detection of CO using the PdCl2 strips method.

Photocatalytic methods offer a sustainable approach to chemical production, reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources and addressing climate change. Traditional H2O2 production often involves hazardous chemicals, while photocatalysis is cleaner and generates fewer by-products. Similarly, rising CO2 levels from fossil fuel combustion contribute to global warming, making photocatalytic CO2 reduction via Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) a promising solution by repurposing CO2 into useful products. Chapter 1 introduced novel semiconductor photocatalysts including their syntheses strategies and their photocatalytic applications. This chapter subsequently introduced the photocatalytic production of H2O2 and the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. It covered the discussion of associated reaction mechanism, the preparation and performance of catalysts, as well as practical applications such as the production of H2O2 from seawater and the reduction of CO2 from exhaust gases. Finally, the challenges and aims of these works was discussed. Chapter 2 presented a BiOBr-lignin composite photocatalyst which was designed for producing H2O2 directly from seawater. Various characterization techniques revealed the structural morphological and optical properties of the photocatalyst. The presence of lignin not only provided structural support but also lowered the reduction potential of the catalyst. Furthermore, the functional groups in the lignin acted as an electron sink upon ionization with metal ions present in the seawater, facilitated through Bronsted-Lowry base proton abstraction. The study delved into the oxygen reduction reaction mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic process. Chapter 3 discussed a Mn-based single atom photocatalyst which were designed for the efficient production of H2O2 directly from seawater through the water oxidation reaction. Advanced characterization techniques and multiscale molecular modeling revealed the structural morphological and electronic properties of the Mn-photocatalyst. The research was delved into the mechanism of the water oxidation reaction. It was found that the atomically dispersed Mn centers played a crucial role in promoting the formation of hydroxy radical (•OH), which was essential intermediates in the production of H2O2. Chapter 4 focused on an iron-based photocatalyst which has been designed for converting impure CO2 streams into valuable products as part of the carbon capture and utilization (CCU) approach. This catalyst demonstrated an impressive production rate of 145 mmol g-1 h-1 for CO generation, highlighting its efficiency in utilizing sunlight for chemical transformation. The comprehensive characterization, mechanistic insights, and impressive performance metrics underscore its potential for practical applications in carbon capture and utilization strategies.

Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C−C coupling. Herein, we designed highly active metal atom clusters anchored on semiconductor nanosheet, which established heteroatom sites on the interface to steer C−C coupling, realizing air‐concentration CO2 photoreduction into C2H4 in pure water for the first time. As an example, the Pd nanoclusters loaded on ZnO nanosheets are prepared, demonstrated by the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high‐angle annular dark‐field image. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the C−C coupling step over the Pd‐ZnO nanosheets, while quasi in situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrates the active sites of Pd and Zn atoms on the Pd‐ZnO nanosheets during CO2 photoreduction. Density functional theoretical calculations unveil the transition state energy barrier of C–C coupling of CO* and COH* intermediates are only 0.998 eV, hinting the easy C–C coupling to produce C2 fuels. Therefore, the Pd‐ZnO nanosheets first realize C2H4 photosynthesis by atmospheric‐concentration CO2 reduction with the formation rate of 1.03 μmol g−1 h−1, while the ZnO nanosheets only acquired the carbon monoxide product.

A new ruthenium(II) NAD (NAD = Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) type bis‐carbonyl complex, [Ru(bpy)(pbn)(CO)2]2+ [pbn = 2‐(pyridin‐2‐yl)benzo[b]‐1,5‐naphthyridine; bpy = 2,2'‐bipyridine] [1]2+, was successfully synthesized and fully characterized by single‐crystal X‐ray structural analysis, ESI‐MS, IR and NMR spectroscopy. Complex [1]2+ together with [Ru(bpy)(pbn)(CO)(COOH)]+ and/or [Ru(bpy)(pbn) (CO)(CO2)]0 complexes exist as equilibrium mixtures in aqueous solutions as evident from spectroscopic study. Chemical reduction of [1]2+ resulted the formation corresponding NADH form i.e., [Ru(bpy)(pbnHH)(CO)2]2+ (pbnHH = 2‐(pyridin‐2‐yl)‐5,10‐dihydrobenzo[b][1,5]naphthyridine) [1.HH]2+ as a two‐electron‐reduced species. The electrochemical behavior of complex [1]2+ in the presence of acid was investigated based on cyclic voltammetry analysis. A control potential electrolysis of [1]2+ afforded formate (HCOO‐) as the major product with a lesser amount of CO and H2, whereas that of [Ru(bpy)2(CO)2]2+ complex produced CO as the main product with a lesser amount of HCOO‐ and H2. The experimental results suggest that the selectivity of HCOO‐ over CO should be due to catalytic hydride transfer from the NADH‐type ligands of [1]2+ to CO2.

Human activities are a significant contributor to climate change, with rising levels of CO₂ in the atmosphere. Several carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) methods have been developed to address this issue. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and remote sensing technologies are emerging as significant improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of atmospheric carbon capture initiatives. This research examines using UAVs and remote sensing technologies to monitor, quantify, and manage atmospheric CO₂ levels. Furthermore, the study explores the implications of integrating robotic-drone technology, emphasizing their ability to contribute to a sustainable future. These technologies, incorporating modern data collection and analysis methodologies, provide promising answers for climate change mitigation and long-term environmental sustainability.

Electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (eCO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals offers an attractive strategy to solve energy and environmental problems simultaneously. We have mapped out entire reaction pathways of eCO2RR to CO on Cu(100), including all intermediates and transition states using first‐principles simulations. To accurately account for the solvent effect, the reaction was investigated with and without explicit water molecules, highlighting the limitations of the often (mis)used vacuum reaction pathway simplification. The results show that the reduction reaction was initiated under neutral pH conditions at an applied potential of –0.11 V (RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) and all elementary reactions were thermodynamically favorable, while an applied potential of –1.24 V is required to ensure that all reactions exhibit spontaneous behavior. Detailed analysis revealed that solvation significantly influences the stability of the adsorbates and intermediates. Its inclusion notably alters the calculated reaction kinetics and energetic parameters by lowering the barrier energies and Gibbs free energies of all reactions. CO production proceeded mainly via the COOH* pathway (CO2‐‐>trans‐COOH*‐‐>cis‐COOH*‐‐>CO*+OH*‐‐>CO*‐‐>CO). The use of water as a more sustainable and cost‐effective solvent is compared to other options such as organic solvents, ionic liquids and mixed solvent systems, which are less sustainable and more expensive.

Abstract: One of the first gas lasers to be created was the carbon-dioxide laser (CO2 laser). One of the most practical kinds of lasers, it was created in 1964 by Bell Labs' Kumar Patel [22]. The most powerful continuous-wave lasers on the market right now are carbon-dioxide lasers. Additionally, they are quite efficient; the output power to pump power ratio can reach 20%. The primary wavelength bands of the infrared light beam produced by the CO2 laser are 9.6 and 10.6 micrometers (μm). [22] In order to improve its performance, a carbon dioxide laser uses carbon dioxide as its main gain medium. Nitrogen (N2), helium (He), and occasionally hydrogen (H2), water vapor, oxygen, or xenon (Xe) are added. This laser works by energizing the gas mixture to produce laser light by promoting the emission of radiation by an electrical gas discharge. In carbon dioxide lasers, the electrical gas discharge can be powered by radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), or alternating current (AC). The wavelength of the light emitted by these lasers is 10.6 micrometers. In dermatology, they are frequently used for operations like wrinkle reduction, scar removal, and sun damage treatment. Furthermore, for accurate cutting and tissue removal, carbon dioxide lasers are employed as surgical instruments in specialties such as neurosurgery and gynecology.[24]

This study focused on the land use (LU) structure and carbon emissions (CEs) in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai provinces of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China from 2000 to 2020, using the STIRPAT model and scenario analysis (SA). We conducted an analysis of the influence exerted by relevant factors on land use carbon emissions (LUCEs) and made forecasts regarding the diverse development scenarios of CE trends, aiming to provide methodological guidance for validating the effectiveness of existing policies in reducing CEs and offer direction for achieving the peak CO2 emissions target as soon as possible. It also constitutes a significant reference for the early realization of the peak CO2 emissions target. The results indicated the following: (1) Between 2000 and 2020, CEs resulting from LU in the YRD rose from 2.70 × 108 t to 9.10 × 108 t, marking an increase of 243.77%. In 2020, the built-up area was the predominant contributor to CEs, representing 99.15% of the overall carbon sources, whereas forests served as the main carbon sink, comprising 92.37% of the total carbon sinks (CSs) for that year. (2) For each percent increase in the parameters considered in this study, the corresponding increases in LU CO2 emissions were estimated to be: 1.932% (population), 0.241% (GDP per capita), −0.141% (energy intensity), 0.043% (consumption structure), 1.045% (industrial structure), and 0.975% (urbanization). (3) According to the existing policy framework and development plans, the YRD is expected to achieve peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. If energy conservation and carbon reduction strategies are implemented, this peak could be achieved as early as 2025. However, if economic growth continues to depend primarily on fossil fuel consumption, the region may not hit its carbon peak until 2035. (4) The low-carbon scenario, which considers the needs of social progress alongside the intensity of carbon emission reductions, represents the most effective development strategy for reaching a carbon peak in LU within the YRD. Effectively managing population size and facilitating the upgrading of industrial structures are key strategies to hasten the achievement of peaking carbon dioxide emissions in the region.

The agenda to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in order to mitigate climate change remains a global concern. Researchers, policymakers and governments have shown interest in this regard. While empirical studies on the subject matter has been increasing conflicting results and little evidence on the effects of some variables necessitate for further studies. In this study the effect of female population, urbanization and trade openness on carbon dioxide emission in Ghana is assessed. The study used the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, & Technology (STIRPAT) model as the foundation for empirical modelling. Time series data spanning from 1971-2018 was used for regression analysis. In both long run and short run periods, urbanization was noted to exert positive influence on carbon dioxide emission while trade openness and female population exert negative effect on carbon dioxide emission. Thus, growth in urbanization increases carbon dioxide emission while the opposite is the case for trade openness and female population. Findings from the study suggest intensifying the empowerment of women could be a crucial catalyst for the achievement of Ghana’s nationally determined contributions toward CO2 reduction. Also, trade negotiations that promote environmental protection should not be relaxed

Eco-design is an important consideration in the development of home appliance products. It encourages the use of more environmentally friendly materials in the manufacturing of appliances to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, limit energy consumption and improve product performance. This paper offers a thorough method for eco-design using CAD tools, emphasizing material selection to reduce environmental impacts throughout a product’s lifecycle. CAD systems are combined with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), as demonstrated in a case study involving an electric iron device. The research presents a systematic approach to minimizing adverse effects by evaluating environmental impacts, particularly CO2 emissions and energy consumption, and comparing alternative materials. According to the findings, the substitution of aluminium oxide for stainless steel in the iron plate component can significantly reduce the environmental impact, resulting in reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption by 82.02 % and 80.42% respectively. This method will help designers to make well-informed choices early in the design process to improve product sustainability and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of material selection to eco-design as well as how the use of CAD-integrated LCA tools may promote the creation of sustainable products. Keywords: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Computer-aided design (CAD), Eco-design, Home appliance product, Environmental impact reduction, CO2 emissions, Energy consumption.

Capturing and repurposing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is the traditional way to deal with climate change and lack of fossil fuel. CO2 adsorption (reduction) is the first step in this process. We have employed density functional theory-based calculations to investigate CO2 activation over the pristine and Cu-decorated carbon-based two-dimensional ψ-graphene material and its hydrogenated forms, i.e., ψ-graphone (half hydrogenated) and ψ-graphane (fully hydrogenated). ψ-graphene is a metallic allotrope of graphene containing 5-6-7 membered carbon rings. Our study found exothermic binding of CO2 with all three materials (for both pristine and Cu-decorated materials), indicating spontaneous physisorption. The presence of single atoms of the transition metal plays a significant role in increasing the activity of materials towards CO2 activation. We observed that the adsorption energy increases about three times after decorating a ψ-graphene sheet with Cu atoms. In contrast, no significant variation is observed on ψ-graphone or ψ-graphane materials. Our Bader charge analysis confirms the charge transfer from 2d nano-sheets to the molecule, where the values of calculated adsorption energies and the density of states suggest that the interaction between CO2 and these three materials can be categorized as weak physisorption., while Cu decoration enhances the CO2 adsorption.

Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to a decrease in anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such a decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this timescale. The rate of decrease in excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments have been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above the pre-pulse amount for the pulse experiment or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above the preindustrial amount for the abrupt cessation experiment) were found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.

Abstract. Ocean liming has gained attention as a potential solution to mitigate climate change by actively removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The addition of hydrated lime to oceanic surface water leads to an increase in alkalinity, which in turn promotes the uptake and sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Despite the potential of this technique, its effects on the marine ecosystem are still far from understood, and there is currently no information on the potential impacts on the concentration and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is one of the largest, most complex and yet least understood mixtures of organic molecules on Earth. The aim of this study is to provide the first experimental evidence about the potential effects of hydrated lime addition on DOM dynamics in the oceans by assessing changes in its concentration and optical properties (absorption and fluorescence). To investigate the effects of liming on DOM pools with different concentrations and quality, seawater was collected from two contrasting environments: the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea, known for its dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration comparable to that observed in the oceans, and the eutrophic Baltic Sea, characterized by high DOM concentration mostly of terrestrial origin. Hydrated lime was added to both waters to reach pH values of 9 and 10. Our findings reveal that the addition of hydrated lime has a noticeable effect on DOM dynamics in both the Mediterranean Sea and Baltic Sea, determining a reduction in DOC concentration and a change in the optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) of DOM. These effects, detectable at pH 9, become significant at pH 10 and are more pronounced in the Mediterranean Sea than in the Baltic Sea. These potential short-term effects should be considered within the context of the physicochemical properties of seawater and the seasonal variability.

The UK Net Zero by 2050 Policy was undemocratically adopted by the UK government in 2019. Yet the science of so-called &lsquo;greenhouse gases&rsquo; is well known and there is no reason to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), or nitrous oxide (N2O) because absorption of radiation is logarithmic. Adding to or removing these naturally occurring gases from the atmosphere will make little difference to the temperature or the climate. Water vapor (H2O) is claimed to be a much stronger &lsquo;greenhouse gas&rsquo; than CO2, CH4 or N2O but cannot be regulated because it occurs naturally in vast quantities. This work explores the established science and recent developments in scientific knowledge around Net Zero with a view to making a rational recommendation for policy makers. There is little scientific evidence to support the case for Net Zero and that greenhouse gases are unlikely to contribute to a &lsquo;climate emergency&rsquo; at current or any likely future higher concentrations. There is a case against the adoption of Net Zero given the enormous costs associated with implementing the policy, and the fact it is unlikely to achieve reductions in average near surface global air temperature, regardless of whether Net Zero is fully implemented and adopted worldwide. Therefore, Net Zero does not pass the cost-benefit test. The recommended policy is to abandon Net Zero and do nothing about so-called &lsquo;greenhouse gases&rsquo;.

By hydrogenating carbon dioxide to value-added products such as methanol, heterogeneous catalysts can lower greenhouse gas emissions and generate alternative liquid fuels. The most common commercial catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to methanol is Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, where ZnO improves conversion and selectivity toward methanol. The structure of this catalyst is thought to be Zn oxy(hydroxyl) overlayers on the nanometer scale on Cu. In the presence of CO2 and H2 under reaction conditions, the Cu substrate itself can be restructured and/or partially oxidized at its interface with ZnO, or the Zn might be reduced, possibly completely to a CuZn alloy, making the exact structure and stoichiometry of the active site a topic of active debate. In this study, we examine Zn3 clusters on Cu(100) and Cu(111), as a subnano model of the catalyst. We use a grand canonical genetic algorithm to sample the system structure and stoichiometry under catalytic conditions: T of 550 K, initial partial pressures of H2 of 4.5 atm and CO2 of 0.5 atm, and 1% conversion. We uncover a strong dependence of the catalyst stoichiometry on the surface coverage. At the optimal 0.2 ML surface coverage, chains of Zn(OH) form on both Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), the catalyst has many thermally accessible metastable minima, whereas on Cu(111), it does not. No oxidation or reconstruction of the Cu is found. However, at a lower coverage of Zn, Zn3 clusters take on a metallic form on Cu(100), and slightly oxidized Zn3O on Cu(111), while the surface uptakes H to form a variety of low hydrides of Cu. We thus hypothesize that the 0.2 ML Zn coverage is optimal, as found experimentally, because of the stronger yet incomplete oxidation afforded by Zn at this coverage.

Abstract. Previous phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) have primarily focused on simulations driven by atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), for both idealized model experiments and climate projections of different emissions scenarios. We argue that although this approach was practical to allow parallel development of Earth system model simulations and detailed socioeconomic futures, carbon cycle uncertainty as represented by diverse, process-resolving Earth system models (ESMs) is not manifested in the scenario outcomes, thus omitting a dominant source of uncertainty in meeting the Paris Agreement. Mitigation policy is defined in terms of human activity (including emissions), with strategies varying in their timing of net-zero emissions, the balance of mitigation effort between short-lived and long-lived climate forcers, their reliance on land use strategy, and the extent and timing of carbon removals. To explore the response to these drivers, ESMs need to explicitly represent complete cycles of major GHGs, including natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Carbon removal and sequestration strategies, which rely on proposed human management of natural systems, are currently calculated in integrated assessment models (IAMs) during scenario development with only the net carbon emissions passed to the ESM. However, proper accounting of the coupled system impacts of and feedback on such interventions requires explicit process representation in ESMs to build self-consistent physical representations of their potential effectiveness and risks under climate change. We propose that CMIP7 efforts prioritize simulations driven by CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and projected deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, as well as land use and management, using the process resolution allowed by state-of-the-art ESMs to resolve carbon–climate feedbacks. Post-CMIP7 ambitions should aim to incorporate modeling of non-CO2 GHGs (in particular, sources and sinks of methane and nitrous oxide) and process-based representation of carbon removal options. These developments will allow three primary benefits: (1) resources to be allocated to policy-relevant climate projections and better real-time information related to the detectability and verification of emissions reductions and their relationship to expected near-term climate impacts, (2) scenario modeling of the range of possible future climate states including Earth system processes and feedbacks that are increasingly well-represented in ESMs, and (3) optimal utilization of the strengths of ESMs in the wider context of climate modeling infrastructure (which includes simple climate models, machine learning approaches and kilometer-scale climate models).

[EMBARGOED UNTIL 08/01/2025] This thesis investigates the impact of nitrification inhibitors and varying fertilizer rates on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield in agricultural systems. Fertilized agricultural soils can experience notable losses of nitrogen gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) after the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. In the Midwest U.S., anhydrous ammonia and urea are common nitrogen sources used in corn cropping systems. Nitrification inhibitors pronitridine and dicyandiamide (DCD) have demonstrated potential to enhance corn grain yield when applied with N fertilizer. The first chapter explores the efficacy of pronitridine in reducing N2O and NH3 emissions from corn fields fertilized with anhydrous ammonia. Results from field trials conducted in Northeast Missouri over two growing seasons indicated that while pronitridine did not significantly reduce cumulative NH3 emissions in both seasons, it lowered N2O emissions from higher fertilizer rates in the 2023 growing season. Grain yield increased with fertilizer rate and the addition of pronitridine. Overall, we found that pronitridine did not affect cumulative N2O and NH3 emissions (outside of 202N fertilizer rate for N2O in 2023) but has the potential to increase grain yield. The second chapter examines the effects of urea fertilizer and DCD on N2O, NH3, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) in bare soil. Findings revealed that increased fertilizer rates led to higher NH3 emissions, while DCD application had a marginal effect on reducing N2O emissions, with greater reductions observed at higher DCD rates. Our data supports other work concluding DCD has the potential to reduce N2O emissions but highlights the potential for greater reductions through increased DCD rates.

Given the global urgency to mitigate climate change, a key action is the development of effective carbon concentration reduction policies. To this end, an influential factor is the availability of accurate predictions of carbon concentration trends. The existing spatiotemporal correlation as well as the diversity of influential factors, pose important challenges in accurately modeling these trends. In this work, different strategies based on deep learning are proposed with the aim of predicting global carbon dioxide and methane concentrations. For this purpose, satellite observations are used for six-month projections, covering geographical regions that span the globe. In addition, complementary environmental variables are integrated to improve the predictive capacity of the proposed models. The results obtained demonstrate the high accuracy of the predictions, in particular of models based on graphical neural networks, reaffirming the great potential of deep learning techniques in predicting carbon dioxide and methane concentrations. Likewise, the effectiveness of models based on deep learning to accurately predict carbon concentrations by incorporating dynamic and static information is demonstrated.

This study proposes a dual-fuel approach combining diesel and ammonia in a single-cylinder compression ignition engine to reduce harmful emissions from internal combustion. Diesel is directly injected into the combustion chamber, while ammonia is introduced through the intake manifold with intake air. In this study, injection timing and the percentage of ammonia energy fraction was varied. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model simulates the combustion and emission processes to assess the impact of varying diesel injection timings and ammonia energy contributions. Findings indicate that as ammonia content increases, the engine experiences reductions in peak in-cylinder pressure, temperature, heat release rate, as well as overall efficiency and power output. Emission results suggest that greater ammonia usage leads to a reduction in soot, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and unburned hydrocarbons, though a slight increase in nitrogen oxides emissions is observed. This analysis supports ammonia’s potential as a low-emission alternative fuel in future compression ignition engines.

As urbanization continues to accelerate, the application of permeable concrete is becoming an increasingly prevalent practice. Nevertheless, the carbon dioxide emission issue associated with traditional permeable concrete cannot be overlooked. In this study, alkali-activated sintered sludge and slag were employed as raw materials to prepare alkali-activated sintered sludge-slag-based permeable concrete. The effects of sludge calcination temperature, sludge content, and binder-to-aggregate ratio on the compressive strength, porosity, and permeability coefficient of the permeable concrete were investigated through the implementation of one-way experiments. The formation mechanism of permeable concrete materials was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and a carbon emission assessment was performed. The findings indicated that an increase in sludge content resulted in a notable decline in the 28-day compressive strength, accompanied by a reduction in the Ca/Si ratio of the C-A-S-H hydration products, from 1.08 to 0.35. Conversely, the carbon emission assessment demonstrated that abiotic losses declined markedly with an increase in sludge content, effectively mitigating the carbon emission burden associated with construction materials.

ABSTRACT Incorporating suitable promoters into nickel‐based catalysts for carbon dioxide methanation proves to be a successful strategy for enhancing catalyst structure, optimizing surface properties, mitigating deactivation, and ultimately boosting catalytic performance. This study focuses on the synthesis of Co‐modified Ni/CaCO 3 catalysts using the solution combustion synthesis method. The catalytic activity of the afforded catalysts has been evaluated for CO 2 methanation in a dielectric barrier discharge reactor operating at a gaseous hourly space velocity of 11,320 h −1 and an H 2 :CO 2 ratio of 4:1. The catalyst exhibits optimal performance at a Ni:Co ratio of 13:2, achieving a CO 2 conversion rate of 57.5% and CH 4 selectivity of 92.4%. Characterization techniques such as X‐ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, programmed temperature‐raising hydrogen reduction, carbon dioxide desorption, and in situ plasma DRIFTS are employed to evaluate the catalysts. The results indicate that the addition of Co to Ni‐based catalysts leads to an increase in moderately basic sites, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of catalysts for CO 2 methanation. Notably, the combination of the plasma and the Ni–Co catalyst offers a novel pathway for CO 2 methanation, featuring higher energy efficiency and superior synergistic effects compared to monometallic catalysts.

The search for low-cost, durable, and effective catalysts is essential for green hydrogen production and carbon dioxide upcycling to help in the mitigation of climate change. Discovery of new catalysts is currently limited by the gap between what AI-accelerated computational models predict and what experimental studies produce. To make progress, large and diverse experimental datasets are needed that are reproducible and tested at industrially-relevant conditions. We address these needs by utilizing a comprehensive high-throughput characterization and experimental pipeline to create the Open Catalyst Experiments 2024 (OCX24) dataset. The dataset contains 572 samples synthesized using both wet and dry methods with X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction characterization. We prepared 441 gas diffusion electrodes, including replicates, and evaluated them using zero-gap electrolysis for carbon dioxide reduction (CO$_2$RR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities up to $300$ mA/cm$^2$. To find correlations with experimental outcomes and to perform computational screens, DFT-verified adsorption energies for six adsorbates were calculated on $\sim$20,000 inorganic materials requiring 685 million AI-accelerated relaxations. Remarkably from this large set of materials, a data driven Sabatier volcano independently identified Pt as being a top candidate for HER without having any experimental measurements on Pt or Pt-alloy samples. We anticipate the availability of experimental data generated specifically for AI training, such as OCX24, will significantly improve the utility of computational models in selecting materials for experimental screening.

Abstract Synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a representative pathway for CO2 resource utilisation, which can effectively reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. CeZrO2 can effectively catalyse the generation of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) by direct reaction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methanol (MeOH). However, its morphologically controllable synthesis and resolution of particle agglomeration remain a challenge. In this paper, uniformly dispersed rod-like structures were synthesised by adjusting the composition of the reaction solvent during CeZrO2 synthesis. Experiments and characterisation showed that the addition of alcohol directly affected the morphology and aggregation of ions in solution and promoted the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, thus improving the catalytic performance of rod-shaped CeZrO2. When n-butanol was added at an alcohol-to-water ratio of 1/1, the generation of DMC has been optimised at 4.36 mmol/g, which was about 10% higher than the performance of DMC from a single aqueous solution. In this work, a simple, efficient and rapid modification method was used to achieve the improvement of catalyst performance, and the modulation of the reaction solvent can effectively reduce the cost of catalyst production compared with the doping modification of the catalyst with metal elements, and this study is an important reference for the optimisation of the performance of other types of catalysts.

В публикации рассматриваются особенности технологии извлечения масла из семян кориандра - как традиционных, так и новой (с использованием диоксида углерода). При этом рассмотрены теоретические аспекты применения диоксида углерода как экстрагента в докритическом (жидком) и сверхкритическом (флюидном) состояниях применительно к извлечению растительных масел и иных компонентов из растительного сырья. Показано, что в процессе экстрагирования обоими видами растворителя жирного масла из масличного сырья, исходные свойства масла, оцениваемые по его жирнокислотному составу, сохраняются. Анализ данных по фракционному составу белков кориандрового шрота показывает, что для обоих вариантов экстрагирования, содержание водорастворимой фракции белков в шротах (наиболее ценной с точки зрения кормовой усвояемости) по сравнению с содержанием ее в соответствующих исходных образцах, снижается. Отмечено, что для другой ценной фракции белков - солерастворимой наблюдается другая тенденция: по сравнению с ее содержанием в исходных образцах процесс жидкостной экстракции вызывает ее снижение, а сверхкритической -повышение. Выход жирного кориандрового масла составил для экстракции жидким диоксидом углерода 68,47%, а для экстракции флюидом - 86,34%. The publication discusses the features of the technology of extracting oil from coriander seeds - both traditional and new (using carbon dioxide). The theoretical aspects of the application of carbon dioxide as an extractant in the precritical (liquid) and supercritical (fluid) states are considered in connection with the extraction of vegetable oils and other components from plant raw materials. It is shown that in the process of extraction by both kinds of a solvent of fatty oil from an oilseed raw material, the initial properties of the oil, evaluated by its fatty acid composition, are preserved. Analysis of the data on the fractional composition of coriander meal proteins shows that for both extraction variants, the content of the water-soluble fraction of proteins in the meal (the most valuable from the point of view of fodder assimilation), as compared with its content in the corresponding initial samples, is reduced. It is noted that for another valuable fraction of proteins - soluble, another tendency is observed: in comparison with its content in the initial samples, the process of liquid extraction causes its reduction, and supercritical - an increase. The yield of fatty coriander oil was 68.47% for extraction with liquid carbon dioxide, and 86.34% for extraction with fluid.

These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Purpose The healthcare sector contributes approximately 4% to 5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby impacting climate change. Various initiatives, including teleworking, have been considered to mitigate GHG emissions, but their environmental impact remains poorly defined in the healthcare sector. This study aims to evaluate the impact of teleworking by hospital pharmacists on GHG emissions reduction by comparing the actual situation at one Canadian hospital, which includes teleworking shifts from home, to a scenario where all working shifts necessitate travel to the hospital. Methods The study was conducted at the pharmacy department of an academic hospital with 86 pharmacists (75 pharmacist full-time equivalents), between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2023. Two different online carbon footprint calculators, one developed by the Centres de Gestion des Déplacements (CGD) and one available at the website of Carbon Footprint Ltd., were employed to measure mean GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) for individuals based on their modes of transport and distances traveled between home and work. Results During the study period, teleworking resulted in a significant reduction of mean GHG emissions per pharmacist relative to the scenario of all on-site shifts, with a reduction of 134 kg CO2eq (1,160 CO2eq vs 1,026 CO2eq; t = 3.32; P = 0.0007) estimated with the CGD calculator and a reduction of 135 kg CO2eq (1,117 CO2eq vs 982 CO2eq; t = 4.31; P &lt; 0.0001) estimated with the Carbon Footprint calculator. Those figures correspond to a reduction of 11.5% (11,249 kg CO2eq) to 12.1% (11,315 kg CO2eq) of the total quantity of emissions associated with commuting for the 84 pharmacists over 3 years. The median distance from home to the hospital was 10.0 (8.1) km, with nearly three-quarters of pharmacists commuting by public or active transport. Conclusion Teleworking has a positive environmental impact and could be implemented in other pharmacy departments. The implemented teleworking approach represents an encouraging initial step toward reducing the GHG emissions associated with the travel of employees.

Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a rapidly growing technology at the forefront of sustainable chemistry, leveraging the ability of microorganisms to catalyze electrochemical reactions to synthesize valuable compounds from renewable energy sources. The reduction of CO2 is a major target application for MES, but research in this area has been stifled, especially with the use of direct electron transfer (DET)-based microbial systems. The major fundamental hurdle that needs to be overcome is the low efficiency of CO2 reduction largely attributed to minimal microbial access to CO2 owing to its low solubility in the electrolyte. With their tunable physical properties, ionic liquids present a potential solution to this challenge and have previously shown promise in facilitating efficient CO2 electroreduction by increasing the CO2 solubility. However, the use of ionic liquids in MES remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 as a model DET strain. Electrochemical investigations demonstrated the ability of S. oneidensis MR-1 biocathodes to directly convert CO2 to formate with a faradaic efficiency of 34.5 ± 26.1%. The addition of [EMIM][Ac] to the system significantly increased cathodic current density and enhanced the faradaic efficiency to 94.5 ± 4.3% while concurrently amplifying the product yield from 34 ± 23 μM to 366 ± 34 μM. These findings demonstrate that ionic liquids can serve as efficient, biocompatible cosolvents for microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added products, holding promise for more robust applications of MES.

CO2-soluble surfactant foam systems have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance oil recovery, particularly in tight oil reservoirs where conventional water-soluble surfactants face challenges such as poor injectability and high reservoir sensitivity. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of the basic theory of CO2-soluble surfactant foam, its mechanism in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and the classification and application of various CO2-soluble surfactants. The application of these surfactants in tight oil reservoirs, where low permeability and high water sensitivity limit traditional methods, is highlighted as a promising solution to improve CO2 mobility control and increase oil recovery. The mechanism of enhanced oil recovery by CO2-soluble surfactant foam involves the effective reduction of CO2 fluidity, the decrease in oil–gas flow ratio, and the stabilization of the displacement front. Foam plays a vital role in mitigating the issues of channeling and gravity separation often caused by simple CO2 injection. The reduction in gas fluidity can be attributed to the increase in apparent viscosity and trapped gas fraction. Future research should prioritize the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly CO2-soluble surfactants. It is essential to further explore the advantages and challenges associated with their practical applications in order to maximize their potential impact.

Enhanced fire-prone weather under greenhouse gas warming can significantly affect local and global carbon budgets from increased fire occurrence, influencing carbon-climate feedbacks. However, the extent to which changes in fire-prone weather and associated carbon emissions can be mitigated by negative emissions remains uncertain. Here, we analyze fire weather responses in CO2 removal climate model experiments and estimate their potential carbon emissions based on an observational relationship between fire weather and fire-induced CO2 emissions. The results highlight that enhanced fire danger under global warming cannot be restored instantaneously by CO2 reduction, mainly due to atmospheric dryness maintained by climatic inertia. The exacerbated fire danger is projected to contribute to extra CO2 emissions in 68% of global regions due to the hysteresis of climate responses to CO2 levels. These findings highlight that even under global cooling from negative emissions, increased fire activity may reinforce the fire-carbon-climate feedback loop and result in further socio-economic damage. This study shows that increased fire risk under global warming may not decrease in line with CO2 reductions. The exacerbated fire danger is projected to contribute to extra CO2 emissions in 68% of the world due to the hysteresis of climate responses to CO2 levels.

In the quest to replace fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, developing energy technologies based on clean catalytic processes is fundamental. However, the cost-effectiveness of these technologies strongly relies on the availability of efficient catalysts made of abundant elements. Herein, this study presents a one-step hydrothermal method to obtain a series of Ni3Se4 nanoparticles with a layer of amorphous selenium on their surface. When employed as electrocatalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the optimized proper surface Se-coated Ni3Se4 nanoparticles exhibit a high current density of 160 mA cm–2 at 1.6 V, achieving a high methanol-to-formate Faradaic efficiency above 97.8% and excellent stability with less than 20% current decay after an 18 h chronoamperometry test. This excellent performance is rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which unveil that the electrochemical recombination of SeOx results in a reduction of the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation of methanol during the MOR process.

An important aspect of sustainable chemistry research is the discovery of novel chemical mechanisms by which otherwise inert molecules become activated toward useful transformations by earth’s most abundant elements. Compounds involving the most abundant metal on earth, aluminum, most commonly involve AlIII ions due to their noble gas electronic configurations. Although compounds with AlI ions have also been studied, the chemistry of AlII ions is nearly unknown and may contain undiscovered reaction manifolds. Here, we report the CO2 activation chemistry of an AlII complex supported by a chelating, dianionic ligand and investigate the electronic structure details and reaction mechanisms required to access this reactivity. We found that a heterobinuclear complex, (NON)Al- FeCp(CO)2 (1), undergoes reversible Al-Fe bond homolysis at ambient conditions to reveal the [(NON)Al]·/[CpFe(CO)2]· radical pair in situ. The presence of predominantly Al-centered spin density (i.e., an AlII ion) within this radical pair was established using experiments with radical scavengers as well as electronic structure calculations. Exposure of 1 to CO2 atmosphere resulted in insertion of CO2 into the Al-Fe bond. This net 2-electron CO2 reduction process was computationally modeled using quantum chemical calculations and direct dynamics simulations, revealing that reduction involves two 1-electron steps and, thus, depends on stabilization of high-energy [CO2]· - by coordination to aluminum. This mechanism for CO2 activation is unexpected given the canonical predisposition of CO2 for multi-electron reduction processes and demonstrates the possibility of discovering new reaction profiles of earth- abundant elements in unusual oxidation states.

We conducted combustion tests with marine gas oil (MGO) blended with bioethanol (BE) in ratios of 0%–30% to address International Maritime Organization air pollution regulations on exhaust gases emitted from ships and fossil fuel resource depletion and achieve carbon neutrality. We designed and manufactured a standard 1-ton combustion chamber, using an attached gun-type burner to analyze the exhaust gases of each sample under similar conditions. Compared to pure MGO (BE0), the oxygen content increased by approximately 1.91% at the maximum blend ratio (BE30), while carbon dioxide decreased by 1.39%. Nitrogen oxides were reduced by approximately 30%. Sulfur oxides were minimal (<0.03%), with MGO alone at approximately 0.08 ppm, confirming the superior quality of low-sulfur fuel. In all blends containing BE, no sulfur oxides were detected. Additionally, exhaust gas temperature decreased by 5.8%, and combustion efficiency decreased from 72.24% to 70.33%, a reduction of approximately 1.9%. This indicated that BE has a relatively lower calorific value; however, it provides a similar thermal output, with some reduction of exhaust emissions. A one-way ANOVA and post-hoc verification confirmed that with increased BE content, emission differences were significant ( p < 0.01 level in all areas). Through this study, it was confirmed that the use of eco-friendly fuels such as bioethanol has excellent effects on reducing exhaust emissions. It is analyzed that it would help solve global warming and air environment pollution problems. Therefore, it is determined that the future application of MGO-bioethanol blended fuel as an eco-friendly alternative fuel for ships holds significant potential, and positive outcomes are anticipated.

The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is a valuable strategy for energy storage. However, the formation of energy‐dense liquid fuels such as methanol remains rare, particularly under low‐temperature and ‐pressure conditions that can be coupled to renewable electricity sources via electrochemistry. Here, a multicatalyst system pairing an electrocatalyst with a thermal organometallic catalyst is introduced, which enables the reduction of CO2 to methanol at ambient temperature and pressure. The cascade methanol synthesis proceeds via CO2 reduction to formate by electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2’‐bipyridine), Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H‐PNP)Ir(H)3 (H‐PNP = HN(C2H4PiPr2)2). The isopropanol solvent plays several crucial roles: activating formate ion as isopropyl formate, donating hydrogen for the reduction of formate ester to methanol via transfer hydrogenation, and lowering the barrier for transfer hydrogenation through hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition to reporting a method for room‐temperature reduction of challenging ester substrates, this work provides a prototype for pairing electrochemical and thermal organometallic reactions that will guide the design and development of multicatalyst cascades.

The article considers the direction of increasing the energy and environmental efficiency of the city's energy infrastructure through the modernization of existing thermal power plants (TPP) and combined heat and power (CHP) plants using combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. Fuel and energy balances of electric power plants have been constructed, and the energy and environmental effects of the use of CCGT have been assessed. The modeling of energy and environmental indicators for the thermal circuits of the CCGT was conducted using the Thermoflex, GT PRO software (Thermoflow) and the ISC Manager program developed at the National Research University "Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI)". The analysis of CCGT efficiency in urban energy applications is based on modeling and optimizing the city’s fuel and energy balance (FEB). For this purpose, the OptiTEB program developed at the Department of PTS at the National Research University "MРEI" is used. Constructing fuel and energy systems in cities and regions is a pressing task that enables the planning of a strategy for the development of the urban fuel and energy complex (FEC), with an assessment of the magnitude of harmful emissions, including greenhouse gases. The article presents the results of work on establishing scientific foundations for modern heat supply systems, exemplified by a mathematical model of the Moscow thermal power plant and its optimization, taking into account the projected development of electric transport infrastructure over the coming decades, improving the thermal protection characteristics of newly constructed buildings, and the potential increase in the use of renewable energy sources (RES). The growth in the share of electric transport should be linked to an increase in the share of renewable energy sources (RES). Simply increasing the number of electric vehicles without a significant rise in renewable energy usage in the city's energy balance will not result in a reduction of carbon dioxide and harmful substance emissions. Expanding electricity generation through CCGT, alongside the growth of renewable energy use in the city, can lead to a significant decrease in carbon dioxide emissions.

The study examines the friction and wear properties of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloys under varying gas conditions. The alloy was tested in the presence of oxygen and carbon dioxide using a controlled atmosphere wear tester. The study revealed that the wear environmental embrittlement resulted from the diffusion of reactive atomic hydrogen into the interior of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V alloy. The addition of Zr elements decreased the proportion of Al elements on the surface of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy and reduced the proportion of H atoms produced by the chemical reaction between atmospheric water vapour and Al elements. This inhibited the environmental embrittlement and improved the performance of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy. The wear performance of Ni 5 Zr alloy is superior to that of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V. When exposed to air in an air environment, the surface of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy forms a protective Al 2 O 3 oxide film on the workpiece, resulting in a reduction of the friction coefficient and wear rate of the alloy. The wear mechanism of the alloy is mainly oxidation wear and abrasive wear. In an oxygen environment, the surface of the alloy generates a significant amount of Al 2 O 3 oxide film. The flaking of the oxide film leads to an increase in the friction coefficient and wear rate of the alloy. In a carbon dioxide environment, the surface of the alloy undergoes severe deformation, and plough lines become apparent. This is accompanied by flaking Si 3 N 4 abrasive chips adhering to the surface of the alloy, which intensifies the wear of the alloy. The primary wear mechanism is abrasive wear.

The environmental issues affecting the globe have been intensifying since the Industrial Revolution, which began in 1789, at the end of the 18th century. Technological development enabled humans to expand their capacity for exploration and extraction of natural resources, resulting in the concentration of wealth in the hands of a small group of international organizations, with the complicity of the most developed nations. The consequences of this predatory development model are evident: global warming, uncontrolled population growth, environmental degradation, and an exponential increase in poverty in various regions. This study, through a bibliographic review, seeks to identify trends and assess the possible consequences of this scenario for the lives of citizens on planet Earth. The focus is to suggest mitigating actions that can curb environmental devastation and ensure a more sustainable future, preserving human life on what was once known as the "blue planet," but which, in recent decades, has been marked by the spread of gray areas due to wildfires and increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. The drastic reduction in biodiversity, with the extinction of numerous species of fauna and flora, is an irrefutable fact that demands immediate attention.

With global warming and climate change becoming more and more serious, countries around the world have begun to pay attention to emission reduction and environmental protection, and the concept of ‘dual carbon’ has further penetrated into people's hearts, bringing new opportunities for the export of power lithium batteries from China. This paper aims to conduct a digital analysis of the export trade of the top seven countries (regions) in terms of the volume of power lithium battery trade in China, and to explore the influencing factors of the export volume of power lithium batteries from China. This paper first conducts a contour analysis based on the data fluctuations of five indicators in 32 provinces (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) from 2019 to 2021: total carbon dioxide emissions (mt), lithium iron phosphate production (10,000 tons), lithium battery electrolyte (10,000 tons), two-wheeled electric vehicles (100,000 vehicles), and lithium battery separators (10,000 tons). The final conclusion is that the ‘dual carbon’ background has a significant impact on China's power lithium battery industry. Furthermore, based on a panel data regression model, the factors affecting trade between China and the major countries (regions) exporting power lithium batteries are explored in depth. The results of the analysis found that the power generation, economic freedom, number of charging piles, population size, and per capita GDP of the exporting countries significantly affect the export volume of power lithium batteries in China. Among them, the population size and per capita GDP growth rate of the exporting countries have a negative impact, while the rest have a positive impact on the export volume of power lithium batteries in China.

Objective The study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of different noninvasive ventilation (NIV) modalities as primary respiratory support following extubation in Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS). Methods A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Network (CNKI), Wanfang database, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Literature databases with a search time limit of April 2024 for the year of construction, and included randomized controlled clinical trials of different modes of noninvasive respiratory support after extubation in NRDS. The primary outcome indicators were the need for re-tracheal intubation within 72 h of extubation on noninvasive ventilatory support and carbon dioxide retention (PCO2) 24 h after extubation. Secondary outcome indicators included the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), nasal injury, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular white matter softening (PVL), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and mortality rate. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of the literature was performed by two investigators who screened, extracted, and evaluated the quality of the data. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were then performed using R software. Results A total of 23 studies involving 2,331 neonates were analyzed. These studies examined four noninvasive respiratory modalities: continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (NCPAP), noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (N-BiPAP), and noninvasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (NHFOV). Results indicated that NHFOV, NIPPV, and N-BiPAP were significantly more effective than NCPAP in reducing the risk of reintubation (all P &lt; 0.05), with NHFOV being the most effective. For carbon dioxide clearance, NHFOV outperformed both NIPPV and NCPAP ( P &lt; 0.05). Regarding the reduction of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) incidence, NHFOV and NIPPV showed a significant advantage over NCPAP. Conclusions This network meta-analysis (NMA) suggested that NHFOV is the most effective mode of noninvasive respiratory support post-extubation, while NCPAP is the least effective. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number and quality of the studies included.

Copper tube (CT) is an indispensable material for space cooling. However, under the urgent requirements of cooling-related emission reduction, the environmental impacts and effective emission reduction strategies associated with CT manufacturing have not been investigated. This study quantified the environmental impacts of China's CT manufacturing and further explored the emission reduction potentials. Key findings are (1) almost all of the considered types of the environmental impacts of CT manufacturing are from electricity use, with melting as the largest contributing process. The gate-to-gate carbon emission intensities of inner-grooved CT, coiled CT, and straight CT are 1018, 747, and 499 kg CO2 eq, respectively. (2) The cumulative carbon emissions of China's CT manufacturing from 2022 to 2050 will reach 47.5 Mt CO2 eq in baseline scenario, of which 50% from inner-grooved CT is due to its increasing use in air conditioners. (3) About 27 Mt CO2 of the cumulative carbon emissions of CT manufacturing can be reduced, with 60% contributed by sustainable energy strategies (incl., energy efficiency improvement, energy substitution, and electricity transition). Accordingly, the impacts of other environmental issues will also be decreased by 14%–66%. This study provides an important scientific basis for the green transition of the CT industry.

The catalysis of CO2 to light olefins (C2=–C4=) utilizing Fe–Co bimetallic catalysts is deemed a practicable approach to counteract the excessive emission of CO2. However, a significant research gap exists in the study of manipulating the interaction between Fe–Co alloys, particularly in terms of component control. In this work, a range of bimetallic catalysts with varying Co/Fe molar ratios supported on ZrO2 were obtained through pyrolysis of mixed metal organic framework NH2-MIL-88B(Fe/Co)@UiO-66 that enables the hydrogenation of CO2 to C2=–C4=. Notably, the catalyst 10Fe1Co@ZrO2 exhibited a C2=–C4= selectivity of 45% at a CO2 conversion of 44.6%. The characterization results authenticate that, compared to the bare Fe catalyst, introducing Co significantly enhances the CO2 adsorption and conversion. Intriguingly, CoFe2O4 formed in both 10Fe1Co@ZrO2 and 5Fe1Co@ZrO2 undergoes reduction to generate CoxFey, facilitating its subsequent carbonization into the active phase χ-(CoxFe1–x)5C2 more readily during the reaction process.

Abstract The invasive pest, spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura, 1931) or SWD), damages various soft-skinned fruits, severely impacting orchards and vineyards economically. Current sorting practices in commercial production may overlook early-stage SWD infestations, as visible signs take a few days to appear. Our study focused on managing SWD infesting fruits (blueberry, cherry, and raspberry) without visible signs using an artificial atmosphere with elevated CO2 and low temperature. We hypothesized that these factors affect SWD survival and possibly interact, with potential variations among different soft- or stone-fruit species or varieties. High CO2 concentrations and cold storage both negatively affected SWD development. A 24-h 100% CO2 fumigation, without cold storage, significantly reduced SWD infestations in all 3 fruit species studied. On the other hand, 10% CO2 without cold storage did not cause a significant infestation reduction in cherries. Cold storage alone was too slow to be considered effective. Concurrent low-temperature treatment and CO2 treatment reduced the insecticidal efficacy of CO2 fumigation. Optimal fruit sanitation was achieved with a 3-h 100% CO2 treatment at ambient temperature before cold storage. Raspberries were the most suitable host for SWD development, with over a 5-fold higher SWD development compared to blueberries and over 50 times more than in cherries. We discussed the observed interactions between CO2 fumigation and chilling and suggested a simple postharvest SWD management protocol using optimal CO2 levels, exposure times, and chilling periods—achievable without complex equipment.

The increased interest nowadays in quantitative assessment of soil respiration is largely due to studies of the role of various terrestrial ecosystems in changing the concentration of the most important greenhouse gas, CO2, in the atmosphere. The review considers methodological aspects of determining the actual CO2 emission from soils using chamber and absorption methods, as well as the use of the obtained data to assess the carbon balance in soils. Successful development of this topic will allow to promptly get an answer to the main question of this pressing environmental issue: what is the soil of this or that ecosystem for atmospheric CO2 – a net source or a net sink? The article analyzes the results of works devoted to comparative determination of CO2 emission from soils by these methods. It is shown that the widespread opinion about obtaining underreported data by absorption method is often based on studies in which the basic principles of the method were violated. It is concluded that it is necessary to carry out in-depth comparative studies on determination of average daily indicators of CO2 emission from soil by chamber and absorption methods. It is recognized that, regardless of the method, the main problem in using CO2 production data to estimate soil C balance is the adequate partitioning of total respiration into heterotrophic and autotrophic components, the ratio between which varies widely depending on soil and vegetation conditions. Due to imperfection and labor intensity of existing methods, this division can cause significant errors in determining the annual mineralization of soil organic matter. To reduce them, the approach to determination of mineralization losses of CO2 in bare fallow soils is considered. It is natural for soils of agrocenoses, but as a methodological technique can probably be used in natural grass ecosystems as well. Reduction of errors can be ensured due to the fact that differences in actual mineralization of organic matter in bare fallow and plant-occupied soils are several times less than changes in the ratio between heterotrophic and autotrophic components of soil respiration in different biogeocenoses.

Background/Objectives: This study focused on a group of 22 elite male mountain runners from Brazil (average age of 35.9 ± 6.5 years) with the objective of exploring the possible roles of the ACTN3 R577X, ACE I/D, and CK MM A/G NcoI genetic variants in shaping electrochemical profiles and maintaining acid-base homeostasis during a 105-km ultramarathon. Methods: Genotyping for each polymorphism (ACTN3: RR, RX, XX; ACE: DD, ID, II; CK MM: AA, AG, GG) was conducted using PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), and saliva samples were used to obtain DNA. Analyses of electrochemical and acid-base disturbances were performed in real time. Results: It was observed that athletes who completed the race in less time had lower calcium concentrations (Rs = 0.35; p = 0.016). Athletes who completed the race faster had lower calcium concentrations (Rs = 0.35; p = 0.016). Pre-race, the RX genotype showed a 14.19% reduction in potassium levels compared to RR (p = 0.01). The GG genotype showed potassium levels 19.36% higher than AA (p = 0.01) and a 6.11% increase in hematocrit values compared to AA (p = 0.03). Additionally, the AG genotype exhibited hematocrit values 5.44% higher than AA (p = 0.03). Post-race, the XX genotype demonstrated higher hematocrit values compared to RX, with an increase of 8.92% (p = 0.03). The II genotype showed a 0.27% increase in pH compared to ID (p = 0.02) and a 20.42% reduction in carbon dioxide levels (p = 0.01). Conclusions: The findings emphasize the impact of the examined polymorphisms on the modulation of electrochemical factors and the maintenance of acid-base equilibrium in athletes during 105 km ultramarathons.

This investigation analyses the influence of private AI investment and financial development (FD) on CO2 emissions in the United States, using the STIRPAT framework to account for the functions of GDP, population, and foreign direct investment (FDI). The data's robustness was verified through the application of a variety of unit root tests, which confirmed that the variables are free of unit root issues and exhibit a varied order of integration. The ARDL bound test was used to investigate the cointegration among the variables and it found a long-run equilibrium relationship. The ARDL model results show that income, FDI, FD, and population significantly increase CO2 emissions in both the short and long term. In contrast, we found that private investment in AI led to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions over these time frames. Additional estimations were conducted using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR methods to verify the ARDL results, all of which attested to the initial findings' robustness. In addition, the study implemented a pairwise Granger causality test to illustrate the directional relationships between the variables. There is a unidirectional causal link between GDP, private AI investment, FDI, population, and CO2 emissions, according to the findings. Most notably, we observed bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and FD. Diagnostic tests further corroborated the validity of the study's conclusions, confirming that the model is free from specification errors, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity.

The primary objective of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) applications in various natural and engineered porous materials is to achieve a stable and planar CO2 displacement front, thereby suppressing viscous fingering. A stable front can ensure uniform and exhaustive CO2 mineralization throughout a reactive medium (i.e., mineral carbonation). Drawing inspiration from experimental observations of CO2 flooding into cores of portland cement-based materials, we examine the stability of such systems. Under these conditions, the injected CO2 continuously dissolves into the resident water phase, which becomes chemically disequilibrated with the solid minerals and leads to mineral carbonation on the wetted surfaces. Focusing on the early injection time allows us to reduce the complex multiphysical problem to a simple two-phase flow scenario of immiscible displacement with a CO2 interfacial flux sink. The formulated equations are investigated using numerical simulations and linear stability analysis, which results in a closed-form criterion, and provide fundamental insights into system stability. Overall, the results show that several effects combine to stabilize the system, including the sink effect, which acts to eliminate instability; the reduction in flow velocity along the flow path, which limits flow focusing; and the relative increase in stabilizing capillary forces. Therefore, if the system is stable at early stages, it will likely remain stable later on. Finally, this research demonstrates the use of theory to simplify complex problems and shows that even when flow is inherently coupled, the state of systems can often be determined from fluid stability alone.

The trade-off effect of the oxygen permeability and stability of oxygen transport membranes (OTMs) still exists in working atmospheres containing CO2. Herein, we reported a new series of 60 wt%Ce0.9Ln0.1O2-{\delta}-40wt%Ln0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Ti0.1O3-{\delta} (CLnO-LnSFTO, Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb) dual-phase OTMs by selecting different Ln elements based on the reported highly stable Ti-doped CPrO-PrSFTO. The effects of different Ln elements on the structure and oxygen permeability of Ti-doped dual-phase OTMs were systematically studied. Basically, as the atomic number of Ln elements increases, the unit cell parameters of both the fluorite phase and the perovskite phase become smaller. The unit cell volume and spatial symmetry of the perovskite phase are reduced, resulting in a reduction in oxygen permeability. The optimal CLaO-LaSFTO showed JO2 of 0.60 and 0.54 mL min-1 cm-2 with He and CO2 sweeping at 1000 oC, respectively. In addition, all CLnO-LnSFTO OTMs could work for more than 100 hours with no significant performance degradation in a CO2 atmosphere, maintaining excellent stability. This work explores candidate OTM materials for CO2 capture and oxygen separation, as well as provides some ideas for addressing the trade-off effect.

Abstract Aims Amyloid cardiomyopathy is caused by the deposition of light chain (AL) or transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) fibrils, that leads to a restrictive cardiomyopathy, often resulting in heart failure (HF) with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. This study aimed to determine whether cardiac output reduction or ventilation inefficiency plays a predominant role in limiting exercise in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy. Methods We conducted a multicentre prospective study in patients with AL or ATTR cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing across four centres. Patients were compared with a propensity‐score matched HF cohort based on age, gender, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 ). Results Data from 267 amyloid patients aged 77 (72, 81) years, 86% male, with a median N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) of 2187 (1140, 4383) ng/L, exercise parameters of peak VO 2 of 14.1 (11.6;16.9) mL/min/kg, a minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO 2 ) slope of 37.4 (32.5, 42.6) and a LVEF of 50% (44%, 59%) were analysed. We identified 251 amyloid cardiomyopathy–HF matches. Amyloid patients had a signifnicantly higher VE/VCO 2 slope [37.4, inter quartile range (IQR): 32.7, 43.1 vs. 32.1, IQR: 28.7, 37.0, P < 0.0001], NT‐proBNP (2249, IQR: 1187, 4420 vs. 718, IQR: 405, 2161 ng/L, P < 0.001), peak heart rate (121 ± 28 vs. 115 ± 27 beats/min, P = 0.007) and peak ventilation (51, IQR: 42, 62 vs. 43, IQR: 33, 53 L/min, P < 0.0001) with earlier anaerobic threshold (VO 2 at AT: 8.9, IQR: 6.8, 10.8 vs. 10.8, IQR: 8.9, 12.7 mL/min/kg, P < 0.0001) compared with HF. Between amyloid patients, AL patients ( n = 27) were younger (63, IQR: 58, 70 vs. 78, IQR: 72, 81 years, P < 0.0001), had lower VE/VCO 2 slope (35.0, IQR: 30.0, 38.7 vs. 38.0, IQR: 32.8, 43.1, P = 0.019), higher end‐tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure both at AT (35.1 ± 4.8 vs. 31.4 ± 4.7 mmHg, P < 0.001) and peak exercise (32, IQR: 28, 35 vs. 30, IQR: 26, 33 mmHg, P = 0.039) as compared with ATTR ( n = 233). Conclusions A higher VE/VCO 2 slope and an earlier AT, determining functional capacity impairment, was assessed in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy compared with the matched HF cohort. Additionally, patients with ATTR might display more severe exercise limitations as compared with AL.

Chemical process intensification has attracted extensive interest of scholars. Distillation, as a high energy consumption industry, is in urgent need of energy saving and CO2 emissions reduction by means of process intensification. In this paper, isobutanol and p-xylene azeotrope was separated by pressure swing distillation (PSD). Combined with process integration method, four heat integration PSD processes including partial heat integration PSD (PHI-PSD), enhanced partial heat integration PSD (EPHI-PSD), full heat integration PSD (FHI-PSD), and enhanced full heat integration PSD (EFHI-PSD) were designed and optimized through sequential iterative procedure. The total annual cost (TAC), CO2 emissions, and thermodynamic efficiency were calculated and compared. By comparing relevant data, it is found that EPHI-PSD process has obvious advantages in terms of economic, thermodynamic efficiency, and environmental benefits. Specifically, comparing with the basic PSD process, thermodynamic efficiency of EPHI-PSD process is improved by 97.8% while TAC and CO2 emissions are decreased by 37.0% and 50.1%, respectively.

Based on the experimentally reported stable and conductive two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) as building block and cyan substituted phenyl as connector (CuCOF-CN) as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction reaction (RR), first principle calculations were performed on CuCOF-CN and its analog with the CN being replaced by H (CuCOF). Comparatively studied on the crystal structures, electronic properties, and CO2RR performance of the two catalysts found that CuCOF has reduced crystal unit size, more positive charge on Cu and CuPc segments, smaller band gap, and lower reaction barrier for CO2 RR than CuCOF-CN. CuCOF is proposed to be good potential electrocatalyst with good environment friendliness. The substituent effect and structure-property-performance relationship would help for designing and fabricating new electrocatalysts.

Fine-tuning transformer-based deep learning models is currently at the forefront of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, fine-tuning these transformers for specific tasks, especially when dealing with ever-expanding volumes of data, constant retraining requirements, and budget constraints, can be computationally and financially costly, requiring substantial energy consumption and contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. This article focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on instance selection (IS) – a range of document filtering techniques designed to select the most representative documents for the sake of training. The objective is to either maintain or enhance classification effectiveness while reducing the overall training (fine-tuning) total processing time. In our prior research, we introduced the E2SC framework, a redundancy-oriented IS method focused on transformers and large datasets – currently the state-of-the-art in IS. Nonetheless, important research questions remained unanswered in our previous work, mostly due to E2SC's sole emphasis on redundancy. In this article, we take our research a step further by proposing biO-IS – an extended bi - ob jective i nstance s election solution, a novel IS framework aimed at simultaneously removing redundant and noisy instances from the training. biO-IS estimates redundancy based on scalable, fast, and calibrated weak classifiers and captures noise with the support of a new entropy-based step. We also propose a novel iterative process to estimate near-optimum reduction rates for both steps. Our extended solution is able to reduce the training sets by 41% on average (up to 60%) while maintaining the effectiveness in all tested datasets, with speedup gains of 1.67 on average (up to 2.46x). No other baseline, not even our previous SOTA solution, was capable of achieving results with this level of quality, considering the tradeoff among training reduction, effectiveness, and speedup.

Effective climate action depends on dismantling the assumptions and oversimplifications that have become the basis of climate policy. The assumption that greenhouse gases (GHG) are fungible and the use of single-point values in normalizing GHG species to CO2-equivalents can propagate inaccuracies in carbon accounting and have already led to failures of carbon offset systems. Separate emission reduction targets and tracking by GHG species are recommended to achieve long-term climate stabilization.

ABSTRACT Edible insects have gained increased attention as the important and sustainable source of nutrients for both human and animal consumption due to their rich content of protein, oil, fiber (as chitin), vitamins, and minerals. This study focuses on examining the effects of advanced pretreatments and oil extraction methods from prominent edible insect species commercially cultivated in Thailand, namely the house cricket ( Acheta domesticus ), black soldier fly larvae ( Hermetia illucens ), and silkworm ( Bombxy mori ). The raw insect samples underwent pretreatment using high pressure processing (HPP) at 200–600 MPa for 5 min or ultrasonication (UL) at 37 kHz for 5–15 min, followed by dehydration and extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO 2 ) or solvent extraction. The study revealed that HPP significantly reduced the initial microbial load of all edible insects by 6–8 log cycles, while UL showed a slight effect on microbial reduction. Additionally, pretreatments notably improved the oil extraction yield of most samples by disrupting the integrity of the cell membrane, facilitating the release of oils. The extracted edible insect oils were rich in unsaturated fatty acids, omega 3, 6, and 9, making them suitable for various applications such as cosmetics, food, and feed additives. Furthermore, the protein meals obtained as a residue after oil removal were identified as potential meat alternatives or replacements in food or feed formulations. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of edible insects as a sustainable source of oil and protein, highlighting the significance of pretreatments and extraction methods in maximizing their utility for various applications in the food, cosmetic, and feed industries.

Abstract. Inland saline lakes play a key role in the global carbon cycle, acting as dynamic zones for atmospheric carbon exchange and storage. Given the global decline of saline lakes and the expected increase of periods of drought in a climate change scenario, changes in their potential capacity to uptake or emit atmospheric carbon are expected. Here, we conducted continuous measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes at the ecosystem scale in an endorheic saline lake of the Mediterranean region over nearly 2 years. Our focus was on determining net CO2 and CH4 exchanges with the atmosphere under both dry and flooded conditions, using the eddy covariance (EC) method. We coupled greenhouse gas flux measurements with water storage and analysed meteorological variables like air temperature and radiation, known to influence carbon fluxes in lakes. This extensive data integration enabled the projection of the net carbon flux over time, accounting for both dry and wet conditions on an interannual scale. We found that the system acts as a substantial carbon sink by absorbing atmospheric CO2 under wet conditions. In years with prolonged water storage, it is predicted that the lake's CO2 assimilation capacity can surpass 0.7 kg C m2 annually. Conversely, during extended drought years, a reduction in CO2 uptake capacity of more than 80 % is expected. Regarding CH4, we measured uptake rates that exceeded those of well-aerated soils such as forest soils or grasslands, reaching values of 0.2 µmol m−2 s−1. Additionally, we observed that CH4 uptake during dry conditions was nearly double that of wet conditions. However, the absence of continuous data prevented us from correlating CH4 uptake processes with potential environmental predictors. Our study challenges the widespread notion that wetlands are universally greenhouse gas emitters, highlighting the significant role that endorheic saline lakes can play as a natural sink of atmospheric carbon. However, our work also underscores the vulnerability of these ecosystem services in the current climate change scenario, where drought episodes are expected to become more frequent and intense in the coming years.

The intensive use of fossil fuels has led to a significant increase in air pollution, which negatively affects human health and the environment. Fly ash (FA), a byproduct of coal combustion, has great potential as an adsorbent for hazardous gas pollutants due to its physical and chemical properties. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of fly ash as an adsorbent in reducing gas pollutants such as CO2, SO2, and NO2, as well as to examine the influence of temperature and material characteristics on adsorption capacity. The results indicate that the maximum adsorption capacity for each gas pollutant is achieved at different temperatures, fly ash demonstrating the highest performance at 150 °C for CO2 adsorption, achieving an efficiency of 94.7%. For SO2 and NO2, the optimum temperatures are 200 °C, with efficiencies of 72.17% and 100%, respectively. This study also emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate characteristics of the adsorbent material to enhance adsorption efficiency. This finding has the potential to support the development of more efficient and sustainable air pollution reduction technologies in the future, by utilizing industrial waste such as fly ash as an innovative solution.

To achieve carbon neutrality in China’s fossil energy sector, saline aquifer CO2 geological storage has become a critical strategy. As research into carbon reduction and storage potential evaluation advances across various geological scales, the need arises for consolidating key CO2 storage cases and establishing a standardized classification system and evaluation methodology. This paper provides a comprehensive review of notable CO2 storage projects in saline aquifers, covering aspects such as project overviews, structural and reservoir characteristics, caprock integrity, and seismic monitoring protocols. Drawing on insights from mineral and oil and gas exploration, as well as international methods, this paper outlines the stages and potential levels of saline aquifer storage in China. It proposes an evaluation framework with formulas and reference values for key coefficients. The study includes successful global projects, such as Sleipner and Snøhvit in Norway, In Salah in Algeria, and Shenhua in China’s Ordos Basin, which provide valuable insights for long-term carbon capture and storage (CCS). By examining geological characteristics, injection, and monitoring protocols in these projects, this paper analyzes how geological features impact CO2 storage outcomes. For example, the Sleipner project’s success is linked to its straightforward structure, favorable reservoir properties, and stable caprock, while Snøhvit illustrates diverse structural suitability, and In Salah demonstrates the influence of fractures on storage efficacy. CO2 storage activities are segmented into four stages—survey, investigation, exploration, and injection—and are further categorized by storage potential: geological, technical, techno-economic, and engineering capacities. This study also presents evaluation levels (prediction, control, technically recoverable, and engineering) that support effective reservoir selection, potential classification, and calculations considering factors like reservoir stability and sealing efficacy. Depending on application needs, volumetric or mechanistic methods are recommended, with precise determination of geological, displacement, and cost coefficients. For China, a dynamic evaluation mechanism characterized by multi-scale, tiered approaches and increasing precision over time is essential for robust storage potential assessment. The levels and methods outlined here serve as a scientific foundation for regional and stage-based comparisons, guiding engineering approvals and underground space management. To align with practical engineering demands, ongoing innovation through laboratory experiments, simulations, and field practice is crucial, supporting continual refinement of formulas and key parameter determinations.

This article is dedicated to the issues of formulating a “green” investment policy. The research aims to analyze, systematize, and improve the existing theoretical and methodological framework concerning the development of the “green” economy in Ukraine and develop a mechanism for formulating a “green” investment policy. The development of the “green” economy in Ukraine and its significance for achieving sustainable economic development are examined. A comprehensive analysis of the main aspects influencing the country’s ecological economic formation is presented, including carbon dioxide emissions, transformational mechanisms for the transition, and the state of ecological innovation implementation. It is substantiated that developing the “green” economy is crucial in the transition to sustainable economic development, which considers ecological, social, and economic aspects. The results of expert evaluations are provided, indicating some progress in developing the “green” economy from 2021 to 2023 despite the country’s military conflict’s negative consequences. It is found that one of the critical tools for stimulating the development of the “green” economy is environmental taxes, which contribute to pollution reduction and foster corporate responsibility. The research also revealed that while the environmental tax in Ukraine has potential, it still occupies a minor share of the tax revenue structure, indicating the need to improve its implementation mechanisms. The study identified that the market for “green” investments is actively developing; however, obstacles exist, such as the lack of clear standards and criteria for defining “green” projects and a high level of risk associated with investing in advanced ecological technologies. A mechanism for formulating a “green” investment policy is proposed. It is determined that implementing the “green” investment policy in Ukraine requires a systematic approach and coordinated efforts from many stakeholders in the process, including government bodies, private companies, and non-governmental organizations. Developing an investment policy that stimulates investments in environmentally friendly technologies is also essential. It is noted that to achieve the goals of developing a “green” economy in Ukraine, it is necessary to overcome existing barriers and ensure stability and transparency in the investment environment. Keywords: green economy, green policy, green investments, environmental taxes, sustainable development.

The architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) sector exerts a considerable influence on energy consumption and CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere, making a notable contribution to climate change. It is therefore imperative that energy efficiency in buildings is prioritized in order to reduce environmental impacts and meet the targets set out in the European 2030 Agenda. In this context, renewable energy communities (RECs) have the potential to play an important role, promoting the use of renewable energy at the local level, optimizing energy management, and reducing consumption by sharing resources and advanced technologies. This paper introduces an open tool (OT) designed for the configuration of energy systems dedicated to RECs. The OT considers several inputs, including thermal and electrical loads, energy consumption, the type of building, surface area, and population size. The OT employs artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine learning (ML) techniques to generate forecast optimized scenarios for the sizing of photovoltaic systems, thermal, and electrical storage, and the estimation of CO2 emission reductions. The OT features a user-friendly interface, enabling even non-experts to obtain comprehensive configurations for RECs, aiming to accelerate the transition toward sustainable and efficient district energy systems, driving positive environmental impact and fostering a greener future for communities and cities.

Due to its distinctive structure and unique physicochemical properties, gallium nitride (GaN) has been considered a prospective candidate for lithium storage materials. However, its inferior conductivity and unsatisfactory cycle performance hinder the further application of GaN as a next-generation anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To address this, cobalt (Co)-doped GaN (Co-GaN) nanowires have been designed and synthesized by utilizing the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy. The structural characterizations indicate that the doped Co elements in the GaN nanowires exist as Co2+ rather than metallic Co. The Co2+ prominently promotes electrical conductivity and ion transfer efficiency in GaN. The cycling capacity of Co-GaN reached up to 495.1 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. After 500 cycles at 10 A g−1, excellent cycling capacity remained at 276.6 mA h g−1. The intimate contact between Co-GaN nanowires and carbon paper enhances the conductivity of the composite. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further illustrated that Co substitution changed the electron configuration in the GaN, which led to enhancement of the electron transfer efficiency and a reduction in the ion diffusion barrier on the Co-GaN electrode. This doping design boosts the lithium-ion storage performance of GaN as an advanced material in lithium-ion battery anodes and in other electrochemical applications.

Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement is recognized as an environmentally friendly alternative to Portland cement (PC) due to its lower carbon footprint and energy requirements. However, traditional CSA cement production faces significant obstacles, including the high cost and regionally constrained availability of bauxite, a key raw material. Utilizing alternative materials in the production process offers a viable approach to address these limitations. This study evaluated the environmental performance of three laboratory-synthesized CSA cements using alternative raw materials sourced through an industrial symbiosis framework. A comparative assessment with PC was conducted, focusing on energy consumption and CO2 emissions as key environmental performance indicators. The environmental impact of the CSA cements was analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations, a robust statistical approach based on data for the constituent raw materials. This method provides a practical alternative to a full life cycle assessment (LCA) when comprehensive data are not available. The results demonstrate that the CSA cements have significantly lower environmental impacts compared to PC, achieving energy savings of 13–16% and CO2 emission reductions of 35–48%. These results emphasize the potential of industrial symbiosis to enable more sustainable CSA cement production while addressing raw material constraints. In addition, this approach highlights the wider applicability of industrial symbiosis frameworks in the construction industry, contributing to a zero-waste future and supporting global climate goals.

As awareness of the impact of anthropogenic activities on climate change increases, the concepts of durability, resilience, and sustainability in concrete tend to be adopted more seriously in the concrete construction industry. In this sense, one of the concrete technologies that began in the 1980s and that significantly contributes to maximize the beneficial effect on all these concepts are the ultra-high-performance concretes, a very attractive technology because it presents ultra-high strength and durability performances far superior to those of conventional concretes, a performance that is leading to a permanent increased demand. However, the development of these concretes has been widely criticized due to their high ecological impact, which is mainly attributable to the high cement dosages required for their production (800–1000 kg/m3). To address this criticism in a comprehensive manner and thereby reduce the embodied carbon attributable exclusively to the material, this research was oriented to determine the effect of an industrial by-product of vitrified clay, as a partial or total substitution for cement, silica fume, and limestone aggregate, on the compressive strength, flexural toughness, and embodied CO2. For the UHPC’s evaluated in this work with a dosage of 2% by volume of steel micro-fibers, the results evidence the feasibility that the following substitutions by mass: 30% of the Portland cement, 100% of the silica fume, and 30% of the limestone aggregate and powder, do not detract the fresh stage, the compressive strength, the static modulus of elasticity, and the flexural strength, leading to significant reductions of the embodied CO2.

Telework has become a commonly employed modality in companies and public institutions to perform work activities, mainly due to the confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, even before the pandemic, telework was recommended to mitigate some of the adverse effects of human activity on the environment, reduce the use of resources in companies, combat traffic congestion, and affect the quality of life of workers. The present article is exploratory and aims to analyze the workers' perspective on telework and its relation to the environment. We proceeded to apply a survey, using a poll, to more than 200 people;subsequently, a descriptive statistics analysis was carried out in order to identify patterns or classifications among different groups of workers. Teleworking offers several perceived advantages, one of which is the significant reduction in commuting and fuel consumption. A staggering 90.91% of teleworkers acknowledge this reduction in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this work modality enables companies to curb their electricity consumption and use of air conditioning, thereby benefiting the environment. From an environmental standpoint, telework can contribute to sustainable development by reducing emissions and energy consumption. This positive impact aligns with the country's decarbonization goals and can also enhance people's quality of life.

This paper presents research in the field of optimization in maritime passenger traffic that can ensure the long-term sustainability of coastal maritime passenger lines system. For the purpose of the research contained in this paper, it has been hypothesized that the optimal arrangement of boats within a coastal maritime passenger lines system will reduce the consumption of propulsion energy, the emission of harmful gasses and operating costs. The aim of this paper is to present an efficient algorithm for a reduction in propulsion energy consumption in coastal maritime passenger lines systems by reassigning boats to lines that they service. The problem is modeled using a bipartite graph and the solution is obtained by searching for optimal matching using Edmonds’ algorithm. The authors apply, for the first time, Edmonds’ algorithm to the problems of the optimization of assignments of boats to lines. The research results were confirmed by tests on a representative example. The optimization results on only 10 ships in the given example show yearly savings of 91,097.30 L of fuel (lowering costs by EUR 69,233.95) and reducing CO2 by 243.59 tons, which proves that this algorithm found a much more efficient arrangement that could result in a significant reduction in propulsion energy consumption, thus providing economic and ecological benefits.

This study examines methods to lessen the environmental consequences of global CO2 emissions from the hard-to-abate transport sector. The paper analyzed historical and projected trends in global CO2 emissions from the hard-to-abate transport industry under two scenarios: the stated policy scenario (STEPS) and the announced pledged scenario (APS). The study covered the historical period from 2010 to 2022 and projected emissions up to 2050. The analysis revealed that the compound annual growth rate (CAAGR) of STEP exceeded that of APS in 2030 and 2050 for challenging emissions from heavy- duty vehicles, aircraft, and shipping when compared to the baseline year of 2022. The aviation industry has a higher CAAGR of 5.3% and 2.5% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, compared to heavy-duty vehicles at 1.6% and 0.9% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, and shipping at 0.7% and 0.9% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, under STEPS. Under the APS scenario, shipping showed a negative CAAGR of -0.8% and -2.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, and 0.4% and -1.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, for heavy-duty trucks. In comparison, the aviation industry had CAAGRs of 4.5% and 0.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively. The data shows that the aviation industry is expected to see a far greater CAAGR in emissions than heavy-duty vehicles and shipping in both STEPS and APS scenarios. Targeted efforts are necessary to mitigate the environmental effects of air travel in the upcoming decades. The paper also examined 56 publicly traded international transportation companies and their corresponding carbon emission targets. Only seven companies, or 12.5%, have established goals for reducing emissions from 2023 to 2050; 10 companies, accounting for 17.9%, have committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040 to 2060; five corporations, representing 8.9%, have set targets for reducing emission intensity from 2025 to 2034; and 34 global corporations, making up 60.7%, have committed to achieving net zero emissions between 2040 and 2050. Despite some progress in setting emission reduction targets in the air travel industry, many companies still need to set carbon footprint reduction goals.

Carbonation technology using MgO and CO2 has been considered a rapid, effective, and environmentally friendly method for improving weak soils, mainly applied in shallow foundation treatments. This study introduced a novel MgO-carbonated composite pile (MCP) technique developed by injecting CO2 through a gas-permeable pipe pile into a MgO-mixing column for carbonation and solidification and its applications in weak subgrade treatments. Several field tests were carried out to study the characteristics of MCP as well as the performance of the MCP-reinforced foundations, including carbonation reaction temperature monitoring, pore-water pressure monitoring, standard penetration tests (SPT), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests, static load tests, and subgrade deformation monitoring. Results showed vigorous and uniform carbonation within the MgO-mixing column, confirming the feasibility of constructing large-diameter MgO-mixing columns. The distribution, evolution, and affected zone of excess pore-water pressure induced by MCP installation were determined. The MCP exhibited good pile quality, with average SPT-N and UCS values of 39 and 1021 kPa, respectively. MCP’s bearing capacity was superior to pre-stressed high-strength concrete pipe piles, with ultimate vertical and lateral bearing capacities of 1920 kN and 119 kN, respectively. The MCP-reinforced foundation exhibited a small settlement of 54.5 mm under embankment loads. Life cycle assessment indicated significant carbon reduction benefits for MCP, with 44.7% lower carbon emissions compared to traditional composite piles.

This paper explores the integration of Circular Economy (CE) principles and Industrial Ecology (IE) practices as a means to enhance sustainability and resource efficiency across various industries. The circular economy shifts away from the traditional linear model of “take, make, dispose,” promoting a closed-loop approach that minimizes waste and prolongs the lifecycle of products through reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing. Industrial ecology, on the other hand, emphasizes industrial symbiosis, where waste or by-products from one process serve as inputs for another, mimicking natural ecosystems. The study employs a qualitative methodology, analysing secondary data from industries such as automotive, energy, and electronics, revealing how CE and IE practices lead to significant reductions in resource use, waste generation, and carbon emissions. Results show that industries adopting CE and IE principles achieve improved efficiency and environmental sustainability, with specific examples of resource savings and reductions in CO2 emissions. Despite challenges in implementation, this research highlights the potential of CE and IE to foster innovation, economic growth, and environmental resilience. The paper concludes by stressing the importance of collaboration between governments, businesses, and academia to advance these concepts and address the environmental challenges of the 21st century.

The problems related to environmental issues have motivated extensive research on environmentally friendly materials. The built environment is responsible for high primary energy use and more of energy related CO2 emissions. However, it is important to develop low-embodied energy, carbon-negative, sustainable construction materials to replace conventional products. In this context, agricultural wastes are the excellent alternative materials to substitute mineral aggregates because they are widespread and easily accessible. The application of these elements is interesting as regards the recycling of the vegetable particles, since these are easily available and renewable low-cost raw materials, and has advantage for economy and environment. However, the reduction of energy consumption in construction, production of thermal insulation materials, and the solution of environmental problems by recycling waste are becoming greater problems. Various types of agriculture waste, after being processed, have been used as particles in concrete or mortars. These materials display lower density and have several potential applications such as acoustic and thermal insulation, fire resistance cladding…etc. The study reported in this paper was undertaken to investigate the physico-mechanical properties of cellular materials based on flax particles, in order to produce usable materials in cellular concrete applications. The material produced containing different volumes of flax particles (0V (control mortar), 1V, and 2V) was lightened by creating a porous structure in the matrix through a chemical reaction between aluminium powder and free lime. A study conducted on hardened material properties has indicated a significant reduction in sample unit weight, thereby resulting in a level of compressive strength compatible with a load-bearing wall. The reduction in flexural strength was lower than that in compressive strength. These results shown that the cellular material based on flax particles can be used as suitable insulated load-bearing walls.

In general, an internal combustion engine vehicle is still the convention in personal and commercial transport, but due to its high use stage CO2 emission, a shift is occurring in propulsion methods, and the use of battery electric vehicles (BEV) will become the new norm. BEV’s curb weight is, in general, greater than that of a conventional fuelled vehicle (CFV) for equivalent classes. Consequently, it is questionable that the level of BEV’s energy consumption is acceptable. The aim of this paper is to compare the mass induced energy consumption of CFV and BEV. The expectation is that the comparative study of energy consumption between CFV and BEV will provide insight for proposing a strategy to determine the extent to which lightweighting can be introduced to a BEV. Encouragingly, less exhaustive energy consumption can help by reducing range anxiety by increasing BEV range, resolving one issue facing a BEV. With a typical road condition for hilly and flat roads, various drive cycles are also taken into consideration, and the energy consumption profiles for CFV and BEV can be determined. The vehicle model involved using the MATLAB/Simulink software underpinned by longitudinal vehicle dynamic methods. The idea is to determine the amount of lightweighting of various components of a BEV through an iterative process based on energy consumption profiles. As a function of mass reduction, for comparative energy expenditure, the results showed that a range of 28 to 36% reduction in BEV mass was achieved, which in turn can increase the driving range by 36.4 to 46.8%.

This study investigates the optimization of aeration rates for the biodrying of market waste using negative-pressure ventilation. Market waste, characterized by a high moisture content (MC) and rapid decomposition, presents challenges in waste management. Over 12 days, three aeration rates (ARs) of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m3/kg/day were examined, and the most effective continuous ventilation configuration was identified in terms of heat generation, moisture reduction, and biodrying efficiency. The results indicate that the most effective AR for heat retention and moisture removal was 0.2 m3/kg/day, achieving a 6.63% MC reduction and a 9.12% low heating value (LHV) increase. Gas analysis showed that, while AR 0.2 supported high microbial activity during the initial 7 days, AR 0.6 sustained higher overall CO2 production due to its greater aeration rate. The findings also suggest that the biodrying of market waste with a high initial MC can achieve significant weight loss and leachate generation when paired with a high aeration rate of 0.6 m3/kg/day, with a 69.8% weight loss and increased waste compaction being recorded. The study suggests that variable ARs can optimize biodrying, making market waste more suitable for conversion to refuse-derived fuel or landfill pre-treatment and improving waste-to-energy processes and sustainability.

Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high‐value product with less energy consumption. Two‐dimensional conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (2D c‐MOFs), comprising square‐planar metal‐coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c‐MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm‐2, significantly reducing the overall water‐electrolysis‐voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4>CoO4>Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non‐noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high‐performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.

This study examines the influence of transportation policies and urbanisation on cycling participation and environmental sustainability in Slovenia. Factor and regression analyses were employed. The yearly data from 2008 to 2021 were isolated. A modest increase in urban cycling frequency was observed, bolstered by investments in environmental protection and safety enhancements; however, additional evidence is needed to confirm the long-term effects (H1). Furthermore, while increased cycling was linked to a reduction in CO2 emissions and improved air quality, the overall environmental benefits were found to be affected by other factors, such as motorisation and public transportation in summer (H2). The study revealed that the introduction of reduced urban speed limits and expanded cycling lanes significantly enhanced cycling safety and desirability, leading to a shift from car usage to bicycles (RQ). These findings indicate that cycling could play a vital role in advancing Slovenia’s sustainable development goals, emphasising the need for continued investments and supportive urbanisation policies.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic disorder accompanied by ovulatory dysfunction. Insulin resistance (IR) is a key pathogenic mechanism in PCOS, and insulin sensitizers, such as metformin and pioglitazone, can improve PCOS symptoms. Chiglitazar, a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (pan-PPAR) agonist, is also an insulin sensitizer; however, its therapeutic effects have not yet been studied in PCOS. We evaluated the therapeutic effects of chiglitazar in a rat model of PCOS. Sprague–Dawley rats aged 4 weeks were injected subcutaneously with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (6 mg/100 g/day) to establish PCOS, and a control (CON) group was established. The rats were divided into the CON, PCOS model (DHEA), pioglitazone-treated (DHEA + PIO), and chiglitazar-treated (DHEA + CHI) groups. The DHEA + PIO group received pioglitazone (20 mg/kg/day) and the DHEA + CHI group received chiglitazar (20 mg/kg/day), each for 15 days. Body weight, estrous cycle, and glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin resistance test (ITT) results were monitored. Experimental animal energy metabolism systems were utilized to assess metabolic parameters. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to detect changes in serum hormones, including insulin, adiponectin, sex-related hormones, and lipid metabolism indicators. The ovaries were used for molecular biology experiments to detect changes in Akt/phosphorylated Akt and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression by Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Chiglitazar and pioglitazone improved PCOS symptoms. However, chiglitazar demonstrated a more pronounced effect on lipid improvement and weight gain than pioglitazone. In the DHEA + PIO and DHEA + CHI groups, there was notable recovery in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output; substantial improvement in GTT and ITT results; an increase in adiponectin; and a reduction in serum insulin, androgens, luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio. Compared with the DHEA group, the DHEA + CHI group exhibited notable decreases in triglycerides, free fatty acids, and atherosclerosis index, while the DHEA + PIO group demonstrated no changes. Granulosa cells and healthy follicles increased in ovarian sections. Ovarian steroidogenic enzymes also increased in the DHEA + PIO and DHEA + CHI groups compared with the DHEA group. Mechanistically, chiglitazar increased Akt phosphorylation. Chiglitazar significantly improved ovulation in rats with PCOS and may be a potential novel therapeutic strategy for PCOS.

Environmental taxation has emerged as a promising policy tool to combat the pressing challenge of carbon emissions and address the adverse impacts of climate change. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of environmental taxation in the G20 nations, a diverse group of major economies that collectively contribute to a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this research is to assess the role of environmental taxation in influencing carbon emission levels across G20 countries. To achieve this, review of the literature on environmental taxation, and carbon emission reduction strategies in each G20 nation was conducted. Additionally, data from international databases, governmental reports, and academic studies were analysed and Johansen co-integration test was applied to test the hypothesis. It was found that environment taxation is important variable to manage CO2 emissions and to focus on sustainable growth of the nations. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance the effectiveness of environmental taxation measures in their respective countries. By identifying successful policy approaches and lessons learned from G20 nations, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how environmental taxation can play a pivotal role in addressing carbon emissions and advancing global efforts to combat climate change.

The objective of this work is to investigate the implications of geological influence factors on gas content and geochemical characteristics of deep-buried (> 800 m) coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs. Results show that bituminous coal accounts for the majority, which exhibits similar maturity but differ in maceral and chemical constituents. CBM reservoirs show low porosity, low permeability and moderate temperature, with thickness of 0.85–4.15 m. In addition, the total gas content is 4.58–12.33 m3/t (average of 8.83 m3/t). CH4 is the main component with concentration of 92.83−99.22% (average of 96.68%), and the δ13CCH4 and δ13DCH4 is − 53.78‰–−44.62‰ (average of − 48.82‰) and − 223.93‰––−4.49‰ (average of − 215.37‰), respectively. All CBM samples are the mixtures of thermogenic gases and secondary biogenic gases with CO2 reduction. In addition, gas content characteristic at the critical point of burial depth is the result by positive and negative geological effects. CH4 concentration shows a wide range with the increases of buried depth, while the numerical values of which for the selected samples display complex variation characteristics. Furthermore, the values of δ13CCH4 and δ13DCH4 become heavier with the increases of buried depth. Besides, the above two geochemical parameters are related to Ro, max and reservoir temperature.

Catalytic activity, mechanisms, and active sites were determined for methane steam reforming (MSR) over gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) supported iridium (0.1 wt%) prepared by impregnation of GDC with iridium acetylacetonate. Isothermal steady-state rate measurements followed by micro-gas chromatography analysis were performed at 660 and 760 °C over Ir/GDC samples pretreated in N2 or H2 at 900 °C. Transient responses to CH4 or H2O step changes in isothermal conditions were carried out at 750 °C over Ir/GDC pretreated in He or H2 using online quadrupole mass spectrometry. In the proposed mechanism, Ir/GDC proceeds through a dual-type active site associating, as follows: (i) Ir metallic particles surface as active sites for the cracking of CH4 into reactive C species, and (ii) reducible (Ce4+) sites at GDC surface responsible for a redox mechanism involving Ce4+/Ce3+ sites, being reduced by reaction with reactive C into CO (or CO2) depending on the oxidation state of GDC and re-oxidized by H2O. Full reduction of reducible oxygen species is possible with CH4 after He treatment, whereas only 80% is reached in CH4 after H2 treatment.

Gravel mulching is a widely employed strategy for water conservation in arid agricultural regions, with potential implications for soil carbon (C) sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. However, soil respiration and CO2-C emissions remain uncertain owing to less consideration of the influence of precipitation patterns and planting age. In this study, we investigated the soil respiration rate (Rsoil) and cumulative CO2-C emission (Ccum), both measured over a period of 72 h, along with soil properties and enzyme activities under different precipitation conditions based on gravel mulching with different planting ages. We analyzed the effects of planting ages on Rsoil and Ccum and revealed the underlying mechanisms driving changes in environmental factors on Rsoil and Ccum. The results demonstrated that the Rsoil reached the maximum value at about 1 h, 0.5 h, and 0.25 h after rewetting in 1, 10, and 20 years of gravel mulching under the condition with 1 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm of precipitation, respectively, whereas the Rsoil exhibited its maximum at about 8 h after soil rewetting under precipitation of 30 mm. The Ccum induced by precipitation pulses tends to decrease with increasing years of gravel mulching. The Ccum was 0.0061 t ha−1 in the 20-year gravel-mulched soil, representing a 53.79% reduction compared to the 1-year gravel-mulched soil. Soil organic matter (SOM), planting ages, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were the primary factors influencing the Rsoil and Ccum in 0–20 cm, while SOM, planting ages, and soil porosity (AirP) were the key factors affecting the Rsoil and Ccum in 20–40 cm. The Rsoil and Ccum in the 0–20 cm soil were regulated by soil enzyme activities, while those of 20–40 cm soil were controlled by soil properties. This indicates that the decrease in Rsoil and Ccum is caused by soil degradation, characterized by a decrease in SOM and ALP. This study offers a novel insight into the long-term environmental impact of gravel mulching measures in arid areas, which is helpful in providing a theoretical basis for dryland agricultural management. It is imperative to consider the duration of gravel mulching when predicting the potential for C sequestration in arid agricultural areas.

This study investigates the effectiveness of combining magnets with parabolic and truncated fins in enhancing the distillation process of solar stills. The integration of magnets accelerated evaporation rates, while the fins increased the heat absorption area, resulting in improved output, vis-à-vis traditional solar stills. A comparative assessment revealed that the parabolic fin solar still (PFS) with magnets outperformed the truncated fin solar still (TCFS), producing 20%, 15%, and 16% more distillate at three different depths (1, 2, and 3 cm). The superior performance of the PFS is attributed to the magnetism of the water and the fins’ more extensive surface area for heat absorption. Efficiency measurements at a water depth of 1 cm showed that the PFS achieved the maximum energy and exergy efficiencies at 30.49% and 8.85%, respectively, compared with TCFS’s 25.23% and 6.22%. Economically, the PFS setup proved more feasible, with a 20.9% lower cost per liter of distilled water than TCFS. Additionally, the environmental impact assessment indicated a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, potentially generating revenues of approximately USD 1242.32 through carbon credits. These results reflect a considerable margin to enhance the efficiency of solar desalination through well-planned adjustments, which bodes well for the future of optimized solar distillation systems from an economic and environmental perspective.

Abstract. As offshore wind gains momentum within US renewable energy goals, New Jersey’s ambitious targets for offshore wind development represent a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and transition towards cleaner energy sources. This study presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a planned offshore wind farm off of New Jersey’s coast, emphasizing the implications of a domestic supply chain. Key findings show the farm is projected to produce 0.0113 kg CO2 per kWh of electricity generated, reflecting a 98 % decrease in carbon emissions compared to natural gas derived electricity. Further, when compared to carbon emissions of other renewable energy technologies, offshore wind outperforms both solar and onshore wind by 81 % and 48 %, respectively. This finding highlights offshore wind’s role in emissions reduction, as well as the importance of a domestic supply chain to mitigate transportation-related impacts. Additionally, results indicate a need to address the environmental trade-offs of offshore, as steel-intensive materials used in turbines and infrastructure contribute heavily to toxicity-related impacts. This research underscores the potential of offshore wind to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and offers insight into the environmental dynamics of offshore wind energy in the US.

Every year, 10.8 to 19.1 billion tonnes of CO2 are emitted through food exports, which accounts for roughly 21% - 37% of the world’s global total emissions. In the urge to expand businesses and ensure availability of all crops throughout the year, the quality of air is being compromised. The demand for crops rises in tandem with population growth and improvements in human well-being. In addition, most of these exported crops lose their nutritional value due to the unhealthy exposure of preservatives and other farming chemicals. There are multiple factors involved in crop production: land, labour, transportation, storage etc. Aeroponics is a relatively new farming system that eradicates numerous problems by using less land and water and requiring minimal labour and nutrients. The aim of this project is to convert the aeroponic farming unit into a 100% carbon-neutral, self-reliant unit called Aerogarden by integrating modern technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI). Every household having an Aerogarden unit can access fresh organic vegetables and microgreens that actually retain their nutritional value. By achieving this goal, non-agricultural nations' dependence on food imports will lessen, which will ultimately result in a reduction in the sector's carbon footprint. By giving people a way to directly support the international movement, the project also aims to support the UN's initiative to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

African countries are committed to the creation of free trade areas as a means of consolidating trade links between African nations. Intra-African trade is expected to boost economic growth and improve macroeconomic performance and living standards in Africa. However, theoretical insights and empirical evidence suggest that these efforts risk being undermined by the adverse environmental consequences of trade, which are likely to undermine the continent's achievements in terms of sustainable development and poverty reduction. This paper aims to examine the environmental impact of intra-African trade while integrating FDI, economic growth, urbanization, and energy consumption. The study used a panel data set for 32 African countries over the period 1990-2020. The empirical analysis was based on the latest panel estimation techniques. More specifically, we used the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test, the second generation of unit root tests on panel data, and the PMG estimator to estimate an ARDL panel. The error correction term reveals the existence of a cointegrating relationship between CO2 and trade, FDI, and the other control variables. The results suggest that intra-African trade worsens environmental quality in Africa in the long term. Similarly, FDI has a similar ecological impact, corroborating the ‘pollution heaven’ hypothesis. The results also refute the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Energy consumption plays a key role in the long-term deterioration of the environment. Finally, urbanization degrades the environment in line with the intuition of urban environmental transition theory.

Electrolyte alkaline cations can significantly modulate the reaction selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R), enhancing the yield of the valuable multicarbon (C2+) chemical feedstocks. However, the mechanism underlying this cation effect on the C–C coupling remains unclear. Herein, by performing constant-potential AIMD simulations, we studied the dynamic behavior of interfacial K+ ions over Cu surfaces during C–C coupling and the origin of the cation effect. We showed that the specific adsorption of K+ readily occurs at the surface sites adjacent to the *CO intermediates on the Cu surfaces. Furthermore, this specific adsorption of K+ during *CO–*CO coupling is more important than quasi-specific adsorption for enhancing coupling kinetics, reducing the coupling barriers by approximately 0.20 eV. Electronic structure analysis revealed that charge redistribution occurs between the specifically adsorbed K+, *CO, and Cu sites, and this can account for the reduced barriers. In addition, we identified excellent *CO–*CO coupling selectivity on Cu(100) with K+ ions. Experimental results show that suppressing surface K+-specific adsorption using the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) significantly decreases the Faradaic efficiency for C2 products from 41.1% to 4.3%, consistent with our computational findings. This study provides crucial insights for improving the selectivity toward C2+ products by rationally tuning interfacial cation adsorption during eCO2R. Specifically, C–C coupling can be enhanced by promoting K+-specific adsorption, for example, by confining K+ within a coated layer or using pulsed negative potentials.

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is the latest industry development, attempting to build smart systems by combining physical objects with digital innovations. The main idea behind the chapter's attempt is to empirically assess the link between I4.0 and sustainability performance, particularly in the context of green supply chain (GSC) and social responsibility (SR). In industry, data-driven investigation is required to show how I4.0 and sustainability performance are related. Thus, this chapter attempts to close this research gap by empirically assessing the link between the two paradigms. I4.0 technologies can reduce energy and resource consumption, which leads to a reduction in waste or CO2 emissions across production and supply chain processes. Smart plants support worker health and safety by enhancing working conditions, which results in higher worker satisfaction and ambition. A coordinated and proactive procedure among supply chain (SC) managers is essential to curb the environment and SCs. Supplier-customer environmental cooperation (SCEC) may be understood as the collaborative efforts made among partners to enhance understanding and support toward improving environmental performance through greener products and innovations. The idea of SR is that organizations should behave in a manner that enhances their surroundings and society as a whole. Companies with more SR always ask suppliers to be more socially responsible just for the sake of implementing SR throughout the SC management and focusing on the welfare of society, their efficiency in all aspects, and the performance of their suppliers who take part in their activities. Overall, this chapter aims to demonstrate how GSC, I4.0, and SR are interconnected and can be leveraged to enhance sustainability performance.

Abstract Background Telemedicine is increasingly common in gastroenterology and may represent an opportunity for improving sustainability in medical care. The purpose of this study was to determine the carbon emissions related to travel for in-person gastroenterology clinic appointments. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis evaluating carbon emissions associated with travel to gastroenterology appointments over a 2-week period. We determined the average number of appointments per day and used patient’s postal codes to estimate travel distances. We estimated carbon emissions based on these travel distances and completed sensitivity analyses to model methods for emissions reductions. Results We assessed 975 clinic appointments, of which 71 were excluded (eg, insufficient data, non-physician appointments), leaving 904 included appointments of which 75% were follow-up (678) and the remainder were new consultations (226). Sixteen different gastroenterologists had an average of 22.7 patients per clinic. The mean return distance travelled per appointment was 57.3 km which translates to 14.9 kg CO2 per patient visit. An average day at our clinic was equal to burning 146.6 L of gasoline or the annual carbon capture of 15.5 trees. By changing follow-up appointments or those with a travel distance over 100 km to telehealth, emissions were reduced by 77%. Conclusions We demonstrate that a relatively modest change in the number of in-person visits can save thousands of litres of gasoline emissions annually from each practicing clinician. While we cannot avoid emissions related to travel for procedure-based appointments, the use of telemedicine is one potential strategy to reduce healthcare-related emissions.

Objective: This study evaluates climate transition risks in Morocco, focusing on the energy sector under the climate actions outlined by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It aims to understand the financial implications of climate transition risk in the Moroccan stock market. Theoretical Framework: The study builds on the frameworks of transition risk assessment and integrated assessment models, employing a Poisson jump process to capture uncertainties in climate policy transitions. Method: A model-based approach is utilized, incorporating CO2 data, integrated assessment models, and six climate scenarios. The analysis uses Monte Carlo simulations to explore potential policy shifts and their impact on the Moroccan stock market. Results and Discussion: Findings reveal significant differences in the resilience of energy sub-sectors, with fossil fuel sectors facing substantial financial losses, while renewable sectors show greater resilience. A responsible investment strategy, prioritizing low-carbon sectors, demonstrates a significant reduction in financial risks compared to a capitalistic alternative. The study highlights the critical role of sustainable investment in mitigating climate transition risks. Research Implications: The results provide valuable insights for Moroccan financial entities, emphasizing the importance of aligning investments with SDGs to minimize financial risks. The findings also offer a foundation for developing climate risk assessment tools that support sustainable finance in Morocco. Originality/Value: This study is the first to focus on quantifying climate transition risk in the Moroccan stock market. It stands out for its innovative approach to modeling the uncertainty associated with climate policies, providing a more refined understanding of how policy shifts impact financial risks.

Engaging the public in the shift to sustainable travel behaviours The new Labour government wishes to be seen as a global climate leader and has prioritised delivering greener transport. Among its commitments are measures to improve public transport and make streets more attractive for those walking, wheeling and cycling. These transport policies are welcomed by many, but have also attracted opposition from some politicians and media outlets, and been the focus of intense pushback in several communities. How can the government achieve net zero transport in a way that is publicly acceptable? The UK has made limited progress in reducing emissions from transport over the past three decades and transport is now the country's largest emitting sector. In standard emissions calculations, surface transport currently accounts for more carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than aviation, with car use responsible for 52 per cent of domestic transport emissions.1 While these accounts do not adjust for non-CO2 impacts of aviation nor emissions from return flights, therefore underplaying aviation's role, reducing surface transport emissions must be central to the UK's climate commitments. Indeed, avoiding driving is frequently cited as the single most effective action that individuals can take to cut their carbon footprint, followed by switching from a petrol/diesel car to an electric vehicle (EV).2 "The transport sector is … inequitable, unhealthy and inefficient" The transport sector is also unsustainable in other ways, besides being a major greenhouse gas contributor. It is inequitable, unhealthy and inefficient. People with an annual income of more than £100,000 travel almost three times further than those with an income under £10,000;3 meanwhile 28 per cent of the poorest fifth of households do not have a car, compared with just 6 per cent of the wealthiest fifth.4 Dominance of car use has also contributed to rising obesity, accidents and air pollution. And road traffic is estimated to place costs equivalent to £31.9 billion a year on communities in Britain, equivalent to 1.6 per cent of GDP.5 Shifting to a more sustainable transport system would therefore bring environmental, health, social and economic benefits. Technology alone cannot deliver this. Reducing emissions from transport requires profound behaviour change too. Indeed, behaviour change is needed for all levels of the 'avoid, shift, improve' sustainable travel hierarchy. Avoiding the need to travel by using digital alternatives is essential to decarbonise transport, and requires radically different ways of interacting and working. Shifting to more sustainable – public, shared and active – modes of travel means breaking car-use habits and reconfiguring travel choices. Even switching from petrol/diesel to EV requires consumers to choose greener cars, and to adapt vehicle-refuelling habits to engage with the growing EV charging infrastructure. In fact, behaviour change is fundamental to achieving net zero in all sectors. According to the Climate Change Committee, more than 60 per cent of the measures needed to reach net zero will require behaviour change by consumers, and the remainder will involve behaviour change by businesses.6 However, in 2022, a House of Lords inquiry found that the UK government's approach to achieving sustainable behaviour change was 'seriously inadequate'.7 There has been a preference for information provision to inform consumer decision-making (so-called 'downstream' measures), over incentives, regulations or infrastructure provision ('upstream' measures) that alter the attractiveness or availability of options for consumers. Yet, extensive evidence shows that information provision alone is ineffective in changing behaviour. One meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials testing behavioural interventions to promote household action on climate change found that information provision was 2 to 3 per cent effective, compared with interventions that alter choices (nudges), which are on average 25 per cent effective, and can reach 90 per cent effective. Moreover, informational approaches tend to exacerbate inequality, as they do not remove structural barriers (for example, cost or inconvenience) to behaviour change.8 "the UK government's approach to achieving sustainable behaviour change was 'seriously inadequate'" Transport behaviours are particularly driven by physical and geographical factors, such as the availability of parking or public transport routes, and by economic factors (for example, income); whereas psychological factors (such as knowledge and values) tend to be less important.9 As alluded to above, information provision is likely to be particularly ineffective to change behaviours. Moreover, travel behaviours are highly habitual – regular trips, such as commutes, become automatic and routine, and less amenable to change through information.10 Changing car-use habits requires disrupting old routines as well as creating new ones; in this sense, 'pull' measures, like creating cycle lanes or increasing bus frequency, will not suffice; 'push' measures like congestion charges or road reallocation will also be required.11 Push and pull together are needed. Cities across Europe have demonstrated how crucial push measures can be as part of an integrated plan to improve public transport infrastructure. London's congestion charge is credited with stopping three million additional journeys by car in 2019 and boosted bus travel by a third (33 per cent) on implementation.12 In Stockholm, congestion pricing achieved a 22 per cent reduction in the 10 years from its implementation in 2006, despite a growing population.13 Such initiatives defy the long-held maxim in transport policymaking that increasing numbers of people and a growing economy necessarily lead to more car use. Urban leaders who recognise the harms caused by traffic to their local economy, environment and communities have shown that an alternative path is possible. "Changing car-use habits requires disrupting old routines as well as creating new ones" Rural communities in the UK face different barriers in making changes to how they travel to their urban counterparts. Many feel that EVs, public transport and active travel are all currently out of their reach due to a lack of charging infrastructure, unsafe routes or inadequate bus and train services. In these areas, the focus must be on addressing the barriers to behaviour change, including working with rural authorities to revive the fortunes of towns that can act as anchors for local services and amenities and provide multi-modal transport hubs.14 In Cornwall, for example, car dependency is higher than in more urban regions, so the council there has been trialling shared mobility solutions, including providing credits and marketing for shared e-bikes.15 The Welsh government has also been trialling rural sustainable mobility solutions, including local working hubs and loans for e-bikes and e-cargo bikes.16 However, some policies, while highly effective in changing behaviour, can be controversial. Public backlash in response to Ultra Low Emission Zones and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods exemplifies how a vocal minority can politicise transport policy and challenge local authority efforts to promote alternatives to fossil-fuelled cars. This opposition is in part fed by the 'democratic chasm' that has opened up between communities and authorities,17 as local news services have closed and disinformation is spread online. Right-leaning media and politicians have gone as far as to call these (proposed) policies a 'war on motorists', implying that motorists constitute a definable demographic or identity group. But to what extent does this assumption reflect public views and behaviours? "Right-leaning media and politicians have gone as far as to call these (proposed) policies a 'war on motorists'" Recent research commissioned by IPPR suggests that, for the vast majority of the UK public, transport is pragmatic, not ideological.18 Owning a car is not a marker of identity in any meaningful way and people are not especially attached to their cars. In fact, people want transport systems to change and public transport is actually valued more highly than cars. Across different social groups, and regardless of whether someone is a car owner or not, there is strong support for a wide range of policies that would support achieving net zero, reducing transport costs and delivering healthier, safer streets. Notably, schemes such as school streets (which see road space opened up to children travelling actively to school) are supported by all voter segments used in this analysis. Change is hard and can be disruptive to people's daily routines, but there is a clear consensus that transport at the moment isn't working, and there is an appetite for a new approach − as long as it takes the cost-of-living crisis into account. "there is a clear consensus that transport at the moment isn't working, and there is an appetite for a new approach" The research also found that there is a lack of trust in decision-makers in relation to transport, although there is more trust in local leaders, including local authorities and mayors. It is clear that 'fairness' is a critical condition for the acceptance of transport policies – this includes distributional and procedural fairness (providing a voice for the public in decision-making). To win support for social change, authorities must listen to diverse perspectives, co-design policies that address people's concerns, and understand which narratives and language work best within their communities. Taken together with wider evidence on behaviour change and public engagement, the research report concludes that a transition to a sustainable transport system requires upstream public engagement – early and substantive involvement of citizens and communities in transport policymaking. This engagement can not only help avoid backlash but also improve the quality and effectiveness of decision-making.19 This engagement should happen at two levels: strategic involvement in national net zero policy and in developing general principles for sustainable transport policies (for example, Climate Assembly UK and Welsh Government Net Zero 2035); and the co-development of local transport schemes through place-based engagement and community relationship building. The Republic of Ireland provides a practical case study of how the UK government may approach strategic engagement of the public in the shift to sustainable mobility. The Irish government's department for transport has published its principles and practical actions to foster 'public engagement on climate action and sustainable mobility'.20 This combines an awareness of the need for supportive mainstream media messages on sustainable travel alongside fostering a shift in how the state works – recognising that engagement is a two-way process, in which government must listen and learn. The UK is long overdue a public engagement strategy for net zero,21 and should urgently adopt the best practice being set by its nearest European neighbour. "The UK is long overdue a public engagement strategy for net zero" Importantly, public engagement is not a replacement for political will and leadership. Major changes in transport norms and the redesign of public spaces have only been achieved through the willingness of leaders to engage with the evidence of what is and isn't working and make the case for trying something new. In Janette Sadik-Khan's Streetfight she details the approach taken during her time as New York's commissioner of transportation under Mayor Bloomberg. During this period, road space in the city was reallocated to social, commercial and public or active transport at a rapid pace, often using temporary materials, such as planters, with the ability to make adaptations quickly if things didn't go to plan. A clear vision, backed up by a politician willing to spend political capital, drove a culture change in what was seen as within the remit of a transport department and what was considered possible in reshaping city streets. The engagement of communities in this process, and active sharing of data on the impact of trials, helped smooth the notorious 'Goodwin curve' of public opinion – where public support drops prior to implementation but rises when benefits are realised.22 Unfortunately for New Yorkers, they are still waiting to see this approach applied to congestion charging.23 "The climate crisis requires us to change, at an unprecedented pace, how we travel The climate crisis requires us to change, at an unprecedented pace, how we travel. This does not mean changes should be rushed. The British public are pragmatists and their views on transport are shaped by what they see and experience as they go about their lives. Winning the case for change means making greener transport choices possible for more people and urgently addressing the stresses caused by many people's attempts to engage with public transport. Action must be practical, fair and rooted in empathetic engagement of the public. Delivering on the government's goals requires a new relationship between communities and transport decision-makers, and a willingness to 'move fast, and fix things' – together.

Urachal remnant (UR) is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from the obliteration failure of a fibrous tube which connects the umbilicus to the bladder dome during embryological development. Laparoscopic resection has been used for symptomatic UR in recent years, and simultaneous umbilical resection has been reported to prevent the recurrence of umbilical infection.1 Empirically, the CO2 insufflation pressure decreases during umbilical resection, which sometimes makes it difficult to achieve a safe surgical field. The AirSeal™ Intelligent Flow System (SurgiQuest, Milford, USA; ConMed Japan, Tokyo) is an insufflator designed to maintain pneumoperitoneum pressure with continuous smoke evacuation and CO2 recirculation during surgery.2 Several advantages were reported in urologic surgeries, such as shown in Table S1.2 In this report, we evaluated a modified method of laparoscopic surgery for UR, using a 5-mm port connected to AirSeal. A 26-year-old man was diagnosed with UR at a nearby hospital using magnetic resonance imaging due to repeated umbilical infections. The patient visited our hospital for UR surgery, and laparoscopic umbilical resection was performed. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position, and a Foley catheter was inserted. The transperitoneal approach was employed, and the first 12-mm port was inserted using Hasson's open technique on the right border of the rectus abdominis at the level of the umbilicus. Pneumoperitoneum was achieved by CO2 insufflation to a pressure of 10 mmHg, and a 10-mm flexible laparoscope was placed using this port. Next, a 5- and 12-mm working ports were placed under the direct vision; the 12-mm port was located 7 cm caudal, 5 mm lateral to the first port, and the 5-mm port was located 7 cm cranial, 5 mm lateral to the first port, respectively, and AirSeal was connected to the 5-mm port (Figure 1). Between the bilateral umbilical ducts, LigaSure™ MaryLand (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was used to dissect the UR from the posterior layer of the rectus abdominis sheath. UR was dissected in the caudal direction, clipped, and cut just above the bladder dome using a Hem-o-lok (Teleflex, Wayne, USA) (Figure 1b). UR was then dissected in the cranial direction to the rectus abdominis sheath just below the umbilicus, and the resection range of the umbilical skin was determined using a cathelin needle. The cathelin needle was inserted from outside the body along the skin incision line, and the resection range was decided by confirming the needle in intra-peritoneum vision (Figure 1c). The UR and attached umbilical skin were excised using an appropriate resection line (Figure 1d). After urachal excision, Endo Close™ (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was used to secure the closure of the urachal defect. Under intraperitoneal observation of the urachal cavity, an Endo Close needle with a 70-cm absorbable suture was inserted from outside the body, and the rectus abdominis fascia, muscle, and peritoneum were punctured. The suture was then left in the body, the EndoClose needle was inserted again from the opposite side of the urachal cavity, and the suture was captured. The suture was pulled to the skin level and ligated (Figure 1e). This process was repeated to bridge the defects. The insufflation pressure and surgical field were maintained during the procedure, despite the umbilical cavity. Finally, umbilicoplasty was performed with the assistance of a plastic surgeon. Intra- or retro-peritoneal approach, single-site and robot assisted surgery have recently been employed for laparoscopic UR surgery.3-6 The peritoneal approach provides a large enough cavity for laparoscopic working; however, it has a risk of intestine injury and retro-peritoneal approach often does not have enough cavity to set the ports.6 Moreover, single-site or robotic surgery is devoid of umbilical resection.4, 5 Due to the maintenance of insufflation pressure, our modification achieves a large operation field throughout the procedure, which might result in the reduction of risk of not only intestine injury but also abdominal incisional hernia, a known complication of umbilical resection.7 It is sure, that a muscle hook might achieve a similar view by lifting abdominal wall, and a proficient operator might perform the same operation without AirSeal system. However, one of the maximum advantages of AirSeal system is considered to make a safe view and procedure, not depending on the operator's experience. Furthermore, in our active umbilical infection case, this method was useful given the larger umbilical cavity. Despite the diameter being over 5 cm of urachal defect, the surgical field was maintained due to AirSeal (Figure 1f), suggesting that the modification could be effective regardless of the urachal defect size. Our study, for the first time, evaluated the impact of AirSeal on laparoscopic surgery for UR and it can potentially overcome problems associated with other methods.

Andžs, M. “Loose-fill heat insulation material obtained from hemp shives by steam explosion”. Ph.D. thesis. Jelgava, LBTU, 2024. – 112 pages. The thesis text includes 10 tables, 60 images, 21 formulas and 225 references to the used literature sources. The doctoral thesis was developed in the Biorefining Laboratory of the Latvian State Institute of Wood Chemistry by support of the European Union 7th Framework Programme Wood Wisdom project “ProLignin” (2012-2014), National Research Program “ResProd” (2014-2017), European Regional Development Fund research results commercialization project No 1.2.1.2/16/I/001/ KC-PI-2020/13 "Commercialisation of the technology for the production of lignocellulosic bulk thermal insulation material" (2020–2022) and Fundamental and Applied Research lzp-2021/1-0599 “Investigation of eco-friendly thermal insulation materials from sustainable and renewable industrial crops residuals” project (2022–2024). Regulations’ of the European Union and global best practice trends for limiting climate change have forced Latvia to implement actions for the rational consumption and saving of heat energy. Latvia has the lowest housing quality in the European Union, including buildings with relatively low thermal stability. EU regulations and society demand sustainable, health and environmentally friendly thermal insulation materials. As a solution to the urgent need for a new thermal insulation material produced from non-woody lignocellulosic biomass of local origin, a new loose-fill thermal insulation material that meets current regulations and environmental requirements has been developed from the by-product of agricultural plants – hemp shives – in the research of the doctoral thesis. The thesis is a detailed and fundamental, but at the same time a technological study, which includes the development of the pretreatment methodology for the hemp shives by the steam explosion of hemp shives, the study of the properties of the obtained fibrous materials and the evaluation of loose-fill thermal insulation material samples. As a result of the research, a steam explosion method was applied for the production of environmentally friendly thermal insulation material. The influence of the variable parameters of the steam explosion technology on the structure, properties and application possibilities of the obtained material in heat and sound insulation was studied, thus creating new knowledge about the application of the steam explosion technology in the processing of agricultural residues. The optimal processing parameters of the steam explosion method for obtaining loose-fill thermal insulation material from hemp shives are at a temperature of 235° C, a pressure of 32 Bar with release immediately after reaching it, i.e. holding time 0 minutes. One of the most important scientific findings in the development of loose-fill thermal insulation material with steam explosion technology is the discovery that the most important is the adiabatic process (second phase – explosion), which performs fibrillation of the sample, maximally shortening the thermochemical process (first phase). By choosing the optimal processing conditions, it is possible to reduce the bulkiness up to 2.3 times, obtaining the best indicators of thermal inertia and thermal conductivity. The thermal insulation properties of the developed fiber loose-fill material (λ=0.043 W·m-1·K-1) are equivalent to analogs on the market. The research of the thesis has a significant practical value, as a practically applicable technology has been developed for the processing of by-products of hemp fiber production – hemp shives – into products with high added value, thus creating a knowledge-intensive, innovative product with commercialization and export potential. The developed product contributes to the growing demand for sustainable thermal insulation materials, as well as contributes to the achievement of Latvia's climate neutrality goals and the reduction of CO2 emissions in the field of energy efficiency.

Η αύξηση του ανθρώπινου πληθυσμού οδηγεί σε αυξημένη ζήτηση ζωικών προϊόντων, γεγονός που πιέζει τα συστήματα ζωικής παραγωγής να εξελιχθούν τόσο σε αποτελεσματικότητα όσο και σε παραγωγή. Τα κτηνοτροφικά κτίρια (συστήματα εντατικής κτηνοτροφίας) διαδραματίζουν σημαντικό ρόλο στην κάλυψη αυτής της ζήτησης, καθώς επιτρέπουν στα ζώα να παραμένουν σε ελεγχόμενο περιβάλλον για καλύτερη ανάπτυξη και παραγωγή. Ωστόσο, οι συμβατικές κτηνοτροφικές πρακτικές έχουν συνδεθεί με περιβαλλοντικά ζητήματα σχετικά με τις εκπομπές αερίων του θερμοκηπίου, την υπερκατανάλωση ενέργειας, τις προκλήσεις διαχείρισης αποβλήτων και την έλλειψη ελέγχου του μικροκλίματος. Ως εκ τούτου, οι βιώσιμες κτηνοτροφικές πρακτικές έχουν μεγάλη σημασία στις μέρες μας. Ο περιβαλλοντικός αντίκτυπος των κτηνοτροφικών πρακτικών θα πρέπει να μειωθεί με την εισαγωγή καινοτόμων συστημάτων κάλυψης-εξοικονόμησης ενέργειας, που συμβάλλουν στη μείωση των εκπομπών αερίων του θερμοκηπίου. Από την άλλη πλευρά, οι καινοτόμες κτηνοτροφικές πρακτικές συνεπάγονται την ενσωμάτωση ανανεώσιμων πηγών ενέργειας, τη βελτιωμένη διαχείριση αποβλήτων και τα συστήματα εξοικονόμησης ενέργειας, ενώ παράλληλα ενισχύουν την ευημερία και την απόδοση των ζώων βελτιώνοντας τις συνθήκες μικροκλίματος στο εσωτερικό των κτηνοτροφικών εγκαταστάσεων. Τα συστήματα περιβαλλοντικού ελέγχου μπορούν να διατηρήσουν την κατάλληλη ποιότητα του αέρα, τη θερμοκρασία και τα επίπεδα σχετικής υγρασίας, ενώ ο συνδυασμός τους με συστήματα αξιοποίησης ανανεώσιμων πηγών ενέργειας μπορεί να ευθυγραμμίσει την κτηνοτροφική παραγωγή με τους κλιματικούς στόχους και να ελαχιστοποιήσει τις περιβαλλοντικές επιπτώσεις του τομέα. Η προσαρμογή τέτοιων πρακτικών μπορεί δυνητικά να ανταποκριθεί στις αυξανόμενες απαιτήσεις χωρίς να διακυβεύεται η βιωσιμότητα ή η υγεία και η απόδοση των ζώων, ενώ συμβάλλει στην «πράσινη» και ενεργειακά αποδοτική κτηνοτροφία. Η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή επικεντρώνεται στην ανάπτυξη ενός καινοτόμου συστήματος για τη βελτίωση της ενεργειακής απόδοσης των κτιρίων κτηνοτροφίας, την ενίσχυση της ευζωίας των ζώων μέσω της ρύθμισης των συνθηκών μικροκλίματος, την επίτευξη περιβαλλοντικής βιωσιμότητας μέσω της μείωσης των εκπομπών αερίων του θερμοκηπίου και την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών αναγκών των κτηνοτροφικών κτιρίων. Η ολοκληρωμένη προσέγγιση που ακολουθείται στην παρούσα διατριβή περιλαμβάνει ένα αυτοματοποιημένο σύστημα ρύθμισης του μικροκλίματος και την αξιοποίηση μιας ανανεώσιμης πηγής ενέργειας, συγκεκριμένα του βιοαερίου που παράγεται από τα ζωικά απόβλητα του ιδίου κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου μέσω της διαδικασίας της αναερόβιας χώνευσης, για την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών αναγκών του κτιρίου. Το πειραματικό κτηνοτροφικό κτίριο στέγαζε πρόβατα και βρισκόταν στη Γαλάτιστα στην περιοχή της Χαλκιδικής. Πραγματοποιήθηκαν οι κατάλληλες εγκαταστάσεις εξοπλισμού για την ενσωμάτωση του προτεινόμενου συστήματος. Το αυτοματοποιημένο σύστημα παρακολουθούσε συνεχώς τις εσωτερικές περιβαλλοντικές παραμέτρους, όπως η θερμοκρασία, η υγρασία και οι εκπομπές όπως CH4, CO2, NH3, και εκτελούσε έλεγχο του μικροκλίματος προκειμένου να επιτευχθούν οι βέλτιστες συνθήκες ανοίγοντας και κλείνοντας τα παράθυρα όταν χρειαζόταν, με βάση τις καταγεγραμμένες περιβαλλοντικές παραμέτρους από τους εγκατεστημένους αισθητήρες. Επιπλέον, διερευνήθηκε η δυνατότητα χρήσης του βιοαερίου που παράγεται μέσω αναερόβιας χώνευσης από τα κτηνοτροφικά απόβλητα του κτιρίου για θερμική ενέργεια, ώστε να μειωθεί η εξάρτηση από συμβατικές πηγές ενέργειας και, ως εκ τούτου, να μειωθεί το αποτύπωμα άνθρακα του κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου. Αυτό επιτυγχάνεται με τον προσδιορισμό του δυναμικού βιοαερίου από τα απόβλητα του κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου σε διαφορετικά σενάρια μέσω της διαδικασίας αναερόβιας χώνευσης, και τέλος, με τη διενέργεια εκτεταμένης ενεργειακής ανάλυσης για να αξιολογηθεί κατά πόσον οι ενεργειακές ανάγκες του κτιρίου μπορούν να καλυφθούν, ώστε να επιτευχθούν βέλτιστες συνθήκες μικροκλίματος για τα φιλοξενούμενα ζώα και να μειωθούν οι εκπομπές αερίων του θερμοκηπίου. Αξιολογήθηκαν απόβλητα από διαφορετικά είδη ζώων, πρόβατα (υφιστάμενο κτηνοτροφικό κτίριο) και κατσίκια (άλλο κτηνοτροφικό κτίριο). Αυτή η ολιστική προσέγγιση βελτιώνει την εξοικονόμηση ενέργειας και μειώνει τις περιβαλλοντικές επιπτώσεις των κτηνοτροφικών πρακτικών, ενώ παράλληλα παρέχει βελτιωμένη ευζωία των ζώων μέσω του κατάλληλου ελέγχου του μικροκλίματος. Η παρούσα εργασία περιγράφει μια νέα ολοκληρωμένη προσέγγιση με ένα αυτοματοποιημένο σύστημα και ένα θεωρητικό σύστημα αξιοποίησης του βιοαερίου για την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών αναγκών των κτηνοτροφικών κτιρίων προς την κατεύθυνση πράσινων κτηνοτροφικών πρακτικών για βιώσιμες και ενεργειακά ανεξάρτητες από το δίκτυο εφαρμογές. Τα αποτελέσματα έδειξαν ότι το προτεινόμενο αυτοματοποιημένο σύστημα σε συνδυασμό με την ενέργεια που παράγεται από βιοαέριο από τα εκκρινόμενα απόβλητα μπορεί να επηρεάσει σημαντικά το μικροκλίμα του υπό μελέτη κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου και να καλύψει τις ενεργειακές του ανάγκες θέρμανσης στις περισσότερες από τις εξεταζόμενες περιπτώσεις. Το σύστημα ρύθμισε με επιτυχία τη θερμοκρασία, τη σχετική υγρασία και τα επίπεδα αερίων ελέγχοντας τις λειτουργίες των παραθύρων, οδηγώντας σε ένα βελτιωμένο περιβάλλον για την καλή διαβίωση των ζώων. Συγκεκριμένα, τα παράθυρα άνοιγαν για το 61,5% και έκλειναν για το 38,5% του χρόνου, εξασφαλίζοντας βέλτιστες συνθήκες με βάση τα δεδομένα των αισθητήρων. Αυτό επέτρεψε τη διατήρηση της θερμοκρασίας όσο το δυνατόν περισσότερο εντός της θερμο-ουδέτερης ζώνης των ζώων, ενώ παράλληλα ρυθμίστηκε η σχετική υγρασία και οι συγκεντρώσεις των επιπέδων αερίων. Όσον αφορά την αξιοποίηση του βιοαερίου, εξετάστηκαν διάφορα σενάρια με διαφορετικά υποστρώματα μέσω αναερόβιας χώνευσης για τον προσδιορισμό του δυναμικού τους σε βιοαέριο, τα οποία προσομοίαζαν διαφορετικές τεχνικές διαχείρισης της κτηνοτροφικής πρακτικής. Το πιο αποδοτικό υπόστρωμα ήταν η τρέχουσα πρακτική με 75% κοπριά προβάτων και 25% άχυρο σιταριού (βάρος/βάρος) και το πιθανό βιοαέριο που θα μπορούσε να παραχθεί από την καθημερινή κοπριά των προβάτων είχε δυναμικό έως και 23678,49 ± 66,96 LBiogas·d-1, ενώ για το άλλο αξιολογούμενο ζωικό είδος (κατσίκια) έως και 14868,5 ± 412,07 LBiogas·d-1 προσφέροντας μια πολλά υποσχόμενη λύση για την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών αναγκών με ταυτόχρονο περιορισμό των εκπομπών αερίων του θερμοκηπίου. Πραγματοποιήθηκε επίσης μια προκαταρκτική ανάλυση μετριασμού των περιβαλλοντικών επιπτώσεων με θεωρητική σύγκριση με άλλα συστήματα θέρμανσης, εάν χρησιμοποιούνταν δυνητικά η ίδια ποσότητα παραγόμενης ενέργειας από βιοαέριο μαζί με τις εκπομπές που προέρχονται από τα απόβλητα, γεγονός που οδήγησε σε ετήσια μείωση των εκπομπών έως και 54,22 και 34,04 tCO2, για τα πρόβατα και τα κατσίκια, αντίστοιχα, λαμβάνοντας υπόψη 180 σταβλισμένα ζώα. Η μείωση των εκπομπών αυξάνεται περαιτέρω αν ληφθεί υπόψη η μείωση της πρόσληψης ξηρής ύλης λόγω του εντερικού μεθανίου και της μειωμένης ποσότητας τροφής, όπως αξιολογήθηκε στην παρούσα διατριβή. Η ενεργειακή ανάλυση διεξήχθη λαμβάνοντας υπόψη την εσωτερική θερμοκρασία του κτηνοτροφικού κτιρίου στους 10 °C (βέλτιστη θερμοκρασία των ζώων) και έδειξε ότι ο συνδυασμός του αυτοματοποιημένου συστήματος και ενός θεωρητικού συστήματος θέρμανσης με βιοαέριο κάλυψε το 96,67% των ενεργειακών αναγκών θέρμανσης στην πρώτη ρύθμιση και το 75% στη δεύτερη, με μόνο 14,17% ποσοστό μη κάλυψης για το σύνολο των σεναρίων που αξιολογήθηκαν. Η μελέτη ανέδειξε επίσης τη δυνατότητα χρήσης της πλεονάζουσας ενέργειας βιοαερίου για τη θέρμανση του πόσιμου νερού και την αύξηση της θερμοκρασίας του, συμβάλλοντας στην περαιτέρω βελτίωση της ευημερίας των ζώων. Το προτεινόμενο σύστημα μπορεί να αποτελέσει μια βιώσιμη λύση για τη μείωση και την κάλυψη των ενεργειακών απαιτήσεων κτηνοτροφικών κτιρίων, επιτυγχάνοντας βέλτιστες συνθήκες καλής διαβίωσης των ζώων και μειωμένες εκπομπές αερίων του θερμοκηπίου για βιωσιμότητα και ενεργειακή απόδοση στις κτηνοτροφικές πρακτικές.

The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), Arabian Sea (AS), and Bay of Bengal (BoB) are recognized for hosting the most intense oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), characterized by severe hypoxia at intermediate depths (Gilly et al., 2013; McCreary et al., 2013). The formation of these OMZs is attributed to a complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical processes, many of which exhibit commonalities across all three basins. Enhanced primary productivity in surface waters fosters organic matter export to deeper layers. This organic matter undergoes intensified decomposition at intermediate depths, leading to oxygen depletion through microbial respiration (Breitburg et al., 2018; Gilly et al., 2013; Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; Pennington et al., 2006). Furthermore, sluggish circulation patterns within these basins limit the advection of oxygen-rich waters into the OMZ, and weak vertical mixing restricts oxygen replenishment from the surface (Breitburg et al., 2018; Gilly et al., 2013; Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; McCreary et al., 2013).The Bay of Bengal oxygen minimum zone (BoB-OMZ) deviates from the typical pattern observed in the ETP and AS despite sharing common drivers for OMZ formation (Gilly et al., 2013; McCreary et al., 2013). This disparity underscores the significant influence of regional factors on the BoB-OMZ's characteristics. A key distinction lies in the primary mechanism responsible for its persistence. Microbial processes such as denitrification and anammox are crucial for oxygen consumption in the ETP and AS (Rao et al., 1994; Gilly et al., 2013; Kalvelage et al., 2013; Castro-González et al., 2014). In contrast, the BoB-OMZ primarily owes its existence to intense salinity stratification (Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; Sarma et al., 2018; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021). This stratification effectively traps oxygen-depleted waters, hindering vertical mixing and oxygen replenishment from the surface. Cyclonic eddies further influence the intensity and distribution of the BoB-OMZ (Sarma et al., 2018). Interestingly, anticyclonic eddies can sporadically ventilate the BoB-OMZ with oxygen-rich surface waters, leading to temporary weakening and spatial heterogeneity of the hypoxic zone (Sarma and Udaya Bhaskar, 2018). These contrasting mechanisms, absent in the ETP and AS, contribute to the BoB-OMZ's weaker overall intensity and dynamic nature.The intensity and extent of the BoB-OMZ exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations. In the northern BoB, influenced by major river discharge from the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, the summer monsoon and post-monsoon seasons see intensified salinity stratification, leading to a more pronounced OMZ (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Jana et al., 2015; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021; Sarma et al., 2016). This stratification traps oxygen-depleted waters, hindering vertical mixing and oxygen replenishment. Additionally, the cross-shelf transport of organic matter from the western BoB fuels microbial decomposition, resulting in a stronger OMZ compared to the eastern region (Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021). Recent studies suggest the possibility of even more intense OMZ formation in the northwestern BoB during winter (Bristow et al., 2017), potentially due to enhanced nutrient input from rivers or atmospheric deposition. However, Sridevi and Sarma (2021) propose that these intense episodes might be transient features caused by eddies. Biogeochemically, the BoB-OMZ is considered weaker compared to other regions. This can be attributed to factors such as weak upwelling, limited primary productivity, and rapid sinking of organic carbon to the deep sea, reducing the availability of organic matter for microbial oxygen consumption (Rao et al., 1994; Ittekkot et al., 1991; Naqvi et al., 1996; Ramaiah et al., 2010; McCreary et al., 2013). Furthermore, several studies suggest that riverine nutrients are rapidly consumed within a limited distance (20 km) from the coast, restricting their contribution to offshore OMZ intensification (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Sarma et al., 2018).The Godavari River, India's third-longest fluvial system (1,465 km), is driven by the monsoon cycle, resulting in concentrated discharge from July to September (Central Water Commission, 2019). This peak discharge coincides with the BoB's highest riverine input, contrasting with the dominance of tidal processes in other seasons (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Sarma et al., 2010). While the influence of major rivers such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra on the northern BoB-OMZ is well-established (Jana et al., 2015; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021), the annual impact of medium-sized rivers such as the Godavari remains less explored. This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the annual cycle of Godavari River discharge (GRD), its potential effects on local coastal primary productivity, and its contribution to the development of a seasonal OMZ near the river mouth. The following section outlines the methodology and details the datasets employed. Section 3 presents our findings on the seasonal evolution of the BoB- OMZ, the biogeochemistry in the river mouth region, and the potential mechanisms driving the intense OMZs observed near the Godavari. Finally, section 4 provides a comprehensive summary and concluding remarks. The GRD data utilized in this study were obtained from the Dowleiswaram barrage, located approximately 50 km upstream of the river's confluence with the BoB. This barrage serves as the final major infrastructure point along the Godavari's course, regulating the downstream flow of freshwater into the BoB. Daily measurements of water released from the Dowleiswaram barrage provided a high- resolution record of GRD variations. These daily values were subsequently aggregated to generate monthly mean time series data spanning 29 years (1990-2018). The use of Dowleiswaram barrage discharge as a proxy for total GRD into the BoB is justified due to several factors. First, the barrage captures the vast majority of the Godavari's freshwater input, as evidenced by minimal tributaries downstream. Second, the relatively short distance (50 km) between the barrage and the BoB minimizes potential losses through evaporation or tributary inputs. This time series data of mean monthly GRD serve as a key foundation for our investigation of the river's influence on coastal BoB dynamics. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the GRD data used in this study were not publicly available. The data was obtained from Superintending Engineer, Irrigation Circle, Dhavaleswaram, Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh (https://irrigationap.cgg.gov.in/wrd/home; scicbowlm@gmail.com).This study leverages Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-ARGO) data, a critical component of the Global Ocean Observing System (Notarstefano, 2020), to provide high-resolution in situ station observations in the vicinity of the Godavari River mouth. Within the extensive BGC-ARGO network, we identified two floats (2902264 and 2902193) strategically positioned within the plume of low-saline GRD. The precise locations of these floats are presented in Figure 1, along with their temporal and location information in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S1, S2. These two floats provided individual quality-controlled profiles of various oceanographic parameters. Float 2902193 completed 184 data cycles, with three profiles (cycles 49, 59, and 71) acquired within the vicinity of the GRD region through the fall to early winter (mid-September to December). Float 2902264 completed 268 cycles, with three profiles (cycles 41, 44, and 60) in the GRD region through the fall to the winter months (mid-October to January). Both floats were stationed outside the GRD region for the remaining data cycles. Consequently, only the three profiles acquired within the GRD region, as outlined above, were utilized for the analysis of dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and particle backscattering coefficient information at 700 nm (bb700) in this study. The DO measurements offer insights into potential oxygen depletion associated with enhanced organic matter decomposition driven by the GRD influx. Chl-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, acts as a marker of primary productivity potentially stimulated by nutrient enrichment from the river discharge. Finally, the particle backscattering coefficient serves as an indicator of the presence and type of suspended particles, including phytoplankton and non-living organic matter, which the GRD dynamics can influence. By scrutinizing these critical variables from the strategically located BGC-ARGO floats, we aim to provide robust observational evidence to confirm and refine our understanding of the Godavari River's impact on the biogeochemical dynamics of the coastal BoB region. We obtained BGC-ARGO data from https:// biogeochemical-argo.org/data-access.php. To gain further insights into potential spatial biogeochemical responses to the GRD, we also drew upon complementary datasets from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) (https://www.oceancolour.org/browser/index.php?product=chlor_ a&page=0.=monthly&version=1&limit=24&from=2002- 01-01&to=2016-01-01&mode=download#results). This fresh initiative provides a robust, merged Level 3 product for monthly mean Chl-a concentrations from 2002 to 2016. This valuable resource utilizes satellite observations from diverse sensors, including Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MERIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), seamlessly combined to offer a comprehensive and spatially extensive view of phytoplankton biomass across the global ocean (Sathyendranath et al., 2019). The 4 km spatial resolution of the OC-CCI Chl-a data strikes a balance between capturing local dynamics near the Godavari estuary and providing regional context for the observed patterns. To further elucidate the potential impact of GRD on primary productivity, we also leverage monthly mean net primary productivity (NPP) data obtained from the same OC-CCI website for the same timeframe (2002-2016) (https://www.oceancolour.org/browser/index.php?product=pp&page=0&limit=24&from=2002-01-01&to=2016-01- 01&mode=browse#results). NPP is estimated using the Ocean Production from the Absorption of Light (OPAL) model. This model builds upon the framework originally proposed by Marra et al. (2003). NPP is integrated over the euphotic zone and expressed in grams of carbon per square meter of sea surface (g C m-2). Four key satellite-derived inputs that are assimilated into OPAL are surface Chl- a concentration, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation reaching the ocean surface, and the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter. A detailed description of the NPP calculations is available in O'Reilly (2017). This dataset provides a valuable quantitative estimate of the rate at which organic matter is produced by Chl-a-rich phytoplankton biomass within the coastal BoB region. By analyzing the co-variation between Chl-a, and NPP, we aim to gain insights into the potential stimulation of primary productivity by nutrient enrichment associated with the GRD. The World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18) serves as a cornerstone resource for this study, providing a comprehensive set of objectively analyzed climatological fields for the world ocean (https:// www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/world-ocean-atlas-2018/). These fields, derived from in-situ measurements, encompass various oceanographic parameters at standard depth levels across different grid resolutions (5° × 5°, 1° × 1°, and 0.25° × 0.25°). Specifically, the data includes annual, seasonal, and monthly climatologies of temperature, salinity, DO, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate. The annual and seasonal climatologies extend to an impressive depth of 5,500 m, encompassing 102 distinct vertical levels. However, for monthly climatologies, the data extends only up to 1,500 m (57 vertical levels), still providing valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of near-surface ocean processes. Additionally, the chemical parameters (such as DO, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate) are available only on a 5° × 5° and a 1° × 1° horizontal resolution. This choice balances the need for a detailed spatial resolution within the coastal BoB region with the data availability and reliability constraints inherent in monthly climatologies. In this study, we used the monthly climatological salinity (Zweng et al., 2018) on a 0.25° × 0.25° grid, and dissolved oxygen (Garcia et al., 2019) at a 1° × 1° resolution. By leveraging this robust and authoritative dataset, we aim to gain valuable insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of dissolved oxygen and their potential association with the influence of GRD. The monthly mean horizontal and vertical current data (2000-2020) from the Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) developed by the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is used to elucidate the seasonal dynamics of coastal circulation and upwelling near the Godavari River mouth. This advanced reanalysis product (replacing Reanalysis 6) serves as the initial oceanic state for the NCEP's Climate Forecast System (Saha et al., 2006). The GODAS is forced by the momentum flux, heat flux, and freshwater flux. It utilizes a quasi-global configuration of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) MOM.v3 model, encompassing the critical coastal zone with high-resolution grids (1° x 1°, enhanced to 1/3° near the equator) and 40 vertical levels (10 m resolution in the upper 200 m). Leveraging these capabilities of the GODAS data (https:// www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/GODAS/), we estimated the divergence and upwelling of the GRD region. The divergence field represents the net flow of fluid into or out of a specific region and is calculated as the sum of the partial derivatives of the horizontal velocity components (u and v) with respect to x and y, respectively. Positive divergence leads to upwelling as surface water is drawn away, allowing deeper water to rise and replace it.The monthly distribution of the various physical and biogeochemical fields near the GRD region displays interesting signatures (Supplementary Figures S1–S4). Since a detailed analysis of each month will be too descriptive, we focus on January, April, July, and October to examine the evolution of various fields in the boreal seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. GRD exhibits a strong seasonality driven by the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) season. Monthly climatology (Figure 2A) reveals a peak discharge exceeding 4700 m3.s-1 in August, coinciding with peak SWM rainfall. Subsequently, GRD declines through September, October, and November, becoming negligible by December. Surface salinity distribution (Figure 2B) generally shows a freshening trend during fall due to the equatorward movement of the West India Coastal Current (WICC) transporting low-salinity waters from the northern BoB. Interestingly, GRD also contributes significantly to this freshening during the SWM season, causing a decrease in over 2 practical salinity units (psu) near the river mouth compared to the pre- monsoon values. From summer to winter, salinity becomes the dominant factor controlling near-surface density stratification. This stratification results in a shallow mixed layer and the formation of a thick barrier layer. The shallow mixed layer restricts the exchange of air-sea fluxes, while the barrier layer suppresses mass and energy exchange between the surface layers and the deeper ocean interior. In short, though the relative contribution of fresh water from GRD is negligible compared to other rivers (Sarma et al., 2016), it has the potential to impact the physical and biogeochemical state of the BoB, especially near the Godavari River mouth region. GRD profoundly amplifies spatiotemporal Chl-a dynamics in the BoB during the SWM season (Figure 2C). Pre-monsoon and winter months are characterized by Chl-a concentrations lingering well below 0.4 mg.m-3, indicative of quiescent phytoplankton growth. In stark contrast, the SWM season ushers in a vibrant pulse of primary productivity, propelling Chl-a to peak values exceeding 2.2 mg.m-3 within a significantly expanded spatial footprint encompassing regions up to 83°E around the river mouth (Figure 2C). This pronounced Chl-a bloom intricately mirrors the fluctuations in GRD, diminishing in intensity as the monsoon recedes. The riverine influx of nutrients orchestrates this dramatic seasonal spectacle, directly fueling phytoplankton proliferation and consequently boosting regional NPP, as depicted in Figure 2D. NPP exhibits a gradual ascent from April that culminates at the onset of SWM, and surges beyond 1000 mgC.m-2 by July. However, with the waning of the monsoon and subsequent decline in GRD, NPP undergoes a steep drop, leaving the river mouth region with markedly reduced productivity by October. Thus, the annual peak in GRD serves as a potent force, not only inducing vertical stratification but also transforming the BoB into a highly productive ecosystem during the SWM season. The thriving phytoplankton blooms fueled by enhanced nutrients from the Godavari River are projected to contribute to a significant suspension of organic matter in subsurface BoB waters. To gain insights into this process, we utilized particle backscatter data from two BGC-ARGO floats (2902264 and 2902193) deployed near the river mouth (Figure 1). These floats offered three individual profiles spanning the SWM to winter seasons, allowing us to analyze the organic matter dynamics across contrasting productivity regimes. Details of the data acquisition and processing are provided in Table 1. The BGC-ARGO float 2902264 revealed a pronounced peak in particle backscatter (>0.002 m-1), coinciding with elevated Chl-a concentrations (>3.5 mg m-3) at depths between 30 and 50 m in October 2018 (Figures 1A, B). This peak, located at a depth of 40-50 m, suggests a substantial abundance of organic matter during peak productivity. By November, the intensity of the particle backscatter peak diminished to 0.00165 m-1 at 39 m, accompanied by a reduction in Chl-a to 1.5 mg.m-3 at 37 m. This decline implied a weakening of organic matter abundance as productivity decreased. Notably, while the extreme particle backscatter peaks were absent by January 2019, Chl-a exhibited a secondary peak at 48 m, albeit with a lower magnitude (<0.8 mg.m- 3). This suggests a potential decoupling between Chl-a and organic particle suspension during this period. Data from BGC-ARGO float 2902193 qualitatively support the observed patterns from float 2902264 (Figures 1C, D) in the upper 80 m of the water column. The highest values for both particle backscatter (>0.003 m-1) and Chl-a (>3.5 mg.m-3) were observed during November 2016 (late fall/early winter season) at depths between 25 and 40 m. The peak particle backscatter (>0.003 m-1) occurred at 38 m, while the peak Chl-a (>3.5 mg.m-3) was slightly shallower at 28 m. These elevated values suggest an enhanced production and possible export of organic matter during the fall, following the peak productivity of the SWM. However, the September 2016 data showed lower particle backscatter (<0.0028 m-1) and significantly reduced Chl-a (<1.9 mg.m-3), indicating weaker organic matter suspension preceding the fall peak. Interestingly, while December 2016 exhibited the highest particle backscatter value (>0.0032 m-1) between 85 and 95 m, Chl-a concentrations remained very low (<1 mg.m-3) at depths between 30 and 80 m. This discrepancy suggests a potential decoupling between particle export and phytoplankton biomass at deeper depths during this period. Thus, our analysis of the BGC-ARGO data from both floats indicates a seasonal pattern of enhanced Chl-a inducing an elevated particle backscatter underneath it, along with increased organic matter abundance near the Godavari River mouth region, particularly at depths between 25 and 55 m during the fall season. Furthermore, this abundance appears to be linked to elevated Chl-a and NPP during the preceding SWM season.Hence, GRD significantly impacts the river mouth region during the SWM season through a multifaceted interplay of stratification, primary productivity, and organic matter abundance. The pronounced stratification resulting from a shallow mixed layer and a thick barrier layer generated by GRD restricts vertical mixing, potentially minimizing DO transport from the surface to subsurface layers. Simultaneously, the riverine influx of nutrients fuels phytoplankton growth, leading to enhanced Chl-a concentrations and culminating in elevated NPP. This primary productivity surge drives organic matter export into subsurface layers, potentially capable of influencing DO distribution through microbial decomposition processes. In conclusion, the combined effects of altered stratification, intensified primary productivity at the surface, and organic matter sinking into subsurface layers during the post-SWM season are likely to significantly modify the DO distribution (both horizontal and vertical) near the Godavari River mouth region. The region near the Godavari River mouth lies within the BoB- OMZ, a persistent feature characterized by year-round hypoxic conditions at intermediate depths (200-1,000 m). This section focuses on the potential impact of enhanced organic matter sinking during the SWM and early fall seasons on the distribution of DO and the dynamics (intensity and upper limit) of the BoB-OMZ in the Godavari River mouth region. Analysis of DO profiles from BGC-ARGO floats near the Godavari River mouth reveals the presence of an OMZ (DO within 0-0.5 ml.l-1) between 50 to 800 m (average depth levels), with a dynamic response to seasonal changes in organic matter input (Figure 3). Both floats exhibit a shoaling and intensification of the OMZ during the fall season, indicating a potential influence of riverine flow on DO consumption. At float 2902264, the upper limit of the OMZ deepened from 40-45 m in October 2018 (DO ~ 0 ml.l-1) to 50m in November (DO ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) and to 100 m by January 2019 (DO ~0.5 ml.l-1) (Figure 3A). This pattern suggests a gradual deepening of the OMZ as surface productivity declined and oxygen consumption in subsurface layers for microbial respiration reduced. Float 2902193 exhibited a similar trend, with the upper OMZ boundary at 35-40 m in November 2016 (following the SWM with a DO of ~ 0 ml.l-1), which was as deep as 75 m in September (pre-SWM with a DO of ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) and further down to 105 m in December (with a DO of ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) (Figure 3B). These observations collectively suggest a significant shoaling and intensification of the OMZ near the Godavari River mouth during the fall season. Thus, the enhanced Chl-a and particle backscatter (between 25 and 55 m depth) during the fall season driven by GRD (Figure 1) coincides with shoaling and intensification of the OMZ near the Godavari River mouth. This provides strong evidence for the potential impact of high organic matter sinking on the dynamics of the BoB-OMZ. The limited availability of BGC-ARGO observations in the GRD region restricts our ability to investigate the seasonal evolution of DO. Therefore, we turn to the objectively analyzed WOA18 DO data, despite its coastal data gap. WOA18 offers sufficient coverage (>80% data availability) for a 63-year period (1955-2017), enabling seasonal analysis of various ocean fields. Figures 4A–D display the vertical distribution of DO (surface to 500 m) in the BoB near GRD (16.8°N) during different seasons, derived from WOA18. High DO concentrations (>4-5 ml.l-1) characterize the basin's surface layers (~0-80 m) year-round. Below this, the OMZ prevails, with its upper boundary primarily residing between 80-200 m, exhibiting seasonal and spatial variations. Winter and spring months reveal similar spatial patterns of the OMZ (Figures 4A, B), with its upper limit confined between 80-110 m depth. A pronounced OMZ (DO < 0.3 ml.l-1) persists below 500 m throughout these seasons. Summer (July) exhibits distinct spatial patterns from the previous two seasons (Figure 4C). Except for a narrow depth range (200-250 m, 92.5-93.5°E), DO levels below the mixed layer generally remain above 0.2 ml.l-1. Additionally, the OMZ upper boundary in the western basin deepens to 110-130 m. The fall season witnesses the most profound OMZ expansion and intensification near the western basin, where the Godavari River discharges (Figure 4D). DO levels below 0.1 ml.l-1 appear between 60-175 m in this region, a stark contrast to summer values of 1-1.5 ml.l-1 (Figure 4C). The shoaling and intensification of the OMZ at subsurface depths (40-200 m) near the Godavari River mouth, evident in the BGC- ARGO and WOA18 data during fall, necessitates further investigation. To validate this localized phenomenon, we delved deeper into the seasonal evolution of DO within this critical depth range (40-200 m) in the western BoB (Figures 4E–H). Winter reveals a clear influx of highly oxygenated water from the southern BoB (Figure 4E), aided by the prevailing ocean current system (Figure 2B). This influx maintains sufficient DO (>1 ml.l-1) in the western BoB throughout winter and spring (Figures 4E, F). Even in summer (July) (Figure 4G), subsurface DO (averaged over 40-200 m) near the Godavari River mouth remains moderate, exceeding 1.2 ml.l-1. However, a dramatic shift occurs in the fall (October) as the region transforms into an oxygen-depleted zone (<0.5 ml.l-1) (Figure 4H). This stark contrast highlights the dynamic seasonal cycle of subsurface DO in the western BoB. While oxygenated waters prevail near the Godavari delta basin during winter, spring, and summer, a localized and intense OMZ establishes itself near the river mouth during fall. Thus, coinciding with the retreat of the SWM season, the confluence of increased organic matter input from the Godavari River and enhanced stratification likely contributes to the generation of an intense and shallow subsurface OMZ (40-200 m) near the river mouth. The genesis and dynamics of the pronounced subsurface OMZ observed near the GRD region after the retreat of the SWM season are likely influenced by a complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical factors. In this section, we focus on analyzing other processes such as surface ocean circulation and divergence in the western BoB near the GRD region (Figure 5) using GODAS data, recognizing their crucial role in upwelling and associated biogeochemical processes influencing OMZ dynamics. The surface circulation in the western BoB exhibits distinct seasonal patterns near the Godavari River mouth, playing a crucial role in regional upwelling and potentially influencing the observed OMZ dynamics. The pre-Southwest Monsoon and SWM seasons are characterized by strong northward coastal currents and an eastward current across the BoB, as shown in Figures 5B, C, respectively. Additionally, during the SWM season, south-westerly winds induce positive divergence along the western BoB coast, favoring coastal upwelling (Figure 5C). Following the retreat of the SWM season, the strong monsoon currents subside, and southward- moving coastal currents dominate the western BoB (Figure 5D). This shift creates favorable conditions for upwelling near the GRD region and northwards, indicated by positive surface divergence (Figure 5D). Winter (January) sees a further weakening of the southward current, and positive divergence persists near the GRD region, suggesting continued upwelling potential (Figure 5A). Thus the oceanic region near the GRD experiences favorable conditions for upwelling throughout the SWM, fall, and late winter periods due to the combined influence of surface currents and divergence. This sustained upwelling could potentially contribute to the observed surge in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), NPP, and the subsequent intensification and vertical expansion (shoaling) of the OMZ observed after the retreat of the SWM season. To provide insights into the interplay between GRD and upwelling in shaping dissolved DO and OMZ dynamics in the BoB, we selected two geographically distinct study regions. Box A (82-84°E, 15.5-17°N) lies directly at the Godavari River mouth, maximizing its exposure to GRD influence and benefiting from favorable upwelling conditions during the SWM season. In contrast, Box B (84-86°E, 17-18.5°N), located slightly north, experiences minimized GRD influence while retaining similar upwelling conditions during the SWM season. This strategic selection allows for a comparative analysis, disentangling the individual and combined effects of GRD and upwelling on DO and OMZ dynamics. Figure 6 represents the seasonal evolution of vertical velocity (GODAS data), and those of Chl-a (OC-CCI data), NPP (OC-CCI), and depth-averaged (40-200 m) dissolved oxygen (WOA18 data) in these two selected oceanic regions. The analysis unfolds similar qualitative patterns for vertical velocity (upwelling) in both boxes. In both the oceanic regions, upwelling increases with the emergence of the SWM season and starts declining with its withdrawal. In comparison, Box A records higher values for upwelling than Box B (Figure 6A). The highest upwelling was recorded in July in both boxes, 0.72×10-5 m.s-1 in Box A and 0.58×10-5 m.s-1 in Box B. The increase in upwelling during the SWM season clearly reflects the seasonal evolution of Chl-a in Box A, whereas Box B shows a slight decreasing trend from June to July, although it maintained an overall increasing trend during the SWM season (Figure 6B). Both the regions reflected mild Chl-a values during rest of the year. In comparison, Chl-a blooms in Box A (0.8-0.9 mg.m-3) were almost twice as intense as Box B (0.4-0.5 mg.m-3) during the SWM season. NPP also showed a similar seasonal signature (Figure 6C). Both boxes highlighted an increasing trend in NPP during the SWM season and showed similar patterns during the rest of the year. Similar to the Chl-a distribution, Box A recorded very high (> 1100 mgC.m-3) NPP distribution compared to Box B (< 850 mgC.m-3) during the SWM season. The rise in Chl- a and NPP during the SWM season significantly impacted seasonal DO fluctuations in both study regions (Figure 6D). While DO exhibited a mildly increasing trend in both boxes during late winter and pre-monsoon, it displayed a substantial decline with the onset of the SWM season. In Box A, DO plummeted from 3 ml.l-1 in May to a critical low of 0.1 ml.l-1 in October (fall), representing a drastic decrease of 2.9 ml.l-1. In contrast, Box B experienced a smaller decline, with DO decreasing from 2.2 ml.l-1 in June to an average of 0.55 ml.l-1 during fall (September-November), representing a decrease of 1.75 ml.l-1. In conclusion, it is evident that SWM- driven biogeochemical activity was significantly enhanced in Box A, directly influenced by GRD, leading to pronounced oxygen consumption during fall. This comparative analysis highlights the crucial role of GRD in shaping DO and OMZ dynamics in the BoB. This study delves into the profound biogeochemical impact of GRD in the BoB, with a particular focus on the region near the river mouth. Our key finding is the intriguing presence of an intense and shallow OMZ within the subsurface (40-200 m) depths near the Godavari River mouth during the post-monsoon season which has hardly been mentioned previously. Notably, this phenomenon differs from the conventional intermediate-depth BoB-OMZ prevalent in the basin (McCreary et al., 2013). The temporal evolution of this shallow OMZ was elucidated through data from two BGC-ARGO floats located close to the river discharge region. Their observations revealed a clear intensification and shoaling of the OMZ during fall. To unveil the spatial extent and context of this phenomenon, we leveraged the broader coverage of WOA18 data, facilitating comparisons with other crucial variables. Furthermore, to disentangle the relative influence of GRD and upwelling on OMZ dynamics, we conducted a comparative analysis in two geographically distinct locations. This comparative analysis proved the pivotal role of GRD in shaping the biogeochemical environment near the river mouth. Despite both regions experiencing similar upwelling patterns, the area directly influenced by GRD exhibited significantly higher Chl-a blooms, enhanced NPP during the SWM season, and a more pronounced oxygen consumption during fall. These observations strongly suggest that the extensive nutrient influx from GRD fuels increased primary productivity, leading to enhanced organic matter suspension and subsequent oxygen depletion in the subsurface layers, culminating in the observed intense and shallow OMZ. Our findings paint a compelling picture of the substantial influence of GRD on BoB biogeochemistry, particularly in the vicinity of the river mouth. Briefly, during the SWM season, the influx of nutrients from GRD, combined with enhanced coastal upwelling, creates favorable conditions for phytoplankton blooms. These blooms, peaking in August and September, are characterized by high Chl-a concentrations and lead to a surge in NPP. However, this elevated productivity comes with a subsequent cost. As the blooms senesce and decompose by fall, an elevation in suspended organic matter at the subsurface depths (40-200 m) develops. This organic matter fuels the activity of heterotrophic microbial communities, leading to intense oxygen consumption through respiration. This microbial respiration, coupled with the reduced atmospheric oxygen supply due to strong stratification, drives the shoaling and intensification of the OMZ off the Godavari River mouth. Understanding and quantifying these impacts are crucial for various reasons. First, alterations in GRD can directly affect primary productivity and food webs in the coastal zone. Second, changes in the OMZ's intensity can influence the release of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and N2O, potentially impacting global climate change. Finally, understanding the dynamic interplay between riverine inputs, upwelling, and biogeochemical processes is critical for predicting and managing the future state of the BoB ecosystem. In summary, although the discharge of the Godavari River is negligible compared to other rivers flowing into the BoB, GRD plays a pivotal role in shaping the biogeochemistry of the bay, with profound impacts on primary productivity, oxygen dynamics, and greenhouse gas emissions. Further research is needed to fully understand the intricate interactions between GRD, upwelling, and biogeochemical processes, and to predict the consequences of future alterations in riverine inputs on this vital ecosystem. It should, however, be noted that the interpretations derived from our analysis are subject to the limited temporal and spatial sample extent, which precludes us from any statistical significance test of the results. We are in the process of initiating a few high-resolution sensitivity experiments with the ocean model that will be 15-20 years long. The outputs will enable us to quantify the contributions of each parameter separately.
