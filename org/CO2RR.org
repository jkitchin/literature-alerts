The increasing emission of carbon dioxide worldwide has emerged as a major global concern in the context of addressing climate change. Converting CO2 to high-value carbon materials is a promising solution to capture emitted carbon for achieving carbon neutrality. Furthermore, such conversion can provide carbon nanomaterials for key industries, including the lithium battery and fuel cell industries. Here, it is shown that sub-50 nm tangled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be synthesized by adjusting the metaborate concentration and the current density through the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide in a molten carbonate salt. The metaborate ion concentration affects the product selectivity and carbon morphology, and the current density is strongly related to the particle size of in situ seed catalysts supplied by the dissolution of an Ni-Fe-Cr alloy anode. The optimized process conditions control the nucleation and growth of carbon via a tip-growth mechanism, thereby promoting the formation of sub-50 nm CNTs rather than bulky irregular carbon particles. The Raman and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analyses showed that the properties of the prepared CNTs depended on the synthetic parameters. This study provides deep insights into the mechanism underlying carbon synthesis through the electrochemical reduction of a molten carbonate salt.

The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C‐700‐4) simply by a thermal‐driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen‐doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for carbon dioxide reduction into formate. The in‐situ experimental observation on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen‐doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8% and the long‐time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar‐driven system renders the high 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2%, presenting the impressive solar‐to‐fuel conversion.

Precise regulation of the active site structure is an important means to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts in CO2 electroreduction. Here, we creatively introduce anionic groups, which can not only stabilize metal sites with strong coordination ability but also have rich interactions with protons at active sites to modify the electronic structure and proton transfer process of catalysts. This strategy helps to convert CO2 into fuel chemicals at low overpotentials. As a typical example, a composite catalyst, CuO/Cu‐NSO4/CN, with highly dispersed Cu(II)‐SO4 sites has been reported, in which CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with a high Faradaic efficiency (−0.5 V vs. RHE, FEHCOO−=87.4%). Pure HCOOH is produced with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.3% at a cell voltage of 2.8 V. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that sulfate promotes CO2 transformation into a carboxyl intermediate followed by HCOOH generation, whose mechanism is significantly different from that of the traditional process via a formate intermediate for HCOOH production.

With the emergence of the global energy crisis and global climate change, renewable energy systems, such as fuel cells that turn off energetic oxygen and carbon cycles, are becoming increasingly important. Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO_2 RR) is an important electrocatalytic process on the gas diffusion electrode of CO_2 electrolyzer, which has been paid more and more attention by researchers. The problems of high cost, low efficiency, weak selectivity and stability of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO_2 RR) also continue to be solved. Catalysts are considered a viable way to solve these problems. The Cu-based nanomaterial catalyst has been proven to have a good positive effect on the reaction. In this paper, the current research results of Cu-based nanomaterials on CO_2 RR were reviewed, and the catalytic effects of several different Cu-based nanomaterials on CO_2 RR reactions were compared. This paper collected the researches on the catalytic effect of copper-based nanomaterials on carbon dioxide reduction reactions in the past ten years, and found that most copper-based nanomaterials can improve the efficiency of the reactions and show good selectivity. The aim of this paper is to provide a possible catalytic direction for the improvement of carbon dioxide reduction reactions in industry

Metal-functionalized porphyrin-like graphene structures are promising electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) as their metal centers can modulate activity. Yet, the role of metal center of metalloporphyrins (MTPPs) in CO2 reaction activity is still lacking deep understanding. Here, CO2RR mechanism on MTPPs with five different metal centers (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Zn and Ni) are examined by first-principles calculations. The *COOH formation is the rate determined step on the five MTPP structures, and the CoTPP exhibits the best CO2RR activity while ZnTPP and NiTPP are the worst, which is also verified by our experiment. The CO2RR activity is controlled by adsorption states of intermediates (*CO, *COOH), i.e., chemisorption (e.g., on CoTPP) and physisorption (on ZnTPP and NiTPP) of intermediates will lead to good and poor activity, respectively. The deeper the d-band center of the porphyrin ring complexed metal atom, the weaker bonding of MTPP with CO and COOH. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that MTPPs with Co and Fe centers lead to a reduction in the energy barriers for the two uphill reaction steps in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process, thereby enhancing CO2 reduction electrocatalytic activity. Faradaic efficiency of CO is correlated with the reaction energy barrier of the first proton-coupled electron reduction process, displaying a strong linear correlation. This work provides a fundamental understanding of MTPPs used as electrocatalysts for CO2RR.

A sterically encumbered dinuclear amidinato magnesium hydride 3 with bridging hydrido ligands was synthesized from the metalation of the corresponding amidine 1 with dibutylmagnesium and subsequent treatment with phenylsilane. This complex reacts stoichiometrically with 1 atm of carbon dioxide at room temperature in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to the corresponding bis(thf) adduct of the dinuclear formate complex 4‐2thf with bridging formate anions. This complex is stable in THF at 60°C for more than 16 hours but decomposes into the amidine 1 upon removal of ligated thf ligands . Complex 3 efficiently catalyzes the reduction of carbon dioxide with 9‐BBN, yielding bis(boryl)acetal (R2BO)2CH2, and with silanes H4‐nSiPhn (n = 1, 2, and 3). The bis(silyl)acetal is quantitatively accessible for Ph3SiH (n = 3) whereas during the reduction of CO2 with hydrogen‐richer silanes (n = 1, 2) siloxanes form and methane evolves.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising technique for the production of desirable hydrocarbons without the need to resort to fossil resources. However, high overpotentials and poor selectivity remain a challenge for CO2 electro-reduction, especially for deep reduction by more than two electrons. One apparently attractive approach for breaking the scaling relations caused by simultaneous CO2 reduction pathways and for achieving deeper reduction is the use of multi-metallic electrodes, where several promising metal catalysts are present in close proximity. Herein, noting the activity shown by Ni, Cu and Ag for CO2 electroreduction when used individually, we set out to synthesise a tri-metallic "stack" catalyst, NiCuAg, and then to test this for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The stack architecture was successfully generated and the trimetallic NiCuAg system did show improved Faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid when compared to the bare Ni and bimetallic NiCu controls under some select conditions. However, the two-layer NiCu stack and bare Ni exhibited consistently higher Faradaic efficiencies than NiCuAg for deeper CO2 electroreduction to methanol and ethanol, indicating that the combination of three individually promising metals does not necessarily translate into superior catalytic performance for deep carbon dioxide reduction.

Bismuth-based catalysts are highly promising for the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to formate product. However, achieving high activity and selectivity towards formate and ensuring long-term stability remains challenging. This work reports the oxygen plasma inducing strategy to construct the abundant grain boundaries of Bi/BiOx on ultrathin two-dimensional Bi nanosheets. The oxygen plasma-treated Bi nanosheet (OP-Bi) exhibits over 90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate at a wide potential range from −0.5 to −1.1 V, and maintains a great stability catalytic performance without significant decay over 30 h in flow cell. Moreover, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device with OP-Bi as catalyst sustains the robust current density of 100 mA cm−2 over 50 h, maintaining a formate FE above 90%. In addition, rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery presents the peak power density of 1.22 mW cm−2 with OP-Bi as bifunctional catalyst. The mechanism experiments demonstrate that the high-density grain boundaries of OP-Bi provide more exposed active sites, faster electron transfer capacity, and the stronger intrinsic activity of Bi atoms. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations further elucidate that the unsaturated Bi coordination atoms between the grain boundaries can effectively activate CO2 molecules through elongating the C–O bond, and reducing the formation energy barrier of the key intermediate (*OCOH), thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of eCO2RR to formate product.

Amorphous materials are distinguished by their exceptional attributes, notably their expansive surface area and the profusion of active sites they present. Consequently, the amorphization process stands as an efficacious strategy to augment the catalytic efficacy of electrocatalysts. This is achieved through the meticulous construction of the surface architecture and the precise modulation of the electronic configuration of these materials. Therefore, this review aims to offer a thorough examination of the latest progress in the application of amorphous materials for the enhancement of electrocatalytic processes, with a particular emphasis on the nitrate (NO3‐) reduction reaction (NITRR) and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Initially, we delve into the structural benefits inherent to amorphous materials, outlining the diverse synthesis techniques and characterization methodologies utilized in their development. Following this, we illustrate the utilization of various amorphous materials in NITRR and CO2RR, accentuating how the amorphous framework influences electrocatalytic activities. Concludingly, we encapsulate the merits and the obstacles encountered in the application of amorphous electrocatalysts for NITRR and CO2RR, whilst also forecasting the future direction for the creation of innovative amorphous electrocatalysts.

Understanding the structure-activity relationship of materials that are active for the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2ERR) is crucial for developing stable, high-performance catalysts. In this research, it is first shown that ball-milling is a highly efficient way to disperse cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) onto carbon black without influencing the CO2 electroreduction performance of the resulting materials. Then, the link between the loadings of the CoPC precursor on the carbon support and the CO2ERR activity of the pyrolyzed materials is demonstrated. With CO current efficiencies higher than 45 % and CO current densities as high as -20 mA cm−2 at -0.77 V vs. RHE, the materials with CoPC loadings of 7.9 wt% and higher were still surprisingly active after pyrolysis at 800 and 900°C. On the other hand, the CO2ERR activity of the materials containing less than 6.1 wt% CoPC was drastically reduced after pyrolysis at these temperatures, with CO current efficiencies lower than 10%. X-ray powder diffraction revealed that only the materials containing crystalline CoPC before pyrolysis showed good CO2ERR activity after pyrolysis at 800 and 900°C. Furthermore, X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that the loading of the CoPC precursor influenced the structure of the active sites in the pyrolyzed CoPC/C materials. Overall, this study highlights the importance of the dispersion of CoPC when forming a material that is catalytically active for CO2ERR after pyrolysis.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR) is capable of converting CO2 into a wide range of value‐added products under relatively mild conditions. Electrocatalyst with high selectivity and activity is crucial for high efficient ECO2RR. Herein, Bi‐In2O3 nanoflower catalysts with different metal ratios synthesized by wet chemical method are used for ECO2RR to produce formate. The results indicate that the hydrogen evolution activity of the Bi‐In2O3 catalysts during ECO2RR is suppressed at a low level and the activity and selectivity of formate production is related to the ratio of Bi to In content in the catalysts. The optimized Bi‐In2O3 catalyst with the ratio of Bi6In94 can achieve a high formate Faradaic efficiency (FEformate) over 80% under a wide potential range from ‐0.7 V to ‐1.2 V vs. RHE, with the maximum value of 88.1% at ‐0.7 V vs. RHE. Meanwhile, the highest formate partial current density reaches 47.7 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.2 V vs. RHE and the current density and Faradaic efficiency remain stable during the 10 h stability test. The enhanced formate formation on Bi‐In2O3 NF can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Bi and In according to the characterizations of the Bi‐In2O3 NF.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a sustainable strategy for producing fuels and chemicals. However, it suffers from sluggish CO2 activation and slow water dissociation. In this work, we construct a (P‐O)δ− modified In catalyst that exhibits high activity and selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate. A combination of in‐situ characterizations and kinetic analyses indicate that (P‐O)δ− has a strong interaction with K+(H2O)n, which effectively accelerates water dissociation to provide protons. In‐situ attenuated total reflectance surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS) measurements together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that (P‐O)δ− modification leads to a higher valence state of In active site, thus promoting CO2 activation and HCOO* formation, while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the (P‐O)δ− modified oxide‐derived In catalyst exhibits excellent formate selectivity across a broad potential window with a formate Faradaic efficiency as high as 92.1% at a partial current density of ~200 mA cm−2 and a cathodic potential of ‐1.2 V vs. RHE in an alkaline electrolyte.

In CO2RR, enhancing CO adsorption could suppress desorption and increase *CO concentration for deep reduction. An underlying concern is that strong adsorption might result in high thermodynamic barrier for *CO hydrogenation, however, kinetic barrier firstly dominates the reaction pathway and determines the products selectivity. Directed by above idea, CO2RR performance on Mn, Cu doped nitrogenated carbon (MnCu-NC) is comprehensively studied using density functional theory (DFT). MnCu-NC shows a mild limiting potential of -0.59 V (*CO → *CHO) for CH3OH and CH4 products. CO poisoning is likely to cause catalyst deactivation, while CO modified MnCu-NC shows a slightly increased limiting potential of -0.63 V (*COCO → *COCHO) for CH3OH and CH4, and hydrogen evolution is significantly suppressed. Further comparative studies indicate that kinetic barrier for *CO hydrogenation is crucial for deep reduction, and C−O activation, as well as CO adsorption is enhanced by Π-backbonding. Besides, introduction Cu to dual-atom catalyst (DAC) could help retain more electrons and Mn has strong magnetization for charge transfer, both of which improve the charge densities and Π-backbonding strength, thus boosting the remarkable CO2RR performance toward CH4 and CH3OH on MnCu-NC.

With a significant share of renewable power generation integrated into the power supply, it is crucial to timely adjust the regulating peak load for coal-fired power plants equipped with CO2 capture to ensure the stable operation of the multi-energy supply system. In this paper, the effects of varying boiler loads on the techno-economic performance of the retrofitted power plant were studied. Furthermore, the potential for reducing the cost of CO2 capture was investigated, and early opportunities for demonstration were discussed. Results showed that when the boiler load decreased from 100% turbine heat acceptance condition to 50% turbine heat acceptance condition, the cost of CO2 capture increased from 37.0 $/t CO2 to 57.0 $/t CO2, cost contribution of energy penalty and extra capital investment also increased from 20.6 $/t-CO2 to 25.7 $/t-CO2, and from 16.4 $/t-CO2 to 31.3 $/t-CO2, respectively. Furthermore, by improving separation efficiency from 0.15 to 0.5, a 25% to 30% reduction in CO2 capture cost can be achieved. The cost of CO2 capture could decrease by 42.2–50.5% when the cumulative capacity reaches 250 GW under the high investment learning rate scenario. According to the distribution of coal prices and renewable energy sources in China, the early demonstration projects of multi-energy supply systems should prioritize the northern region. The results of this work can provide informative references for making roadmaps and policies for CO2 emission reduction toward carbon neutrality.

The wide product spectrum resulting from the intricate reactions of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) makes CO2RR unfavorable for industrial electrolysis. Herein, we demonstrate a hydrogen-feeding effect from copper-silica catalysts that can regulate CO2RR product selectivity via modulation of Cu dispersion in the copper-silica core-shell particles. We found electromethanation of CO2 is greatly enhanced on Cu-Si catalyst with optimally dispersed Cu nanoparticles, resulting in a high methane Faradaic efficiency of 72.9 %. In contrast, a lower or higher Cu dispersion correlated to a preferential (co-)production of methane and ethylene or hydrogen. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and spectroscopic analysis, we show Cu dispersion affects the Cu coverage on SiO2 and the exposure of Cu-O-Si interfacial sites for CO2RR and water dissociation. An optimum Cu dispersion creates abundant Cu-O-Si sites with reduced energy barriers for both the hydrogenation of *CHO and water dissociation, leading to selective methane formation.

The utilization of photothermocatalytic dry reforming of methane is shown to be an up-and-coming technology. However, reaching high fuel productivity at a comparatively low light intensity and effectively suppressing the side reactions of coking in the DRM process are still two tough difficulties. Under focused UV–vis–IR irradiation at a relatively low light intensity of 80.5 kW m−2, a nanostructure of Co/Mg-CoAl2O4 possesses excellent photothermocatalytic activity and a light-to-fuel efficiency of 34.2 % and a low carbon deposition rate compared to its reference catalyst without Mg2+ doping (Co/CoAl2O4). The improved photothermocatalytic activity and coking resistance of Co/Mg-CoAl2O4 mainly comes from the synergetic effect, including Mg2+ doping, the active lattice oxygen in CoAl2O4 also participating in the oxidation of carbon species, and strong light absorption properties of the Mg-CoAl2O4. The photoactivation promotes DRM on Co nanoparticles while significantly facilitates the C* oxidation by strongly adsorbed CO2 on doped Mg2+.

Decarbonization of the power sector means a reduction of its CO2 intensity, which reduces the emission of carbon dioxide per unit of electrici­ty generated. In order to meet the emission reduction targets pledged to the Paris Agreement on climate change, power utility companies need to devel­op strategies on how to decarbonize their generation assets. Companies must achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which is necessary to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement of capping global temperature rise at 1.5°C and to meet the less ambitious 2°C target. Rapid decarbonization of the power sector is needed particularly as heat and transport sectors are electrified, creating an increase in demand for electric power. Decarbonization is being achieved by increasing the share of low-carbon energy sources, particularly renewables, and a corresponding reduction in the use of fossil fuels. Worldwide, renewa­bles now produce a third of power capacity.

The complexity and interdependence of all factors of forest ecosystems is reflected in the general state of the environment. The forest moderates air temperature fluctuations by 1.5–4° C, and creates a more favorable temperature regime in the soil. Atmospheric precipitation in the forest is absorbed by the forest litter, which slows down surface runoff and prolongs the period of water infiltration. The wind speed in the forest is 30% lower than the wind speed in the open space, and wind protection is manifested in a radius 3–5 times greater than the average height of the trees. Forest vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and uses it for its growth in the process of photosynthesis. This process leads to a decrease in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and contributes to reducing the negative effects of the greenhouse. In this way, forests influence the prevention of the occurrence of unfavorable scenarios of surface global warming, which may manifest with an increase in temperature by as much as 5.8° C. Forests play a key role in maintaining the oxygen-carbon dioxide balance because they annually release 9–13 t/ha of CO2, and bind 6–18 t/ha of CO2. A monofunctional approach to forest ecosystems, where forests are viewed exclusively through the prism of the production (assortment) function, still exists it burdens the perception and evaluation of numerous ecological and social functions. However, even today, around 1.15 billion hectares of forests (30%) are used primarily for the production of wood and non–wood forest products. Some of the ecological potential of forest complexes is reflected in the absorption of dust particles, sulfur dioxide, the release of oxygen, the binding of carbon dioxide, and the release of phytoncides. One hectare of forest absorbs 30 to 70 tons of dust annually. Coniferous forests absorb 30−35 tons of dust annually, and deciduous forests 50-76 tons. A hectare of forest absorbs about 100 kg of SO2, releases 3 to 11 t of oxygen and binds 4 to 15 t of CO2 per day. Thanks to the phytoncide action, a cubic meter of forest air contains 250 to 300 times less bacteria than city air. Forest ecosystems contain more carbon per unit area than any other terrestrial ecosystem. Amounts of soil organic carbon in the upper 30 cm of soil vary from 1.7 to 4.2 kg C.m-2 for organic layers and from 5.0 to 9.5 kg C.m-2 for mineral layers. The layers of the forest mat and the surface horizons of the forest soil of coniferous forests are large acceptors of heavy metals. Risks caused by numerous disruptions of natural processes (climate change, drought, storm winds, erosion, fires, etc.) have a major impact on the sustainable development of natural resources and threaten the environment, infrastructure, forest ecosystems, agricultural production, water availability and public health. The threat of forests, disappearance, degradation and drying of forests affect the reduction of the impact of the forest on the balance in the biosphere, the reduction of the volume of biomass production and the endangerment of the environment. Existing forests continue to suffer the direct and indirect effects of human action, whether from deliberate deforestation, damage from numerous conflicts and wars, to the careless actions of mining companies and illegal activities, or damage from legal and illegal logging. Around the world, severe forest fires have not only shown the combined effects of careless human activities in and around forests and global warming, but have also shown how quickly forests can be lost. In Europe, almost 45.000 forest fires occur every year, covering of 500.000 ha. The Balkan Peninsula is one of the areas with the highest risk of drought. Frequent and long-lasting drought leads to a decrease in the vitality and gradual deterioration of forests due to a decrease in soil moisture, the appearance of climatic extremes, a shortening of the vegetation period, difficult regeneration, a decrease in resistance to harmful biotic factors (the appearance of epiphytophytes of pathogenic fungi or gradation of economically harmful insects), all of which can lead to the drying of forests on a wider scale. For the environment, the general utility functions of forests related to tourist-recreational, health, water protection, historical, cultural and other values are particularly important. These functions are reduced due to the degradation and devastation of forests because these processes affect the increase in the intensity of climate change, the reduction of biodiversity, the reduction of renewable energy sources, the decline of economic development, the occurrence of erosion and flood, increase in atmospheric CO2, decline in quality of life, occurrence of diseases, etc. The complexity of the relationship between forest ecosystems and the environment needs to be viewed from multiple aspects and understood through an ecological, economic and social interconnected system. Understanding the impact of the forest requires the study of all characteristics of forest ecosystems, such as pedological, phytocenological, typological and other research. The destruction and fragmentation of urban forests, the loss of certain valuable trees, as well as the loss of fauna, threaten the ecological integrity and functioning of natural ecosystems, which directly affects the quality of life in urban areas. Domestic and international legislation and strategic decisions related to forest ecosystems are closely related to similar documents related to the environment. These documents mainly indicate the need to increase forest cover, preserve existing forests, multifunctional use of forest resources and sustainable development.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is well recognized as one of the key intermediates for carbon dioxide (CO2) electrolytic reduction to C2+ products, which has been a hot research field recently. Developing an efficient catalyst that focuses on achieving C-C coupling is highly important for the production of C2+ products. In the present work, we present a feasible approach via the combination of electrostatic assembly and the hydrothermal method of coupling silicon polyanions and copper salts to build an amorphous copper hybrid material wrapped in carbon-silica, denoted as CuO@C-SiO2-X (where X means preparation temperature), as an efficient electrocatalyst for carbon monoxide reduction mainly to liquid C2+ products. The CuO@C-SiO2-X catalyst demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity, especially to C2+ liquid products with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 81.5%. Additionally, the catalyst showed good stability. The presence of carbon enhanced electronic conductivity, and the silica protected the amorphous CuO from aggregation into crystalline structures. The present work not only provides an efficient catalyst for CO electrocatalytic reduction to liquid C2+ chemicals but also offers a protocol for building Cu-based catalysts with high selectivity to C2+ products in CO reduction.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to produce high-value multicarbon products represents a challenging yet highly desirable process, particularly due to the inefficient C–C coupling observed in current electrocatalysts. In this study, Cu2+ and Co2+ were introduced into ZIF-8 as precursors to synthesize a series of Co- and CuCo-doped carbon nanostructure materials with varying Co-to-Cu ratios. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the successful doping of metal Co in the form of Co–Nx, while Cu was partly doped as nanoparticles attached to the carbon substrate surface and partly as single atoms forming Cu–Nx. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses revealed uniform distribution of elemental Co and Cu on the carbon substrate, with Cu loaded as nanocluster on the surface. Linear sweep voltammetry tests indicated that Cu/CoCu-Nx-C composites exhibited enhanced reactivity toward CO2 reduction compared to other samples. At −0.19 V (vs RHE), the Faradaic efficiencies (FEs %) of C2H4, C2H6, CH4, CO, and H2 over Cu/CoCu-Nx-C were 29.7, 8.6, 20.2, 9.8, and 31.5%, respectively. The influence of Co and Cu doping modes on the selectivity of electrocatalytic reduction products was investigated. Results showed that Cu/CoCu-Nx-C exhibited a higher FE of C2 compared to Cu/Cu–Nx-C, with nearly 10 times higher C2 current density. Mechanistic insights from acid-etching experiments and XPS revealed a synergistic interaction between metallic Co and Cu, promoting the generation of multicarbon products. Co–Nx improved *CO coverage, facilitating subsequent C–C coupling on neighboring Cu–Nx. Additionally, CH4 production was attributed to the (111) crystalline facets in the Cu nanocluster and isolated Cu–Nx. Overall, this research provides an important understanding of the creation of straightforward and effective catalysts for the reduction of CO2. It holds considerable potential for the production of hydrocarbons using carbon dioxide.

Utilizing carbon dioxide as a carbon source for the synthesis of olefins and aromatics has emerged as one of the most practical methods for CO2 reduction. In this study, an improved selectivity of 85% for targeting products (ethylbenzene and propylbenzene) is achieved with a benzene conversion of 16.8% by coupling the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to olefins over the bifunctional catalyst “Oxide-Zeolite” (OX-ZEO) and the alkylation of benzene with olefins over ZSM-5. In addition to investigating the influence of SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 zeolite acidity on product distribution, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is addressed by modifying both molecular sieves to be hierarchical to extend the catalyst lifespan. Even after 100 h of operation at 400 °C, the catalysts maintained over 80% selectivity towards the target products, with benzene conversion over 14.2%. Furthermore, the pathway of propylbenzene formation is demonstrated through simple experimental design, revealing that the surface Brønsted acid sites of SAPO-34 serve as its primary formation sites. This provides a novel perspective for further investigation of the reaction network.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has long been known to be affected by the electrolyte cations, yet the interpretations of these effects remain controversial. In this work, taking advantage of the unique catalytic characteristics of Pd, we investigated the cation effects on the CO2RR. It was found that the productions of formate and carbon monoxide (CO) are accelerated, and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is suppressed on Pd surfaces by larger cations. Detailed ATR-SEIRAS measurements revealed the promotion of CO2RR comes from two aspects. First, the CO2 molecules can be concentrated at the electrode–electrolyte interface by larger cations through electrostatic interaction. Second, a stronger interfacial electric field brought by the larger cations can accelerate the CO2RR and stabilize the negatively charged intermediates. The potential-dependent spectral transitions of adsorbed CO and interfacial water shed new light on the cation-dependent electric double layer structures. In light of these findings, the cation effects on the formate and CO pathways at different overpotentials were further revealed.

Abstract Introduction Synchronising the dates of patients’ repeat prescriptions can reduce monthly community pharmacy visits or home deliveries, which may improve patients’ adherence to medicines.[1] It should also reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with avoidable travel, but previous research does not appear to have determined the potential size of this reduction. This pilot study therefore attempted to do so using routinely collected data. Aim To estimate potential carbon savings from synchronising repeat medicines for a sample of patients from one community pharmacy. Methods All patients who had prescriptions dispensed four times per month or more from a single medium-sized (approximately 2,500 items dispensed per month) urban community pharmacy in England were identified from the pharmacy’s home delivery application. The threshold of four deliveries per month was selected to increase the likelihood of this frequency being due to asynchronised prescriptions. Data were collected (August 2023) for deliveries in June 2023 as there were no public holidays or events to affect prescription ordering. Data included patients’ postcode, delivery dates, and using the Patient Medication Record, the pharmacist collecting the data determined acute or one-off prescription items, that neither the patients nor the repeat medicines were new, and where deliveries were made to supply medicines owing. The pharmacy was selected because it efficiently managed stock to minimise items owing. The distance that would have been travelled was calculated as if the medicines had been collected from the pharmacy as a dedicated journey to and from the patient’s home address instead of being delivered. The saving in miles and CO2 emitted for different vehicle types was modelled by assuming that for each patient, all deliveries that were not for acute items or medicines owing could have been reduced to a single delivery if prescriptions had been synchronised. UK Government conversion factors were used to calculate CO2 emissions.[2] Results Data were collected for 59 patients, of whom 7 patients had 8 deliveries, 4 had 7 deliveries, 6 had 6 deliveries, 16 had 5 deliveries and 26 had 4 deliveries. The total number of deliveries to these patients was 269 but would have been 80 deliveries if the repeat prescriptions had been synchronised (70% reduction). The distance travelled would have been reduced from 842 miles to 241 miles (71% reduction). This would have resulted in a 71% reduction in CO2 emissions, although the reduction in volume in kilograms of CO2 emitted would have varied (by an estimated 137 Kg CO2 or 51%) depending on whether e.g., a small diesel car was used or a large petrol car (reduction of 133kg versus 270 kg CO2). An average diesel car was estimated to have reduced CO2 emissions by 163 kg. Conclusion The findings demonstrate that potential carbon savings from medicines synchronisation can be modelled from routinely collected data, but with limited accuracy, especially as patients receiving home deliveries may not be representative of all pharmacy users. Challenges remain in how to measure actual carbon savings of prescription synchronisation and overcoming barriers to widespread implementation of clinically appropriate synchronisation. References 1.

Reactive magnesium oxide cement (RMC) has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) due to its lower production temperature and ability to permanently sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) through carbonation. However, mixtures with only RMC can have significantly reduced CO2 absorption capacity due to limited CO2 diffusion, thereby compromising the performance of RMCs. This paper demonstrates the adoption of cenospheres, an industrial waste, as a lightweight filler in RMC-based 3D printable composites to enhance carbonation and improve thermal insulation. This work investigates the effect of incorporating different dosages of cenospheres on the rheological properties, compressive strength, thermal conductivity, and microstructural development of the RMC mixtures using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study reveals that substituting 30% of RMC with cenospheres not only improves the printability and carbonation of the composite but also results in a 16% reduction in density, achieving 1.72 g/cm³, and reduced the thermal conductivity by 59% compared to the control without cenospheres to 0.63 W/(m·K). The findings provide valuable insights for developing lightweight 3D printable RMC-based composites.

In 2011, commercial aviation contributed approximately 3.5% of global anthropogenic climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases during flight and operational non-CO2 climate effects. Over the last few years, numerous aviation-related organisations have set goals to reduce aviation’s climate impact. These goals, however, lack alignment, are poorly or ambiguously defined, or are internally inconsistent. This increases uncertainty about what aviation should work towards, how various stakeholders can contribute, and introduces problems with respect to accountability. In order to address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive definition of a climate neutral air transport system as an “air transport system of which the climate effects of all its greenhouse gases and non-carbon dioxide effects throughout the entire life-cycle of each element of the system is balanced”. The proposed definition spans relevant system and encompasses all life cycle phases. To achieve a climate neutral air transport system by 2050, all life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and non-CO2 climate effects remaining after in-sector reduction should be neutralised, as should all remaining non-CO2 climate forcing from emissions prior to 2050. Clarity on governance is furthermore needed, as the goal and associated targets proposed should be adopted globally.

Abstract The increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has precipitated a climate crisis, with the industrial sector identified as a significant contributor to escalating pollution levels. This research explores the impact of real gross domestic product (GDP), consumption of renewable and non-renewable energy (RE, NRE), financial development (FD), and industrial value added (IVA) on CO2 emissions across a panel of OECD countries spanning the period 2000–2021. Cointegration techniques are employed to achieve this objective. The findings of the empirical analysis reveal cross-sectional dependence among countries. Furthermore, the variables are found to be integrated of order one, and cointegration tests indicate the presence of a long-run relationship between them. The results obtained from the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) analysis indicate that economic growth and non-renewable energy consumption are associated with an increase in CO2 emissions. In contrast, renewable energy consumption, industrial value-added, and financial development are found to contribute to a reduction in emissions over the long term. The interaction between financial development and industrial value-added exhibits a positive influence on CO2 emissions, indicating a lack of alignment between financial and industrial strategies.

The anthropogenic impact of the functioning of livestock complexes on the environment is caused by the release of gaseous air pollutants into the atmosphere, including harmful gases such as methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The latter cause environmental degradation and have a negative impact on the climate balance of the planet. Therefore, the basis of the planned research was to evaluate the effectiveness of different doses of "Scarabei" and "Vodohrai Chystyi Khliv" biodestructors on the emission of harmful gases from pig manure in vitro. In the process of conducting experimental studies, it was established that the addition of "Scarabei" and "Vodohrai Chystyi Khliv" biodestructors to pig waste helps to reduce the level of CH4 emissions up to 14.4% and 22.3%, NH3 up to 23.7% and 39.7%, H2S up to 22.2% and 38.2%, CO2 up to 23.4% and 35.6%, NO up to 14.6% and 23.2%, respectively. Simultaneously, with the reduction of emissions of the studied gases, biodestructors also provide a lower level of pH, i.e., its shift to the acidic side up to 5.54 ("Scarabei") and 5.12 ("Vodohrai Chystyi Khliv"), against 6.2–6.5 – in the control. Thus, the results obtained indicate the feasibility of using the studied biodestructors, such as "Scarabei" and "Vodohrai Chystyi Khliv" at a dose of 40 g/m3 for lower emissions of harmful gases, both when storing manure in storage facilities (lagoons) and directly in the pig keeping premises, which will prevent the negative impact of intensive pig production on the environment.

In situ studies of electrochemical processes using NMR offer valuable information on reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and species identification, making it a powerful tool in electrochemistry research. In this study, we present the design of an in situ redox-flow NMR cell that allows for a continuous flow of liquid (electrolyte) or gas, application of electrical voltage, and recording of NMR signals. The utility of this setup is demonstrated through two case studies: electrochemical copper deposition on a gold electrode and the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon products. Specifically, the presence of multicarbon products containing C–C bonds generated during the electrochemical reduction reaction is confirmed in the 2H NMR spectra in the latter example. These findings highlight the ability of the in situ redox-flow NMR cell to directly monitor reaction intermediates and products, thereby enabling the elucidation of reaction mechanisms for the efficient and selective production of valuable hydrocarbon products through the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals. In contrast to other reported in situ NMR cells, the presented cell is suitable for multiple uses, and allows detecting NMR signals not only from exhaust products but also from those formed on the catalyst surface.

Concrete pavements are integral to sustainable infrastructure, offering longevity and resilience in construction and transportation. This study focuses on optimizing concrete pavements through the incorporation of steel and carbon fibers with Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) to enhance mechanical strength, reduce fracture development, and minimize carbon emissions. Utilizing 25 mixing designs with a consistent water-to-cement ratio of 0.40, varying ratios of GGBS, steel fibers, and carbon fibers (0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% based on concrete volume) were explored. A comprehensive evaluation, including slump, compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength, water absorption, abrasion resistance tests, carbon dioxide emissions, and cost analysis, was conducted at different curing stages. Results revealed a decline in compressive strength for all mix designs at 28 days, attributed to reduced cement strength with GGBS substitution. The 1.5% steel fiber and 50% GGBS mix demonstrated minimal compressive strength reduction (30.1 MPa, 5.5% less than control), outperforming other mixtures. Steel fibers surpassed carbon fibers, likely due to \erior distribution. Notably, 1.5% steel fibers showed superior results, particularly with 50% GGBS. Compressive strength generally increased with GGBS content, except for 1% fibrous samples where 40% GGBS produced optimal results. At 90 days, compressive strength increased for most designs, with G50S1.5 exhibiting over 38% growth compared to the control. Steel fiber-containing samples outperformed carbon fiber-containing ones, showcasing the efficacy of steel fibers in enhancing compressive strength. Split tensile strength generally decreased, but steel fibers improved it, emphasizing their positive influence. Flexural strength increased in 28 and 90 days, with steel fiber-containing designs outperforming. G30S1.5 showed the most significant increase (33.3%) at 28 days, and G30S1.5 exhibited the highest growth (32.22%) at 90 days. Abrasion resistance tests indicated steel fibers and GGBS positively impacted abrasion reduction. G50S1.5 demonstrated the highest abrasion resistance (25% increase over control). The environmental evaluation revealed lower CO2 emissions for GGBS-containing designs. G50S0.5 showed a 40.34% reduction compared to the control sample. Cost analysis showed GGBS reduced costs, but fiber addition, particularly carbon fibers, increased costs. G30C1.5 had the highest cost increase (208.5%), while G50S1.5 showed a marginal rise (3.9%) compared to the control. Therefore, steel fibers in concrete pavements offer improved mechanical properties, durability, and reduced environmental impact, making them a viable choice despite a slight increase in cost. Conversely, carbon fibers are cautioned against due to their higher cost and inferior mechanical properties.

Due to the anthropogenic increase of atmospheric CO2 emissions, humanity is facing the negative effects of rapid global climate change. Both active emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies are needed to meet the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 °C by 2050. One promising CDR approach is coastal enhanced weathering (CEW), which involves the placement of sand composed of (ultra)mafic minerals like olivine in coastal zones. Although the large-scale placement of olivine sand could beneficially impact the planet through the consumption of atmospheric CO2 and reduction in ocean acidification, it may also have physical and geochemical impacts on benthic communities. The dissolution of olivine can release dissolved constituents such as trace metals that may affect marine organisms. Here we tested acute and chronic responses of marine invertebrates to olivine sand exposure, as well as examined metal accumulation in invertebrate tissue resulting from olivine dissolution. Two different ecotoxicological experiments were performed on a range of benthic marine invertebrates (amphipod, polychaete, bivalve). The first experiment included acute survival and chronic growth tests (10 and 20 days, respectively) of olivine exposure while the second had longer (28 day) exposures to measure chronic survival and bioaccumulation of trace metals (e.g. Ni, Cr, Co) released during olivine sand dissolution. Across all fauna we observed no negative effects on acute survival or chronic growth resulting solely from olivine exposure. However, over 28 days of exposure, the bent-nosed clam Macoma nasuta (Conrad, 1837) experienced reduced burrowing and accumulated 4.2 ± 0.7 μg g ww-1 of Ni while the polychaete Alitta virens (M. Sars, 1835) accumulated 3.5 ± 0.9 μg g ww-1 of Ni. No significant accumulation of any other metals was observed. Future work should include longer-term laboratory studies as well as CEW field studies to validate these findings under real-world scenarios.

Coastal wetlands capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at high rates and store large amounts of “blue carbon” in soils. These habitats are home to a variety of microbial communities that break down organic matter and cycle nutrients, playing a substantial role in coastal biogeochemical balance. Rising sea levels make coastal wetlands more susceptible to saltwater intrusion, which might disrupt biogeochemical processes, such as the sulfur cycle and methane generation/consumption by bacteria thus disrupting existing equilibria. A change in biogeochemical equilibria may produce important climate-related feedback because these systems, while involved in carbon sequestration, also have the potential to emit greenhouse gases, with reported higher emissions in freshwater ecosystems compared to brackish ones. In this study, we characterize the microbial community and geochemical properties in soils of three temperate coastal wetlands along a salinity gradient to assess the effect of salinity on organic matter decomposition and related greenhouse gas emissions. The full-length Oxford Nanopore MinION 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing is used to characterize bacterial communities from soil samples. Results indicate a prevalence of sulfur-reducing bacteria in salinized sites compared to freshwater sites. In brackish environments, there is an emergence of obligate anaerobic taxa associated with sulfate reduction, fatty acid degradation, and denitrifying bacteria. These microbial communities play a significant role in reducing CH4 emissions while simultaneously increasing CO2 emissions within these habitats. This study reveals the structure of microbial communities in wetland soils, crucial for ecosystem understanding and implications in wetland conservation, management, and climate change mitigation.

At present, the excessive emission of carbon dioxide has threatened people 's living environment and future development. More and more countries have begun to pay attention to carbon emission reduction. China has set the dual-carbon strategic goal of “carbon dioxide content reaches its peak” and “carbon neutrality”. According to the research on carbon dioxide capture technology by many scholars at home and abroad, it is found that the use of chemical absorbents to capture carbon dioxide is a relatively low cost, less technical difficulty, and can be widely put into industrial production. In this paper, several common chemical absorbents such as hot potassium alkali method, organic amine absorption method, amino acid salt, ionic liquid and phase change absorbent are reviewed. Through the research of various kinds of absorbents by researchers from various countries, their reaction principle, performance advantages and disadvantages, research status are introduced, and the future development direction of carbon dioxide negative emission technology is analyzed.

Wall-seeping gas film (WSGF) represents a promising method for transition control, drag reduction, and heat reduction in hypersonic vehicles. Experiments were conducted in a Mach 6 hypersonic quiet wind tunnel using nano-tracer planar laser scattering (NPLS) and high-frequency fluctuating pressure measuring techniques. This paper investigates the effects of wall-seeping helium, air, and carbon dioxide gas films under identical volume flow rate conditions on conical boundary layer thickness, disturbance wave structure, wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and nonlinear interaction. The experimental results reveal that WSGF significantly thickens the hypersonic boundary layer, with the thickest position appearing at the downstream boundary of the seeping zone. The boundary layer thickness is thinnest for helium gas film and thickest for carbon dioxide gas film. Generally, air gas film and carbon dioxide gas film induce the appearance of regular, rope-like, and interlaced second-mode waves in advance in the boundary layer. However, under a higher volume flow rate for carbon dioxide gas film, the disturbance wave structure resembles interface fluctuations, with a characteristic wavelength of approximately 18 mm and a peak frequency as low as about 35 kHz, without the rope-like interlaced characteristic. At this time, the influence of shear layer instability becomes significant. The disturbance waves do not exhibit second-mode wave characteristics for wall-seeping helium gas film, whose shape is irregular and undergoes deformation over time and space. Additionally, the power spectral density of wall fluctuating pressure exhibits insignificant variation with volume flow rate and flow direction, which is similar to the characteristics of power spectral density in the laminar boundary layer and has no peak frequency. The wavelength of second-mode waves is about 2~3 times the boundary layer thickness for air gas film while increasing to more than 3 times for carbon dioxide gas film. Compared to air gas film, the application of carbon dioxide gas film results in a smaller peak frequency and bandwidth of disturbance waves, larger characteristic wavelength and amplitude, longer propagation distance, and stronger nonlinear interaction. In the future, attention should be directed towards understanding disturbance wave characteristics in the boundary layer for helium gas film and shear layer instability under larger volume flow rates.

Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction offers a promising route to synthesize fuels and value-added chemicals, unfortunately their activities and selectivities remain unsatisfactory. Here, we present a general surface molecular tuning strategy by modifying Cu 2 O with a molecular pyridine-derivative. The surface modified Cu 2 O nanocubes by 4-mercaptopyridine display a high Faradaic efficiency of greater than 60% in electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction to acetate with a current density as large as 380 mA/cm 2 in a liquid electrolyte flow cell. In-situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals stronger *CO signal with bridge configuration and stronger *OCCHO signal over modified Cu 2 O nanocubes by 4-mercaptopyridine than unmodified Cu 2 O nanocubes during electrochemical CO reduction. Density function theory calculations disclose that local molecular tuning can effectively regulate the electronic structure of copper catalyst, enhancing *CO and *CHO intermediates adsorption by the stabilization effect through hydrogen bonding, which can greatly promote asymmetric *CO-*CHO coupling in electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction.

Flooding of paddy fields during the rice growing season enhances arsenic (As) mobilization and greenhouse gas (e.g., methane) emissions. In this study, an adsorbent for dissolved organic matter (DOM), namely, activated carbon (AC), was applied to an arsenic-contaminated paddy soil. The capacity for simultaneously alleviating soil carbon emissions and As accumulation in rice grains was explored. Soil microcosm incubations and 2-year pot experimental results indicated that AC amendment significantly decreased porewater DOM, Fe(III) reduction/Fe2+ release, and As release. More importantly, soil carbon dioxide and methane emissions were mitigated in anoxic microcosm incubations. Porewater DOM of pot experiments mainly consisted of humic-like fluorophores with a molecular structure of lignins and tannins, which could mediate microbial reduction of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides. Soil microcosm incubation experiments cospiking with a carbon source and AC further consolidated that DOM electron shuttling and microbial carbon source functions were crucial for soil Fe(III) reduction, thus driving paddy soil As release and carbon emission. Additionally, the application of AC alleviated rice grain dimethylarsenate accumulation over 2 years. Our results highlight the importance of microbial extracellular electron transfer in driving paddy soil anaerobic respiration and decreasing porewater DOM in simultaneously remediating As contamination and mitigating methane emission in paddy fields.

Abstract Commitments to emissions reductions following the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement have proliferated. Though it is promising that 145 countries have declared a net-zero emissions target, with 33 enshrining this goal into law, comparison of country-level emissions inventories can only be effectively carried out with uniform and consistent data. The extent to which greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory comparison is possible, and the ancillary climate governance implications, are the motivation for this article. Based on time-series correlation analyses over 32 years and 43 Annex-I countries, we uncover issues that are likely to inveigh against country-country comparison of GHGs—with the potential to weaken climate governance systems that are based mainly on emissions inventory tracking. First, the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs)—which convert each respective GHG into carbon equivalents (CO 2 -e), and are revised with each IPCC report—are not immediately or consistently integrated into GHG inventories. Second, GHGs apart from carbon dioxide, based on the data analysis, do not appear to be tracked uniformly. Should comparison of emissions remain a cornerstone of global climate governance, an overhaul of country-level GHG inventories is called for, specifically to enable effective reporting and tracking of GHGs apart from only carbon dioxide.

Ag-doped Cu2O immobilized carbon beads (Ag/Cu2O@CB) based composite photocatalysts have been prepared for the removal of levofloxacin, an antibiotic, from water. The photocatalysts were prepared by the processes of chemical reduction and in-situ solid-phase precipitation. The composite photocatalyst was characterized by a porous and interconnected network structure. Ag nanoparticles were deposited on Cu2O particles to develop a metal-based semiconductor to increase the catalytic efficiency of the system and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers. Cellulose-derived carbon beads (CBs) can also be used as electron storage libraries which can capture electrons released from the conduction band of Cu2O. The results revealed that the maximum catalytic degradation efficiency of the composite photocatalyst for the antibiotic levofloxacin was 99.02 %. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model was used to study the reaction kinetics, and the process of photodegradation followed first-order kinetics. The maximum apparent rate was recorded to be 0.0906 min-1. The mass spectrometry technique showed that levofloxacin degraded into carbon dioxide and water in the presence of the photocatalyst. The results revealed that the easy-to-produce photocatalyst was stable and efficient in levofloxacin removing.

Abstract Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is discussed for offsetting residual greenhouse gas emissions or even reversing climate change. All emissions scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that meet the ”well below 2 ◦ C” warming target of the Paris Agreement include CDR. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) may be one possible CDR where the carbon uptake of the ocean is increased by artificial alkalinity addition. &#xD;Here, we investigate the effect of OAE on modelled carbon reservoirs and fluxes in two observationally-constrained large perturbed parameter ensembles. OAE is assumed to be technically successful and deployed as an additional CDR in the SSP5-3.4 temperature overshoot scenario. Tradeoffs involving feedbacks with atmospheric CO 2 result in a low efficiency of an alkalinity-driven atmospheric CO 2 reduction of -0.35 [-0.37 – -0.33] mol C per mol alkalinity addition (skill-weighted mean and 68% c.i.). The realized atmospheric CO 2 reduction, and correspondingly the efficiency, is more than two times smaller than the direct alkalinity-driven enhancement of ocean uptake. The alkalinity-driven ocean carbon uptake is partly offset by the release of carbon from the land biosphere and a reduced ocean carbon sink in response to lowered atmospheric CO 2 under OAE.&#xD;In a second step we use the Bern3D-LPX model in CO 2 peak-decline simulations to address hysteresis and temporal lags of surface air temperature change (ΔSAT) in an idealized scenario where ΔSAT increases to ∼2 ◦ C and then declines to ∼1.5 ◦ C as result of CDR. ΔSAT lags the decline in CO 2 -forcing by 18 [14 – 22] years, depending close to linearly on the equilibrium climate sensitivity of the respective ensemble member. These tradeoffs and lags are an inherent feature of the Earth system response to changes in atmospheric CO 2 and will therefore be equally important for other CDR methods.

In the current context of carbon neutrality, afforestation is an effective means of absorbing carbon dioxide. Stock can be used not only as an economic value index of forest wood resources but also as an important index of biomass and carbon storage estimation in forest emission reduction project evaluation. In this paper, we propose a data-driven machine learning framework and method for predicting plantation stock based on airborne LiDAR + satellite remote sensing, and carried out experimental verification at the site of the National Forest emission reduction project in Southern China. We used step-up regression and random forest (RF) to screen LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI multispectral indicators suitable for the prediction of plantation stock, and constructed a plantation stock model based on machine learning (support vector machine regression, RF regression). Our method is compared with traditional statistical methods (stepwise regression and partial least squares regression). Through the verification of 57 plantation field survey data, the accuracy of the stand estimation model constructed using the RF method is generally better (ΔR2 = 0.01~0.27, ΔRMSE = 1.88~13.77 m3·hm−2, ΔMAE = 1.17~13.57 m3·hm−2). The model evaluation accuracy based on machine learning is higher than that of the traditional statistical method, and the fitting R2 is greater than 0.91, while the fitting R2 of the traditional statistical method is 0.85. The best fitting models were all support vector regression models. The combination of UAV point clouds and satellite multi-spectral images has the best modeling effect, followed by LiDAR point clouds and Landsat 8. At present, this method is only applicable to artificial forests; further verification is needed for natural forests. In the future, the density and quality of higher clouds could be increased. The validity and accuracy of the method were further verified. This paper provides a method for predicting the accumulation of typical Chinese plantations at the forest farm scale based on the “airborne LiDAR + satellite remote sensing” data-driven machine learning modeling, which has potential application value for the current carbon neutrality goal of the southern plantation forest emission reduction project.

Reduction of oxides of carbon (CO and CO2) to fixed forms of carbon is desirable to achieve sustainable and clean energy. Carbon monoxide (CO), an intermediate product in CO2 reduction, is challenging to reduce, which in turn jeopardizes the direct reduction of CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ to products like CH3OH and CH4. Iron porphyrins can efficiently reduce CO2 to CO by 2e–/2H+, but further reduction is halted by the rapid dissociation of CO from the reduced iron center. This work shows that CO can indeed be reduced upon inclusion of a pendent pyridine in the second coordination sphere of an iron porphyrin complex efficiently and selectively to CH4 using water or phenol as the proton source. In situ spectro-electrochemistry supported by theoretical calculations indicates that the pendent pyridine moiety imposes a hydrogen bonding interaction between the bound CO and water, which stabilizes two low-valent CO adducts, i.e., Fe(I)–CO and Fe(0)–CO, of iron porphyrins, allowing its complete reduction, via a Fe(II)–CHO species, to CH4. The ability to activate and reduce CO by ne–/nH+ via a second-sphere hydrogen bonding interaction in a mononuclear iron porphyrin opens newer pathways to valorize both CO and CO2 to valuable C1 products.

Addressing the urgent need for efficient CO2 reduction, a novel Co@C catalyst was synthesized through the pyrolysis of a unique layered metal–organic framework (MOF), featuring tunable thickness, pore sizes. The CO2 hydrogenation performance demonstrates an enhancement by an optimized structure that significantly improves stability, maintaining a 25% CO2 conversion rate over an extended 80-hour period. The catalyst's composite structure exhibits a dual-confinement effect, where the Co-C interface and graphitic carbon belt stabilize Co nanoparticles, preventing sintering during reaction cycles. This study delves into the structural modifications necessary for catalytic optimization in CO2 hydrogenation, offering valuable insights for designing efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction and advancing sustainable energy solutions.

Renewable energy is a sustainable and green energy converted from renewable energy resources in the nature. There is a huge amount of renewable energy resources in the ocean that can be changed into useful energy like electricity, store for long time use, or apply in the daily energy consumption. These marine renewable energies (MRE) include wave energy, ocean thermal energy, tidal energy, ocean current energy, salinity gradient energy, and offshore energy. With a big area, the oceans have been prospected that it brings endless renewable energy sources for social development and human demand. The renewable ocean energy shows many advantages of sustainable energy, clean energy, and non-carbon dioxide emissions by generating from wave and water in the ocean with an enormous amount of natural energy resources. The MRE can service at many areas of off-shore, on-shore, and remote areas where need energy to drive daily living demands. The MRE reveals some disadvantages such as the influence of daily, monthly, season, and period of time. The solutions have been developed to solve the limitations of the MRE such as developing the storage method to store energy for long time use or making the balance of the output performance to improve quality of the renewable energy. The MRE has also received many concerns from countries by promulgating policies, strategies, and plans to develop the renewable ocean energy such as green economy development, blue economy strategy, carbon dioxide emission reduction, and encouragement of using marine renewable energy. This paper reviews current marine renewable energy with its generation, storage, and application. The work also mentioned some advantages, disadvantage, policies, strategies, and solutions to encourage the development of the renewable ocean energy in over the world. The results hope that it will be spread development, exploitation, and application of marine renewable energy in the near future.

Abstract Manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) materials have recently garnered attention as prospective high‐capacity cathodes, owing to their theoretical two‐electron redox reaction in charge storage processes. However, their practical application in aqueous energy storage systems faces a formidable challenge: the disproportionation of Mn 3+ ions, leading to a significant reduction in their capacity. To address this limitation, the study presents a novel graphitic carbon interlayer‐engineered manganese oxide (CI‐MnO x ) characterized by an open structure and abundant defects. This innovative material serves several essential functions for efficient aqueous energy storage. First, a graphitic carbon layer coats the MnO x molecular interlayer, effectively inhibiting Mn 3+ disproportionation and substantially enhancing electrode conductivity. Second, the phase variation within MnO x generates numerous crystal defects, vacancies, and active sites, optimizing electron‐transfer capability. Third, the flexible carbon layer acts as a buffer, mitigating the volume expansion of MnO x during extended cycling. The synergistic effects of these features result in the CI‐MnO x exhibiting an impressive high capacity of 272 mAh g −1 (1224 F g −1 ) at 0.25 A g −1 . Notably, the CI‐MnO x demonstrates zero capacity loss after 90 000 cycles (≈3011 h), an uncommon longevity for manganese oxide materials. Spectral characterizations reveal reversible cation intercalation and conversion reactions with multielectron transfer in a LiCl electrolyte.

The mechanism of Ni-catalyzed carboxylation of aryl C(sp2)–S bonds with CO2 was studied for the first time by density functional theory calculations. We first proposed another possible reaction pathway in which CO2 insertion occurs prior to reduction. Then, we performed calculations on all proposed reaction pathways, and our calculation results show that the pathway in which reduction occurs prior to CO2 insertion is the favored pathway for this reaction. Additionally, our calculations disclose that additive Zn0 acts in multifaceted roles. (1) Zn0 acts as a reductant to reduce the NiI and NiII intermediates. (2) The simultaneously formed ZnIIBr2 can undergo transmetalation with NiI or NiII intermediates to produce an aryl reservoir by forming arylzinc species. (3) ZnIIBr2 can also coordinate to the CO2 to lower the energy barrier of the CO2 insertion step. Moreover, the calculation results suggest that CO2 insertion is the rate-determining step of the reaction, and CO2 is easier to insert into the NiI–Ph bond rather than into the NiII–Ph bond. These calculation results can improve our understanding of the mechanism of the carboxylation process and the multifaceted roles of metal additive Zn0 and provide theoretical guidance for improving the carboxylation reaction.

Abstract Anaemia is a common issue in patients who are admitted to intensive care units and worsens their condition throughout the stay due to the extraction of blood for diagnostic purposes. It is also well‐known that an important amount of the carbon dioxide produced by health services is likely attributable to blood donation, testing and manufacture, storage or distribution of blood components. This must be taken into account to perform nursing interventions consistent with the idea of sustainable health care. In this regard, within patient blood management bundles, with the objective of minimizing the use of blood products, it is recommended to use blood‐sparing techniques: small volume tubes (SVT) or closed‐blood sampling devices (CBSD). Published studies before 2014 (excepting two more recent ones) have shown that by themselves, both techniques reduce drawn volume but do not decrease haemoglobin reduction and/or need of transfusion. Given the lack of cost‐effectiveness studies, it may be easier to implement the use of CBSD as it does not require prior consensus on the discard volume or adaptations in the processing of laboratory tests, as is the case with SVT.

Our world has limited resources to sustain a growing population. According to some estimates, humanity currently uses about 1.5 times more renewable sources than the pace of their renewal. Reducing energy use, for example by improving the energy efficiency of an existing building fund, is one of the main environmental goals along with reducing CO2 emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy sources. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the construction of residential buildings with only low energy consumption or high-quality overhaul will reduce the need for heating buildings by 90 %. This will lead to a reduction in fossil fuel imports, increased energy independence of the state, greater sustainability of the economy in case of emergencies and a reduction in CO2 emissions. When writing the article, such empirical research methods as analysis and synthesis, comparison, generalization, etc. were used. Thus, the goals of major repairs are not only to improve the comfort and safety of housing, but also to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. The article considers the experience of major repairs abroad, ways to preserve the old housing stock and improve its energy efficiency.

Nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing (NDFO) bacteria are widespread in the environment contribute to nitrate removal and influence the fate of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and poorly understood. The most prominent model system for this type of studies is enrichment culture KS, which originates from a freshwater sediment in Bremen, Germany. A second NDFO culture, culture BP, was obtained with a sample taken in 2015 at the same pond and cultured in a similar way. To gain insights in the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to iron(II) oxidation under in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen limited conditions, we performed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analyses of culture BP.This dataset contains: (1) Raw sequencing data of 16S (V4 region, primers 515f and 806r) rRNA amplicon sequencing of the microbial community composition of the autotrophic NRFeOx enrichment culture BP and of environmental samples from the pond where culture BP originates from. Illumina MiSeq sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using PE 250 bp MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles kit) were performed at Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). (2) Raw sequencing data of near full-length 16S (primers 27F and 1492R) sequenced with PacBio Sequel SMRT at the Helmholtz research institute, Munich, Germany. (3) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metagenomics. Library was prepared with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Kit (Illumina) and sequenced with PE 150 bp on a NovaSeq 6000 totalling 91 Gbp by CeGaT, Tuebingen, Germany. (4) Short reads were assembled with MEGAHIT v1.2.7 using https://github.com/nf-core/mag v1.0.0. (5) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metatranscriptomes (2 conditions, triplicates). Library preparation including bacterial ribodepletion (Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus kit) and Illumina NextSeq v2.5 sequencing with PE 75 bp and 6 to 53 Mio clusters per sample were performed by Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland).

The calcium looping (CaL) process, comprising reversible calcination and carbonation reactions with CO2 and CaO-based sorbents, stands out as a highly promising industrial approach for CO2 capture. A significant challenge, however, is the swift degradation of the reactivity of CaO-based sorbents. In this study, CeO2-stabilized and CeO2/Al2O3 co-stabilized CaO-based sorbents were produced via a Pechini technique. Results indicated that incorporating CeO2 enhanced the CO2 sorption performance of CaO-based sorbents. The most effective CeO2-stabilized CaO-based sorbents (a CeO2/CaO mass ratio of 15:85) demonstrated an initial sorption capacity of 0.479 gCO2/gmaterial, undergoing a 41% reduction in its initial reactivity by the 20th cycle. To enhance CO2 sorption stability and reduce the high cost linked with the expensive cerium precursor, Al2O3 was introduced as the second stabilizer into the CeO2-stabilized CaO-based sorbents. When the CeO2/Al2O3/CaO mass ratio was adjusted to 5:10:85, the CO2 sorption capacity of CeO2/Al2O3 co-stabilized CaO-based sorbents reached 0.354 gCO2/gmaterial in the 20th cycle. This represented only a 17.7% reduction in its initial performance, surpassing the CeO2-stabilized counterpart by 26.3%. Comprehensive characterizations, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), revealed that incorporating Al2O3 into the CeO2-stabilized CaO-based sorbents served a dual purpose: acting as a stable framework to inhibit pore structure deterioration and increasing the concentration of oxygen vacancies. In consequence, the synergistic effect of CeO2 and Al2O3 improved both structural stability and oxygen vacancy concentration of the sorbents, ultimately leading to superior CO2 sorption performance.

High-tech greenhouse horticulture offers efficient crop cultivation that is unaffected by outdoor climate. However, compared to conventional cultivation systems, energy requirements, such as greenhouse heating and control, are larger, and concerns about the associated increase in CO2 emissions exist. Although several previous studies have analyzed CO2 emissions from high-tech greenhouse horticulture, few have covered the entire life cycle. This study aimed to analyze CO2 emissions from high-tech greenhouse horticulture for tomatoes in Japan across the entire life cycle. A hybrid method combining process and input–output analyses was used to estimate life cycle CO2 (LC-CO2) emissions. The emission reduction potential of replacing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for greenhouse heating with wood chips was also examined. The results show that LC-CO2 emissions were estimated to be 3.67 kg-CO2 per 1 kg of tomato, 55.6% of which came from the production and combustion of LPG for greenhouse heating. The substitution of LPG with wood chips has the potential to reduce LC-CO2 emissions by up to 49.1%. However, the improved LC-CO2 emissions are still higher than those of conventional cultivation systems; thus, implementing additional measures to reduce LC-CO2 emissions is crucial.

Self-healing concrete is a type of concrete formed by delayed or secondary hydration of cement and its particles with water in the matrix leaking through cracks, and calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide on the crack surface react with calcium carbonate to provide protection against leakage through cracks. In recent studies, it has been observed that bacteria can self-repair with the production of calcium carbonate-based minerals and this repair provides protection against leakage, pore permeability and protection with increased strength and durability by reducing the infiltration of harmful substances into the internal structure. In this study, 32 different batches of samples were produced by using Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseudomonas putida and Sphingomonas mucosissima bacteria in mortar mixtures prepared by traditional methods with 2 different water/cement ratios and 3 different mineral additives. The bacteria used are cave isolates that provide calcium carbonate formation, and these isolates were multiplied in the appropriate growth culture and then added to the prepared mortar samples together with the mixture water. The specimens were cured with tap water for 28 days and then subjected to suction, ultrasonic, flexural and compressive strength tests. The results of the tests revealed a reduction in the porous structure of the specimens containing bacteria, resulting in lower water absorption rates compared to the reference specimens. It was observed that most CaCO3 was produced by Pseudomonas putida bacteria. However, there was no significant difference in compressive and flexural strengths compared to the reference specimens.

This study was set in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), where commercial vehicle movements were assigned across the road network. Implications for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air quality, and health were examined through an environmental justice lens. Electrification of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks was assessed to identify scenarios associated with the highest benefits for the most disadvantaged communities. Using spatially and temporally resolved commercial vehicle movements and a chemical transport model, changes in air pollutant concentrations under electric truck scenarios were estimated at 1-km2 resolution. Heavy-duty truck electrification reduces ambient black carbon and nitrogen dioxide on average by 10 and 14%, respectively, and GHG emissions by 10.5%. It achieves the highest reduction in premature mortality attributable to fine particulate matter chronic exposure (around 200 cases per year) compared with light- and medium-duty electrification (less than 150 cases each). The burden of all traffic in the GTHA was estimated to be around 600 cases per year. The benefits of electrification accrue primarily in neighborhoods with a high social disadvantage, measured by the Ontario Marginalization Indices, narrowing the disparity of exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Benefits related to heavy-duty truck electrification reflect the adverse impacts of diesel-fueled freight and highlight the co-benefits achieved by electrifying this sector.

Low-carbon electricity and heat production is essential for keeping the decarbonization targets and climate mitigation goals. Thus, an accurate understanding of the potential environmental impacts constitutes a key aspect not only for the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions but also for other environmental categories. Life cycle assessment allows us to conduct an overall evaluation of a given process or system through its whole lifetime across various environmental indicators. This study focused on construction, operation and maintenance, and end-of-life phases, which were analyzed based on the ReCiPe 2016 method. Within this work, authors assessed the environmental performance of one of the renewable energy sources—Enhanced Geothermal Systems, which utilize supercritical carbon dioxide as a working fluid to produce electricity and heat. Heat for the process is extracted from hot, dry rocks, typically located at depths of approximately 4–5 km, and requires appropriate stimulation to enable fluid flow. Consequently, drilling and site preparation entail significant energy and material inputs. This stage, based on conducted calculations, exhibits the highest global warming potential, with values between 5.2 and 30.1 kgCO2eq/MWhel, corresponding to approximately 65%, 86%, and 94% in terms of overall impacts for ecosystems, human health, and resources categories, respectively. Moreover, the study authors compared the EGS impacts for the Polish and Norwegian conditions. Obtained results indicated that due to much higher electricity output from the Norwegian plant, which is sited offshore, the environmental influence remains the lowest, at a level of 11.9 kgCO2eq/MWhel. Polish cases range between 38.7 and 54.1 kgCO2eq/MWhel of global warming potential in terms of electricity production. Regarding power generation only, the impacts in the case of the Norwegian facility are two to five times lower than for the installation in the Polish conditions.

This article presents the findings of a study on oxide reduction utilizing a novel reducing plasma torch, employing greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 as plasma gases. The primary aim of this investigation is to establish the viability of this approach. The innovative plasma torch was employed to reduce various oxides, including aluminum oxide, iron oxide, and titanium oxide, as well as a mixed oxide composition, employing a CO2/CH4 molar ratio of 1:1 within a spouted bed reactor. Following plasma treatment, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to examine the metallic phases, notably titanium, iron, and aluminum. SEM–EDS observations were carried out to assess microstructural changes and identify elemental compositions pre- and post-plasma treatment. The results demonstrate that within the conical section of the reactor, titanium oxide experiences partial reduction, resulting in limited titanium production, while aluminum oxide and iron oxides (magnetite and hematite) undergo reduction to yield aluminum and iron, respectively. Thermodynamic calculations, performed using Factsage software version 8.3, were utilized to predict stable-phase formations following plasma treatment for each material.

Abstract This study investigates the effect of five amino acids on the electrodeposition of Cu to enhance its electrocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The amino acids significantly influenced the deposition potential, crystallite size, and surface morphology of the electrodeposited Cu. Electrodeposited Cu with amino acids exhibit significantly smaller crystallites and higher particle density on carbon paper relative to amino acid-free samples. The integration of amino acids into the electrodeposited Cu was confirmed via high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. All electrodeposited Cu exhibits a higher faradaic efficiency (FE) in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 relative to Cu foil (24.2%), regardless of the presence or absence (55.0%) of amino acids when the electrolysis was conducted at −1.27 V vs. RHE. Electrodeposited Cu with L-histidine, containing an imidazole group, demonstrates a higher FE of CH4 (67.6%) and effectively suppressed the hydrogen evolution reaction, highlighting the crucial role of amino acid functional groups, particularly imidazole, in augmenting the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CH4. The study demonstrates the critical influence of specific functional groups in amino acids on the catalytic efficiency of electrodeposited Cu in CO2RR electrocatalysis applications.

Since 2015, the prevailing challenges of gender inequality and climate change have garnered attention from the United Nations. While gender equality represents the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #5, climate action is listed as Goal #13. Gender equality is a saturated area in the extant literature of gender studies while the literature on the nexus between the climate change and gender mainstreaming are in short supply. Apart from the environmental hazards created by climate change, vulnerable groups, especially women, are facing higher risks and greater burdens from its impacts. The effects of climate change have led to a global quest for decarbonization, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions through the use of low-carbon power sources. Despite the global quest for decarbonization, the effects of climate change are alarming. The impact of climate change has widened the gap of gender inequality. Empirical studies show that women in agriculture are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change compared to their male counterparts. It is also evident that women and men experience climate change impacts differently due to their socially constructed roles and responsibilities in developing countries. Because climate change affects the availability of surface water, rural women, who are usually given the task of fetching water, have to travel greater distances to collect water, increasing their already substantial workloads. This study assesses the National Action Plan on Gender and Climate Change for Nigeria and its impact on gender mainstreaming in Nigeria. The study adopts methodological triangulation. The primary data were generated through key informant interviews (KIIs); the secondary data were sourced from textbooks, journal articles, and web-based materials. The data generated were analyzed using inductive methodologies and thematic analysis. The study recommends more gender-sensitive climate actions and the proper formulation of structures and processes toward the full realization of gender mainstreaming.

Solar‐driven CO2 reduction and water oxidation to liquid fuels represents a promising solution to alleviate energy crisis and climate issue, but it remains a great challenge for generating CH3OH and CH3CH2OH dominated by multi‐electron transfer. Single‐cluster catalysts with super electron acceptance, accurate molecular structure, customizable electronic structure and multiple adsorption sites, have led to greater potential in catalyzing various challenging reactions. However, accurately controlling the number and arrangement of clusters on functional supports still faces great challenge. Herein, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to uniformly disperse Wells‐Dawson‐ and Keggin‐type polyoxometalates on TiO2 nanotube arrays, resulting in a series of single‐cluster functionalized catalysts P2M18O62@TiO2 and PM12O40@TiO2 (M = Mo or W). The single polyoxometalate cluster can be distinctly identified and serves as electronic sponge to accept electrons from excited TiO2 for enhancing surface‐hole concentration and promote water oxidation. Among these samples, P2Mo18O62@TiO2‐1 exhibits the highest electron consumption rate of 1260 µmol g−1 for CO2‐to‐CH3OH conversion with H2O as the electron source, which is 11 times higher than that of isolated TiO2 nanotube arrays. This work supplied a simple synthesis method to realize the single‐dispersion of molecular cluster to enrich surface‐reaching holes on TiO2, thereby facilitating water oxidation and CO2 reduction.

Summary Climate change is simultaneously increasing carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO 2 ]) and temperature. These factors could interact to influence plant physiology and performance. Alternatively, increased [CO 2 ] may offset costs associated with elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the interaction between elevated temperature and [CO 2 ] may differentially affect populations from along an elevational gradient and disrupt local adaptation. We conducted a multifactorial growth chamber experiment to examine the interactive effects of temperature and [CO 2 ] on fitness and ecophysiology of diverse accessions of Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae) sourced from a broad elevational gradient in Colorado. We tested whether increased [CO 2 ] would enhance photosynthesis across accessions, and whether warmer conditions would depress the fitness of high‐elevation accessions owing to steep reductions in temperature with increasing elevation in this system. Elevational clines in [CO 2 ] are not as evident, making it challenging to predict how locally adapted ecotypes will respond to elevated [CO 2 ]. This experiment revealed that elevated [CO 2 ] increased photosynthesis and intrinsic water use efficiency across all accessions. However, these instantaneous responses to treatments did not translate to changes in fitness. Instead, increased temperatures reduced the probability of reproduction for all accessions. Elevated [CO 2 ] and increased temperatures interacted to shift the adaptive landscape, favoring lower elevation accessions for the probability of survival and fecundity. Our results suggest that elevated temperatures and [CO 2 ] associated with climate change could have severe negative consequences, especially for high‐elevation populations.

Tackling climate change remains a critical challenge for society. Achieving climate neutrality requires a massive expansion of renewable energies such as wind and photovoltaics (PV). Agriculture plays a key role in this context, especially as the expansion of ground-mounted PV systems often leads to land-use conflicts. Agrivoltaics (AV), which combines agricultural and electricity production, can be a solution, but the synergies are particularly dependent on local agronomic conditions. There is also a knowledge gap in how AV expansion impacts greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the landscape level and how it contributes to regional emission reduction targets. In this study, we analysed the economic and climate change mitigation impacts of AV expansion pathways in the German state Baden-Württemberg using an integrated land use model and life cycle assessment under the assumption of general rentability of electricity production by AV. We found that implementing AV on 1%-5% of the regions's arable and grassland area reduced the total agricultural gross margin by a maximum of approximately 0.5%. Concurrently, AV implementation reduced GHG emissions by about 1.2 million to 5.9 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2-eq). Even if this reduction is almost exclusively accounted for in the energy sector, in absolute terms it amounts to more than the current GHG emissions from Baden-Württemberg's agricultural sector (about 4.4 Mt CO2-eq in 2021). In the 5% expansion scenario, almost 90% of the installations were installed on grassland, but this share dropped to 72% when considering landscape quality constraints. Although we found considerable regional disparity, our findings still suggest that AV is an essential component for regional emission reduction targets. These results are particularly relevant for policymakers in spatial planning, agricultural and energy policy.

Under the mounting pressure to make changes to become more environmentally friendly and sustainable, port authorities have been exploring effective solutions to reduce CO2 emissions. In this regard, alternative fuels, innovative technology, and optimization strategies are key pathways for ports to transition toward a low-carbon pattern. In this review work, the current development status and characteristics of renewable and clean energy in ports were meticulously analyzed. The CO2 emission reduction effects and limitations of port microgrids, carbon capture, and other technological operations were thoroughly examined. Lastly, the emission reduction optimization strategies ports could adopt under different scenarios were evaluated. The research findings showed that (1) combining the characteristics of the port and quantifying the properties of different renewable energy sources and low-carbon fuels is extremely necessary to select suitable alternative energy sources for port development; (2) technological advancements, multi-party interests, and policy impacts were the primary factors influencing the development of emission reduction technology methods; and (3) the coordinated optimization of multiple objectives in cross-scenarios was the main direction for ports to achieve sustainable development. This study provides theoretical guidance to ports that are transitioning to a greener pattern, as well as pointing out future research directions and development spaces for researchers.

Methane hydrate (MH) is found under the seabed in Japan's exclusive economic zone and is attracting attention as a domestic natural gas resource. One of the methods for extracting methane gas (MG) from sub-seabed MH reservoir is depressurisation. However, the production decelerates after a certain time partly due to the cooling of the reservoir caused by the heat absorption during MH dissociation. Therefore, several enhanced gas recovery (EGR) methods have been proposed, such as injecting CO2 into a sub-seabed sand layer to form CO2 hydrate (CDH) and, using the heat of CDH formation. This method is two functions: EGR and the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. In this study, a numerical method was developed to investigate the performance of the EGR from MH, using the heat of CDH formation. In our previous study, CDH formation model had been installed into a programme code for two-phase flow of CO2 and water in porous media. Based on this code, we newly implemented the state equation, enthalpy model, viscosity model, and heat conduction model of MG and the dissociation model of MH. Then, simulations were performed to form CDH in specific sand-mud alternate layers and to dissociate MH. As a result, it was suggested that increasing the CO2 injection amount potentially increases MH dissociation and the vertical distance between the mud layer capping the injected liquid CO2 and the bottom-simulating reflector of CDH is important to ensure a large CDH region to generate a large amount of heat. It was also shown that even after stopping CO2 injection, MH dissociation can continue for a certain period.

The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising method that can both mitigate the greenhouse effect and generate valuable chemicals. The 2D-M2C12 with high-density transition metal single atoms is a potential catalyst for various catalytic reactions. Using an effective strategy, we screened 1s-Mn2C12 as the most promising electrocatalyst for the CO2RR in the newly reported 2D-M2C12 family. A low applied potential of −0.17 V was reported for the CO2-to-CH4 conversion. The relative weak adsorption of H atom and H2O in the potential range of −0.2 to −0.8 V, ensures the preferential adsorption of CO2 and the following production of CH4. The different loading amounts of Mn atoms on γ-graphyne (GY) were also investigated. The Mn atoms prefer doping in the nonadjacent triangular pores instead of the adjacent ones due to the repulsive forces between d-orbitals when the Mn loading is less than 32.3 wt % (5Mn). As the Mn concentration further increases, adjacent Mn atoms begin to appear, and the Mn@GY becomes metallic or half-metallic. The presence of four adjacent Mn atoms increases the d-band center of Mn@GY, particularly the dz2 center involved in CO2 adsorption, thereby enhancing the adsorption capacity for CO2. These findings indicate that 1s-Mn2C12 with high Mn atomic loadings is an excellent CO2RR electrocatalyst, and it provides new insights for designing efficient CO2RR electrocatalyst.

The energy demand in the building sector is anticipated to increase with climate change and the high energy consumption is responsible for releasing enormous amounts of CO2 into the environment, intensifying climate change. Phase change material (PCM) integration into the building envelope has a high potential to reduce the building's energy demand without compromising environmental sustainability. This research investigated the impact of PCMs (PCM 18–PCM 30) on building cooling, heating, and annual energy efficiency for future climate scenarios (2095) in 13 different climate zones worldwide. For this purpose, the Fanger comfort model was implemented and numerical simulations were performed using Energyplus. The performance of PCM was evaluated using novel Predicted Mean Vote fluctuation reductions (PMVFR), and the Total Predicted Mean Vote drop (TPMVD). Further, for the first time, a time series-forecasting model for the estimation of CO2 emissions originating from various energy production sources in the future was developed using gene-expression programming (GEP) algorithm. Finally, the two different maps showing the PCM efficiency for energy conservation and environmental sustainability at the global level are presented. The results evidence a maximum of 12.9% reduction in annual energy demand in the future with the integration of PCM. The GEP-based prediction model demonstrated good accuracy as determined by the statistical parameters and satisfied the external validation requirements. The environmental analysis exhibits that PCM integration can reduce carbon emissions up to 204 CO2-e Kg/year. Overall, the integration of PCM is regarded as a sustainable solution for building energy efficiency, considering climate change.

Lanthanide metals have attracted particular interest in the catalysis of electrochemical CO2 reduction. The synthesis and precise spatial distribution of active sites are fundamental important but still formidably challenging owing to the strong oxygen affinity of lanthanide. Here, heteronuclear Pr1-Ni1 single atoms are supported on the carbon matrix containing surface framework defects from lanthanide contraction. The Pr/Ni-NC catalyst exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.1 % with a commercial-scale current density of 237 mA cm−2 and a turnover frequency as high as 18,038 h−1 at −1.1 V due to d-f coupling effect and electronic structure perturbation of Pr. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations unveil that the diatomic active sites effectively reduce the energy barrier of the crucial *COOH formation, in which the Pr site facilitates CO2 activation and the Ni site enables H2O dissociation to accelerate the proton transfer process, thereby ensuring the synergy of catalytic sites to greatly facilitate CO2-to-CO conversion.

Chemical looping integrated with reverse water gas (CL-RWGS) shift is presented in this study using Cu-based oxygen carrier (OC) supported on Al2O3 has been used to convert the CO2 and H2 mixture stream into a syngas stream with a tailored H2 to CO ratio and relevant conditions. The results demonstrated consistent breakthrough curves during redox cycles, confirming the chemical stability of the material. In 10 consecutive cycles at 600 °C and 1 bar, bed temperatures increased by 184 °C and 132 °C across the bed during oxidation and reduction stages respectively. The cooling effects during RWGS showed a decline in solid temperatures demonstrating the effectiveness of the heat removal strategy while attaining a CO2-to-CO conversion close >48%. The outlet gas maintains a H2/CO ratio above 2, confirming the material's dual role as OC and catalyst. During complete CL-RWGS cycles, varying temperature from 500 °C to 600 °C at a constant H2/CO2 molar ratio (1.3) and pressure (1 bar) reduces the H2/CO molar ratio from 3.14 to 2.35, respectively with a remarkable continuous CO2-to-CO conversion > 40%. The decrease in H2/CO molar ratio with the increase in temperature is consistent with the expected results of equilibrium limited conditions. Additionally, in CL-RWGS cycles, pressure insignificantly affects product molar composition. The study showed the capability of Cu material in converting CO2 into syngas through the CL-RWGS technique.

The main objective of the current study is to examine the impact of institutional performance, digital governance, and green finance on environmental performance within expanded BRICS nations that have undergone expansion. Key findings indicate that enhancing digital governance significantly reduces emissions; therefore, policies should be implemented to fortify digital infrastructure and promote environmentally responsible practices. The study utilized three discrete regression models to analyse the ecological impact and emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, providing insights into the primary greenhouse gases contributing to global climate change. In light of the intricate correlation between emissions and institutional performance, it is imperative to develop nuanced policies that effectively reconcile the need to strengthen institutions with environmental concerns. Green financing is a crucial element that advocates for policies that encourage investment in environmentally friendly initiatives and technology and has a net positive impact on emissions reduction. The adoption of sustainable practices is imperative for economic expansion due to the observed correlation between heightened emissions and economic capacity. To decouple environmental degradation from economic expansion, policies should be implemented to support green technologies. In summary, these results provide evidence in favour of a comprehensive policy approach within the BRICS countries, which ought to achieve a harmonious coexistence of environmental conservation and economic advancement, to the advantage of all stakeholders. The current study is carried out to promote environmental sustainability, reduce harmful activities, strengthen institutions for collaborative pollution management, and enforce stringent environmental regulations on foreign direct investment, the expanded BRICS nations should strive to reduce detrimental activities. Placing significant emphasis on the interdependent nature of economic development and its environmental ramifications is of utmost importance.

Abstract The dihydrogen (H2) sector is undergoing development and will require massive storage solutions. To minimize costs, the conversion of UGS sites, such as deep aquifers, used for natural gas storage into future underground hydrogen storage (UHS) sites is the favored scenario. However, these sites contain microorganisms capable of consuming H2, mainly sulfate reducers and methanogens. Methanogenesis is therefore expected but its intensity must be evaluated. Here, in a deep aquifer used for UGS, 17 sites were sampled, with low sulfate concentrations ranging from 21.9 to 197.8 µM and a slow renewal of formation water. H2 selected communities mainly were composed of the families Methanobacteriaceae and Methanothermobacteriaceae and the genera Desulfovibrio, Thermodesulfovibrio and Desulforamulus. Experiments were done under different conditions, and sulfate reduction, as well as methanogenesis, were demonstrated in the presence of a H2 or H2/CO2 (80/20) gas phase, with or without calcite/site rock. These metabolisms led to an increase in pH up to 10.2 under certain conditions (without CO2). The results suggest competition for CO2 between lithoautotrophs and carbonate mineral precipitation, which could limit microbial H2 consumption.

Solar-integrated fuel cell systems are widely regarded as an effective means of saving energy and reducing emissions, given their ability to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. However, solar thermal power systems are intermittent, whereas fuel cell waste heat power generation has continuous power output. The paper proposes a novel solar and molten carbonate fuel cell complementary driven supercritical-CO2 cycle system. The performance of multi-energy complementary driven supercritical-CO2 cycle and system operation mode conversion is being investigated. The complementary operation mode ensures the continuous output of the proposed system through the switching of the solar module and the fuel cell module. The result indicates that the fuel cell module operates for 23.5 % of the time in a year, resulting in a reduction of the storage tank volume by 14,723 m3 and a decrease of the fixed heliostat area by 108,237 m2. The efficiency of the supercritical-CO2 cycle individually is 43.1 %, and with the addition of the waste heat utilization subsystem, the cycle efficiency of the proposed system reaches 50.89 %. Furthermore, the levelized cost of electricity for the proposed system is 0.1861$/kWh, and the research results can serve as a reference for the design of complementary energy systems.

The commercial viability of utilizing solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO remains hampered by the sluggish electrocatalytic activity of their electrode materials. Herein, a series of perovskites, Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x = 0.1, 0.2, PSCFNx), was synthesized with varying Ni doping levels. Increasing the Ni doping level induced the production of more oxygen vacancies. The treatment of PSCFNx in a reducing atmosphere caused the structural conversion of PSCFNx to a composite composed of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (RP-PSCFNx) and the exsolved Ni-Fe alloy. Moreover, a heterogeneous interface was formed between the Ni-Fe alloy nanoparticles and RP-PSCFNx structure. The electrocatalytic activity of the reduced PSCFNx (re-PSCFNx) for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) was studied using symmetrical SOEC, revealing that cell performance improved with increasing Ni doping content (i.e., with increasing oxygen vacancy content). The re-PSCFN0.2-based cell exhibited a current density of 2.40 A cm-2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE%) of almost 100% at 850 °C and 1.6 V, which was an 18% improvement compared to the re-PSCFN0.1-based cell. This work provides a strategy for synergistically improving the eCO2RR activity of SOEC by constructing an active heterogeneous interface and increasing the oxygen vacancy content.

SiC was first synthesized using the sol-gel method and subsequent carbothermal reduction method, then xCo/SiC-700 and 30%Co/SiC-T catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal method and thermal treatment. The structure of the catalysts was characterized by XRD, SEM/TEM, XPS, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, etc. Their catalytic activities for ammonia decomposition to produce hydrogen were investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The results showed that the synthesized SiC had a high specific surface area and could evenly disperse Co3O4 nanoparticles, which increased the exposure of active sites and improved the adsorption capacity on the catalyst surface. N2-TPD indicates that 30%Co/SiC-700 has a high N2 adsorption capacity, effectively preventing hydrogen reduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles in the catalyst during ammonia decomposition. CO-TPD shows that Co has the best dispersion on 30%Co/SiC-700 catalyst. CO2-TPD shows the higher the catalyst's basicity, the stronger ammonia's decomposition ability. Among the synthesized catalysts, 30% Co/SiC-700 showed the best catalytic activity for ammonia decomposition, with the ammonia conversion of 78.3% and hydrogen production of 25.0 mmol H2 gcat-1 min-1 at 550 °C under 30,000 mL gcat-1 h-1.

Abstract. In order to reduce aviation’s CO2 emissions and comply with current climate targets, the European Union plans a mandatory quota of 2 % sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, rising up to ≥ 70 % SAF by 2050. In addition to a reduction of life cycle CO2-emissions the use of SAF can also have a positive impact on particle emissions and contrail properties. In this study we present observations from the ECLIF3 (Emission and CLimate Impact of alternative Fuels) aircraft campaign, which investigated exhaust and contrail characteristics of an Airbus A350-941 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines. For the first time, non-volatile and total particle emissions of 100 % HEFA-SPK (Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids – Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) SAF, a blended fuel and a reference Jet A-1 were measured in flight. A maximum reduction in non-volatile particle number emissions of ∼41 % compared to the reference Jet A-1 fuel was measured at low cruise engine power settings when using 100 % HEFA-SPK. The reduction decreases to ∼29 % for typical cruise engine settings and to ∼22 % at high cruise engine power settings. The size of non-volatile particles was slightly smaller for HEFA-SPK compared to Jet A-1. We show a comprehensive analysis of the hydrogen content of globally available fuels. Our results demonstrate the impact of the fuel composition in terms of its aromatic, hydrogen and sulfur content as well as of the effect of engine power settings on particle emissions. We demonstrate that the use of HEFA-SPK can significantly reduce particle emissions and thus contrail ice particles, and therefore can provide an aviation climate benefit.

Introduction:Teleconsultations for preoperative evaluation in anesthesiology proved to be feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, widespread implementation of teleconsultations has not yet occurred. Besides time savings and economic benefits, teleconsultations in anesthesia may have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions.Methods:We conducted a life cycle assessment based on prospective surveys to assess the potential environmental benefits of preoperative anesthesia teleconsultations in comparison to the status-quo in-person consultations. Within 1 month, all patients presenting at the preoperative anesthesia clinic at RWTH Aachen University Hospital were asked about the distance traveled and mode of transportation to the hospital. The main outcome measure was the potential environmental benefit resulting from the implementation of teleconsultations.Results:In total, 821 out of 981 patients presenting at the anesthesia clinic participated in the survey. Most patients visited on an outpatient basis (62.9%) and traveled by car (81.7%). The median travel distance was 25 km [interquartile range 12-40]. If patients who came to the hospital solely for the anesthesia appointment had scheduled virtual appointments, the emissions of 3.03-ton CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq) could be avoided in the first month after implementation. The environmental impact associated with the production of teleconsultation equipment is outweighed by the reduction in patient travel. If all outpatient appointments were performed virtually, these savings would triple. Within 10 years, more than 1,300 tons CO2-eq could be avoided.Conclusion:Teleconsultations can mitigate the environmental impact of in-person anesthesia consultations. Further research is essential to leverage teleconsultations for preoperative evaluation also across other medical specialties.

The growing demand for sustainable and efficient gas separation technologies has prompted the exploration of advanced materials to enhance the gas permeability and selectivity. Polyethersulfone (PES) membranes are widely used in gas separation, gas upgrading, and clean energy production owing to their environmental friendliness and low cost. However, their gas permeability and selectivity can be further improved for commercial application. This study explored the incorporation of 10 wt. % of MIL-68(ln)-NH2 into PES membranes using a phase-inversion approach to enhance gas permeability and selectivity. The morphological, structural, and thermal properties of the resulting MOF/PES membrane were characterized using SEM, AFM, BET, XRD, FTIR, and TGA-DTG. Gas permeation experiments were conducted using different gases (CO2, N2, CH4, and H2) under different heating conditions (20-60 °C) to evaluate the gas permeability and selectivity of the MOF/PES membrane. The results showed that the incorporation of MOF into the mixed matrix membrane (MMMs) led to a 9% increase in porosity, 87% reduction in roughness, and 32% decrease in pore size compared to neat PES membranes. Significant changes in the morphology, crystallinity, and thermal stability were observed, with notable improvements of up to 22%. Moreover, the MOF/PES membrane exhibited high gas permeability (CO2 = 124656, N2 = 83650, CH4 = 159298, and H2 = 427075 Barrer) and selectivity (H2/N2= 5.7, H2/CO2= 4, CH4/N2= 2, and CH4/CO2= 1.7) for flammable gases. The optimal gas separation performance was observed at 20°C and 60°C for H2/N2 and H2/CO2 separation, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of MOF-based PES membranes for gas separation applications, particularly in H2 purification.

Abstract Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are among the most popular formations for large-scale geologic CO2 storage. While extensive research and characterization have been conducted on the geological structure and physical properties of many of these fields, the lack of field and core sample data related to reservoir flow and mechanical properties has hindered the assessment and modeling of CO2 storage, especially in offshore areas. In this study, we developed a coupled flow-geomechanical numerical model to evaluate the potential for storing CO2 in the soft sediments of the West Delta field of the Gulf of Mexico. The poroelastic parameters of the reservoir rocks were measured in the laboratory and the geological model of the reservoir was constructed based on the available seismic and well logs. The process of reservoir depletion was simulated to consider the effect of porosity reduction and permeability change. Pore volume multipliers were employed at the boundary to reach realistic pressure in the reservoir after depletion. A modified Cam-Clay model was used as the mechanical failure criterion to trace the porosity and formation subsidence. The results showed that the porosity reduced somewhat during the depletion and then increased during the CO2 injection. The porosity, however, did not fully recover after the injection process was completed. The maximum subsidence of the storage formation top reached almost 24 cm at the well location once the depletion completed. The pressure buildup at fault zones varied based on the vicinity of faults to the injection well, fault dip, dip direction, and CO2 injection rate. Sensitivity analysis using Fault Slip Potential (FSP) showed that various geomechanical parameters such as SHmax orientation, friction coefficient and dip of the fault influenced the probability of fault slip markedly. Assuming that faults are sealed, the pressure perturbation required to slip one of the major faults in the reservoir volume studied was lower than the calculated pressure buildup after the CO2 injection. The other two major faults are not predicted to have the potential for activation in any scenario. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct additional mechanical characterization particularly focusing on in-situ stress orientation and the transmissibility of faults as further work. This precautionary measure aims to mitigate the risk of fault activation during or after the injection phase.

Conventional usage of tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) via being supported on porous solid materials for carbon capture is susceptible to oxidative degradation during regeneration cycles. This study reports a novel method to synthesize a TEPA based solid polymer for efficient CO2 removal via direct air capture (DAC). The polymer was obtained through epoxy‐amine crosslinking reaction, leading to the transformation of liquid TEPA to a self‐supported solid polymer. The synthesis was conducted under ambient conditions via a one‐pot process with no waste products, which is aligned with green synthesis. The performance of the solid amine was evaluated in DAC under realistic conditions and compared with TEPA supported on SiO2 and zeolite 13X prepared through the conventional method. The solid TEPA amine exhibited a high CO2 uptake of 6.2 wt.% comparable to the conventional counterparts. More importantly, the solid TEPA amine demonstrated high resistance to oxidation during the accelerated ageing process at 80 °C in air for 24 h, whereas the two supported TEPA samples experienced severe degradation, with zeolite 13X supported TEPA incurring a reduction of 86.5% in CO2 capturing capacity after the ageing. This work sheds light on the novel usage of TEPA as an efficient solid amine for practical DAC operation.

Enhanced efforts in the transportation sector should be implemented to mitigate the adverse effects of CO2 emissions resulting from zoning-based planning paradigms. The concept of a 15-minute city, emphasizing proximity-based planning, holds promise in reducing unnecessary travel and progressing towards carbon neutrality. However, a critical research question remains inadequately explored: to what extent is the 15-minute city concept feasible for American cities? This paper presents a comprehensive framework to evaluate the 15-minute city concept using SafeGraph Point of Interest (POI) check-in data across 12 major American cities. Our findings suggest a prevailing reliance on cars among residents due to the spatial distribution of essential activities beyond convenient walking, cycling, and public transit distances. Nevertheless, there exists significant promise for realizing the 15-minute city vision, given that most residents' daily activities can be accommodated within a 15-minute radius by low-emission modes transportation modes. When comparing cities, it appears that achieving a 15-minute walking city is more feasible for metropolises like New York City, San Francisco, Boston, and Chicago, while proving to be challenging for cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix. In examing inter-group comparisons, neighborhoods with higher proportion of White residents and higher median incomes tend to have more accessible POIs, with a substantial percentage of activities concentrated within a 15-minute radius. This demographic also shows a greater propensity to fulfill daily activities through walking, cycling, or public transit trips within a 15-minute travel time, thus presenting a greater potential in CO2 reduction compared to African Americans. This study can offer policymakers insight into how far American cities are away from the 15-minute city concept. It also highlights the potential CO2 emissions reductions that could be achieved through successful implementation.

Ethane, one of the key components of shale gas, is a valuable feedstock for the production of syngas (CO + H2) via the CC bond cleavage during dry reforming of ethane (DRE) reaction. Selective catalysts are needed to direct this reaction pathway against the competing CH bond cleavage for ethylene formation. In this study, Fe, V and Rh oxides supported on TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method. The catalysts were tested for DRE with the main target of enhancing selectivity to syngas (CO and H2) and reducing byproducts (methane and ethylene) formation. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, NH3/CO2 temperature programmed desorption and H2-temperature programmed reduction. Temperature programmed oxidation was utilized to characterize the coke contents of the spent catalysts. The catalysts were evaluated for DRE reaction in a fixed-bed reactor at the temperature range from 500 °C to 650 °C and CO2/ethane ratio from 2.0 to 10.0 (mol/mol). It was found that ethane conversion over the three catalysts increased in the order Rh/TiO2 > Fe/TiO2 > V/TiO2. Rh/TiO2 catalyst exhibited > 99 % ethane conversion, 36 % and 61 % yields of H2 and CO, respectively, at 650 °C and CO2/ethane ratio of 5.0. The high conversion of ethane was mainly attributed to the enhanced dispersion of Rh oxides on the TiO2 support coupled with the balanced surface acidic and basic sites. The Rh catalyst facilitated CC bond dissociation of ethane thereby forming methyl intermediates which then reacted with adsorbed CO2, thereby enhancing syngas production during DRE reaction.

<p>The Uithoornlijn project involves the construction of a concrete pavement for buses with tram tracks, with a focus on achieving low CO2 emissions during construction. The largest share of emissions comes from cement production for the concrete. Through smart reduction in cement usage and the incorporation of various substitutions, the CO2 emissions have been reduced to approximately 1,400 tons.</p><p>The sustainable concrete mix requires attention to the slow strength development, especially in cold conditions. Insulating the concrete after placement helps retain heat and stimulate strength development.

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) with orthostatic intolerance (OI) is characterized by neuro-cognitive deficits perhaps related to upright hypocapnia and loss of cerebral autoregulation (CA). We performed N-back neurocognition testing and calculated the phase synchronization index (PhSI) between Arterial Pressure (AP) and cerebral blood velocity (CBV) as a time-dependent measurement of cerebral autoregulation in 11 control (mean age=24.1 years) and 15 ME/CFS patients (mean age=21.8 years). All ME/CFS patients had postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). A 10-minute 60⁰ head-up tilt (HUT) significantly increased heart rate (109.4 ± 3.9 vs. 77.2 ± 1.6 beats/min, P <0.05) and respiratory rate (20.9 ± 1.7 vs. 14.2 ± 1.2 breaths/min, P < 0.05) and decreased end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2; 33.9 ± 1.1 vs. 42.8 ± 1.2 Torr, P < 0.05) in ME/CFS vs. control. In ME/CFS, HUT significantly decreased CBV compared to control (-22.5% vs -8.7%, p<0.005). To mitigate the orthostatic CBV reduction, we administered supplemental CO2, phenylephrine and acetazolamide and performed N-back testing supine and during HUT. Only phenylephrine corrected the orthostatic decrease in neurocognition by reverting % correct n=4 N-back during HUT in ME/CFS similar to control (ME/CFS=38.5±5.5 vs. ME/CFS+PE= 65.6±5.7 vs. Control 56.9±7.5). HUT in ME/CFS resulted in increased PhSI values indicating decreased CA. While CO2 and Acetazolamide had no effect on PhSI in ME/CFS, PE caused a significant reduction in PhSI (ME/CFS=0.80±0.03 vs ME/CFS+PE= 0.69±0.04, p< 0.05) and improved cerebral autoregulation. Thus, PE improved neurocognitive function in ME/CFS patients, perhaps related to improved neurovascular coupling, cerebral autoregulation and maintenance of CBV.

Electromethanogenesis has emerged as a biological branch of Power-to-X technologies that implements methanogenic microorganisms, as an alternative to chemical Power-to-X, to convert electrical power from renewable sources, and CO2 into methane. Unlike biomethanation processes where CO2 is converted via exogenously added hydrogen, electromethanogenesis occurs in a bioelectrochemical set-up that combines electrodes and microorganisms. Thereby, mixed, or pure methanogenic cultures catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methane via reducing equivalents supplied by a cathode. Recent advances in electromethanogenesis have been driven by interdisciplinary research at the intersection of microbiology, electrochemistry, and engineering. Integrating the knowledge acquired from these areas is essential to address the specific challenges presented by this relatively young biotechnology, which include electron transfer limitations, low energy and product efficiencies, and reactor design to enable upscaling. This review approaches electromethanogenesis from a multidisciplinary perspective, putting emphasis on the extracellular electron uptake mechanisms that methanogens use to obtain energy from cathodes, since understanding these mechanisms is key to optimize the electrochemical conditions for the development of these systems. This work summarizes the direct and indirect extracellular electron uptake mechanisms that have been elucidated to date in methanogens, along with the ones that remain unsolved. As the study of microbial corrosion, a similar bioelectrochemical process with Fe0 as electron source, has contributed to elucidate different mechanisms on how methanogens use solid electron donors, insights from both fields, biocorrosion and electromethanogenesis, are combined. Based on the repertoire of mechanisms and their potential to convert CO2 to methane, we conclude that for future applications, electromethanogenesis should focus on the indirect mechanism with H2 as intermediary. By summarizing and linking the general aspects and challenges of this process, we hope that this review serves as a guide for researchers working on electromethanogenesis in different areas of expertise to overcome the current limitations and continue with the optimization of this promising interdisciplinary technology.

Abstract DNA variation analysis has become indispensable in many aspects of modern biomedicine, most prominently in the comparison of normal and tumor samples. Thousands of samples are collected in local sequencing efforts and public databases requiring highly scalable, portable, and automated workflows for streamlined processing. Here, we present nf-core/sarek 3, a well-established, comprehensive variant calling and annotation pipeline for germline and somatic samples. It is suitable for any genome with a known reference. We present a full rewrite of the original pipeline showing a significant reduction of storage requirements by using the CRAM format and runtime by increasing intra-sample parallelization. Both are leading to a 70% cost reduction in commercial clouds enabling users to do large-scale and cross-platform data analysis while keeping costs and CO2 emissions low. The code is available at https://nf-co.re/sarek.

The integration of digital technologies into forest management is crucial for the European Union’s Green Deal, the Forestry Strategy 2030, and Italy’s national forestry strategy, aiming to enhance governance and efficiency. However, sustainable forest management’s administrative aspects are often overlooked, despite the potential for digital tools to significantly improve environmental performance. Through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for a case study in the Umbria region, the research quantifies CO2 emissions associated with over-threshold forestry administrative procedures under both current and future digitalisation scenarios. Data were collected from legislative documents, interviews with forestry professionals, and emissions calculated according to ISO standards. The findings reveal a considerable reduction in CO2 emissions through digitalisation, from 75.07 kgCO2 to 38.14 kgCO2, with the implementation of the LIFE FOLIAGE project’s digital platform. This underscores digitalisation’s role in climate change mitigation, highlighting the significant, albeit modest per procedure, of the cumulative national impact. The main findings support further digitalisation in forest management as a method of increasing resource efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to the Green Deal’s and Italy’s forest sustainability goals.

Abstract A large amount of toxic smoke and heat generated by the combustion of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) poses a significant threat to human fire escape evacuation. This work aims to use γ-ray to prepare e-MXene@Ag hybrid flame-retardant materials by the method of in-situ reduction, and EVA composites are prepared by melt blending to reduce the smoke and toxic gases produced during combustion significantly. Compared with pure EVA, the total heat release, total smoke release, and the production rate of CO and CO2 produced by the combustion of EVA composite with 1wt% e-MXene@Ag1.0 decreased by 30.3%, 33.3%, 18.2%, and 20.1% respectively, while the content of residue increased by 907.4%. The fire hazard reduction of EVA composite materials was due to the physical barrier, catalytic carbonization and adsorption of the e-MXene@Ag1.0 hybrid. In addition, e-MXene@Ag1.0 can also further increase the mechanical properties of EVA composites due to its own "multi-contact point limit structure."&#xD;

It remains unclear why type-II antiferromagnetic order with a propagation vector along a trigonal axis and a tetragonal Jahn–Teller deformation coexist in a low-temperature phase of CoO. Nanocrystals generally have a lower magnetic transition temperature but crystal size reduction does not affect structural transition locally induced by a crystal field. On this basis, we investigated the magnetic and structural properties of CoO nanocrystals. Both transition temperatures were equally reduced in nanocrystals, which indicates that magnetic order triggers the tetragonal deformation. This observation is consistent with a model that the Jahn–Teller deformation is assisted by spin–orbit energy splitting of t2g electrons in the high-spin Co2+ ion, proposed by Kugel and Khomskii.

Reppe carbonylation of acetylene is an atom-economic and non-petroleum approach to synthesize acrylic acid and acrylate esters, which are key intermediates in the textile, leather finishing, and polymer industries. In the present work, a noble metal-free Co@SiO2 catalyst was prepared and evaluated in the methoxycarbonylation reaction of acetylene. It was discovered that pretreatment of the catalyst by different reductants (i.e., C2H2, CO, H2, and syngas) greatly improved the catalytic activity, of which Co/SiO2-H2 demonstrated the best performance under conditions of 160 °C, 0.05 MPa C2H2, 4 MPa CO, and 1 h, affording a production rate of 4.38 gMA+MP gcat−1 h−1 for methyl acrylate (MA) and methyl propionate (MP) and 0.91 gDMS gcat−1 h−1 for dimethyl succinate (DMS), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra of CO adsorption (CO-DRIFTS) measurements revealed that an H2 reduction decreased the size of the Co nanoparticles and promoted the formation of hollow architectures, leading to an increase in the metal surface area and CO adsorption on the catalyst. The hot filtration experiment confirmed that Co2(CO)8 was generated in situ during the reaction or at the pre-activation stage, which served as the genuine active species. Our work provides a facile and convenient approach to the in situ synthetization of Co2(CO)8 for a Reppe carbonylation reaction.

Algal biofuel production and carbon capture catalytic approaches represent groundbreaking solutions to environmental challenges, offering pathways to sustainability and energy security. This comprehensive review investigates the integration of catalytic methods in algae-based technologies, emphasizing their environmental benefits and potential for innovation. Algal biofuel production harnesses solar energy and CO2 to yield a promising alternative to conventional fuels. Despite notable progress, scalability, resource optimization, and economic viability pose ongoing challenges.

In today's life, humans compromise with nature while evolving into a more advanced species. One of the main effects of that advancement is air pollution. Air pollution seriously threatens human health, the environment, and the general quality of life worldwide. A quantitative analysis of air quality was the purpose of developing the Air Quality Index (AQI), an indexing approach. The air quality index is computed using measurements for particulate matter (PM), PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, CO2, NH3, and other contaminants. Agnihotra (Yagya) is a method of environmental purification mentioned in the Hindu sculpture (The Book Yagya Vimarsh, written by Dr. Ramprakash, talks about the air pollution reduction method). This paper discusses the Vayu Vishleshan framework for monitoring air quality in the presence of Agnihotra (Yagya). This study is divided into two processes. The first one is AQI monitoring, and the second is AQI reduction. AQI Monitoring covers sensing particulate matter (PM), PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO and performing analysis over the AQI data before, during, and following Agnihotra (Yagya). According to analysis, there is an approximate 6–7% decrease in CO levels and an approximate 10–12% decrease in PM levels following Agnihotra.

New mobility, battery electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicle manufacturer strategies to achieve climate neutrality are transforming car design and automotive engineering. As an important styling element and an essential part of emissions-reduction strategies, wheel design is undergoing significant change. Advances in simulation tools, supercomputing and increasingly diverse engineering capabilities are enabling advances in wheel design. These investments and advances are enabling Maxion to deliver on its objective of offering customers the most sustainable wheel option for every vehicle segment. To achieve substantial carbon footprint reductions, however, major innovations are required: replacing aluminum with less energy-intensive materials is a key part of the challenge. With a carbon footprint that is 70% less than aluminum, steel wheels represent a significant opportunity for life cycle CO2 savings. As vehicle manufacturers adjust to the evolving demands of new mobility, the need for improved aerodynamics and changing perceptions of what creates additional value for EV buyers are prompting a shift in attitudes toward steel wheels by program managers. Long overlooked, the industry's commitment to carbon neutrality, sustainability and new mobility, is encouraging a fundamental rethink of the role of steel wheels.

Atomically precise nanoclusters (APN) are more useful for detecting the reaction mechanisms and active sites of the electrocatalysis process at the molecular or atomic level. The atomically precise metal nanoclusters are used as efficient catalysts in most electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reactions, electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions, fuel cell reactions, degradation reactions of contaminants, and electrochemical synthesis of ammonia. The various factors influencing the electrocatalytic properties of metal nanoclusters include the core, charge of the metal, metal atom distribution, kinds of protection ligands, substrates, and the detailed structure of the metal nanoclusters. The design of fuel cells is challenging because of the formulation and design of effective electrocatalysts for the slow cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Amongst the differently designed electrocatalysts, presently the atomically precise electrocatalysts (APE), like single-atom, multi-atom, and dual-atom clusters, have been emphasized by researchers because of their outstanding effectiveness in atom utilization and catalytic performance. The nanoparticle of metal now captures a vital position in the catalytic activity of electrocatalysis. Therefore, APN shows the properties of metal nanoclusters passivated by ligands and is today considered an effective class of model catalyst that provides great potential in the field of catalysis research.

Reducing the energy consumption of hydrogen liquefaction process is an urgent issue to improve the economy of liquid hydrogen transportation. A novel large-scale hydrogen liquefaction system, with a capacity of 100 TPD, is proposed in this paper. The pre-cooling system is composed of a mixed-refrigerant (MR) refrigeration cycle and a CO2–NH3 cascade refrigeration cycle. Due to the auxiliary pre-cooling effect of the CO2–NH3 cascade cycle, temperature of the pre-cooled hydrogen can be as low as −200.9 °C. A modified MR Joule Brayton cycle with an additional compressor is used as the cryogenic system to cool the hydrogen from −200.9 °C to −252.2 °C. Besides, a four-stage ortho-to-para conversion (OPC) process is utilized. Performance of the novel system is investigated and optimized using the Aspen HYSYS software. According to the results, the lowest specific energy consumption (SEC) of the proposed process is 6.15 kWh/kgLH2 and the exergy efficiency is as high as 67.4%. Based on the energy analysis, the best system coefficient of performance is 0.1751 with a 96.3% of p-H2 in the liquid hydrogen. In addition, compared to the initial conceptual system, the proposed system exhibits significant performance enhancements, a 20% reduction in SEC and a 27.9% increase in exergy efficiency. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the impact of refrigerant composition and hydrogen pressure on the system, resulting in the determination of the optimal proportions of refrigerant components and the optimal inlet pressure. Results of the study can provide theoretical reference for the further development of large-scale hydrogen liquefaction technology.

Onions (Allium cepa L) minimally processed presents especially high demand for foodservices, however the cutting process results in an increase in metabolic activity of the tissue, triggering a reduction of its lifetime. Therefore, it was proposed to evaluate the implementation of atmospheres modified (0%O2 , 10%CO2 and 90%N2 ) using two packaging materials (Flexvac® and BOPP®) on the stability of sliced onions against a control sample vacuum packed. The samples were stored for 18 days at 4 °C, and the quality attributes were evaluated in terms of physical-chemical, microbiological and sensorial analysis. The result shows that the three packaging conditions increased value of firmness within the first 5 days of storage, then these values are reduced, which is related to the amount of exudate produced in samples assessed as loss weight , for the three conditions of packaging a loss of 20 % occurs in approximately , being lower for Flexvac®. Sensory analysis, the condition of coextruded vacuum - packaging is that presents greater decrease. In relation to the variables of pH, acidity, color and microbiological growth showed no difference between the treatments. The results indicate that the Flexvac® material is suitable for the packaging of pre - cut onion in modified atmospheres

Energy usage and climate change are 21st-century challenges. The main cause of climate change is greenhouse gases (GHGs) which are mostly produced by burning fossil fuels. Therefore, effective solutions for new urban areas are required to mitigate climate change impact and to achieve a balance between different sustainability dimensions. Thus, this research investigates the assessment of applying a new generation of Egyptian cities that possesses an urban identity and architectural character, which is called; the 5th generation of Egyptian cities. An outdoor simulation is performed using ENVI-met software to assess the mutual effect on buildings and street canyon conditions, whereas the street canyon considers urban details, and identifies various environmental sustainability measures. This work shows with courtyarded clustered housing with CEB wall material is more efficient as the simulation results show a reduction in air temperature by (0.71%), mean radiant temperature by (3.91%) as a maximum value in the peak day hour, and better human thermal comfort PMV by (4%) as a maximum value at hours from 10 am to 5 pm and by (2.8%) as an average value all day. An indoor simulation is also applied using Design-Builder software and it shows that there is an average reduction in energy by (5.5%) and CO2 emissions by (3.2%). Also, Thermal comfort (PMV) is better by (18.6%) as an average value.

Abstract We describe how increased root cortical parenchyma wall width (CPW) can improve tolerance to drought stress in maize by reducing the metabolic costs of soil exploration. Significant variation (1.0 to 5.0 µm) for CPW was observed in maize germplasm. The functional-structural model RootSlice predicts that increasing CPW from 2 to 4 µm is associated with ca. 15% reduction in root cortical cytoplasmic volume, respiration rate, and nitrogen content. Analysis of genotypes with contrasting CPW grown with and without water stress in the field confirms that increased CPW is correlated with ca. 32 to 42% decrease in root respiration. Under water stress in the field, increased CPW is correlated with 125% increased stomatal conductance, 325% increased leaf CO2 assimilation rate, 73 to 78% increased shoot biomass, and 92 to 108% increased yield. CPW was correlated with leaf mesophyll midrib parenchyma wall width, indicating pleiotropy. GWAS analysis identified candidate genes underlying CPW. OpenSimRoot modeling predicts that a reduction in root respiration due to increased CPW would also benefit maize growth under suboptimal nitrogen, which requires empirical testing. We propose CPW as a new phene that has utility under edaphic stress meriting further investigation.

Multiple-thermal-fluid (MTF) stimulation technology has been successfully applied in heavy-oil reservoir development, resulting in the significant enhancement of oil production. However, the underlying mechanism of multi-component coupling remains unclear. This paper constructs a coupling model for MTF stimulation, investigates the coupling mechanism of different media in various zones during multiple-cycle stimulation operations, and compares the implementation effect with field results. The findings reveal that (1) based on media distribution, the area from near-wellbore to far well locations can be divided into four zones: high-temperature oil-viscosity-reduction zones, compound action zones, energy-replenishment zones, and unaffected zones. (2) In the high-temperature oil-viscosity-reduction zone, the latent heat of vaporization is released by steam, and ultra-heavy oil absorbs heat and reduces its viscosity, which plays a dominant role in the production of MTF. In the compound action zone, hot water, CO2, and N2 exhibit a synergistic effect which enhances overall performance. In the energy-replenishment zone, a small amount of N2 provides pressure maintenance and an additional energy supply. (3) As more cycles of stimulation are conducted, the compound action zone expands, while the energy-replenishment zone contracts. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in contribution rate from the high-temperature viscosity-reduction zone to oil production but an increase from both the compound action zone and energy-replenishment zone up to 30%. Based on the dynamic law of representative wells, this paper proposes a multi-media zonal coupling mechanism, providing a reference for subsequent research on MTF stimulation mechanisms and the adjustment of production measures.

Governments globally have prioritized carbon neutrality and reduction as a response to the intensifying menace of climate change. These objectives align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG-13), stressing the imperative to take decisive action on climate change. Thus, this study aimed to assess the impact of oil price uncertainty, economic policy uncertainty, financial development, and renewable energy on ecological proxies (CO2 emissions, Ecological footprint, and Load capacity factor) using quarterly data spanning from 1990 to 2019. As far as the investigators are aware, this is the first empirical analysis examining the impact of oil price uncertainty on ecological quality. To achieve this, we employed advanced techniques, including quantile-on-quantile KRLS (QQKRLS) and quantile-on-quantile Granger causality (QQGC), to analyse the interconnections among these variables. The findings based on the load capacity factor exposed that renewable energy, economic policy uncertainty, financial development, and economic growth positively contribute to ecological quality, whereas oil price uncertainty has a detrimental effect. Additionally, as a measure of robustness, CO2 emissions and ecological footprint were included in the analysis, demonstrating comparable outcomes when assessed alongside the load capacity factor model. Furthermore, QQGC results demonstrated that all regressors significantly forecast ecological quality. Drawing from the findings, policy interventions ought to prioritize incentivizing the adoption of renewable energy, mitigating economic policy uncertainty, fostering financial development, and stimulating economic growth as pivotal strategies for augmenting ecological quality. Furthermore, integrating measures to alleviate oil price uncertainty stands as a crucial imperative for ensuring environmental sustainability.

Submarine mud-volcanoes are globally distributed in the plate convergent margins1,2. The mud-volcanism transports deep-sourced fluids and hydrocarbons to the seafloor3, which upward supply often supports chemosynthetic benthic life and microbial communities that play significant ecological roles in biogeochemical carbon cycle4,5. Yet, geochemical and microbiological characteristics of the deep mud-volcano subsurface remain largely unknown. Here, we studied an active submarine mud-volcano in the Nankai Trough by drilling down to 200 meters from the summit. Cell count and molecular analyses indicate that relatively small (102~105 cells/cm3) but phylogenetically diverse microbial populations are present throughout the cored sediment. In the pore water, carbon isotopic compositions of bicarbonate and acetate are notably 13C-enriched up to the maximum value of +40 and -25, respectively. High concentrations of hydrogen (up to 1,800 nM) are observed, suggesting a thermodynamically feasible condition for microbial acetogenesis via CO2 reduction. Radiotracer experiments consistently showed that acetogenesis activities are generally 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than those of methanogenesis. These data indicate that the deep biosphere in the submarine mud-volcano is characterized by tectonic and sedimentolgoical regimes of the oceanic accretionary wedge, and hence different from the stratified sedimentary biosphere.

The use of phase change materials in building envelopes has attracted the attention of researchers to minimize cooling and heating loads and for thermal comfort regulation. A research gap was found regarding the numerical analysis of lightweight roofs with PCM considering conjugate heat transfer. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the thermal performance of a lightweight hollow concrete roof with a phase change material (PCM) in a subhumid climate. Three roof configurations with two PCMs were numerically analyzed through computational fluid dynamics. Simulations were conducted using the open-source code OpenFoam and were verified and validated with good agreements proving the confidence of the proposed methodology for building envelope design purposes. The roof configurations with fully-filled PCM exhibited the best thermal behavior, reaching higher temperature reductions between 1.4 °C to 2.0 °C, respectively, and reductions of indoor peak heat flux by approximately 47 % compared with the reference case. The roof fully-filled with an inorganic PCM with a melting temperature of 25 °C was the most energy-efficient roof configuration because it achieved the highest energy savings of 65.5 %, lowest electricity costs of 0.85–4.33 USD m−2, and lowest CO2 emissions of approximately 18.31 kgCO2e m−2. The results demonstrated that the utilization of PCM into lightweight concrete roofs in subhumid climates is very promising.

Bangladesh faces challenges with global carbon emissions and energy security due to its heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels. This paper investigates the techno-economic viability of photovoltaic (PV) systems for achieving net-zero energy in academic buildings as a sustainable alternative. The study evaluates the performance of PV systems based on factors including annual energy production, capacity factor, net-zero energy potential, self-consumption/sufficiency ratio, renewable fraction, levelized cost of energy, net present value (NPV), payback period, profitability index (PI), and carbon emission reduction. The results indicate that optimally sized PV systems can generate net positive energy: 6.18 MWh for universities, 4.04 MWh for high schools, and 3.62 MWh for primary schools. Economic viability was assessed under two billing methods (net metering and all buy/sell), and all cases showed positive NPV and PI values greater than 1. Decarbonization analysis revealed significant reductions in CO2 emissions: 2026.5 tons for universities, 18.9 tons for high schools, and 9.7 tons for primary schools. Finally, a sensitivity analysis assessed the optimal PV system size for seven other regions in Bangladesh. These findings suggest that the widespread adoption of PV systems in academic buildings can play a crucial role in achieving net-zero energy, contributing significantly to the government and policymakers' pursuit of sustainable development goals.

Building materials are responsible for significant CO2 emissions and energy consumption, both during production and operational phases. Earth as a building material offers a valuable alternative to conventional materials, as it naturally provides high hygrothermal comfort and air quality even with passive conditioning systems. However, disadvantages related to high density, conductivity, and wall thickness prevent its effective inclusion in the mainstream. This research explores enhancing the thermophysical properties of compressed earth blocks (CEBs) by using locally sourced natural materials. The study is framed in the Portuguese context and the natural materials involved are wheat straw (WS) as a by-product of wheat harvesting, cork granules (CGs) from bottle caps, and ground olive stone (GOS) residues from olive oil production. Blocks were produced with different mixtures of these materials and the thermal response was examined in a hot box apparatus. Best results include a 20 and 26% reduction in thermal conductivity for mixtures with 5v.% CG and 10v.% GOS, respectively, and an associated reduction in bulk density of 3.8 and 5.4%. The proposed approach therefore proves to be effective in improving the key thermophysical characteristics of CEBs. The article includes a comparative analysis of the experimental data from this study with those from the literature. The study contributes to the growing knowledge of sustainable materials, providing insights for researchers and practitioners looking for innovative solutions for low-carbon and energy-efficient materials.

Ferromagnetic metallic cobalt and nickel nanoparticles were synthesized by intramolecular metal-hydrazine ligand oxidation reduction reaction in basic media and the solid state. Nickel nanoparticles Ni1 and Ni2 are obtained from two complexes, Ni(N2H4)2(C2O4) and Ni(N2H4)2(HCO2)2, respectively. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) data show pure fcc crystal structures of nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed both Ni1 and Ni2 nanoparticles have agglomerated sphere morphologies. The crystallite size estimated by using the Scherer method for Ni1 and Ni2 were 18.7 and 6.2 nm. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) data show the coercivity of metallic nickel samples Ni1 and Ni2 are 50 and 153 Oe, respectively. Both nanoparticles cause an increase in the temperature of water under applied alternative magnetic field and showed specific loss power (SLP) of 70 W/g and 104.8 W/g, respectively. The same method is used in preparation of cobalt nanoparticles from two complexes, Co(N2H4)2(C2O4) and Co(N2H4)2(HCO2)2. XRD analysis data show both nanoparticles have hcp crystal structure. SEM images show nanosheet structure with sheet thickness of 10 to 30 nm. Coercivity of Co1 and Co2 nanoparticles obtained by VSM and Hc are 182 and 171 Oe, respectively. In spite of high coercivity in both Co1 and Co2 nanoparticles, the magnetic hyperthermia heating effects are not observed in practice and specific loss power (SLP) is zero.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to feedstocks competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) immobilized onto carbon driven by π-π interaction represents a classical type of heterogeneous molecular catalyst for CO2R. However, the impacts of π conjugation on the electrocatalysis have not been clarified. Herein, the electrochemical properties of CoPc were investigated by comparison of its analogue to 2,3-naphthalocyanine cobalt (NapCo) having extended π conjugation. It is found that CoPc is redox-active on carbon to provide low oxidized Co sites for improving the CO2R activity and selectivity, while NapCo on carbon turned out to be redox-inert leading to lower performance. In addition, the redox-mediated mechanism for CO2R on CoPc tends to operate with increasing electrolyte alkalinity, which further enhances the reaction selectivity. We speculated that moderate π conjugation allows the redox-mediated mechanism on CoPc, which is critical to promote CO2R performance while depressing the competing HER.

Depolymerization of carbohydrate biomass using a long-chain alcohol (transglycosylation) to produce alkyl glycoside-based bio-surfactants has been gaining industrial interest. This study introduces microwave-assisted transglycosylation in transforming wheat bran, a substantial agricultural side stream, into these valuable compounds. Compared to traditional heating, microwave-assisted processing significantly enhances the product yield by 53 % while reducing the reaction time by 72 %, achieving a yield of 29 % within 5 h. This enhancement results from the microwave's capacity to activate intermolecular hydrogen and glycosidic bonds, thereby facilitating transglycosylation. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) demonstrate the benefits of microwave heating in reducing energy consumption by 42 %, CO2 emissions by 56 %, and equipment, operational and production costs by 44 %, 35 % and 30 %, respectively. The study suggests that microwave heating is a promising approach for efficiently producing bio-surfactants from agricultural wastes, with potential cost reductions and environmental benefits that could enhance industrial biomass conversion processes.

The aim of this study is to perform the thermal analysis of an existing building by a software, hence determine the possible improvements and energy savings. In this context, the existing model and two different improved models of a building are compared. The 1st case covers the existing situation of the building while the 2nd and 3rd cases are related to two improved cases for the building. The improvements are focused on heat insulation, infiltration and lighting system of the building. The results point out that 2nd and 3rd cases provide a reduction in electricity consumption by 15% compared to the 1st case. Similarly, annual natural gas consumption is decreased about by 76% and 90% in 2nd and 3rd cases, respectively in comparison with the 1st case. The total energy consumption by electricity and natural gas per unit area for 1st, 2nd and 3rd cases is also determined as 55.7, 35.7 and 33.1 kWh/m2, respectively. Moreover, annual CO2 emission is ensured to reduce nearly by 23% in both 2nd and 3rd cases compared to 1st situation.

A new afterburner installation is proposed, fueled with pure hydrogen (100%H2) or hydrogen–methane mixtures (60% H2 + 40% CH4, 80% H2 + 20% CH4) for use in cogeneration applications. Two prototypes (P1 and P2) with the same expansion angle (45 degrees) were developed and tested. P1 was manufactured by the classic method and P2 by additive manufacturing. Both prototypes were manufactured from Inconel 625. During the tests, analysis of flue gas (CO2, CO, and NO concentration), PIV measurements, and noise measurements were conducted. The flue gas analysis emphasizes that the behavior of the two tested prototypes was very similar. For all three fuels used, the CO2 concentration levels were slightly lower in the case of the additive-manufactured prototype P2. The CO concentration levels were significantly higher in the case of the additive-manufactured prototype P2 when 60% H2/40% CH4 and 80% H2/20% CH4 mixtures were used as fuel. When pure H2 was used as fuel, the measured data suggest that no additional CO was produced during the combustion process, and the level of CO was similar to that from the Garrett micro gas turbine in all five measuring points. The NO emissions gradually decreased as the percentage of H2 in the fuel mixture increased. The NO concentration was significantly lower in the case of the additive-manufactured prototype (P2) in comparison with the classic manufactured prototype (P1). Examining the data obtained from the PIV measurements of the flow within the mixing region shows that the highest axial velocity component value on the centerline was measured for the P1 prototype. The acoustic measurements showed that a higher H2 concentration led to a reduction in noise of approximately 1.5 dB for both afterburner prototypes. The outcomes reveal that the examined V-gutter flame holder prototype flow was smooth, without any perpendicular oscillations, without chaotic motions or turbulent oscillations to the flow direction, across all tested conditions, keeping constant thermal power.

Diesel-fueled heavy-duty (HD) trucks are a key component of global freight transport, but consume 25% of the transportation industry's energy and emitting substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Utilizing low-carbon fuels like natural gas (NG), combined with hybridization, presents an excellent opportunity for reducing GHG emissions and fuel consumption. Micro-pilot dual fuel diesel/NG engines offer high engine brake thermal efficiency (BTE) with an efficient three-way catalyst (TWC) to limit pollutant emissions like CO2 without the need for costly exhaust aftertreatment systems. This engine is particularly well-suited for hybridization, as it features high-efficiency under stable, mid-, and high-load conditions, but with reduced performance at low loads. This paper validates two conventional baseline models (X15 Cummins diesel engine and micro-pilot NG engine) based on a tested class 8 regional-haul truck on highway. The study investigates the combined effect of low-carbon fuels and hybridization on improving the fuel economy and GHG emissions of class 8 regional-haul trucks. This involves designing pre-transmission parallel and plug-in hybrid configurations with downsized 6.7-liter micro-pilot NG engines. The cargo load and performance requirements are maintained equivalent to the conventional diesel baseline. Results show comparable fuel economy and engine BTE between conventional diesel baseline and NG models on highways with full cargo load. The parallel and series plug-in hybrid NG designs exhibit fuel economy improvements of 2.9% and 26%, respectively, compared to the micro-pilot NG over highway with full cargo load. In the same conditions, the CO2 emissions reductions for parallel and series plug-in hybrid NG designs are 15% and 51%, respectively, relative to the conventional diesel baseline. In addition, this article provides a detailed comparison and analysis of non-plug-in and plug-in hybrids based on component energy losses and internal combustion engine (ICE) operating points.

AbstractObjective To compare the effects of fractional CO2 laser and microablative fractional radiofrequency treatment with promestriene topical estrogen on sexual function and genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms. Methods This was a prospective randomized open-label clinical trial conducted with 62 postmenopausal women assigned to three intervention groups: a) topical promestriene for 90 days (n = 17); b) fractional CO2 laser treatment (n = 24); and c) microablative fractional radiofrequency treatment (n = 21). Each of the latter two groups underwent three treatment sessions at 4-week intervals. At baseline and at the end of the study, all participants had a gynecological examination that included vaginal pH measurement, and the completion of the Vaginal Symptom Score, the Vaginal Health Index, and the Female Sexual Function Index. For the energy treatment groups, adverse effects were evaluated after each session. Group homogeneity was assessed at baseline, and results were evaluated over time (from baseline to the end of treatment) and between groups over time. Results All baseline parameters were similar among studied groups. At the end of the study, all 3 treatments had produced similar effects: a reduction of vaginal pH, and an improvement of vulvovaginal symptoms (Vaginal Symptom Score and Vaginal Health Index scores) as well as sexual function (higher total Female Sexual Function Index, and in the desire, arousal, lubrication and pain domain scores), with no differences observed between groups. Side-effects were slight for both energy treatment groups, mainly represented by vaginal discharge. Conclusion The present study suggests that the two energy treatments were efficient along with promestriene at improving postmenopausal genitourinary and sexuality symptoms. Clinical trial identification number NCT04717245.

The accumulation of large amounts of steel slag (SS) and oil shale residue (OSR) causes serious pollution due to the lack of effective ways to utilize them. In this study, OSR, SS, and soda residue (SR) were used to synergistically prepare all-solid-waste low-carbon cemented backfill material (ALCCB). No cement and chemical additives were added to this material, and synergistic activation enabled full utilization of the solid wastes. The total solid waste utilization rate was 100%. The mechanical characteristics of the ALCCB and the heavy metal leaching rates were determined. The unconfined compression strength of the ALCCB after 28 days was 5.97 MPa, while the slump was 205 mm. These results met the performance requirements for a filling material. The leaching rates for the heavy metals after 28 days conformed to the guidelines for Class III groundwater quality. The mechanism underlying synergistic hydration of the solid wastes was analyzed at the micro- and macroscale with X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The results indicated that hydration of the ALCCB occurred continuously during curing, and the faster early hydration reaction stabilized heavy metal curing at 7 d. In addition, ALCCB offers greater economic and environmental advantages than cementitious materials. Notably, the economic and environmental benefits of ALCCB were found to supersede those of cement-based materials, with a cost reduction of 42.6% and a CO2 emission reduction of 86.9%. This innovative low-carbon mine backfill material effectively promotes the utilization of solid waste resources and supports sustainable development.

In this paper, the design and carbon credit evaluation of a grid-connected solar photovoltaic (SPV) power system for campus street light, a case study of the University of Uyo main campus at Nsukara Offot in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, is presented. The campus streetlight has a total path length of 3.45 km, a daily energy demand of 144.96 kWh with 1717.2 kWh/m2 yearly solar irradiation on the horizontal plane, and a mean ambient temperature of 24.9 °C. The SPV power system design and determination of the energy yield are done using PVSyst simulation software. The results show that the SPV has yearly energy yield of 51.6 MWh, with performance ratio of 76.9%. Also, a maximum energy yield of 5462 kWh occurred in the month of January, while the lowest energy yield of 3401 occurred in the month of July. Furthermore, the CO2 emission reduction value is 48.0912 tons per year, and this amounts to carbon credit of 1322.51 USD, which is equivalent to 1,005,106.08 Naira. In essence, over one million Naira carbon credit is realized by the installation of the grid-connected SPV power system for the campus streetlight.

Drought generally causes the significant reduction of vegetation productivity. Most studies focus on the vegetation response to gradual water variabilities instead of anomalies in water availability, however, the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation response to extreme water deficits during drought are still unclear. Here, based on leaf area index (LAI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), we employed coincidence analysis to identify the susceptibility and response time of vegetation productivity to drought, and further investigated the spatiotemporal changes of them during 2001-2021 across the globe. We found stronger susceptibility and shorter response time both in areas occupied by more grasses and in more arid regions. Temporally, we revealed a predominately increasing susceptibility (P < 0.05) and shortening response time (P < 0.05) in drought-sensitive regions from 2001 to 2021. These changes have been majorly attributable to the elevated atmospheric CO2, which tended to strengthen the susceptibility in areas covered by more grasses and in arid regions. Our finding highlighted the increasing risk of decline in vegetation production under drought particular in grasslands and drylands.

The growing interest in cycling as a means of urban transport has led to an increased focus on cyclist safety as a key aspect of urban planning and transport policy. Simulation studies conducted by the International Transport Forum have demonstrated that reductions in CO2 and other pollutants can be achieved in the context of urban transport, thus realising the goals of decarbonising road transport. The spread of modal transport in cities is a potential reality within the next decade. Bicycles play a significant role in this context. This article presents an analysis of data on accidents involving cyclists. National and international data were analysed to identify the main risk factors. The aim of the paper is to analyse the risk to cyclists with an attempt to identify and map the five biggest risks to cyclists in urban traffic. The aim of the research is to raise awareness of cyclist safety issues and to identify directions for further action to reduce accidents and improve overall road safety. The results of the conducted analyses indicate that the risk for cyclists in road traffic (including urban traffic) has been on a noticeable downward trend over the past five to ten years. This trend allows for the mapping of the most significant types/risks in cycling in urban environments, thereby enabling the implementation of risk management strategies based on the method of risk mapping.

Hydrophobization of nanotextured catalyst materials is a promising route to enhance the yield of N2 and CO2 conversion into green fuels. However, these applications require a hydrophobic coating to not only promote air trapping but also allow charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface. In this work, nano thin films with thicknesses as low as 7 nm were deposited from the plasma phase of perfluorohexene, perfluorodecene, and perfluorooctane (PFO) precursors using a mild vacuum and gentle powers. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization reveal that the resulting films are conformal and hydrophobic thanks to a good retention of CF2 and CF3 moieties. The PFO films exhibited the highest water contact angle and achieved superhydrophobic states when deposited on top of re-entrant nano features, an indication of successful air trapping. Electrochemical studies further demonstrated that the plasma-deposited PFO films allow charge transfer but could only sustain repeated cyclic voltammetry cycles without losing their hydrophobicity when deposited under optimal conditions. This result indicates that plasma deposition could become a viable route for the hydrophobization of electrocatalysts required to enhance the yield of poorly soluble gas reduction reactions.

Abstract. A natural plankton community from oligotrophic subtropical waters of the Atlantic near Gran Canaria, Spain, was subjected to varying degrees of ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) to assess the potential physiological effects, in the context of the application of ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques. We employed 8.3 m3 mesocosms with a sediment trap attached to the bottom, creating a gradient in total alkalinity (TA). The lowest point on this gradient was 2400 μmol · L-1, which corresponded to the natural alkalinity of the environment, and the highest point was 4800 μmol · L-1. Over the course of the 33-day experiment, the plankton community exhibited two distinct phases. In phase-I (days 5–20), a notable decline in the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) was observed. This change was accompanied by substantial reductions in the abundances of picoeukaryotes, small size nanoeukaryotes (nanoeukaryotes-1), and microplankton. The cell viability of picoeukaryotes, as indicated by fluorescein-di-acetate hydrolysis by cellular esterases (FDA- green fluorescence), slightly increased by the end of phase-I whilst the viability of nanoeukaryotes 1 and Synechococcus spp . did not change. Reactive oxygen species levels (ROS-green fluorescence) showed no significant changes for any of the functional groups. In contrast, in phase-II (days 21–33), a pronounced community response was observed. Increases in Fv/Fm in the intermediate OAE treatments of ∆900 to ∆1800 μmol · L-1  and in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chlorophyll-c2 (Chl-c2) , fucoxanthin and divinyl-Chl-a were attributed to the emergence of blooms of large size nanoeukaryotes (nanoeukaryotes-2) from the genera Chrysochromulina, as well as picoeukaryotes. Synechococcus spp. also flourished towards the end of this phase. In parallel, we observed a total 20 % significant change in the metaproteome of the phytoplankton community. This is considered a significant alteration in protein expression, having substantial impacts on cellular functions and the physiology of the organisms. Medium levels of ∆TA showed more upregulated and less downregulated proteins than higher ∆TA treatments. Under these conditions, cell viability significantly increased in pico and nanoeukaryotes-1 in intermediate alkalinity levels, while in Synechococcus spp., nanoeukaryotes-2 and microplankton remained stable. ROS levels did not significantly change in any functional group. The pigment ratios DD+DT : FUCO, and DD+DT : Chl-a increased in medium ∆TA treatments, supporting the idea of nutrient deficiency alleviation and the absence of physiological stress. Taken all data together, this study shows that there is minimal evidence indicating a harmful impact of high alkalinity on the plankton community. The OAE treatments did not result in physiological fitness impairment, thus OAE did not cause cellular stress in the phytoplankton community studied.

ABSTRAKPembangkit Listrik Tenaga Uap Batu bara menghasilkan zat SO2, CO2, NO2, dan partikel yang merupakan emisi dari proses pembakarannya. Emisi tersebut menyebabkan peningkatan efek pemanasan global, kerusakan lingkungan, dan merusak kesehatan. Dikarenakan pembangkit batu bara masih banyak digunakan di Indonesia maka Economic Emission Dispatch yang dikombinasikan dengan algoritma Whale Optimization Algorithm menjadi solusi dalam pengurangan emisi pembangkit listrik. Dengan cara memasukkan nilai weighted sum pada fungsi biaya dan emisi agar dapat dilihat pembangkit mana yang memiliki kadar emisi lebih rendah untuk memenuhi beban listrik yang dibutuhkan. Pada simulasi tersebut didapatkan pengurangan kadar emisi sebesar 12,73% dibandingkan tanpa menggunakan weighted sum dengan algortima WOA. Hal ini mampu untuk membantu program pemerintah dalam mengurangi emisi karbon agar tidak melebihi standar emisi yang telah ditetapkan sesuai dengan Peraturan Menteri Nomor P.15/MENLHK/SETJEN/KUM.1/4/2019.Kata kunci: PLTU batu bara, emisi, EED, WOA, weighted sum ABSTRACTCoal-fired power plants produce SO2, CO2, NO2, and particulate matter as emissions from the combustion process. These emissions cause increased global warming effects, environmental damage, and damage to health. coal plants are still widely used in Indonesia, Economic Emission Dispatch combined with the Whale Optimization Algorithm is a solution for reducing power plant emissions. By entering the weighted sum value in the cost and emission functions, it can be seen which plants have lower emission levels to meet the required electricity load. The simulation obtained a reduction in emission levels of 12.73% compared to not using weighted sum with the WOA algorithm. This method is able to help government programs in reducing carbon emissions so as not to exceed the emission standards that have been set in accordance with Peraturan Menteri Nomor P.15/MENLHK/SETJEN/ KUM.1/4/2019.Keywords: coal power plant, emission, EED, WOA, weighted sum

Accumulation of geogenic phosphorus (P) in groundwater is an emerging environmental concern, which is closely linked to coupled processes involving FeOOH and organic matter under methanogenic conditions. However, it remains unclear how P enrichment is associated with methane cycling, particularly the anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO). This study conducted a comprehensive investigation of carbon isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, and CH4, alongside Fe isotopes, microbial communities, and functions in quaternary aquifers of the central Yangtze River plain. The study found that P concentrations tended to increase with Fe(II) concentrations, δ56Fe, and δ13C-DIC, suggesting P accumulation due to the reductive dissolution of FeOOH under methanogenic conditions. The positive correlations of pmoA gene abundance versus δ13C–CH4 and Fe concentrations versus δ13C–CH4, and the prevalent presence of Candidatus_Methanoperedens, jointly demonstrated the potential significance of Fe(III)-mediated AMO process (Fe-AMO) alongside traditional methanogenesis. The increase of P concentration with δ13C–CH4 value, pmoA gene abundance, and Fe concentration suggested that the Fe-AMO process facilitated P enrichment in groundwater. Redundancy analysis confirmed this assertion, identifying P concentration as the primary determinant and the cooperative influence of Fe-AMO microorganisms such as Candidatus_Methanoperedens and Geobacter on P enrichment. Our work provided new insights into P dynamics in subsurface environments.

Regulating the binding energy between the catalysts and reaction intermediate species is crucial for electrocatalytic processes. As according to the Sabatier principle, excessively strong binding energies can be detrimental. The presence of oxygen vacancy defects is beneficial, leading to a relatively lower binding energy. In this study, ZnO catalysts with varying oxygen vacancy contents were successfully synthesized with different solvents and hydrothermal treatment temperatures. The oxygen vacancy content of prepared samples was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, while the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) experiments were performed in a flow cell. A proportional relationship was observed between the CO production rate and oxygen vacancy content. As a result, the catalyst with a hydrothermal temperature of 180 °C for 3 h (ZnO-EG-180-3) exhibited the highest oxygen vacancy content, accompanied by a high CO yield. The sample was stable in CO2RR for over 50 h at a constant current of 150 mA, maintaining a stable CO faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 90%, and the CO yield was more than 2625 μmol·h–1·cm–2, while lower than 10% for H2. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the presence of oxygen vacancies in ZnO catalysts reduces the binding energy of the *CO intermediate, facilitating *CO desorption, mitigating the poisoning effect of *CO on active sites, and promoting the generation of CO generation.

The silicon nanosheet/carbon composite emerges as a promising anode material for the next-generation commercial lithium-ion batteries. However, complex, costly, and energy-intensive synthesis procedures impede its practical application. Herein, the carbon-coated silicon nanosheets (Si/C) have been successfully synthesized via a one-pot strategy, involving a modified magnesiothermic reduction of talc followed by a reaction with CO2. The distinct chemical composition and layered nanostructure of talc enable the retention of Si nanosheets during exothermic reactions without additional templates or heat absorbents. The method shows significant potential for the scalable production of Si/C owing to the abundant silicon source, sustainable carbon source, and straightforward protocol. The resulting Si/C displays a hierarchical porous structure, with both macropores and mesopores, and an interconnected network of carbon-coated Si nanosheets. These structural characteristics facilitate rapid Li+ diffusion and enable the material to accommodate the lithiation-induced mechanical strains. As a result, the Si/C electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance, including a remarkable rate capability (with a specific capacity of 1220 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1) and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88%. The work opens a new avenue for the development of Si/C composites from natural clay minerals through an economical and scalable strategy, which would contribute to the practical application of advanced Si-based anodes in lithium-ion batteries.

In this study, a nitrogen/oxygen co-doped carbon fiber cloth with a hierarchical porous structure was synthesized by one-step carbonization and in situ activation method and acted as binder-free electrode materials for supercapacitors. Cotton fiber cloth served as the carbon precursor, while molecular dispersed CaCl2·6H2O and urea functioned as activator and N dopant, respectively. The influence of molar concentration of CaCl2·6H2O and urea on the microstructure and capacitive performance of the resulting products were investigated. CaCl2·6H2O has an expansion effect on pores, resulting in reduction of micropores. Hence, the specific surface area of the resulting porous carbon increased first and then decreased with the increase of CaCl2·6H2O concentration. In addition, the erosion of NH3 and CO2 (produced by the decomposition of urea) at high temperature on the surface of the samples promoted the formation of porous structure. Urea plays the dual role of doping and activation agent. The morphology and structure analysis shown that the activated samples exhibited hierarchical pore structure, large specific surface area, and high heteroatom content. The optimal sample NAC-20 exhibited good capacitive performance, including high specific capacitance of 260.9 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and good rate performance. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor exhibited a maximum energy density and power density of 16.2 Wh kg−1 and 19.0 kW kg−1, respectively, in 6 M KOH electrolyte. In this work, a green, low-cost molten salt activation method was proposed to synthesis biomass derived porous carbon materials for energy storage devices.

Tumor hypoxia induces the production of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1 alpha, which interacts with NF-kB, leading to cancer proliferation and metastasis. This study investigated the effect of tumor hypoxia modulation using carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2) and nicotinamide on reducing soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with tissue overexpression of HIF-1α ≥10%.A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at Dr. Kariadi Hospital in Semarang, Indonesia, from 2021 to 2022. Newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with tissue HIF-1α ≥10% were randomized into an intervention group (nicotinamide 2,000 mg + carbogen 10 liters/min during R-CHOP) and a control group (R-CHOP alone) for one cycle. sIL-2R levels were measured in the blood before and after intervention.The intervention group showed a significant reduction in sIL-2R levels after chemotherapy (p=0.026), with 85% of samples exhibiting a decrease. In contrast, only 45% of samples in the control group demonstrated a decrease in sIL-2R levels (p=0.184). The median sIL-2R level decreased from 139.50 pg/mL to 70.50 pg/mL in the intervention group, while the control group exhibited an increase from 182.50 pg/mL to 250.00 pg/mL following one cycle of chemotherapy.Tumor hypoxia modulation led to a significant decrease in serum sIL-2R levels, potentially through improvements in the crosstalk between hypoxia and inflammation pathways.

Solar driven cooling system is a promising and sustainable substitute for conventional cooling systems to soften the impact of energy deficit and environmental degradation. In this study, a solar hybrid cooling system for an institutional building is investigated, which combines solar photovoltaic (PV) technology with traditional vapor compression systems and/or absorption cooling systems. The performance of the proposed solar hybrid cooling system is simulated and compared at four (04) locations in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region: Riyadh (Saudia Arabia), Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Doha (Qatar), and Jaww (Bahrain), with different cooling system configurations from technical, economic, and environmental standpoints. The simulation findings show that the solar driven absorption chiller reduces the maximum CO2 emissions by 42.7% in Riyadh, while the solar driven compressor system gives a maximum Greenhouse gas emissions reduction (99.1%) for the location of Dubai. To determine the most practical design in terms of economics, metrics such as net present value, payback, and benefit–cost ratio (BCR) and several cooling scenarios are also rigorously studied. According to model findings, the solar absorption cooling system presented the most feasible scenario with the shortest payback of 5.8 years, the highest internal rate of return (IRR) of 38.8%, and BCR of 5.4% for the location of Dubai, and the same trend holds for all other locations. Conversely, the solar-powered vapor compression system was the least suitable option for Riyadh city, with the longest payback period of 21.9 years, the lowest IRR of 2.4, and a BCR of −0.06. In addition, optimization results show that ground mounted PV systems outperform building integrated PV (BIPV) systems owing to their higher capacity factor: 21% in case of PV and 12.8% in case of BIPV systems.

Abstract In this paper, the impact of different input variables on the performance and emission features of a pongamia pinnata and rapeseed oil biodiesel with n-Butanol additive were investigated, statistically analyzed, and optimized by employing the powerful response surface methodology (RSM) based design of experiment (DOE) techniques. The vegetable oils (pongamia pinnata and rapeseed oils) were transesterified and their corresponding methyl esters were blended with diesel and n-Butanol at blend ratios 10:84:6, 10:78:12, 20:74:6 and 20:68:12. The samples were tested on a direct injection CI engine at a rated speed of 1500 rpm and standard CR of 17.5:1 at different loads. In each test, performance and emission parameters were measured. Expert machine learning (ML) methods were used to forecast these features. In addition, polynomial equations were developed for each blend using regression techniques and compared with an artificial intelligence technique. It was observed that the engine performance increased as biodiesel and additive weight percentage increased. Regardless of the loads placed on the engine and the blend ratios, the use of PPME and RSME combined with n-Butanol blends demonstrated a clear decrease in NOx compared to diesel (7.07% for P20B12 and 6.58% for R20B12). As per the trend, it is seen that the percentage reduction in CO2 emissions is greater with high percentage increase of n-Butanol in the tested sample irrespective of loads applied on the engine (2.95% more P20B12 for as compared to P20B6). For the emission characteristics, ANN demonstrated a range of 87.92% to 98.83% prediction accuracy while that of regression varies from 81.4% to 98.8% for all the samples of PPME blended biodiesel.

Abstract In the Mediterranean region, a reduction of annual precipitation and a longer and drier summer season are expected with climate change by the end of the century eventually endangering forest survival. To cope with such rapid change, trees may modulate their morpho-anatomical and physiological traits. In the present study, we focused on the variation in leaf gas exchange and different leaf morpho-anatomical functional traits of Quercus pubescens Willd. in summer using a long-term drought experiment in natura consisting of a dynamic rainfall exclusion system where trees have been submitted to amplified drought (AD) (~ −30% of annual precipitation) since April 2012 and compared to trees under natural drought (ND) in a Mediterranean forest. During the study, we analyzed net CO2 assimilation (An), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), water use efficiency (WUE), stomatal size and density, density of glandular trichomes and non-glandular trichomes, thickness of the different leaf tissues, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf surface. Under AD, tree functioning was slightly impacted, since only An exhibited a 49% drop, while gs, E and WUE remained stable. The decrease in An under AD was regulated by concomitant lower stomatal density and reduced leaf thickness. Trees under AD also featured leaves with a higher non-glandular trichome density and a lower glandular trichome density compared to ND, which simultaneously limits transpiration and production costs. This study points out that Q. pubescens exhibits adjustments of leaf morpho-anatomical traits which can help trees to acclimate to amplified drought scenarios as those expected in the future in the Mediterranean region.

This paper presents a review of the trends and geographic variation of impacts of reactive nitrogen (N) inputs on in Europe through impacts on air, soil and water quality. It illustrates those impacts, by assessing temporal and spatial variation in air, soil and water quality indicators and their exceedances of critical thresholds in view of impacts on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, during 1990-2019. Trends are derived from regular inventory and monitoring data and from simulated trends in air quality using the EMEP model. Well quantified adverse impacts of increased N use are: (i) the effects on human health due to increased tropospheric concentrations of NOx and ozone, and N-induced increases in fine particulate matter, (ii) the contribution of N2O to climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion, (iii) the loss of plant and faunal diversity both in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems via direct and soil mediated impacts, (iv) the acidification of forest soils, with impacts on tree forest nutrition, tree growth and tree vitality, and (v) the eutrophication of marine ecosystems, and associated biodiversity loss and occurrence of harmful algae blooms. Over the period 1990-2019, N inputs to agriculture stayed relatively constant, but the emissions of ammonia (NH3) decreased by 27%, while emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) decreased by 57%. In response to those reductions, concentrations of NOx, and of N in particulate matter also declined, although less than 50%. In contrast, the reduction in NOx-induced ozone concentrations and ozone related indicators (AOT40, SOMO35 and POD) was much less (ca 15-20%). Exceedances of critical ozone concentrations for human health and of critical AOT40 and POD vales for vegetation reduced in a similar order of magnitude. Despite decreasing NH3 emissions, NH3 concentrations showed a slight and steady increase from 1995 onwards, due to the large reduction in SOx emissions. Nitrogen deposition and exceedances of critical N loads for terrestrial ecosystems decreased by ca 60%, but the area exceeding critical N loads only reduced by ca 10%. Unlike N, the area exceeding critical acid loads has declined by more than 90% due to high reduction in SOx and NOx emissions. Trends in nitrate (NO3) concentrations in groundwater varied across Europe, but showed overall limited changes over the last two decades. However, N concentrations in surface water and the area exceeding critical levels in view of aquatic biodiversity has decreased and the same holds for N concentrations in coastal regions. Nevertheless, the eutrophication condition of coastal waters has overall not improved due to adverse impacts of elevated phosphorus inputs. Finally the negative impacts of N induced N2O emissions on climate are estimated to be outweighed by the positive effects of N induced CO2 sequestration, mainly in forests, and this holds for the whole period 1990-2019. Nitrogen hotspots, being areas with high exceedances in critical levels and loads of N compounds in air and water, are concentrated in intensive agricultural areas with high livestock densities and in urban region with strong industrial and traffic activities. Cost-benefit analysis shows that environmental costs of reactive N release to the environment are substantial and tend to exceed the direct economic benefits for agriculture. Given the relevance of N for safeguarding food production it is key to develop integrated and targeted plant nutrition strategies following a food system approach and practices that minimize trade-offs between productivity and the environment. In addition, targeted strategies to further reduce NOx emissions are needed to reduce air quality related health and biodiversity impacts.

A quantitative analysis of the most cited articles published in the Scopus scientometric database by 2023 is carried out. It is shown that most of the publications, the object of study of which are "green" structures, focus on the study of "green" roofs. It is shown that since 1981, the number of studies on green roofs has been steadily increasing: approximately 45% of articles focus on the benefits in terms of thermal impact and thermal insulation, 18% on rainwater drainage, 15% on air quality, 5% on the noise-absorbing properties of green roofs, and 17% on the costs of building and operating green roofs, recreational facilities, fire protection, and other related issues. The requirements and commonly used materials for a standard green roof are described, as well as the percentage of scientific publications, depending on the functions and layers of green roof construction involved. An analysis of the most cited scientific studies on the impact of green roof systems on wastewater quality was conducted. It is shown that the results of the studies presented in these publications indicate the need for further study of the impact of a "green" roof on the amount of pollution in the water flowing from its surface. It is emphasized that further research should focus on the structural layers of the roof (thickness and materials used), namely the thickness and types of substrate layers, as well as on the conditions of plant care (e.g., fertilization), especially on intensive green roofs. In addition, it should be studied and analyzed how the retention of rainwater by plants and the soil layer of a green roof affects the relative humidity of the air near the building during periods without rain. The most cited scientific studies on the reduction of air pollutants by means of green roofs are analyzed. It is concluded that future research should focus on the study of plant species that are well adapted to growing on roofs (in temperate climates) and most effectively carry out the process of photosynthesis, absorbing CO2 and releasing O2 into the atmosphere around the building. The article analyzes the most cited scientific publications on the noise-absorbing properties of green roofs. It is substantiated that it is necessary to maximize the percentage of green roofs implementation on all buildings and structures in the city so that green roofs can significantly affect the quality of the environment in urbanized areas.

The preparation of polymer composites that incorporate material of a biogenic nature in the polymer matrices may lead to a reduction in fossil polymer consumption and a potentially higher biodegradability. Furthermore, microalgae biomass as biogenic filler has the advantage of fast growth and high tolerance to different types of culture media with higher production yields than those provided by the biomass of terrestrial crops. On the other hand, algal biomass can be a secondary product in wastewater treatment processes. For the present study, an SBS polymer composite (SBSC) containing 25% (w/w) copolymer SBS1 (linear copolymer: 30% styrene and 70% butadiene), 50% (w/w) copolymer SBS2 (linear copolymer: 40% styrene and 60% butadiene), and 25% (w/w) paraffin oil was prepared. Arthrospira platensis biomass (moisture content 6.0 ± 0.5%) was incorporated into the SBSC in 5, 10, 20, and 30% (w/w) ratios to obtain polymer composites with spirulina biomass. For the biodegradation studies, the ISO 14855-1:2012(E) standard was applied, with slight changes, as per the specificity of our experiments. The degradation of the studied materials was followed by quantitatively monitoring the CO2 resulting from the degradation process and captured by absorption in NaOH solution 0.5 mol/L. The structural and morphological changes induced by the industrial composting test on the materials were followed by physical–mechanical, FTIR, SEM, and DSC analysis. The obtained results were compared to create a picture of the material transformation during the composting period. Thus, the collected data indicate two biodegradation processes, of the polymer and the biomass, which take place at the same time at different rates, which influence each other. On the other hand, it is found that the material becomes less ordered, with a sponge-like morphology; the increase in the percentage of biomass leads to an advanced degree of degradation of the material. The FTIR analysis data suggest the possibility of the formation of peptide bonds between the aromatic nuclei in the styrene block and the molecular residues resulting from biomass biodegradation. It seems that in industrial composting conditions, the area of the polystyrene blocks from the SBS-based composite is preferentially transformed in the process.

Preliminary studies suggest that moderate ARDS and acute renal failure might benefit from extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) coupled with CRRT. However, evidence is limited and potential for this coupled treatment may need to be explored. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a protective driving pressure was obtained applying low-flow ECCO2-R plus CRRT in patients affected by moderate ARDS with COVID-19 compared to an historical group without COVID-19.A case-control study has been conducted comparing a group of consecutive moderate ARDS patients presenting AKI and affected by COVID-19, who needed low-flow ECCO2-R plus CRRT to achieve an ultra-protective ventilatory strategy, with historical group without COVID-19 that matched for clinical presentation and underwent the same ultra-protective treatment. VT was set at 6 mL/kg predicted body weight then ECCO2R was assessed to facilitate ultra-protective low VT ventilation to preserve safe Pplat and low driving pressure.ECCO2R+CRRT reduced the driving pressure from 17 (14-18) to 11.5 (10-15) cmH2O (p<0.0004) in the fourteen ARDS patients by decreasing VT from 6.7 ml/kg PBW (6.1-6.9) to 5.1 (4.2-5.6) after 1 hour (p <0.0001). In the ARDS patients with COVID-19, the driving pressure reduction was more effective from baseline 18 (14-24) cmH2O to 11 (10-15) cmH2O (p<0.004), compared to the control group from 15 (13-17) to 12(10-16) cmH2O (p< 0.03), after one hour. ECCO2R+CRRT did not affected 28 days mortality in the two groups, while we observed a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (19 {7-29} vs 24 {22-38} days; p=0.24) and ICU length of stay (19 {7-29} vs 24 {22-78} days; p=0.25) in moderate ARDS patients with COVID-19 compared to control group.In moderate ARDS patients with or without COVID-19 disease, ECCO2R+CRRT may be and effective supportive treatment to reach protective values of driving pressure unless severe oxygenation defects arise requiring ECMO therapy initiation.

Abstract Background/Aims Activated CD4+T cells make a significant contribution to inflammation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. CD4+T cells can also express activating NK receptors such as NKG2D that can engage with stress-induced ligands such as MICA, as noted in lupus nephritis, and mediate nonspecific tissue injury. We know that cellular metabolism regulates the activation of T cells. Evidence from patients with multiple sclerosis indicates that dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an electrophile, targets cellular metabolism to modulate CD4+T cell activation and function. Here, we investigated whether DMF modulates T cell metabolism and function in samples from patients with SLE in a series of in vitro experiments. Methods All experiments were performed using isolated T cells from freshly drawn whole blood samples from patients with SLE. T cells were isolated using negative selection using stem cell or Miltenyei magnetic bead separation kit. Isolated T cells were activated with anti-CD3 and IL-2 and incubated with either DMF at 25μM concentration or DMSO alone for three or seven days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before harvesting. Results In Seahorse experiments, after three days of incubation, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) inhibited Figure A-i) the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and A-ii) extra cellular acidification rate (ECAR) in isolated T cells when compared with samples incubated with vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Our results revealed that DMF significantly inhibited: 1) aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in activated T cells from patients with SLE (n = 4) (Figure A- i and ii) in vitro; 2) T cell activation and proliferation as assessed by a reduction in the frequency of CD69 (n = 4) and D) Ki67 (n = 2) positivity, respectively (Figure B-E); 3) Collectively, these results suggest that DMF inhibits T cell activation and proliferation in samples from patients with SLE. After 7 days of incubation, DMF significantly inhibited the expression of activating NK receptors CD158a and NKG2D on T cells whereas there was a trend toward enhancing the expression of inhibitory NK receptors NKG2A and CD158b (Figure F-I). After 7 days of incubation, DMF significantly reduced intracellular expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17 and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in supernatants (Figure J - N). Conclusion Our preliminary data indicated that, in SLE patient samples, DMF modulates metabolic programming of CD4+ T cells and inhibits glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation of activated CD4+ T cells. In vitro, DMF inhibited: T cell activation; proliferation; the expression of activating NK receptors; and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from T cells patients with SLE. Taken together with the existing safety data in humans, these data provide mechanistic rationale for investigating the potential of dimethyl fumarate, with a distinct mechanism of action, as a novel therapy for SLE.

<p><strong>Climate change is causing rapid changes in reef structure, biodiversity, and function as a response to ocean warming and acidification. The negative impacts of climate change on corals are well-documented, but most sponges are predicted to tolerate conditions projected for 2100, making them a viable option for stable alternative reef states. Sponges maintain an intimate relationship with microbial communities, whose general stability in a given sponge species makes them suitable indicators of host responses to stressful environmental conditions such as ocean warming and acidification. The overall aim of this thesis is to examine the impacts of climate change on sponges and their associated microbial communities, with a focus on microbial community composition and abundance and sponge protein expression.</strong></p><p>The first data chapter examines the results from a reciprocal transplantation of the coral reef sponges Coelocarteria singaporensis and Stylissa cf. flabelliformis between a control reef site and an adjacent CO2 vent site in Papua New Guinea to explore how the sponge microbiome responds to ocean acidification in situ. Microbial communities of C. singaporensis, which differed initially between sites, did not shift towards characteristic control or vent microbiomes. Microbial communities of S. cf. flabelliformis, which were initially stable between sites, did not respond specifically to transplantation but collectively exhibited a significant change over time, with a relative increase in Thaumarchaeota and decrease in Proteobacteria in all treatment groups. The lack of a community shift upon transplantation to the vent site suggests that microbial flexibility, at least in the adult life-history stage, does not necessarily underpin host survival under ocean acidification.</p><p>The second data chapter compares the symbiotic microbial community composition of tropical sponge Stylissa flabelliformis after an eight-week exposure to nine different treatments of three temperatures (28.5 °C, 30 °C, 31.5 °C) and three pH levels (8.1, 7.8, 7.6) based on ambient conditions and two IPCC predictions of future ocean conditions (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). Bacterial communities differed significantly between temperature treatments, but not pH, with the highest temperature treatments showing increased relative abundances of Bacteroidia and Clostridia (commonly associated with sponge disease and thermal stress), and decreased relative abundances of Nitrospira (associated with nitrogen cycling). Similarly, archaeal communities differed significantly across temperature, with a relative decrease in Nitrososphaeria (associated with ammonia oxidation). Symbiotic eukaryotes were compared using three different reference databases and only two treatments (28.5 °C, pH 8.1 and 31.5 °C, pH 7.6) and exhibited a significant difference in community composition between the two treatments, but also highlighted the requirement for more thorough reference databases. Overall, there was a clear change with temperature across all three microbial groups, indicating increased stress and potential hindrance of nutrient cycling.</p><p>The third data chapter aims to determine the impact of temperature and pH on the abundance and spatial arrangement of sponge-associated microbes using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Total bacterial abundance was not significantly different across temperature or pH, but was unexpectedly high in sponge replicates with notable algal growth and tissue necrosis. Archaea differed significantly with temperature, decreasing in abundance with increasing temperature, but exhibited no changes due to pH. FISH was largely unsuccessful, due primarily to high sponge autofluorescence and a very low concentration of archaea in the sponge tissue (as shown with ddPCR). Regardless, shifts in bacterial abundance with reduced sponge health and archaeal abundance with temperature show signs of stress and potential functional implications.</p><p>The fourth data chapter uses proteomic analysis to examine shifts in protein expression due to temperature and pH. High-temperature treatments exhibited an increased expression of proteins associated with heat shock and a decreased expression of proteins associated with oxidative stress, actin-related processes, and smooth muscle contraction in comparison to low-temperature treatments. The comparison of high- and low-pH treatments resulted in only two significant and annotated proteins associated with biological processes. Oxidation stress exhibited higher expression at pH 7.6 while smooth muscle contraction exhibited lower expression at pH 7.6. Overall, a decrease in the expression of important functions such as reduction of oxidative stress and smooth muscle contraction indicate negative impacts of thermal stress on S. flabelliformis.</p><p>Overall, sponges are expected to be more resilient under climate change conditions than calcifying organisms such as corals. Although low pH produced little response in the sponge holobiont, S. flabelliformis exhibits a temperature threshold of approximately 31.5 °C. At this temperature, microbial community composition and protein expression shift with negative implications for the functional roles of sponges.</p>

Full text Figures and data Peer review Side by side Abstract Editor's evaluation Introduction Methods Results Discussion Data availability References Article and author information Metrics Abstract Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients experience immune compromise characterized by complex alterations of both innate and adaptive immunity, and results in higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination. This immune compromise, coupled with greater risk of exposure to infectious disease at hemodialysis (HD) centers, underscores the need for examination of the immune response to the COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines. Methods: The immune response to the COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was assessed in 20 HD patients and cohort-matched controls. RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed longitudinally before and after each vaccination dose for a total of six time points per subject. Anti-spike antibody levels were quantified prior to the first vaccination dose (V1D0) and 7 d after the second dose (V2D7) using anti-spike IgG titers and antibody neutralization assays. Anti-spike IgG titers were additionally quantified 6 mo after initial vaccination. Clinical history and lab values in HD patients were obtained to identify predictors of vaccination response. Results: Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated differing time courses of immune responses, with prolonged myeloid cell activity in HD at 1 wk after the first vaccination dose. HD also demonstrated decreased metabolic activity and decreased antigen presentation compared to controls after the second vaccination dose. Anti-spike IgG titers and neutralizing function were substantially elevated in both controls and HD at V2D7, with a small but significant reduction in titers in HD groups (p<0.05). Anti-spike IgG remained elevated above baseline at 6 mo in both subject groups. Anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 were highly predictive of 6-month titer levels. Transcriptomic biomarkers after the second vaccination dose and clinical biomarkers including ferritin levels were found to be predictive of antibody development. Conclusions: Overall, we demonstrate differing time courses of immune responses to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in maintenance HD subjects comparable to healthy controls and identify transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG titers in HD. Analyzing vaccination as an in vivo perturbation, our results warrant further characterization of the immune dysregulation of ESRD. Funding: F30HD102093, F30HL151182, T32HL144909, R01HL138628. This research has been funded by the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) award UL1TR002003. Editor's evaluation Chang et al. demonstrate through their findings that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination of hemodialysis patients produces no significant difference in antibody levels achieved across the vaccination series. However, they find that T-cell responses may be delayed in hemodialysis patients as they have lower activation of T-cell genes than healthy controls. The RNA sequencing evidence is solid. However, they lack data on a clinical correlation to T-cell responses. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83641.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most advanced stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with prevalence in the United States reaching 809,000 in 2019 (Johansen et al., 2022). The most used form of renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients in the United States is hemodialysis (HD). Despite significant improvements in HD technology, the mortality rate in ESRD patients is still as high as 20% annually (Williams et al., 2004), with infections being the most common cause of hospitalization and mortality after cardiovascular disease (Kato et al., 2008). The immunocompromised state of ESRD is characterized by simultaneous immunodepression due to the impact of uremic milieu on immunocompetent cells and immunoactivation due to the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines (Kato et al., 2008). There are alterations to both innate and adaptive immunity, including elevated levels of mannose-binding lectin (Satomura et al., 2002), impaired maturation of monocytes and dendritic cells (Satomura et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2007), increased B cell apoptosis (Fernández-Fresnedo et al., 2000), and decreased T-cell proliferation with elevated Th1/Th2 ratio (Stenvinkel et al., 2005). Studies of genome-wide expression (i.e., transcriptome) profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ESRD demonstrate a complex picture of immune alterations. One study found upregulation of genes involved in the complement and oxidative metabolism pathways, and downregulation of genes associated with the clathrin-coated vesicle endosomal pathway and T-cell receptor signaling (Scherer et al., 2013). Two other studies have demonstrated impaired expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function (Granata et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2002). A study identifying a group of inflammatory genes playing a causative role in oxidative stress in dialysis patients showed unique gene expression alterations in maintenance HD patients compared to un-dialyzed CKD patients and compared to patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (Zaza et al., 2008). These studies indicate a range of immune pathways that may impair vaccination response, and further suggest that dialysis leads to unique immune profile alterations. These alterations may lead to higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination (Ghadiani et al., 2012). For example, while more than 90% of patients without CKD develop protective antibodies against HBV after vaccination, only 50–60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert. There have also been higher vaccination failure rates demonstrated against influenza virus, Clostridium tetani, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae in ESRD (Eleftheriadis et al., 2007). Understanding the immune response to vaccines in ESRD is particularly important for the new mRNA vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have proven to be efficacious in non-immunocompromised individuals, with initial reports showing 95 and 94.1% reduction of COVID-19 disease in recipients (Baden et al., 2021; Polack et al., 2020). However, certain immunosuppressed populations remain at risk of infection. Given the widespread transmission of COVID-19, detailed assessments of degree, duration, and determinants of immune protection conferred by these vaccines are vitally needed in immunocompromised patient populations including those with ESRD. While recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 BTN162b2 vaccine in HD demonstrate high levels of seroconversion ranging from 84 to 96% (Grupper et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021; Attias et al., 2021; Anand et al., 2021), they also demonstrate quantitatively reduced SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We posit that characterization of the transcriptomic underpinnings of antibody titer development on a continuous scale may identify biomarkers for weaker or less durable immune protection in this population. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses may identify strategies for the development of new, effective vaccines against other infectious diseases for this population. Thus, we characterized the immune response of the HD population to the COVID-19 mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine using mRNA sequencing, anti-spike antibody ELISA, and neutralization titers across multiple time points. We then integrated these data to identify transcriptomic and clinical determinants of the humoral immune response in HD patients. Methods Study population and sample acquisition The study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago IRB (#2018-1038) Ethics Review Committee. Maintenance HD patients undergoing vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021 were recruited from the outpatient HD unit at the University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) in Chicago, IL. Control subjects consisted of UIH employees undergoing BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination at UIH from December 2020 to January 2021 with no self-reported history of kidney disease or immune disorders. All subjects provided informed consent for participation in this research and for publication of results. A subset of control subjects matched for age, gender, and COVID-19 history was also analyzed for this study. Blood was collected at 0–48 hr prior to and at multiple time points after both the first (V1) and second vaccination doses (V2), which were administered 3 wk apart. Control samples were collected prior to each vaccination dose (D0) and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7. Blood was collected from HD subjects prior to each vaccination dose and at 2 d (D2) and 7 d after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D2, V1D7, V2D0, V2D2, and V2D7. A final blood sample was drawn 6 mo after initial vaccination (M6) for measurement of antibody titers, prior to additional vaccination doses. Serum and PBMCs were extracted within 2 hr of blood collection, then stored at –80°C. PBMCs were extracted using density gradient centrifugation at 400 × g with Ficoll–Paque PLUS. The extracted buffy coat was stored in RNAlater (Invitrogen). Clinical and demographic characterization Demographic and clinical data was collected from the electronic health record (EHR) for HD subjects, including medical diagnoses, medications, and laboratory values. Laboratory values included monthly SARS-CoV-2 test results, as well as urea reduction ratio (URR, a measure of dialysis adequacy), hemoglobin (Hgb), ferritin, transferrin saturation, albumin levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, and WBC differential counts obtained during standard of care monthly blood draws for the 3 mo preceding vaccination. Within our analyses, ferritin was coded as either low risk (200–1200 ng/ml) or high risk (<200 or >1200 ng/ml) since ferritin levels 200–1200 ng/ml have been shown to be associated with lowest all-cause mortality in HD patients (Kalantar-Zadeh et al., 2005). Baseline clinical lab values were calculated as the median of three lab values across the 3 mo prior to vaccination. Demographic and clinical data was collected from a medical questionnaire at time of consent for control subjects, and included medical history, medications, and self-reported prior SARS-CoV-2-positive test results. RNA extraction and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) RNA sequencing was performed on PBMCs at all V1 and V2 time points for all subjects for whom RNA libraries were successfully built at >5 time points. PBMCs stored in RNAlater were thawed and diluted 1:1 with 1× phosphate buffered saline. The mixture was then pelleted and RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini kit (Invitrogen). DNase treatment to remove genomic DNA contamination was performed using either the PureLink DNase kit or DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Invitrogen). Purified RNA in sterile water was stored at –80°C. Each RNA sample was quantified using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity kit (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer RNA Pico kit (Agilent) with RIN ≥ 8. For library construction, 50 ng of RNA from each sample was aliquoted in 96-well plates. Libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with the optional NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England BioLabs). Each individual sample library was barcoded during PCR amplification using unique dual indexed i5 and i7 primers from the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit. Each sample library was quantified using the Qubit DNA High Sensitivity kit and Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity kit. Samples were then pooled and sequenced using the MiSeq Nano V2 kit (Illumina) to check read proportions between samples. Samples with lower-than-expected percentage of reads detected were supplemented with an additional spike-in of sample library to the main pool. The supplemented pooled library was sequenced again using the MiSeq Nano V2 kit to verify adequate adjustment. The finalized library was sequenced using a NovaSeq S2 flow cell configured for 75 bp paired end output. Differential gene expression analysis Raw demultiplexed reads were filtered using fastp to remove adapters and short reads (Chen et al., 2018). Trimmed reads were then quantified using the Salmon pipeline with an hg38 reference transcriptome index (Patro et al., 2017). Quantified data was imported into R using the tximeta package (Love et al., 2020) to convert Salmon quantification and index data to a count matrix. Transcript names were extracted and matched using Entrez IDs with the AnnotationHub package (Love et al., 2020). This finalized count matrix was then imported into a DESeqDataset object and normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation in DESeq2. The DESeq2 R package was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed at each time point after vaccination for each subject group. Specifically, we implemented a design incorporating group-specific condition effects with individual subjects nested within groups. We performed the classical Deseq2 workflow of estimation of size factors, estimation of dispersion, and negative binomial GLM fitting for βi and Wald statistics, increasing the maximum number of iterations for estimation of the negative binomial distribution to 500. We then generated contrasts to obtain differentially expressed genes for controls at V1D1 and V1D7 (compared to V1D0), and at V2D1 and V2D7 (compared to V2D0). Differentially expressed genes for HD were similarly obtained at V1D2 and V1D7 (compared to V1D0), and at V2D2 and V2D7 (compared to V2D0). We also directly compared gene expression between controls and HD at V1D7 and at V2D7. The significance threshold to determine differential expression was FDR-adjusted (p<0.05). Anti-spike (trimer) IgG titer quantification The Human SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Trimer) IgG ELISA Kit from Invitrogen was used to quantitate IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples at V1D0, V2D7, and M6 time points. All samples were initially diluted 1:100 (in addition to the 1:10 assay buffer dilution on the 96-well plate) and assayed in duplicate, with twofold serial dilution of the 150,000 units/ml standard control in duplicate for relative quantification. Absorbance at 450 nm was quantified using a Spark multimode microplate reader. Samples that produced signals greater than the upper limit of the standard curve were diluted 1:2000 and assayed again. IgG concentration was calculated by fitting four-parameter logistic curves to the standard controls and taking the average concentrations of duplicates. Antibody neutralization assays Neutralization assays were performed on serum samples from V1D0 and V2D7 using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus (pseudovirus). To produce pseudoviruses, an expression plasmid bearing codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length S plasmid was co-transfected into HEK293T cells using the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particle Kit (BEI # R-52948). The cell supernatants were collected 72 hr after transfection, divided into aliquots and cryopreserved at −80°C. To titrate the pseudovirus, 5 × 103 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin. Twenty-four hours later, the pseudovirus was diluted 1:10, followed by fivefold serial dilutions for a total of nine dilutions, with each dilution performed in six replicate wells. After incubation at 37°C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 72 hr, the luciferase substrate was added to the 96-well plate for chemiluminescence detection. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the pseudovirus was calculated according to the Reed–Muench method in the titration macro template (Matumoto, 1949). Neutralization activity against SARS-2-CoV was measured in a single-round-of-infection assay with pseudoviruses as previously described (Nie et al., 2020). 5 × 103 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, serial dilutions of the serum samples were performed, incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with ~1000 TCID50/ml of pseudovirus, then added to monolayers of ACE2-overexpressing 293T cells in quadruplicate. The cell control with cells alone and the virus control (VC) with pseudovirus were set up in each plate. The target cells were incubated for 65–72 hr at 37°C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2. Then, 50 µl of Bright-Glo, reconstituted following the manufacturer's instructions, was added to each well of the 96-well plate and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The 96-well plate was read by a 96-well luminescence plate reader (Tecan Genius Pro plate reader) (Ferrara and Temperton, 2018). Percent neutralization was calculated as 100 * ([Virus-only control] – [Virus plus serum])/[Virus-only control], and neutralizing titer levels are reported as the serum dilution required to achieve 50% neutralization (50% inhibitory dilution [ID50]) (Pegu et al., 2021). The input dilution of serum was 1:20, thus 20 is the lower limit of quantification. BTM module enrichment analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for each contrast generated in the DESeq2 analysis above using blood transcription module (BTMs) gene sets (Li et al., 2014). BTMs with FDR-adjusted p<0.05 were considered significantly enriched. Enriched BTMs were further characterized using the distribution of Wald statistics of membership genes from DESeq2. To summarize BTM analyses, BTMs were categorized into different families: B cells, cell cycle, dendritic cell/antigen presentation, type I interferon (IFN type I), myeloid activity/inflammation/ T/NK cells, and 'others' (Braun et al., 2018). The percentage of BTMs in each BTM family with significant enrichment at each time point was then quantified over time. Statistical analysis of antibody response To determine the effect of vaccination on anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 and M6, Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed separately for HD subjects and controls. For each group, anti-spike IgG titer levels were compared to assess for the significant effect of time (V1D0, V2D7, M6), and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed with FDR correction to assess significant differences between each pair of time points (V2D7 vs. V1D0, M6 vs. V1D0, M6 vs. V2D7). To determine the effect of vaccination on antibody neutralization activity (ID50) at V2D7, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed for each group to compare V2D7 vs. V1D0. Linear models were constructed to establish the effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and subject group on anti-spike IgG titer development at V2D7 and M6 and neutralization activity at V2D7. Specifically, log-transformed V2D7 anti-spike IgG titers or V2D7 neutralization activity (ID50) were modeled as the dependent variable, with subject group (HD or controls), log-transformed V1D0 anti-spike IgG titers or V1D0 neutralization activity (ID50), gender, age, race, and ethnicity as independent predictors. To determine predictors of anti-spike IgG at 6 mo, a linear model was constructed with the log-transformed M6 anti-spike IgG titers as the dependent variable, and V2D7 anti-spike IgG titers, SARS-CoV-2 history, gender, age, race, and ethnicity as independent predictors. Identification of BTM and clinical predictors of Ab response in HD BTM predictors of antibody response in HD were identified by first calculating a representative expression level of each BTM per sample, which we will refer to as the eigengene. Specifically, the first principal component of each BTM was calculated using DESeq2-derived variance-stabilized gene counts from each module's member genes across the HD V1 time points, and then across the HD V2 time points. Signs (positive or negative) were assigned to the eigengenes such that samples with higher expression of member genes in a BTM would be given a positive sign, while those with lower overall gene expression would be given a negative sign. This was accomplished for each BTM by (1) computing the median gene expression level across membership genes in a given BTM for each sample, (2) computing the Pearson correlation between the eigengene of the BTM and the median gene expression level across all samples, and (3) multiplying the eigengene of the BTM by –1 if the correlation was negative. Subsequently, we constructed linear models with log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 as the dependent variable and change in BTM eigengene expression after vaccination as the independent variable, controlling for SARS-CoV-2 history. Separate models were constructed for each BTM that was enriched at each time point after vaccination in HD (V1D2 vs. V1D0, V1D7 vs. V1D0, V2D2 vs. V2D0, V2D0 V2D7). Change in BTM expression was calculated as the BTM eigengene after vaccination minus the BTM eigengene before vaccination. p-values were FDR-adjusted across number of enriched BTMs per time point. Additionally, baseline clinical laboratory values predictive of antibody response in the HD subjects were identified. Linear models were separately constructed using URR, ferritin (high risk vs. low risk), transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and WBC count to predict log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 and M6. Finally, clinical laboratory values responding to vaccination that predicted antibody titer response in the HD subjects were identified. Linear models were separately constructed using log-fold change (LFC) from baseline measurements of ferritin (continuous instead of binarized low- and high-risk), transferrin saturation, and WBC count to predict log-transformed anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 and M6. Results Demographic and clinical characterization Demographic and clinical data of the 20 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and controls (HC) are summarized in Table 1. The racial distribution differed between cohorts with more Black/African American subjects in the HD cohort. The cohorts were otherwise demographically similar. The subjects within the HD cohort had significantly more comorbidities, most notable of which include type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular conditions. The most common causes of renal failure were T2DM and HTN, with a minority of cases attributed to anatomic defects (reflux uropathy) and autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematous and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura).

There were eight HD subjects who previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with positive test dates ranging from 7 mo to 4 wk preceding vaccination. Five control subjects self-reported a prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with positive test dates ranging from 8 mo to 4 wk preceding vaccination. Detailed clinical characterization of HD subjects is summarized in Table 2. Notable laboratory data includes an elevated ferritin from normal (with high population variance) and anemia.

All subjects received two BTN162b2 vaccination doses with the second dose (V2) administered 3 wk after the first (V1). Anti-spike IgG binding and neutralizing assay data were obtained for all subjects prior to V1 (V1D0) and 7 d after V2 (V2D7). RNA sequencing data was obtained for all control subjects prior to each vaccination dose (D0), and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7. One control subject is missing V2D0 data, and one is missing V2D1 data. RNA sequencing data was obtained for 12 HD subjects prior to each vaccination dose, and at 2 d (D2) and 7 d after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D2, V1D7, V2D0, V2D2, and V2D7. Two HD subjects are missing V2D2 data. Sequencing data was not obtained for subjects with fewer than five time points of successfully constructed RNA libraries due to time points without sample collection or failure to extract high-quality mRNA from PBMCs. Six-month follow-up (M6) anti-spike IgG binding titers were obtained for 15 HC subjects and 19 HD subjects. One HD subject tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 14 d after the second vaccination dose, demonstrating mild symptoms. None of the other subjects reported SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 6 mo follow-up after the second vaccination. Differential gene expression analysis To characterize the molecular basis of immune responses to vaccination in HC and HD, we performed differential gene expression analyses of the PBMC RNA sequencing data. There are substantially more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to V2 compared to V1, and at D1 and D2 post-vaccination compared to D7 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). For HC, the largest number of DEGs is found at V2D1 (3974), indicating the most transcriptional activity immediately after the second vaccine dose, followed by V2D7 (177), V1D1 (128), and V1D7 (10). HD follows a similar pattern, with the largest number of DEGs found at V2D2 (1,111), followed by V2D7 (153), V1D2 (68), and V1D7 (8). Notably, HD subjects with no SARS-CoV-2 history (n = 6) have substantially lower numbers of DEGs than HD subjects with positive SARS-CoV-2 history (n = 6) at each time point, and particularly at V2 time points (Figure 1A).Direct comparison of gene expression between HC and HD with no prior reported SARS-CoV-2 infection at V1D7 yielded five DEGs in HD versus HC including increased expression of chemokine CCL19 in HD (p<0.05, FDR-corrected). Comparison of these same groups at V2D7 yielded 18 DEGs including increased expression in HD of TIA1, which encodes a granule-associated protein expressed in cytolytic lymphocytes (Anderson et al., 1990) and natural killer cells, and BH3, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member and mediator of lymphocyte apoptosis (Labi et al., 2008).

Full text Figures and data Peer review Side by side Abstract Editor's evaluation Introduction Methods Results Discussion Data availability References Article and author information Metrics Abstract Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients experience immune compromise characterized by complex alterations of both innate and adaptive immunity, and results in higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination. This immune compromise, coupled with greater risk of exposure to infectious disease at hemodialysis (HD) centers, underscores the need for examination of the immune response to the COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines. Methods: The immune response to the COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was assessed in 20 HD patients and cohort-matched controls. RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed longitudinally before and after each vaccination dose for a total of six time points per subject. Anti-spike antibody levels were quantified prior to the first vaccination dose (V1D0) and 7 d after the second dose (V2D7) using anti-spike IgG titers and antibody neutralization assays. Anti-spike IgG titers were additionally quantified 6 mo after initial vaccination. Clinical history and lab values in HD patients were obtained to identify predictors of vaccination response. Results: Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated differing time courses of immune responses, with prolonged myeloid cell activity in HD at 1 wk after the first vaccination dose. HD also demonstrated decreased metabolic activity and decreased antigen presentation compared to controls after the second vaccination dose. Anti-spike IgG titers and neutralizing function were substantially elevated in both controls and HD at V2D7, with a small but significant reduction in titers in HD groups (p<0.05). Anti-spike IgG remained elevated above baseline at 6 mo in both subject groups. Anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 were highly predictive of 6-month titer levels. Transcriptomic biomarkers after the second vaccination dose and clinical biomarkers including ferritin levels were found to be predictive of antibody development. Conclusions: Overall, we demonstrate differing time courses of immune responses to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in maintenance HD subjects comparable to healthy controls and identify transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG titers in HD. Analyzing vaccination as an in vivo perturbation, our results warrant further characterization of the immune dysregulation of ESRD. Funding: F30HD102093, F30HL151182, T32HL144909, R01HL138628. This research has been funded by the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) award UL1TR002003. Editor's evaluation Chang et al. demonstrate through their findings that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination of hemodialysis patients produces no significant difference in antibody levels achieved across the vaccination series. However, they find that T-cell responses may be delayed in hemodialysis patients as they have lower activation of T-cell genes than healthy controls. The RNA sequencing evidence is solid. However, they lack data on a clinical correlation to T-cell responses. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83641.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most advanced stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with prevalence in the United States reaching 809,000 in 2019 (Johansen et al., 2022). The most used form of renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients in the United States is hemodialysis (HD). Despite significant improvements in HD technology, the mortality rate in ESRD patients is still as high as 20% annually (Williams et al., 2004), with infections being the most common cause of hospitalization and mortality after cardiovascular disease (Kato et al., 2008). The immunocompromised state of ESRD is characterized by simultaneous immunodepression due to the impact of uremic milieu on immunocompetent cells and immunoactivation due to the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines (Kato et al., 2008). There are alterations to both innate and adaptive immunity, including elevated levels of mannose-binding lectin (Satomura et al., 2002), impaired maturation of monocytes and dendritic cells (Satomura et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2007), increased B cell apoptosis (Fernández-Fresnedo et al., 2000), and decreased T-cell proliferation with elevated Th1/Th2 ratio (Stenvinkel et al., 2005). Studies of genome-wide expression (i.e., transcriptome) profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ESRD demonstrate a complex picture of immune alterations. One study found upregulation of genes involved in the complement and oxidative metabolism pathways, and downregulation of genes associated with the clathrin-coated vesicle endosomal pathway and T-cell receptor signaling (Scherer et al., 2013). Two other studies have demonstrated impaired expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function (Granata et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2002). A study identifying a group of inflammatory genes playing a causative role in oxidative stress in dialysis patients showed unique gene expression alterations in maintenance HD patients compared to un-dialyzed CKD patients and compared to patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (Zaza et al., 2008). These studies indicate a range of immune pathways that may impair vaccination response, and further suggest that dialysis leads to unique immune profile alterations. These alterations may lead to higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination (Ghadiani et al., 2012). For example, while more than 90% of patients without CKD develop protective antibodies against HBV after vaccination, only 50–60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert. There have also been higher vaccination failure rates demonstrated against influenza virus, Clostridium tetani, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae in ESRD (Eleftheriadis et al., 2007). Understanding the immune response to vaccines in ESRD is particularly important for the new mRNA vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have proven to be efficacious in non-immunocompromised individuals, with initial reports showing 95 and 94.1% reduction of COVID-19 disease in recipients (Baden et al., 2021; Polack et al., 2020). However, certain immunosuppressed populations remain at risk of infection. Given the widespread transmission of COVID-19, detailed assessments of degree, duration, and determinants of immune protection conferred by these vaccines are vitally needed in immunocompromised patient populations including those with ESRD. While recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 BTN162b2 vaccine in HD demonstrate high levels of seroconversion ranging from 84 to 96% (Grupper et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021; Attias et al., 2021; Anand et al., 2021), they also demonstrate quantitatively reduced SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We posit that characterization of the transcriptomic underpinnings of antibody titer development on a continuous scale may identify biomarkers for weaker or less durable immune protection in this population. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses may identify strategies for the development of new, effective vaccines against other infectious diseases for this population. Thus, we characterized the immune response of the HD population to the COVID-19 mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine using mRNA sequencing, anti-spike antibody ELISA, and neutralization titers across multiple time points. We then integrated these data to identify transcriptomic and clinical determinants of the humoral immune response in HD patients. Methods Study population and sample acquisition The study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago IRB (#2018-1038) Ethics Review Committee. Maintenance HD patients undergoing vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021 were recruited from the outpatient HD unit at the University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) in Chicago, IL. Control subjects consisted of UIH employees undergoing BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination at UIH from December 2020 to January 2021 with no self-reported history of kidney disease or immune disorders. All subjects provided informed consent for participation in this research and for publication of results. A subset of control subjects matched for age, gender, and COVID-19 history was also analyzed for this study. Blood was collected at 0–48 hr prior to and at multiple time points after both the first (V1) and second vaccination doses (V2), which were administered 3 wk apart. Control samples were collected prior to each vaccination dose (D0) and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7. Blood was collected from HD subjects prior to each vaccination dose and at 2 d (D2) and 7 d after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D2, V1D7, V2D0, V2D2, and V2D7. A final blood sample was drawn 6 mo after initial vaccination (M6) for measurement of antibody titers, prior to additional vaccination doses. Serum and PBMCs were extracted within 2 hr of blood collection, then stored at –80°C. PBMCs were extracted using density gradient centrifugation at 400 × g with Ficoll–Paque PLUS. The extracted buffy coat was stored in RNAlater (Invitrogen). Clinical and demographic characterization Demographic and clinical data was collected from the electronic health record (EHR) for HD subjects, including medical diagnoses, medications, and laboratory values. Laboratory values included monthly SARS-CoV-2 test results, as well as urea reduction ratio (URR, a measure of dialysis adequacy), hemoglobin (Hgb), ferritin, transferrin saturation, albumin levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, and WBC differential counts obtained during standard of care monthly blood draws for the 3 mo preceding vaccination. Within our analyses, ferritin was coded as either low risk (200–1200 ng/ml) or high risk (<200 or >1200 ng/ml) since ferritin levels 200–1200 ng/ml have been shown to be associated with lowest all-cause mortality in HD patients (Kalantar-Zadeh et al., 2005). Baseline clinical lab values were calculated as the median of three lab values across the 3 mo prior to vaccination. Demographic and clinical data was collected from a medical questionnaire at time of consent for control subjects, and included medical history, medications, and self-reported prior SARS-CoV-2-positive test results. RNA extraction and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) RNA sequencing was performed on PBMCs at all V1 and V2 time points for all subjects for whom RNA libraries were successfully built at >5 time points. PBMCs stored in RNAlater were thawed and diluted 1:1 with 1× phosphate buffered saline. The mixture was then pelleted and RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini kit (Invitrogen). DNase treatment to remove genomic DNA contamination was performed using either the PureLink DNase kit or DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Invitrogen). Purified RNA in sterile water was stored at –80°C. Each RNA sample was quantified using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity kit (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer RNA Pico kit (Agilent) with RIN ≥ 8. For library construction, 50 ng of RNA from each sample was aliquoted in 96-well plates. Libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with the optional NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England BioLabs). Each individual sample library was barcoded during PCR amplification using unique dual indexed i5 and i7 primers from the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit. Each sample library was quantified using the Qubit DNA High Sensitivity kit and Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity kit. Samples were then pooled and sequenced using the MiSeq Nano V2 kit (Illumina) to check read proportions between samples. Samples with lower-than-expected percentage of reads detected were supplemented with an additional spike-in of sample library to the main pool. The supplemented pooled library was sequenced again using the MiSeq Nano V2 kit to verify adequate adjustment. The finalized library was sequenced using a NovaSeq S2 flow cell configured for 75 bp paired end output. Differential gene expression analysis Raw demultiplexed reads were filtered using fastp to remove adapters and short reads (Chen et al., 2018). Trimmed reads were then quantified using the Salmon pipeline with an hg38 reference transcriptome index (Patro et al., 2017). Quantified data was imported into R using the tximeta package (Love et al., 2020) to convert Salmon quantification and index data to a count matrix. Transcript names were extracted and matched using Entrez IDs with the AnnotationHub package (Love et al., 2020). This finalized count matrix was then imported into a DESeqDataset object and normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation in DESeq2. The DESeq2 R package was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed at each time point after vaccination for each subject group. Specifically, we implemented a design incorporating group-specific condition effects with individual subjects nested within groups. We performed the classical Deseq2 workflow of estimation of size factors, estimation of dispersion, and negative binomial GLM fitting for βi and Wald statistics, increasing the maximum number of iterations for estimation of the negative binomial distribution to 500. We then generated contrasts to obtain differentially expressed genes for controls at V1D1 and V1D7 (compared to V1D0), and at V2D1 and V2D7 (compared to V2D0). Differentially expressed genes for HD were similarly obtained at V1D2 and V1D7 (compared to V1D0), and at V2D2 and V2D7 (compared to V2D0). We also directly compared gene expression between controls and HD at V1D7 and at V2D7. The significance threshold to determine differential expression was FDR-adjusted (p<0.05). Anti-spike (trimer) IgG titer quantification The Human SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Trimer) IgG ELISA Kit from Invitrogen was used to quantitate IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples at V1D0, V2D7, and M6 time points. All samples were initially diluted 1:100 (in addition to the 1:10 assay buffer dilution on the 96-well plate) and assayed in duplicate, with twofold serial dilution of the 150,000 units/ml standard control in duplicate for relative quantification. Absorbance at 450 nm was quantified using a Spark multimode microplate reader. Samples that produced signals greater than the upper limit of the standard curve were diluted 1:2000 and assayed again. IgG concentration was calculated by fitting four-parameter logistic curves to the standard controls and taking the average concentrations of duplicates. Antibody neutralization assays Neutralization assays were performed on serum samples from V1D0 and V2D7 using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus (pseudovirus). To produce pseudoviruses, an expression plasmid bearing codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length S plasmid was co-transfected into HEK293T cells using the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particle Kit (BEI # R-52948). The cell supernatants were collected 72 hr after transfection, divided into aliquots and cryopreserved at −80°C. To titrate the pseudovirus, 5 × 103 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin. Twenty-four hours later, the pseudovirus was diluted 1:10, followed by fivefold serial dilutions for a total of nine dilutions, with each dilution performed in six replicate wells. After incubation at 37°C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 72 hr, the luciferase substrate was added to the 96-well plate for chemiluminescence detection. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the pseudovirus was calculated according to the Reed–Muench method in the titration macro template (Matumoto, 1949). Neutralization activity against SARS-2-CoV was measured in a single-round-of-infection assay with pseudoviruses as previously described (Nie et al., 2020). 5 × 103 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, serial dilutions of the serum samples were performed, incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with ~1000 TCID50/ml of pseudovirus, then added to monolayers of ACE2-overexpressing 293T cells in quadruplicate. The cell control with cells alone and the virus control (VC) with pseudovirus were set up in each plate. The target cells were incubated for 65–72 hr at 37°C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2. Then, 50 µl of Bright-Glo, reconstituted following the manufacturer's instructions, was added to each well of the 96-well plate and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The 96-well plate was read by a 96-well luminescence plate reader (Tecan Genius Pro plate reader) (Ferrara and Temperton, 2018). Percent neutralization was calculated as 100 * ([Virus-only control] – [Virus plus serum])/[Virus-only control], and neutralizing titer levels are reported as the serum dilution required to achieve 50% neutralization (50% inhibitory dilution [ID50]) (Pegu et al., 2021). The input dilution of serum was 1:20, thus 20 is the lower limit of quantification. BTM module enrichment analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for each contrast generated in the DESeq2 analysis above using blood transcription module (BTMs) gene sets (Li et al., 2014). BTMs with FDR-adjusted p<0.05 were considered significantly enriched. Enriched BTMs were further characterized using the distribution of Wald statistics of membership genes from DESeq2. To summarize BTM analyses, BTMs were categorized into different families: B cells, cell cycle, dendritic cell/antigen presentation, type I interferon (IFN type I), myeloid activity/inflammation/ T/NK cells, and 'others' (Braun et al., 2018). The percentage of BTMs in each BTM family with significant enrichment at each time point was then quantified over time. Statistical analysis of antibody response To determine the effect of vaccination on anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 and M6, Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed separately for HD subjects and controls. For each group, anti-spike IgG titer levels were compared to assess for the significant effect of time (V1D0, V2D7, M6), and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed with FDR correction to assess significant differences between each pair of time points (V2D7 vs. V1D0, M6 vs. V1D0, M6 vs. V2D7). To determine the effect of vaccination on antibody neutralization activity (ID50) at V2D7, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed for each group to compare V2D7 vs. V1D0. Linear models were constructed to establish the effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and subject group on anti-spike IgG titer development at V2D7 and M6 and neutralization activity at V2D7. Specifically, log-transformed V2D7 anti-spike IgG titers or V2D7 neutralization activity (ID50) were modeled as the dependent variable, with subject group (HD or controls), log-transformed V1D0 anti-spike IgG titers or V1D0 neutralization activity (ID50), gender, age, race, and ethnicity as independent predictors. To determine predictors of anti-spike IgG at 6 mo, a linear model was constructed with the log-transformed M6 anti-spike IgG titers as the dependent variable, and V2D7 anti-spike IgG titers, SARS-CoV-2 history, gender, age, race, and ethnicity as independent predictors. Identification of BTM and clinical predictors of Ab response in HD BTM predictors of antibody response in HD were identified by first calculating a representative expression level of each BTM per sample, which we will refer to as the eigengene. Specifically, the first principal component of each BTM was calculated using DESeq2-derived variance-stabilized gene counts from each module's member genes across the HD V1 time points, and then across the HD V2 time points. Signs (positive or negative) were assigned to the eigengenes such that samples with higher expression of member genes in a BTM would be given a positive sign, while those with lower overall gene expression would be given a negative sign. This was accomplished for each BTM by (1) computing the median gene expression level across membership genes in a given BTM for each sample, (2) computing the Pearson correlation between the eigengene of the BTM and the median gene expression level across all samples, and (3) multiplying the eigengene of the BTM by –1 if the correlation was negative. Subsequently, we constructed linear models with log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 as the dependent variable and change in BTM eigengene expression after vaccination as the independent variable, controlling for SARS-CoV-2 history. Separate models were constructed for each BTM that was enriched at each time point after vaccination in HD (V1D2 vs. V1D0, V1D7 vs. V1D0, V2D2 vs. V2D0, V2D0 V2D7). Change in BTM expression was calculated as the BTM eigengene after vaccination minus the BTM eigengene before vaccination. p-values were FDR-adjusted across number of enriched BTMs per time point. Additionally, baseline clinical laboratory values predictive of antibody response in the HD subjects were identified. Linear models were separately constructed using URR, ferritin (high risk vs. low risk), transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and WBC count to predict log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 and M6. Finally, clinical laboratory values responding to vaccination that predicted antibody titer response in the HD subjects were identified. Linear models were separately constructed using log-fold change (LFC) from baseline measurements of ferritin (continuous instead of binarized low- and high-risk), transferrin saturation, and WBC count to predict log-transformed anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 and M6. Results Demographic and clinical characterization Demographic and clinical data of the 20 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and controls (HC) are summarized in Table 1. The racial distribution differed between cohorts with more Black/African American subjects in the HD cohort. The cohorts were otherwise demographically similar. The subjects within the HD cohort had significantly more comorbidities, most notable of which include type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular conditions. The most common causes of renal failure were T2DM and HTN, with a minority of cases attributed to anatomic defects (reflux uropathy) and autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematous and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura).

Five control subjects self-reported a prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with positive test dates ranging from 8 mo to 4 wk preceding vaccination. Detailed clinical characterization of HD subjects is summarized in Table 2. Notable laboratory data includes an elevated ferritin from normal (with high population variance) and anemia.

All subjects received two BTN162b2 vaccination doses with the second dose (V2) administered 3 wk after the first (V1). Anti-spike IgG binding and neutralizing assay data were obtained for all subjects prior to V1 (V1D0) and 7 d after V2 (V2D7). RNA sequencing data was obtained for all control subjects prior to each vaccination dose (D0), and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7. One control subject is missing V2D0 data, and one is missing V2D1 data. RNA sequencing data was obtained for 12 HD subjects prior to each vaccination dose, and at 2 d (D2) and 7 d after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D2, V1D7, V2D0, V2D2, and V2D7. Two HD subjects are missing V2D2 data. Sequencing data was not obtained for subjects with fewer than five time points of successfully constructed RNA libraries due to time points without sample collection or failure to extract high-quality mRNA from PBMCs. Six-month follow-up (M6) anti-spike IgG binding titers were obtained for 15 HC subjects and 19 HD subjects. One HD subject tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 14 d after the second vaccination dose, demonstrating mild symptoms. None of the other subjects reported SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 6 mo follow-up after the second vaccination. Differential gene expression analysis To characterize the molecular basis of immune responses to vaccination in HC and HD, we performed differential gene expression analyses of the PBMC RNA sequencing data. There are substantially more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to V2 compared to V1, and at D1 and D2 post-vaccination compared to D7 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). For HC, the largest number of DEGs is found at V2D1 (3974), indicating the most transcriptional activity immediately after the second vaccine dose, followed by V2D7 (177), V1D1 (128), and V1D7 (10). HD follows a similar pattern, with the largest number of DEGs found at V2D2 (1,111), followed by V2D7 (153), V1D2 (68), and V1D7 (8). Notably, HD subjects with no SARS-CoV-2 history (n = 6) have substantially lower numbers of DEGs than HD subjects with positive SARS-CoV-2 history (n = 6) at each time point, and particularly at V2 time points (Figure 1A).Direct comparison of gene expression between HC and HD with no prior reported SARS-CoV-2 infection at V1D7 yielded five DEGs in HD versus HC including increased expression of chemokine CCL19 in HD (p<0.05, FDR-corrected). Comparison of these same groups at V2D7 yielded 18 DEGs including increased expression in HD of TIA1, which encodes a granule-associated protein expressed in cytolytic lymphocytes (Anderson et al., 1990) and natural killer cells, and BH3, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member and mediator of lymphocyte apoptosis (Labi et al., 2008). Figure 1 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Results of differential gene expression and blood transcription module (BTM) analysis. (A) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased after second vaccination dose compared to first, and at early time points compared to day 7 (D7). DEGs are shown for maintenance hemodialysis (HD) with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) prior SARS-CoV-2 history. See Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for healthy control (HC) and HD data independent of SARS-CoV-2 history. The DESeq2 R package was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed at each time point after vaccination for each subject group (p<0.05, FDR-adjusted). (B) HC and HD with no SARS-CoV-2 history demonstrate distinct longitudinal enrichments of BTMs. Left: in HC, the most significantly enriched BTMs are shown (up to six) for day 1 (D1) and day 7 (D7) after each vaccination dose (V1, V2) (p<0.05, FDR-adjusted). Density plots for each BTM represent Wald statistics from DESeq2 analysis for each membership gene, thereby representing increased or decreased expression per gene at each time point compared to baseline (V1D0 or V2D0). Right: similarly in HD, the most significantly enriched BTMs for day 2 (D2) and day 7 (D7) are shown. (C) HD demonstrates diminished transitioning from innate to adaptive immune BTM enrichment after each vaccination dose. Percentages of BTMs in each BTM family with significant enrichment are shown at each time point after each vaccination dose (V1, V2) for day 1 (D1) and day 7 (D7) in HC, and day 2 (D2) and D7 for HD in subjects with no prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05, FDR-adjusted). Direction of enrichment was determined using the median Wald statistic from DESeq2 analysis for each BTM membership gene, thereby representing overall increased or decreased expression of membership genes at each time point compared to baseline (V1D0 or V2D0). Blood transcription module (BTM) enrichment BTM enrichment analysis of subjects without SARS-CoV-2 history reveals the vaccine-induced progression of various immune processes at each time point after vaccination (Figure 1B). Following V1, HC demonstrate early (V1D1) enrichment of 29 BTMs, with substantial upregulation of monocyte and antiviral IFN ac

The SG is a modern grid that uses digital technology to manage the flow of electricity from generators to consumers. Clean ES to SG Access to SG is a critical step towards reducing carbon emissions and increasing the use of sustainable ES. Clean ES to SG can be achieved in a number of ways, including the use of distributed generation, energy system storage, and demand response programs. Distributed ES is the use of small-scale energy production technologies, such as photovoltaic panels, wind farms and microturbines, to generate electricity near the point of use. The SG system is used to store the surplus energy generated by cleaning the ES for later use. Demand response systems encourage users to minimize electricity consumption during peak hours when demand is high. The reduction in carbon emissions is one of the main benefits of incorporating a spotless ES into an SG. The use of sustainable ES such as sustainable helps minimize CO2 emissions in the energy sector. Additionally, utilizing energy storage can help minimize the need for fossil fuels to meet peak electricity demand, thereby lowering carbon emissions. Another advantage of incorporating clean ES into SG is higher reliability of energy supply. However, there are significant difficulties in incorporating this issue into the SG. One of the most important issues is the unpredictability of sustainable energy sources such as solar or wind power. Output from these architectures can fluctuate based on weather and other conditions, making it challenging to balance market dynamics on the grid. Energy storage devices can help address this difficulty by storing the extra energy generated during high production times for use during low output times. The need for additional infrastructure to support clean ES integration with SG is another issue. This requires new supercapacitors, demand response programs, distribution networks and technologies to connect clean ES to the grid. In conclusion, incorporating this topic into SG is a key step towards reducing carbon emissions and encouraging the use of sustainable ES in the electrical industry. The benefits of SG's Sustainable Power Convergence, such as cleaner energy, greater reliability of power supply and lower total cost of power ownership, make it a valuable addition for the future, despite some drawbacks such as dispatchable Variability of ES with common project requirements.
