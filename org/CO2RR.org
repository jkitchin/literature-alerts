Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds greater promise for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals, but designing and manufacturing efficient CO2RR catalysts remains desirable but challenging. Here, the Cu2O/In(OH)3 with heterojunction structure was prepared as an efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts. The optimized Cu2O/In(OH)3–1:1 stabilizes over a wide range of potentials to generate syngas (hydrogen/carbon monoxide, H2/CO) at a ratio of 2:1, and the total Faraday efficiency (FE) remains close to 100 %. However, the ratio of syngas will change to 1:1 when the Cu/In ratio becomes 1:2. In addition, creatively using solar energy to drive the CO2RR system can directly and efficiently achieve the change of solar energy to chemical energy (syngas). Moreover, in-situ experiments show that part of Cu+ is converted to Cu during the CO2RR process, while In(OH)3 remains stable. This work highlights an efficient electrocatalyst for producing syngas based on interface engineering.

The deep eutectic solvent (DES) has emerged in recent years as a valuable medium for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals because of its easy availability, stability, and safety, and its capability to dissolve carbon dioxide. CO2 valorization in DES has evolved rapidly over the past 20 years. As well as being used as solvents for acid/base-promoted CO2 conversion for the production of cyclic carbonates and carbamates, DESs can be used as reaction media for electrochemical CO2 reduction for formic acid and CO. Among these products, cyclic carbonates can be used as solvents and electrolytes, carbamate derivatives include the core structure of many herbicides and pesticides, and formic acid and carbon monoxide, the C1 electrochemical products, are essential raw materials in the chemical industries. An overview of the application of DESs for CO2 valorization in recent years is presented in this review, followed by a compilation and comparison of product types and reaction mechanisms within the different types of DESs, and an outlook on how CO2 valorization will be developed in the future.

Excessive CO2 emission has caused serious environmental problems, and converting CO2 to high value-added fuels is attractive for solving energy and environmental crisis. Herein, a novel mesoporous TS-1(mTS-1) zeolite-confined metal oxides nanoclusters Cu-Bi@mTS-1 was developed for efficient photoelectrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (PEC CO2RR). The catalyst Cu-Bi@mTS-1 as a photocathode showed high activity, achieving a maximum methanol Faraday efficiency (FECH3OH) of 93.4 % at −0.7 V vs. RHE. The C2 product ethanol could be also detected at higher potentials during PEC CO2RR. In-situ FTIR results indicate the occurrence of key reaction intermediates *CO, *CHO, *OCCO and *COCHO during the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH and CH3CH2OH. It is believed that the hierarchically porous structure of mTS-1 is conducive to the enrichment of CO2 molecules to increase the reactant concentration, also can promote C-C coupling through photoelectric synergism. This work provides a favorable reference for the rational design of photocathodes by confinement effect of porous structure.

The photocatalytic reduction reactions of CO2 in aqueous suspensions of titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor with photodeposited Pt and Cu cocatalysts have been studied. It has been found that the composition and amount of CO2 reduction products significantly depend on the nature of the cocatalyst supported onto TiO2. A mechanism for the formation of CO2 reduction products has been proposed.

The possibility of electrosynthesis of formate from CO2 at a current density of 50–190 mA/cm2 in sulfuric acid aqueous solutions (pH 2–2.5) in a gas diffusion electrode with a lead electrocatalyst deposited on acetylene black was studied. It is shown that with an appropriate selection of the electrolyte composition, it is possible to carry out the electrosynthesis process with parameters that practically differ little from those in alkaline solutions. The highest current efficiency of 74% was obtained at a potential of -1.89 V, a current density of 150 mA/cm2 in an electrolyte of 0.5 M K2SO4 + 0.083 M H2SO4.

The purpose of this study was to determine the carbon dioxide emissions produced by each type of landscape construction required for each urban park design theme in South Korea and mitigation measures. This study obtained data from four urban park construction projects in South Korea and calculated the amount of carbon dioxide generated during the construction phase using the Tier 2 method based on the amount of construction machinery used according to Korean construction standards. The results show that the three cases beginning after 2020 generated about 1.0 tCO2 of carbon dioxide per 100 m2. In each case, mechanized construction accounted for more than 60% of the total trees planted, and more than 50% of the carbon dioxide was generated in constructing forest-themed parks. Transplanting trees in their natural state emitted at least 2.5 times and up to 9.6 times more carbon dioxide than planting new trees. Pavement construction generated about 340 to 390 tCO2, and block pavement construction generated about 20 to 70 tCO2 per 100 m2 more than pavement constructed by the wet construction method. Based on these results, in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the first step should be to reduce the planting and transplanting of large trees, as this involves a high workload in terms of construction machinery at the design stage, and in the long term, it will be necessary to lead the “landscape of time” through the growth of plant materials. Second, the workload of construction machinery should be improved to induce carbon dioxide reductions through the revision of the Standard Unit Productivity Data on Construction Projects, and it is necessary to refer to past standards. Third, it may be desirable to use wet pavement, but there is a need to improve the sectional detail of block pavement to reduce mechanized work.

Various technologies and projects have been explored and developed for the synergetic control of environmental pollution and carbon emissions in aquatic ecosystems. Planting submerged vegetation in shallow waters was also expected to achieve this purpose. However, the magnitude and mechanism of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission affected by submerged vegetation is not clear enough in complex aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated the influences of submerged plants on CO2 emission, ecosystem metabolism features, and microbial community traits based on observations in river networks on the Changjiang River Delta. The results showed that CO2 emission from planted waters accounted for 73% of unplanted waters. Meanwhile, planted waters had higher dissolved organic carbon removal capacity in overlying water and higher potential of carbon sequestration in sediment at the same time. These distinctions between the two habitats were attributed to (1) improved CO2 and bicarbonate consumption in water columns via enhancing photosynthesis and (2) inhibited CO2 production by reconstructing the benthic microbial community. Additional eco-advantages were found in planted sediments, such as a high potential of methane oxidation and xenobiotics biodegradation and a low risk of becoming black and odorous. In brief, submerged vegetation is beneficial in promoting pollution removal and carbon retention synchronously. This study advances our understanding of the feedback between aquatic metabolism and CO2 emission.

The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value‐added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon‐neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long‐term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon‐neutral community.

The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value‐added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon‐neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long‐term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon‐neutral community.

Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction in aqueous electrolytes is a promising route to produce added-value chemicals and decrease carbon emissions. However, even in Gas-Diffusion Electrode devices, low aqueous CO 2 solubility limits catalysis rate and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that when assembled over a heterogeneous electrocatalyst, a film of nitrile-modified Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) acts as a remarkable CO 2 -solvation layer that increases its local concentration by ~27-fold compared to bulk electrolyte, reaching 0.82 M. When mounted on a Bi catalyst in a Gas Diffusion Electrode, the MOF drastically improves CO 2 -to-HCOOH conversion, reaching above 90% selectivity and partial HCOOH currents of 166 mA/cm 2 (at −0.9 V vs RHE). The MOF also facilitates catalysis through stabilization of reaction intermediates, as identified by operando infrared spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory. Hence, the presented strategy provides new molecular means to enhance heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction, leading it closer to the requirements for practical implementation.

Catalyst materials with high stability and selectivity, based on inexpensive materials, are vital for practical electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction (ECR). In this study, we report ternary Zn-Ce-Ag catalysts for selective and stable CO2-to-CO conversion at high current densities on a large scale. We found that ZnO catalysts are relatively selective for CO2-to-CO conversion, but are only stable for less than 20 h at current densities over 100 mA cm−2 due to the reduction of the Zn oxide phase, along with the ECR. Combining ZnO with CeO2 significantly improves the stability of the catalysts, maintaining a CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 80 % for 100 h at the current density of 200 mA cm−2. By introducing a small amount of silver (<10 wt%) to form ternary Ag-Ce-Zn catalysts, both CO selectivity and stability are significantly improved: the developed catalysts exhibit a high FECO of 90 % at 200 mA cm−2 and are stable for 200 h. We attribute the enhanced CO2-to-CO conversion efficiency to the abundance of stable interfacial areas of various metal-oxide interactions, which are critical for ECR. To demonstrate the potential for practical application, we performed the ECR in a large electrochemical cell, with an active surface area of 100 cm2. The system delivers a FECO of 90 % at 200 mA cm−2 for an extended operation time of 200 h.

Aprotic organic electrolytes for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) offer a promising yet little-explored alternative to avoid the selectivity issues of alkaline media. We present a model-assisted study of the local reaction environment at a Cu cathode in aprotic organic electrolytes to determine the kinetics of the CO2R and the kinetic limitations and reveal their dependence on reaction conditions. The adsorption of CO2 is identified as the rate-determining step, as opposed to the often-assumed electron transfer during radical anion formation. Unlike alkaline media, there is no transport limitation in aprotic media. Furthermore, our model predicts two strategies to overcome the adsorption limitation: (i) by increasing surface roughness and (ii) by elevating pressure. The findings highlight the critical role of CO2 adsorption on CO2R performance and enable knowledge-driven optimization of reaction conditions and electrocatalysts.

Abstract The climate disasters caused by extreme climate change have brought great harm to humanity. This article attempts to propose a balanced CO2 emission perspective by constructing a CO2 emission reduction tolerance function and cost function. Using China's CO2 emission data of China's Oil and Gas Industry over the past 20 years, data on the losses caused by CO2 emission accumulation to the environment and society, and national income data, empirical analysis is conducted on the constructed function to determine a reasonable CO2 emission amount and provide a scientific basis for the country to formulate a scientific and reasonable CO2 emission reduction ratio.

In Japan, efforts have been made to reduce CO2 emissions by utilizing recycled parts of automobiles for more than 10 years, and an annual amount of reduction in CO2 emission of approximately 130,000–140,000 tons per year has been estimated. This initiative has received a great deal of attention globally in the field of automobile recycling; however, we need to examine whether the strategy of utilizing recycled auto parts for CO2 emission reduction can be applied overseas. In China, which has the largest number of vehicles in the world, the effect of reducing CO2 emissions through the use of used automobile parts has not been investigated. However, based on the number of payments for non-life insurance accidents in China, we estimated the potential for reducing CO2 emissions through the use of used automobile parts based on the number of traffic accidents in China, using current data from Japan, and obtained the result of 5952 t-CO2/Y on average over 5 years. In addition, we collected information on the current situation of automobile recycling, administrative efforts, and policies and conducted a fact-finding survey and analysis of specific methods and issues regarding the introduction of Japanese-style CO2 emission reduction programs in China.

Metal‐organic framework (MOF) materials have attracted much attention due to their diverse topological structures, excellent adsorption capacity, and unique physicochemical properties, which hold great promise in catalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the original MOFs materials have disadvantages such as poor electrical conductivity, high diffusion barrier and limited accessible catalytic sites, which seriously limit their application in CO2RR. Therefore, many structural engineering strategies have been used to improve the CO2RR performance of the MOFs materials. In this review, we mainly review the four main structure engineering strategies, i.e. crystal engineering, 2D engineering, heterostructure engineering and MOF derivatives engineering, in enhancing the catalytic CO2RR performance of the MOFs. We hope that this review will not only provide insights for the rational design of efficient MOFs materials for the CO2RR, but also stimulate more research work in this field.

Transforming carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemical products or carbonaceous fuels is a crucial strategy for addressing the impact of global climate change and energy challenges. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) shows promise in this regard, but challenges remain in the eCO2RR, such as poor electrocatalytic activity and low selectivity of the target product. In this study, we report a one‐step method of replacement reaction for synthesizing a cadmium layer on the zinc foil surface (named as the Cd/Zn electrode) for efficient eCO2RR to CO. The thicknesses of Cd layers could be easily adjusted by varying the molar concentration of Cd2+. The Cd/Zn electrode with a 2.0 µm thick Cd layer exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance of the eCO2RR to CO in the ionic liquid‐containing electrolytes. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO reached up to 99.0% at ‐1.9 V vs. Ag/Ag+, and the maximum CO partial current density achieved 34.8 mA cm−2 at ‐2.3 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The 3D fluffy Cd layer with a suitable thickness on the Zn foil surface provided abundant active sites, fast charge transfer rate, and strong adsorption ability of CO2•− intermediates, which contributed to the enhancement of the electrocatalytic performance of the eCO2RR to CO.

The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds substantial promise for producing high‐value chemicals and fuels, drawing significant attention from both academia and industry. This work proposes an in‐situelectrodeposition method to prepare indium‐doped copper (Cu)‐based catalysts on carbon paper (Cu100Inx‐CP, x = 3.9, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, and 7.6, denoting the molar ratio of In to Cu in the catalyst.). The catalysts Cu100Inx‐CP were used for CO2RR to produce multi‐carbon (C2+) products. Characterization results showed that In was highly dispersed in the Cu particles at x<5.1. The Cu100In5.1‐CP (containing 0.95 wt% In based on Cu) was very efficient for electrocatalytic CO2RR. The in‐situ Raman spectroscopy showed that Cu100In5.1‐CP enhanced *CO intermediate adsorption and promoted the production of C2+ products due to the synergistic effect between In and Cu. In doping could suppress HER, enhanced *CO intermediate adsorption, and C‐C coupling for the production of C2+ products in CO2RR.

The conversion of waste carbon dioxide (CO2) gas into valuable products and fuels through an electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach. The sluggish kinetics of the CO2RR require the development of novel strategies for electrocatalyst design. Two-dimensional (2D) materials emerge as promising candidates for CO2RR due to their distinctive electronic and structural properties. This study follows the first principles based DFT-D method to examine the electrocatalytic competences of the defective two-dimensional boron nitride monolayer (d-BN) material towards CO2RR. Introducing a particular defect with nitrogen vacancies in the 2D single layer pristine hexagonal boron nitride (VN_d-BN) can efficiently activate the CO2 molecules for hydrogenation by reducing the electronic band gap of the pristine hBN from 6.23 eV to 3.0 eV. Therefore, VN_d-BN material can act as a large band gap semiconductor. Our findings demonstrate that the defective regions in the 2D monolayer VN_d-BN serve as active sites (Boron) for both the adsorption and activation of CO2. The subsequent hydrogenation steps occur sequentially once the CO2 molecule is adsorbed on the catalytic surface. Our results indicate that the OCHO* path is the most favorable for CH4 production. Hence, the 2D monolayer VN_d-BN material holds a great promise as a cost-effective catalyst for CO2RR, and it presents a viable alternative to expensive platinum (Pt) catalysts.

A study is performed of the electrocatalytic activity of substituted pyridine salts (N-hydro-, N‑methyl-, and N-phenyl-2,4,6-triphenylpyridinium perchlorates) in the electroreduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. The effect the natures of the substituent and the H+ source have on the efficiency of the process is determined. The main reasons for the occurrence of the electrocatalytic process are identified, and the values of TOF (catalyst speed) and TON (number of revolutions of the catalyst) are calculated. It is shown that the values of TOF and TON fall as the pK of the acid rises.

Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction into value-added products is crucial for the green economy. Inspired by the recent synthesis of Biphenylene (BPH), we have systematically investigated pristine, defective, and Cu-decorated BPH as an electrocatalyst for the CO$_2$ reduction reactions (CRR). Our first-principles calculations show the CO$_2$ molecules weakly interact with the pristine BPH surface while defective BPH facilitates the CO$_2$ adsorption with a binding energy ($E_b$) of -3.22 eV, indicating the detrimental process for the CRR on the surface of both systems. Furthermore, we have investigated the binding energy and kinetic stability of Cu-decorated BPH as a single-atom-catalyst (SAC). The molecular dynamics simulations confirm the kinetic stability, revealing that the Cu-atom avoids agglomeration under low metal dispersal conditions. The CO$_2$ molecule gets adsorbed horizontally on the Cu-BPH surface with $E_b$ of -0.52 eV. The CRR mechanism is investigated using two pathways beginning with two different initial intermediate states, formate ($\mathrm{^*OCOH}$) and the carboxylic ($\mathrm{^*COOH}$) pathways. The formate pathway confirms the conversion of $\mathrm{^*OCOH}$ to $\mathrm{^*HCOOH}$ with the rate-limiting potential ($U_L$) of 0.57 eV for the production of HCOOH, while for the carboxylic pathway, the conversion of $\mathrm{^*COH}$ to $\mathrm{^*CHOH}$ has $U_L$ of 0.49 eV for the production of CH$_3$OH. We have also investigated the effect of protons using charged hydrogen pseudopotential, which hints towards the possible formation of CH$_3$OH as fuel. Our findings propose Cu-BPH as an efficient single-atom catalyst for CO$_2$ conversion compared to the well-known Cu metal.

Single‐atom catalysts (SACs), with their well‐defined structure, serve as an efficient catalyst model for studying the structure‐performance relation in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Current CO2RR research primarily focus on the coordination interactions between metal single atoms and coordinated ligands, while the impact of the metal SAC's microenvironment remains largely unexplored. Herein, we generate three microenvironments for a CoN4 ensemble by using different nitrogen sources to prepare Co SACs, i.e. pyridine‐type Co‐N4 (Co‐N4 SACPhen), the pyrrole‐type Co‐N4 (Co‐N4 SACDp) and the mixed‐type Co‐N4(Co‐N4 SACMm). It reveals that the Co‐N4 SACPhen contributes to CO generation with 99.5% selectivity at ‐0.76 vs RHE, whereas the Co‐N4 SACDp accelerates a severe hydrogen evolution reaction. Experimental studies confirmed that the Co‐N4 SACPhen possesses distinctive electrochemical properties and electronic structure, facilitating the generation of CO. This study deepens our understanding of the cobalt SAC's microenvironment's influence on CO2RR.

Converting CO2 and water into valuable chemicals like plant do is considered a promising approach to address both environmental and energy issues. Taking inspiration from the structures of natural leaves, we designed and synthesized a novel copper-coordinated covalent triazine framework (CuCTF) supported by silicon nanowire arrays on wafer chip. This marks the first-ever application of such a hybrid material in the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 under mild conditions. The Si@CuCTF6 heterojunction has exhibited exceptional selectivity of 95.6% towards multicarbon products (C2+) and apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.89% for carbon-based products. The active sites of the catalysts are derived from the nitrogen atoms of unique triazine ring structure in the ordered porous framework and the abundant Cu−N coordination sites with bipyridine units. Furthermore, through DFT calculations and operando FTIR spectra analysis, we proposed a comprehensive mechanism for the photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction, confirming the existence of key intermediate species such as *CO2−, *=C=O, *CHO and *CO−CHO etc. This work not only provides a new way to mimic photosynthesis of plant leaves but also gives a new opportunity to enter this research field in the future.

This paper presents an experimental study of using a double-layered Cu/TiO2 and P4O10/TiO2 as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction with an extended wavelength of range light from ultraviolet light (UV) to infrared light (IR). The lights studied were UV + visible light (VIS) + IR, VIS + IR and IR only. This study also investigated the impact of the molar ratio of CO2:H2O on the CO2 reduction performance. This study revealed that the optimum molar ratio of CO2:H2O to produce CO was 1:1, irrespective of light illumination condition, which matched the theoretical molar ratio to produce CO according to the reaction scheme of CO2 reduction with H2O. Comparing the results of double-layered Cu/TiO2 and P4O10/TiO2 with those of double-layered TiO2 obtained under the UV + VIS + IR light illumination condition, the highest concentration of formed CO and the molar quantity of formed CO per unit weight of the photocatalyst increased by 281 ppmV and 0.8 μmol/g, in the case of the molar ratio of CO2:H2O = 1:1. With IR-only illumination, the highest concentration of formed CO and the molar quantity of CO formed per unit weight of the photocatalyst was 251 ppmV and 4.7 μmol/g, respectively.

The CO2 electrochemical reduction process has been executed utilizing a solid oxide electrolysis cell, incorporating advanced cathode materials: A-site deficient calcium-doped lanthanum strontium titanate (La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3-δ, LSCT) and cerium (5 mol%)-doped lanthanum strontium calcium titanate (Ce0.05La0.2Sr0.2Ca0.45TiO3-δ, Ce-LSCT). In both electrochemical setups, La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were employed as the anode and electrolyte, respectively. The electrocatalytic efficacy of LSCT was notably enhanced in a hydrogen-rich environment, evidenced by a reduction in cathode polarization resistance from 36.7 to 10.43 Ω.cm2, concurrent with an increase in H2 concentration from 30 % to 50 %. Additionally, the replacement of 5 mol% strontium with cerium in the LSCT cathode composition resulted in a further decrease of polarization resistance to 4.88 Ω.cm2 at a CO2/H2 molar ratio of 50/50. In a reductive atmosphere, Ceria (CeO2) nanospheres were observed to exsolve from their lattice sites within the Ce-LSCT cathode, as verified through FE-SEM and HR-TEM analyses. These in-situ exsolved CeO2 nanoparticles actively contributed to the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, achieving a superior current density of 1.01 A/cm2, surpassing the 0.69 A/cm2 recorded for the LSCT cathode. This was observed at an operational voltage of 2.5 V and a temperature of 800 °C. These outcomes suggest the potential of LSCT as a cathode material in CO2 reduction reactions, with Ce-doping offering a pathway to further augment its electrocatalytic capabilities.

Summary Harnessing solar energy for CO2 conversion to fuels presents a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, finding an economical, stable, non-toxic nanomaterial catalyst poses a significant challenge. Understanding the catalyst's active state is vital for optimal performance due to potential structural changes during reactions. Herein, we employ various in situ characterizations to detail δ-FeOOH's structural evolution during hydrogen activation, identifying its active phase while catalyzing the heterogeneous reduction of CO2 by H2. Using in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy, δ-FeOOH is first dehydrated to α-Fe2O3, then reduced to Fe3O4, and finally to α-Fe. Other in situ characterizations revealed that the active state of the catalyst (Fe-350-H2) is a mixture of Fe3O4 and α-Fe. A detailed investigation into the photocatalytic CO2 reduction using batch, flow, and LED reactors unveiled that the Fe-350-H2 catalyst exhibits superior activity and selectivity in activating the reverse water gas shift reaction compared with similar iron-based catalysts.

Objectives/Scope In light of the global transition towards the 1.5-degree pathway, the need for alternative power sources becomes increasingly crucial. However, the rapid growth in the number of wells has led to a substantial rise in power consumption. Currently, ESP systems account for a significant portion, approximately 19%, of the company's power consumption, with an upward trend. To address this challenge, this study aims to employ data analytics and Six Sigma tools to identify and implement methods for optimizing power consumption and enhancing energy efficiency within ESP systems. Methods, Procedures, Process The study commenced by gathering data for approximately 20 ESP parameters along with corresponding power consumption readings from a comprehensive sample of 250 wells. The data underwent meticulous verification and validation processes, ensuring technical and analytical accuracy. To gain insights into the relationship between power consumption and ESP parameters, graphical tools were employed for in-depth analysis. The analysis revealed two primary parameters that consistently contributed to higher power consumption in ESP systems when compared to their design specifications. The team then embarked on developing models aimed at concurrently reducing these identified parameters, namely voltage and tubing head pressure, without compromising production levels. The models demonstrated a promising reduction in power consumption, ranging from 8% to 24%, based on a sample of wells. Subsequently, the team implemented the identified optimizations on the selected wells, which resulted in tangible reductions in power consumption. Encouraged by these positive outcomes, the exercise was replicated across other wells within the field, yielding significant improvements in energy efficiency. Results, Observations, Conclusions The impact of the power consumption optimization measures implemented across the entire company's ESP systems, encompassing approximately 1,000 units equipped with variable speed drives, has yielded remarkable results. Calculations based on electricity tariffs indicate an annual cost savings of $3.0 million. This substantial reduction in operational expenses not only enhances the financial performance of the company but also reinforces its commitment to sustainability. In terms of environmental impact, the power reduction initiatives have led to a significant reduction of approximately 5,500 tons of CO2 emissions annually. The successful implementation of optimizations yielded significant financial savings and environmental benefits. This study establishes a foundation for future energy management strategies, emphasizing the potential for widespread adoption in the oil industry. Novel/Additive Information The study's noteworthy aspect is the successful integration of Six Sigma tools and data analytics, providing a structured framework for optimizing ESP systems. This approach enhanced clarity and direction, making the comprehensive analysis of parameters manageable. Critical factors influencing power consumption were identified, leading to accurate models and significant energy savings. The synergy between data analytics and Six Sigma showcases a novel and additive approach for optimizing energy management in ESP systems, with potential for broader application in complex systems across industries.

Iron- and Cu–Zn-containing carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysts based on natural aluminosilicate nanotubes and zeolite H-ZSM-5 are synthesized. Their textural and acidic properties are studied via low-temperature nitrogen adsorption–desorption, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen, and elemental analysis. The effect the temperatures of the reaction have on the conversion of CO2 and distribution of its product is studied. Catalysts based on aluminosilicate halloysite nanotubes exhibit methanol and С2–С4 hydrocarbon selectivities of 88 and 16%, respectively.

The lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO2) batteries hold promise for energy storage, given their capacity to capture and convert carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the practical application of Li-CO2 batteries continues to face substantial obstacles caused by sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution kinetics, resulting in high overpotential and short lifespan. This work presents the fabrication of a highly effective MoO2@Mo2C heterostructure hybrid catalyst using a CO2 oxidation strategy. This strategy integrated (in-situ) MoO2 onto the surface of two-dimensional (2D) Mo2C MXene, enhancing catalytic activity while preserving 2D electron/ion pathways. As a result, the MoO2@Mo2C, when used as a catalyst in Li-CO2 battery showcased a discharge capacity of 20790.8 mAh/g at a current density of 200 mA g−1. Notably, it achieved a long cycling life of 230 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh/g with a voltage gap as low as 1.85 V, which was significantly superior to that of a pristine Mo2CTx catalyst (3.61 V after twenty cycles). This work provides critical insights into the design of MXenes-based high-performance catalysts for advanced Li-CO2 batteries.

Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO2) foam mobility control in CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery can improve the storage potential and oil production by reducing CO2 mobility and increasing reservoir sweep efficiency. A coreflooding study of CO2 foam strength and stability during the co-injection of CO2 and a nonionic surfactant (CO2 foam) solution with and without hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymers was conducted, including one experiment adding chromium cross-linker solution to the surfactant-polymer solution, to assess gelation effects to assess the effects on improving CO2 mobility reduction. Foam strength, stability, and propagation at unsteady-state flow were compared between the surfactant-based CO2 foam and the polymer-enhanced foam (PEF) solution at 70% foam quality in sandstone cores at scales of 9 cm and 83 cm in length, and rates of 2 ft/day and 4 ft/day. In addition, pure CO2 was injected after foam to identify dynamic changes in foam stability and determine CO2 flow reduction efficiency of the solutions after their placement. Furthermore, the experiment with the 83 cm core added a stage of injection with a chromium cross-linker solution to the surfactant-polymer solution to assess the propagation and strength of the PEF gelled. Apparent viscosity quantified foam strength during co-injections of CO2 foam and CO2 PEF. Adding HPAM polymers significantly increased the foam's apparent viscosity, efficiently creating a stronger foam. PEF propagated at a higher differential pressure compared to CO2 foam, but differential pressure did not increase substantially during the injection of several pore volumes. While the effect of foam injections without polymer was fully reversible during pure CO2 injections, polymer-enhanced foams could significantly reduce the flow of CO2 after placement. The PEF floods high DP showed that the polymer has the ability to block flow channels. The chromium cross-linker with the polymer solution showed that gelation occurred during injection, after which gel entirely blocked the core so CO2 could not enter. Higher rates showed the shearthining behavior of foams and a higher impact on reducing flow mobility during and after the PEF placement. Foam with added polymers may be promising for CO2 mobility reduction during and after placement. Foam has been acknowledged to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) mobility during its injection in a porous media from pore scale to field scale. Therefore, enhancing in-situ CO2 foam propagation into sedimentary reservoirs is essential to maximize CO2 storage and EOR, and it may be achieved by adding polymers in the liquid lamellae.

On the way to climate neutrality manufacturing companies need to assess the Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of their products as a basis for emission reduction measures. The evaluate this so-called Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) life cycle analysis as a comprehensive method is applicable, but means great effort and requires interdisciplinary knowledge. Nevertheless, assumptions must still be made to assess the entire supply chain. To lower these burdens and provide a digital tool to estimate the PCF with less input parameter and data, we make use of machine learning techniques and develop an editorial framework called MINDFUL. This contribution shows its realization by providing the software architecture, underlying CO2 factors, calculations and Machine Learning approach as well as the principles of its user experience. Our tool is validated within an industrial case study.

The excessive consumption of fossil fuels increases CO2 emissions, and the consequent greenhouse effect resulting from higher levels of this gas in the atmosphere has a significant impact on the environment and climate. This has necessitated the development of environmentally friendly and efficient methods for CO2 conversion. The carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR), which is driven by electricity generated by renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar) to convert CO2 into value-added fuels or chemicals, is regarded as a promising prospective path toward carbon cycling. Among the various products, formate, with its relatively simple preparation process, has broad application prospects, and can be used as fuel, hydrogen storage material, and raw material for downstream chemicals. Sn-based oxide electrocatalysts have the advantages of being inexpensive and nontoxic. In addition, these catalysts offer high product selectivity and are regarded as promising catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate. In this review, we first clarify the reaction mechanisms and factors that influence the reduction of CO2 to formate, and then provide some examples of technologies that could be used to study the evolution of catalysts during the reaction. In particular, we focus on traditional Sn-based oxides (SnO2) and novel Sn-based perovskite oxides that have been developed for use in the field of CO2RR in recent years by considering their synthesis, catalytic performance, optimization strategies, and intrinsic principles. Finally, the current challenges and opportunities for Sn-based oxide electrocatalysts are discussed. The perspectives and latest trends presented in this review are expected to inspire researchers to contribute more efforts toward comprehensively optimizing the performance of the CO2RR to produce formate.

Copper (Cu) emerges as a highly efficient and cheap catalytic agent for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR), promising a sustainable route toward carbon neutrality. Despite its utility, the Cu catalyst exhibits limitations in terms of product selectivity, highlighting the need for the development of a superior catalyst design. Herein, we present a density functional theory (DFT) investigation into the selectivities of Cu-M (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, Zn, Ag, Au) bimetallic catalysts (BMCs) for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The interaction between the metals of Cu-M makes the surface electrons reconstruct so that the d-band center shifts to the Fermi level. In terms of CO2 activation, the Cu-Ni catalyst exhibits superior performance. Additionally, the Cu-Pd catalyst favors the formation of *COH along the reaction pathway, favoring the generation of CH4. Conversely, the Cu-Ni catalyst preferentially produces *CHO, thereby favoring the production of CH3OH. For the Cu-Ag catalyst, the reaction intermediates along the C2 pathway are *CO-*CHO and *COH-*CHO. The Cu-Ni catalyst follows a reaction path that proceeds via *CO-*CO → *CO-*COH → *COH-CHO. On the other hand, the Cu-Pt catalyst exhibits a reaction sequence of *CO-*CO → *CO-*CHO → *OCH-*OCH. This study provides guiding significance for the design of Cu-based bimetallic catalysts aimed at improving the selectivities and efficiency of the CO2RR process.

Abstract In-situ electricity generation concepts and design precautions for the proposed system including the main goal which are related to reducing the environmental pollution due to the combustion of fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide (CO2). This reduction will be attained through a proposed smart gas well design and completion. The design is based on in-situ combustion for a gas flow in a downhole combustion chamber. Oxy-fuel combustion technique is the proposed combustion technique due to the ease of CO2 separation in this process. The proper well design will be analogous to the wells used for in-situ oil combustion to handle the high released temperature and the power generation design will combine the fundamentals of geothermal energy deployment for electricity generation. Finally, the produced CO2 from the combustion process will be reinjected downhole into an underground geological structure after being compressed and transferred to the supercritical phase. This process eliminates the CO2 production to the surface and hence reduce the environmental pollution.

The electrolysis of (bi)carbonate solutions can upgrade captured carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals and fuels. This style of electrolysis relies on a pH swing to release the CO2 from the sorbent. Here, we report a bicarbonate electrolyzer equipped with an operando Raman spectroscopic probe that can measure the pH, at or near the cathode surface, as a function of current density. We correlate this cathode surface pH to the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction products when electrolyzing (bi)carbonate, a CO2 capture solution, set at different pH values. Our results show that C2 products (C2H5OH) are favored over C1 products (CO, CH4, HCOO–) when the pH at the cathode surface is high. This trend is consistent with the literature. However, at higher current densities and where the surface pH is highest, C2 product formation is actually less favored. This outcome is because less CO2 reactant is available for C−C coupling events. Consequently, the highest Faradaic efficiency for C2 product formation (22%) occurred at the lowest current density measured (100 mA cm−2).

In the context of rising global energy demands driven by population growth and urbanization, the construction industry significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions during the construction phase and subsequent energy consumption. Fossil fuel dependency for heating and energy needs exacerbates climate change, necessitating urgent solutions. Algal technology emerges as a promising strategy for green building practices, addressing energy efficiency and emissions reduction. Algae's unique ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) through photosynthesis is harnessed by deploying photobioreactors on building exteriors. Studies indicate that each kilogram of dry algae consumes 1.83 kg of CO2 while offering applications as organic fertilizer, oil, and protein sources. This technology not only diminishes CO2 emissions but also transforms wastewater and generates bioenergy, catering to building energy requirements. Algal technology's economic and environmental significance becomes evident through carbon capture, energy generation, and circular waste management, aligning with sustainability principles. This study highlights the potential of algal technology to shape the future of eco-friendly conscious construction practices, providing avenues for reduced emissions, efficient energy utilization, and sustainable development.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce fuels and chemicals has garnered significant attention. However, achieving control over the selectivity of the resulting products remains a challenging task, particularly within molecular systems. In this study, we employed a molecular silver complex immobilized on graphitized mesoporous carbon (GMC) as a catalyst for converting CO2 into CO, achieving an impressive selectivity of over 90% at -1.05 V vs RHE. Notably, the newly formed silver nanoparticles emerged as the active sites responsible for this high CO selectivity rather than the molecular system. Intriguingly, the introduction of copper ions into the restructured Ag-nanoparticle-decorated carbon altered the product selectivity. At -1.1 V vs RHE in 0.1 M KCl, we achieved a high C2 selectivity of 75%. Furthermore, not only the Ag-Cu bimetallic nanoparticle but also the small-sized Ag-Cu nanocluster decorated over GMC was proposed as active sites during catalytic reactions. Our straightforward approach offers valuable insights for fine-tuning the product selectivity of immobilized molecular systems, extending beyond C1 products.

Adsorption-based capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) to upgrade natural gas offer a promising solution for energy crisis and the reduction of CO2 emission. However, trade-off between high adsorption selectivity and rapid kinetic is an inherent shortcoming of size-sieving based adsorptive separation of gas molecules at similar sizes, hindering the launch of sieving adsorbent for practical challenging selective gas capture. Herein, a gradiently porous carbon nanofiber PCF-800 with interconnected sieving ultramicropores and low-proportion surficial mesopores is tailor-made to simultaneously realize the exclusive and rapid capture of CO2 from CH4. Arising from the unique interconnected micro-mesoporous structure, the as-prepared PCF-800 not only achieves remarkable uptake ratio of 45 (298 K, 1 bar) for CO2/CH4 separation via size-sieving effect but also shows fast kinetic with diffusion rate of 1.35 × 10-3 s−1, outperforming the conventional ultramicroporous counterpart. Moreover, the impressive dynamic CO2/CH4 separation factor up to 21.7 and satisfying cycling durability revealed by the breakthrough experiments further imply the industrial potential of PCF-800 in practical CH4 purification. This work may shed light on the design of gradient sieving carbonaceous adsorbent with high selectivity and fast kinetic for extensive high-performance small gas separation.

Outcrops of the Oligocene-Pliocene coal-bearing Tankhoi suite are traced along the southern shore of Lake Baikal and submerge under its Southern Basin, in which several hydrate-bearing zones of focused discharge of hydrocarbon fluids have been found. To test the hypothesis that coals of the Tankhoi Suite can be sources of hydrocarbon gases in these zones, we collected coal samples from the Shakhterskaya Gorka outcrop. The experiment on gas generation from the selected samples was carried out in a special autoclave at a temperature of 90°C for eight months. This paper presents the results of this study, which confirm the important role of gas generation processes from coals in the formation of fluids in the Kedr mud volcano. Further migration of gases was accompanied by biodegradation and the formation of secondary microbial methane due to CO2 reduction. This was one of the reasons for the observed carbon isotopic pattern in methane (heavier than ‒50‰ VPDB) and carbon dioxide (positive values) taken from near-surface sediments and hydrates of the Kedr mud volcano, as well as for the significant enrichment of authigenic siderites in the heavy 13C isotope.

The concurrent utilization of an adsorbent and absorbent for carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption with synergistic effects presents a promising technique for CO2 capture. Here, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole acetate ([Bmim][Ac]), with a high affinity for CO2, and the molecular sieve SAPO-34 were selected. The impregnation method was used to composite the hybrid samples of [Bmim][Ac]/SAPO-34, and the pore structure and surface property of prepared samples were characterized. The quantity and kinetics of the sorbed CO2 for loaded samples were measured using thermogravimetric analysis. The study revealed that SAPO-34 could retain its pristine structure after [Bmim][Ac] loading. The CO2 uptake of the loaded sample was 1.879 mmol g-1 at 303 K and 1 bar, exhibiting a 20.6% rise compared to that of the pristine SAPO-34 recording 1.558 mmol g-1. The CO2 uptake kinetics of the loaded samples were also accelerated, and the apparent mass transfer resistance for CO2 sorption was significantly reduced by 11.2% compared with that of the pure [Bmim][Ac]. The differential scanning calorimetry method revealed that the loaded sample had a lower CO2 desorption heat than that of the pure [Bmim][Ac], and the CO2 desorption heat of the loaded samples was between 30.6 and 40.8 kJ mol-1. The samples exhibited good cyclic stability. This material displays great potential for CO2 capture applications, facilitating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) helps to build a sustainable carbon cycle system. The selectivity and stability of CO2RR catalysts can be tuned by manipulating Metal-Support Interaction (MSI). Here, we conducted a theoretical and experimental research on the interaction between Ag nanoparticles and diverse crystal faces of Cu2O. It was found the strong electron transfer from Ag to (100) facet of hexahedral Cu2O enabled the formation of charge-redistributed interface with positively charged Ag and negatively charged Cu2O, which was more favorable to the stability of integrated structure and CO2-to-CO catalytic process compared to Ag-decorated octahedral and dodecahedral Cu2O with exposed (111) and (110) facets, respectively. Consequently, the composite of Ag on hexahedral Cu2O exhibited an impressive CO Faradaic efficiency of 93%, surpassing Ag on octahedral and dodecahedral Cu2O as well as individual Ag and Cu2O nanoparticles. This work provides an effective avenue to tune CO2RR process by interface engineering.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce ethylene (C2H4) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C2H4 production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal‐free catalysis remains a challenge. Noted piperazine with sp3 N hybridization is beneficial to CO2 capture, but CO2RR performance and mechanism have been lacking. Herein, based on linkage engineering, we construct a novel high‐density sp3 N catalytic array via introducing piperazine into the crystalline and microporous aminal‐linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to its high sp3 N density, strong CO2 capture capacity and great hydrophilicity, aminal‐linked COF successfully achieves the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 with a Faraday efficiency up to 19.1%, which is stand out in all reported metal‐free COF electrocatalysts. In addition, a series of imine‐linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of sp3 N in enhancing the kinetics of CO2RR. Therefore, this work reveals the extraordinary potential of linkage engineering in COFs to break through some catalytic bottlenecks.

Carbon dioxide reduction by amine absorption is considered the most technologically advanced method. This method is particularly recommended for gases with low CO2 concentrations, such as flue gases. On the other hand, the use of amine absorption solutions can contribute to the emission of harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. This paper presents the emission of amines and their degradation products from a CO2 capture pilot plant treating a slipstream (approximately 200 m3N/h) of flue gas from a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The studies were conducted during a 2-week research campaign at the Łaziska Power Plant in Poland. An aqueous blend of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (25 % AMP) with piperazine (9 % PZ) was used as the absorption liquid. Among others, ammonia (12 ppmv), acetone (1 ppmv) and AMP (20 ppmv) were found to be the main contaminants in the clean gas (from the absorber). However, it should be noted that only single water wash section was used. The composition of the CO2 produced (from the desorber) was also measured. It was shown that the main pollutants were water vapor (3–4 % vol.), ammonia (2–6 ppmv), nitrogen oxide, formaldehyde, and formic acid (sum, up to 10 ppmv). Traces of acetone were also detected. The composition of this gas is of practical importance for the planned management of the captured CO2 stream. During the studies, the CO2 capture efficiency was in the range of 86.6 %-94.6 %. The average specific reboiler heat duty (gross) was 3.24 MJ/kg of removed CO2.

A novel series of nickel (Ni) loaded on Fibrous Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (CHE-SM) support with varying Ni contents (x=1 to 30 wt.%) were synthesized, denoted as xNi/CHE-SM and then investigated for carbon dioxide (CO2) methanation. The catalysts underwent comprehensive characterization using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FESEM, FTIR-KBr, H2-TPR, and CO2-TPD techniques. The XRD and FESEM analyses confirmed the structural integrity of CHE-SM, irrespective of the Ni loading. However, the size of the nanocrystalline NiO particles appeared to be influenced by the Ni loading. Notably, 20Ni/CHE-SM exhibited the highest CO2 conversion of 92% at 350 °C, demonstrating its potential for low-temperature activation. H2-TPR and CO2-TPD results revealed favorable NiO reduction at lower temperatures, indicating medium-strength basicity that facilitated efficient CO2 and H2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, 20Ni/CHE-SM exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to other catalysts, with lower activation energy (61.5 kJ/mol). Kinetic studies focusing on 20Ni/CHE-SM indicated a molecular adsorption mechanism of CO2 and H2 on a single site after evaluation using four Langmuir-Hinshelwood models. This result was attributed to the high amount of medium strength basicity possessed by the 20Ni/CHE-SM catalyst which provided an abundance of adsorption sites, resulting in greater fractional coverage of reactants and enhancing the CH4 formation rate.

The aerobic oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide is catalysed by the Mo/Cu‐containing CO‐dehydrogenase enzyme in the soil bacterium Oligotropha carboxidovorans, enabling the organism to grow on the small gas molecule as carbon and energy source. It was shown experimentally that silver can be substituted for copper in the active site of Mo/Cu CODH to yield a functional enzyme. In this study, we employed QM/MM calculations to investigate whether the reaction mechanism of the silver‐substituted enzyme is similar to that of the native enzyme. Our results suggest that the Ag‐substituted enzyme can oxidize CO and release CO2 following the same reaction steps as the native enzyme, with a computed rate‐limiting step of 10.4 kcal/mol, consistent with experimental findings. Surprisingly, lower activation energies for C–O bond formation have been found in the presence of silver. Furthermore, comparison of rate constants for reduction of copper‐ and silver‐containing enzymes suggests a discrepancy in the transition state stabilization upon silver substitution. We also evaluated the effects that differences in the water‐active site interaction may exert on the overall energy profile of catalysis. Finally, the formation of a thiocarbonate intermediate along the catalytic pathway was found to be energetically unfavorable for the Ag‐substituted enzyme.

Abstract In the energy transition era, Colombia has been evaluating different technologies as a commitment to increasing oil recovery and energy efficiency (EE) while at the same time reducing carbon intensity (CI), which represents a big challenge, particularly for heavy oil exploitation. One of the hybrid technologies under evaluation involves the combination of steam and flue gas (FG) to replace volumes of steam with a waste stream of FG from different industrial sources, including gas from steam generators. In that sense, Ecopetrol has been developing an R&D program that includes experimental studies such as a phase behavior evaluation for steam hybrid processes to support numerical studies [Pérez, R. et al., 2020; Pérez, R. et al., 2023]. The methodology for constructing a phase behavior model based on experimental tests that contemplate Carbon dioxide (CO2) solubility in oil and water and its impact on crude oil production and CI is developed and incorporated into a field-sector model for the hybrid steam + FG process. The CO2 and FG (15.24% CO2-84.76% N2) solubility in heavy crude oil at 19.2 SCF/STB were measured to identify its effect on the viscosity, density, and possible compositional changes at two different temperatures (110°F and 302°F) and three pressure conditions (250, 700, and 1,200 psi) to represent the effect of steam injection. In addition, heavy oil fractions were characterized by distillation curves analysis. The use of data from laboratory experiments allowed the development of a numerical fluid model that represents the CO2-Oil interaction through the vapor-liquid K-values obtained by fitting an EOS model, and the liquid-liquid K values that define the interaction CO2-water interaction were calculated using Henry´s model. Experimental evaluations showed at low temperatures, solubility increases with pressure, reaching gas-oil ratios (GOR) values close to 376.7 SCF/STB and 49.7 SCF/STB at the highest-pressure condition and reducing the viscosity of crude oil by 98% and 56% with CO2 and FG, respectively. However, at high temperatures, solubility decreased by 62% and 52% with less impact on oil viscosity reduction. The compositional profiles of the gas and liquid phases showed no increase in intermediate components, which indicates that the injected gases do not have the capacity to extract light hydrocarbons from the liquid phase. Incorporating the phase behavior into the field-sector model was a key feature for estimating an equivalent CO2 storage of 1,360 tons associated with retaining part of the CO2 injected in the remaining water and crude oil coupled with an incremental oil production of 33,000 barrels. This phase behavior study contributes to a better understanding of phenomena associated with steam-based hybrid technologies that positively affect the production of hydrocarbons and the reduction of emissions due to CO2 trapping effects associated with solubility in reservoir fluids, contributing to Colombian energy efficiency goals.

The global surge in the warming trend is predominantly attributed to the substantial release of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide. Despite continuous international efforts to curb these emissions, our country, marked by the largest population and energy consumption, stands as a major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Unlike developed nations, we face a more formidable challenge in reducing emissions, demanding intensified endeavors. To address climate change, our nation has set a crucial carbon emission target: achieving a carbon peak before 2030 and attaining carbon neutrality by 2060. The "14th Five-Year Plan" of each province underscores the significance of "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality," tailoring emission reduction policies to individual economic landscapes. Current research inadequacies hinder theoretical guidance needed to meet the 2030 carbon peak. Crafting province-specific emission reduction strategies is thus imperative. This study aims to scrutinize national and regional carbon dioxide emissions in four distinct Chinese regions, utilizing the STIRPAT model to predict emissions from 2020 to 2030 under the "low development and strong low carbon" paradigm. Initial analysis from 2004 to 2019 showed an annual increase in national and provincial carbon dioxide emissions, revealing significant regional differences. Six prominent factors influencing emissions were identified. The STIRPAT model predicted emissions for 2020 to 2030, indicating that achieving carbon peaking before 2030 is unfeasible under the baseline scenario. However, within the "low development and strong low carbon" framework, attaining this goal becomes plausible.

Abstract This paper focuses on the urgent need to a sustainable food production system and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the food supply chain, which account for over one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The objective is to identify areas for increasing food production and waste reduction areas targeting environmental sustainability. The study analyzes time series data spanning 60 years, encompassing food production, population growth, carbon dioxide emissions, and daily calorie intake by humans to understand where efficiency is needed. In addition to the data analysis, the paper includes a thorough examination of the current body of literature on strategies for reducing waste in the food supply chain. By combining original contributions with established knowledge, this paper synthesizes existing information while also introducing fresh insights into the field of food supply chain waste reduction approaches aiming at sustainable environmental performance. In the study's findings, the time series data analysis reveals an overproduction of food, surpassing the actual demand highlighting the need for sustainable supply chain practices. The slopes of the human daily food consumption curve, food production, and carbon dioxide production in the environment demonstrate a similar pattern, with an equivalent slope compared to the relatively lower slope of population growth. This observation suggests a correlation between these variables, indicating their contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Further investigation of the relationship among these variables is essential to develop effective strategies aimed at sustainable food consumption and production. Among the fifty-seven papers received for the existing literature study, only two papers dealt with environmental performance, therefore more research is looked-for environmental performance regard. The application of lean principles, proven effective in various research, is advocated as a powerful tool for reducing food waste-related carbon dioxide emissions. Lean methodologies should be implemented at each stage of the supply chain to minimize waste. By targeting a reduction in food loss and waste, production needs to be aligned with demand or surplus production can be preserved through processing. The findings of the food consumption and production pattern along with the waste reduction approach support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goals 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and 13 (Climate Action). Finally, this article later contributes to the theory of sustainable production and waste reduction towards the environmental footprint of the food supply chain.

In this work, agricultural biomass waste was gasified in a two-zone tubular reactor in the presence of steam. Firstly, during preliminary experiments the effect of temperature in the 1st and 2nd reactor zone, as well as the influence of catalysts and steam/raw material ratio was investigated, then the reusability of catalysts was also studied during ten regeneration cycles. Based on the preliminary results, in the 1st reactor zone a lower temperature was used (400°C), where the yield of carbon dioxide was ∼55%, which has a positive effect on numerous reactions, also it can be converted to carbon monoxide with proper catalysts with in-situ process. Regarding the temperature, it is important to be mentioned that a significant difference was observed in the yield of synthesis gas at 700°C thus, the experiments were carried out using 700°C in the 2nd reactor zone. A natural (Clinoptilolite) and a synthetic zeolite (ZSM-5), a mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) and a carbon dioxide capturing carrier (CaO) were selected and impregnated with nickel for further use and for enhancing the yield of synthesis gas and hydrogen during the gasification process. The utilization of catalysts helped the in-situ reduction of carbon dioxide while their performance in the gasification process during the regeneration cycles was also investigated. Henceforward, the tested Ni/ZSM-5, Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Clinoptilolite, reduced the amount of carbon monoxide from the 5th regeneration cycles, while the amount carbon dioxide with the four mentioned catalysts was decreased by 15-35 mmol/g raw material, compared to the results obtained during thermal degradation.

Abstract The Paris Agreement has prompted a growing global sense of urgency to mitigate the climate impact of industrialization. Countries and corporations have committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, setting short, medium, and long-term targets for achieving this goal. Notably, the LNG industry is shifting as LNG is the transition fuel of decarbonization journey and major energy buyers seek carbon neutral energy sources to reduce emissions. Oman passed a Royal decree that endorsed the year 2050 as the designated target for attaining a state of net zero emissions. Additionally, this decree involved the formulation of a comprehensive national strategy and the establishment of the Oman Sustainability Centre, all aimed at facilitating the realization of this goal. Aligning with this trend and our mission, Oman LNG (OLNG) has undertaken key initiatives to reduce flaring, ensuring the delivery of clean, reliable energy with lower GHG intensity. OLNG has a well-developed flare abatement strategy and has top quartile Pacesetter of recent benchmarks in the LNG industry. Through a combination of operational best practices and design modifications, OLNG has significantly minimized flaring, ultimately resulting in achieving zero routine flaring as part of its normal operations. Despite the above, Oman LNG continues to pursue further improvements with respect to flaring reduction in safety and non-routine flaring events. An area of focus is on ship gassing up operations. Part of Oman LNG Annual Delivery Program is to accommodate ships which are scheduled for dry dock and inerted with Carbon Dioxide or Nitrogen. These ships must be purged to the flare to decrease CO2 or Nitrogen content to an acceptable level. This prevents disruptions in the fuel gas system by avoiding freezing at boil of gas demisters due to high CO2 content or discharge temperature rise and compressor trip due to high N2 content. In close collaboration with our valued customers, we embarked on a concerted effort to significantly reduce flaring during the ship gassing up operations. This endeavor was achieved through the strategic introduction of an innovative methodology known as the Direct Cooldown Method, which circumvents the conventional ship gassing up procedure. This novel approach entails the utilization of LNG dilution, primarily directed at ships that have been inerted with N2. The essence of this procedure lies in the gradual blending of the cargo tank content with vaporized LNG. Once the tank pressures attain a predetermined threshold and the quality of the diluted vapor aligns with Oman LNG specification, the resulting diluted vapor is channeled ashore directly to fuel gas system. Extensive assessments determined the feasibility of this approach, resulting in the modification of operating procedures for safe and reliable implementation. The successful implementation of this method leads to a truly remarkable outcome – the total elimination of flaring from the ship gassing up operation. Undeniably, this pioneering method aligns with Oman LNG long-term decarbonization plan, supporting the ambitious goal of becoming a carbon-neutral LNG producer.

Halogen-free organophosphorus flame retardants have promising application prospects due to their excellent safety and environmental protection properties. A cobalt-coordinated cyclic phosphonitrile flame retardant (Co@CPA) was synthesized via a hydrothermal method using hexachlorocyclotriphosphonitrile (HCCP), 5-amino-tetrazolium (5-AT), and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2∙6H2O) as starting materials. The structure was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites were prepared by incorporating 10-(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphame-10-oxide (ODOPB), Co@CPA, and silicon dioxide (SiO2) via melt blending. The flame-retardant performance and thermal stability of the TPU composites were evaluated through limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical combustion (UL-94), TG, and cone calorimetric (CCT) tests. SEM and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze the surface morphology and structure of the residual carbon. A synergistic flame-retardant effect of ODOPB and Co@CPA was observed, with the most effective flame retardancy achieved at a TPU:ODOPB:Co@CPA:SiO2 ratio of 75:16:8:1. This composition exhibited an LOI value of 26.5% and achieved a V-0 rating in the UL-94 test. Furthermore, compared to pure TPU, the composite showed reductions in total heat release, CO production, and CO2 production by 6.6%, 39.4%, and 48.9%, respectively. Our research findings suggest that Co@CPA demonstrates outstanding performance, with potential for further expansion in application areas. Different metal-based cyclic phosphonitrile compounds are significant in enriching phosphorus-based fine chemicals.

We examine the effect of climate-induced temporary extreme weather events on the natural real interest rate by incorporating environmental aspects into a Keynesian growth model. We find that environmental damage accentuates the reduction in the natural real interest rate caused by climate-induced temporary supply disruptions, and this effect is even more pronounced when the estimate of the current stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles.

The deterioration of carbon steel in saline solutions enriched with carbon dioxide represents a significant challenge within the oil and gas industry. So, this study focuses on the design and structural analysis of four azo derivatives: 4-(2-quinolinylazo)-catechol (AZN-1), 4-(4-phenoxyphenylazo)-1-naphthol (AZN-2), 4-(4-pyridylazo)-1-naphthol (AZN-3), and 4-(2-pyridylazo)-1-naphthol (AZN-4), and their first application as effective corrosion inhibitors for carbon steel in a carbon dioxide saturated 3.5% sodium chloride solution. Spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the structural configurations of these compounds. The corrosion protection properties of these compounds on carbon steel in a carbon dioxide saturated 3.5% sodium chloride solution (under sweet conditions) were investigated using Tafel polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) studies. The results indicate that the inhibition efficiency increases as the concentration of the inhibitors increases. There is a notable agreement between the results obtained from the PDP and EIS measurements, supporting the findings. Moreover, the results displayed that these compounds had significant corrosion protection capabilities at low concentrations, ranging from 91.0 to 98.3% at an additive concentration of 5 × 10–4 M. The PDP profiles showed that these compounds acted as mixed inhibitors, and their adsorption behavior followed the Langmuir isotherm model. Besides, EIS results corroborate the adsorption of AZN compounds through a reduction in double-layer capacitance (Cdl) alongside an augmentation in polarization resistance (Rp) after the addition of AZN compounds into the corrosive solution. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the formation of a protective layer on the surface of carbon steel when these inhibitors were applied. In addition, computational calculations and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to support the experimental observations, gain insights into the adsorption properties, and elucidate the corrosion inhibition mechanisms of these compounds.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which began during early 2020, had been a worldwide problem, resulting in significant fatalities. In China, the pandemic resulted in strict lockdowns, restricted movement, and reduced transportation. This resulted in improvement of air quality in many cities in China. The objective of the study is to compare the nature of air quality pre-COVID period (2018-2019) and during COVID period (2020-2201). The following air quality parameters were investigated, air quality index (AQI), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). The present investigation results will augment to the current understanding on the air pollution situation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jiangsu Province in China. The study revealed that air quality in Jiangsu Province improved during the months when COVID-19 positive cases increased. The reduction in air pollutants concentrations started during 2020 and reached a maximum during 2021. Overall the air quality index (AQI) improved by 8.2 % and air pollutant reductions achieved were, PMs (≈ 21%), SO2 (26.2 %), NO2 (13.6 %), O3 (2.4 %) and CO (10.4 %). Cities in Jiangsu Province with high air pollutant concentrations achieved a moderate reduction. The correlation between air pollutants and AQI was positive except for O3. The implications of the study are, reduction of fossil fuel powered vehicles and industrial activity can make notable positive impact on the air quality of the region.

The emission factor method is utilised to establish an emission inventory of CO2 and air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, CO, VOC, NH3) for the cement industry in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region from 2018 to 2020. CO2 and CO are prominent among the eight atmospheric emissions, up to 55.06 Mt, 45.40 Mt, and 66.87 Mt, and 123.74 kt, 99.42 kt, and 147.02 kt in 2018-2020, respectively. Furthermore, the emissions from Tangshan and Shijiazhuang account for nearly 50% of the total emissions in the region, based on the design capacity of cement enterprises in different cities. Finally, considering emission reduction technologies and the impact of cement production, the potential for CO2 and major air pollutant emissions reduction in 2030 and 2050 is predicted. According to the scenarios, the emission reduction of CO2, PM2.5, SO2, and NOx will all exceed half in 2030.

In order to assess the possible toxic effect of potassium chloride used in conjunction with mineral nitrogen fertilizers the authors studied the structural and functional components of the microbial complex of chernozem, in particular, its prokaryotic component. The object of research was soil samples of typical chernozem, selected from the vegetation experience with variants with the introduction of nitrogen-phosphorus and ni-trogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizers. To obtain a stable effect of easily soluble salts on the microbial community of the soil, long-term composting of soil samples was carried out with alternating cycles of moistening and drying of the soil. During the first two years of composting, the researches detected the suppression of carbon dioxide emissions; however the suppression leveled out only 5 years later. The initial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, as well as denitrification activity, reached twofold values. The negative effect was manifested when the content of chlorides and nitrates in the soil was significantly lower than the gradation established for slightly saline soils. Prolonged composting of samples of fertile chernozem under the action of potassium chloride led to a decrease in the number and biomass of the metabolically active prokaryotic complex, which confirms its toxic effect on the microbial community of the soil. The representatives of the prokaryotic complex that are resistant and sensitive to the increased content of chlorides and nitrates in the soil have been identified. Among the representatives of the Bacteria domain, almost all were sensitive, with the exception of two phyllum Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia. For some representatives of the phylogenetic group Actinobacteria, sensitivity to chlorine ions is confirmed at the generic level (Streptomyces and Micromonospora). For the Archaea domain, representatives of the Euryarchaeota phylum are identified as the most resistant to the presence of chlorides. Thus, the suppression of the microbiological activity of chernozem during the introduction of potassium chloride explains the previously identified decrease in the availability of nutrients for plants.

Carbon nitrides are commonly employed as substrates to anchor single metal atoms. Numerous theoretical studies have previously characterized these single-atom systems using the pristine g-C3N4 structure, featuring a C6N7 motif. However, the relatively large pores in g-C3N4 may not effectively coordinate with metal cations, resulting in discordance with the coordination environment determined by experimental characterization. In this study, we introduce a novel model denoted as CN-N4, which preserves the essential g-C3N4 motif, while offering four nitrogen sites for metal binding. Compared with g-C3N4, the binding affinity between the metal and this new substrate model is significantly enhanced, similar to that of a commonly studied nitrogen-doped graphene model (N-gra). Additionally, we have assessed the catalytic performance in various reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CN-N4-supported system exhibits activity comparable to that of the corresponding N-gra-supported species. Fe- and Co-centered SACs can be promising catalysts for ORR, and relatively stable Cu-g-C3N4 is active to HER and CO2RR, consistent with reported experiments. In addition, V-CN-N4 and Rh-CN-N4 are predicted to be candidates to catalyze the HER and ORR, respectively. We suggest that the CN-N4 model aptly captures the local structure of carbon nitride-based materials with a high coordination number, providing an alternative foundation for investigating the reaction mechanisms of these single-atom catalysts.

ABSTRACT In least-developed countries (LDCs), electricity shortages are the primary barrier to economic and social growth. Some remote areas in LDC rely on diesel-based systems. However, renewable energy must be taken into account for generating electricity because of the uncertainty of diesel fuel prices and the emissions of carbon dioxide. Hybrid energy systems (HES) are becoming increasingly popular, which is unsurprising given the rapid advancement of renewable energy technologies, which have made them the preferred method to respond to the current unreliable electricity supply, reduce the impact of global warming that occurs from electricity production, and contribute to cost reduction. This study explores the feasibility of utilizing a combination of solar PV, wind energy, and battery systems with the existing diesel generator in four different locations in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. Hybrid optimization multiples for electric renewables (HOMER) is used as a tool for techno-economic analysis and finding the possible combination of solar PV, wind, diesel, and battery. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique was used to verify all configurations obtained from HOMER's results. This approach considers environmental, economic, and technological factors by utilizing the AHP, TOPSIS, EDAS, and PROMETHEEE II techniques. The results show that PV/diesel with batteries is the optimum solution. This hybrid system comprises 89% PV penetration, a cost of electricity (COE) of 0.257 $/kWh, an initial capital cost (IC) of $244,277, and a net present cost (NPC) of $476,216 for a case study in Cambodia. Furthermore, this system can reduce almost 51,005 kg/year of carbon dioxide compared to a diesel-only system, while the cost of electricity is reduced.

There is a growing interest in creating cost-effective catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to address pressing environmental issues and produce valuable products. A bimetallic ZnBi catalyst that enhances catalytic activity and stability toward the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is designed. It is based on bismuth nanodendrites grown using a facile, scalable, and low-cost method. The results have shown that the incorporation of bismuth can decrease the charge transfer resistance and facilitate CO2 reduction toward the formation of CO and formate. It was revealed that the ZnBi catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity compared with that of the pure Zn catalyst for CO2 reduction, with a lower onset potential [−0.75 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) compared with −0.85 V vs RHE for Zn]. In situ electrochemical attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to study the reaction mechanism, showing the formation of CO and formate through the adsorbed *COO– intermediates. This study has demonstrated a new approach for the feasible synthesis of high-performance catalysts for large-scale electrochemical CO2 reduction.

Introduction: Several cities in Malaysia have established plans to reduce their CO 2 emissions, in addition to Malaysia submitting a Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce its carbon intensity (against GDP) by 45% in 2030 compared to 2005. Meeting these emissions reduction goals will require a joint effort between governments, industries, and corporations at different scales and across sectors. Methods: In collaboration with national and sub-national stakeholders, we developed and used a global integrated assessment model to explore emissions mitigation pathways in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur. Guided by current climate action plans, we created a suite of scenarios to reflect uncertainties in policy ambition, level of adoption, and implementation for reaching carbon neutrality. Through iterative engagement with all parties, we refined the scenarios and focus of the analysis to best meet the stakeholders’ needs. Results: We found that Malaysia can reduce its carbon intensity and reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and that action in Kuala Lumpur can play a significant role. Decarbonization of the power sector paired with extensive electrification, energy efficiency improvements in buildings, transportation, and industry, and the use of advanced technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage will be major drivers to mitigate emissions, with carbon dioxide removal strategies being key to eliminate residual emissions. Discussion: Our results suggest a hopeful future for Malaysia’s ability to meet its climate goals, recognizing that there may be technological, social, and financial challenges along the way. This study highlights the participatory process in which stakeholders contributed to the development of the model and guided the analysis, as well as insights into Malaysia’s decarbonization potential and the role of multilevel governance.

Summary N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is a versatile chemical and universal solvent that is commonly synthesized from carbon monoxide and dimethylamine (DMA) under high temperature and pressure. However, this process leads to a large amount of carbon emissions. Herein, we propose an electrochemical strategy to directly convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and DMA to DMF under ambient conditions. Loading palladium (Pd) onto copper (Cu) nanosheet catalysts with Cu vacancies (Pd/Cu-VCu) enabled the efficient synthesis of DMF, and the maximum yield and faradaic efficiency reached 385 mmol·h−1·gcat. −1 and 37.5%, respectively. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicated that Cu vacancies (Cu-VCu) promoted the adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface, followed by its spontaneous coupling with DMA to form the C–N bond. Pd nanoparticles accelerated the electrochemical reduction of the intermediate ∗OCN(CH3)2OH to ∗OCHN(CH3)2OH, leading to highly efficient DMF electrosynthesis. This work paves the way for the synthesis of sustainable high-value organic nitrogen compounds from CO2.

Economic growth has brought global climate change into the spotlight, and CO2 emissions demonstrate significant challenges in reducing environmental shifts worldwide. Globally, the United States and China contribute the greatest amount of CO2 emissions. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between different types of CO2 emissions and economic growth by using a modeling approach. We analyze total CO2 emissions, coal CO2 emissions, oil CO2 emissions, the global share of coal CO2 emissions, the global share of oil CO2 emissions, and economic growth. This study provides unique insights into how to simultaneously reduce CO2 emissions and sustain economic growth. A bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (BARDL) simulation method is utilized to examine the long- and short-run effects of repressors on CO2 emissions. Coal CO2 emissions are found to have a significant positive effect on economic growth in the short run but a negative impact over the long run in the United States. The United States needs to implement stronger measures to balance coal CO2 emissions with economic growth for sustainable development. In contrast, oil CO2 emissions are positive for China in both the long run and short run. Thus, China can continue to reduce CO2 emissions from oil while maintaining positive economic growth. The Chinese policy can be adapted and implemented to maintain a balance between economic growth and carbon reduction. The study has valuable insights for policymakers seeking to balance economic growth with carbon reduction, emphasizing the need to better understand CO2 emissions' relationship with economic growth.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 on catalyst surfaces is hindered by the inefficient mass transfer of CO2 in aqueous solutions. In this study, we employed an electrochemical reduction approach to fabricate a hydrophobic three-dimensional nanoporous silver catalyst with a plastron effect, aiming to enhance the CO2 diffusion. The resulting catalyst exhibited an exceptional performance with the FECO peaking at 95% at -0.65 V (vs. RHE) and demonstrated remarkable stability during continuous electrolysis for 48 hours. Control experiments, together with Tafel analysis, EIS measurements, and contact angle results, confirmed that the notable enhancement of performance was attributed to the hydrophobic porous structure that facilitated efficient storage and rapid mass transfer of low-solubility CO2 gas reactants.

This paper assesses maintenance costs and reliability associated with additional risk reduction measures in a methanol plant to achieve an "as low as reasonably practicable" (ALARP) target risk level of 1 × 10−7 yearly. It proposes an approach to evaluate maintenance and reliability using economic loss risks, focusing on incidents involving piping and reactor operations. The study examines economic losses from fatalities, injuries, equipment damage, business interruptions, and emergency services due to toxicity, thermal radiation, and overpressure events at different reactor pressures. Case studies involve comparing five plants: a 76 bar normal methanol plant with a 42 m3 reactor and four modified plants with 7.6 m3 reactors at pressure of 76, 200, 350, and 500 bar. The methanol reactor contains hazardous substances: hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol. Losses, including fatalities, injuries, equipment damage, are estimated by combining consequence analysis outcomes with individual and equipment values. Business disruptions consider downtime and industry value added per employee, while emergency service losses amount to two percent of the total. Results indicate the normal methanol plant needs RM 12.7 million annually for maintenance to achieve ALARP, while modified plants reduce costs by 75% to 91% compared to the normal methanol plant.

This study aims an optimal design and performance assessment of fuel cell-based energy system for a university campus. To fulfil the average daily load, solar PV and fuel cell with combined heat and power system operate as the primary source. In the initial process, electrolyzer generates green hydrogen and solid oxide fuel cell converts the stored hydrogen into electricity with byproduct heat. Heat is further utilized with combined heat and power process performed by the thermionic and thermoelectric generators. Therefore, six different grid-connected and standalone hybrid systems are simulated in HOMER Pro software to get the optimum energy system. The performance of an optimized grid-connected solar PV-Fuel Cell system offers the optimum results: the overall green hydrogen production is 0.28 million kg/yr with levelized cost of 6.94 $/kg and the recovered heat is 1.19 GWh/yr. The electricity contributes 62.54% from solar PV, 22.45% from fuel cell, 2.91% from thermionic, 1.12% from thermoelectric, 10.95% purchase from grid, and 22.67% sold to the grid. The optimal system has $25.95 million of net present cost, 0.1084 $/kWh of levelized energy cost with 0.072 kg/kWh of carbon dioxide emissions. The overall reduction in carbon emission is 5.6% comparative to natural gas-fuelled energy system.

Abstract Injection of high-pressure CO2 into depleted gas reservoirs can lead to low temperatures promoting formation of hydrate in the near wellbore area resulting in reduced injection rates. The design of effective mitigation methods requires an understanding of the impact of crucial parameters on the formation and dissociation of CO2 hydrate within the porous medium under flowing conditions. This study investigates the influence of water saturation (ranging from 20% to 40%) on the saturation and kinetics of CO2 hydrate during continuous CO2 injection. The experiments were conducted under a medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) to monitor the dynamics of hydrate growth inside the core and to calculate the hydrate saturation profile. The experimental data reveal increase in CO2 hydrate saturation with increasing water saturation levels. The extent of permeability reduction is strongly dependent on the initial water saturation: beyond a certain water saturation the core is fully blocked. For water saturations representative of the depleted gas fields, although the amount of generated hydrate is not sufficient to fully block the CO2 flow path, a significant reduction in permeability (approximately 80%) is measured. It is also observed that the volume of water+hydrate phases increases during hydrate formation, indicating a lower-than-water density for CO2 hydrate. Having a history of hydrate at the same water saturation leads to an increase in CO2 consumption compared to the primary formation of hydrate, confirming the existence of the water memory effect in porous media.

Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pandemic‐related lockdown on Turkey's air quality throughout time and space. For this purpose, statistical techniques were used to assess daily particulate matter (PM 10 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides and nitrogen dioxide (NO x and NO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), and carbon monoxide (CO). The study's findings showed that, while the lockdown improved air quality in terms of air pollutant emissions, the most notable reduction was in NO 2 and NO x emissions. When comparing the months prior to the pandemic (November 2019 to January 2020) with the months during the pandemic (November 2020 to January 2021), the declines in NO 2 were 20%, 3%, and 0.5%, respectively. NO x emissions decreased by an average of 19% and 5% in November and December, respectively, and increased by an average of 16% in January during the pandemic. When the data for the 33 days of lockdown were compared to the data for the same 33 days the previous year, significant differences were determined at several Clean Air Centers, which were two for PM 10 , two for SO 2 , seven for NO x , four for NO 2 , two for CO, and three for O 3 , respectively. In this study, pollutant concentrations were found in the following ranges from November 2019 to January 2021: PM 10 : 3–208 µg m –3 , SO 2 : 1–56 µg m –3 , NO x : 6–600 µg m –3 , NO 2 : 4–155 µg m –3 , CO: 1–3921 µg m –3 , and O 3 : 2–119 µg m –3 . There were days that exceeded the limit values for PM 10 .

Abstract Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal (ECCO 2 R) is used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients to facilitate lung-protective ventilatory strategies. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) allows individual, non-invasive, real-time, bedside, radiation-free imaging of the lungs, providing global and regional dynamic lung analyses. To provide new insights for future ECCO2R research in ARDS, we propose a potential application of EIT to personalize End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) following each reduction in tidal volume (VT), as demonstrated in an illustrative case. A 72-year-old male with COVID-19 was admitted to the ICU for moderate ARDS. Monitoring with EIT was started to determine the optimal PEEP value (PEEP EIT ), defined as the intersection of the collapse and overdistention curves, after each reduction in VT during ECCO 2 R. The identified PEEP EIT values were notably low (< 10 cmH2O). The decrease in VT associated with PEEP EIT levels resulted in improved lung compliance, reduced driving pressure and a more uniform ventilation pattern. Despite current Randomized Controlled Trials showing that ultra-protective ventilation with ECCO 2 R does not improve survival, the applicability of universal ultra-protective ventilation settings for all patients remains a subject of debate. Inappropriately set PEEP levels can lead to alveolar collapse or overdistension, potentially negating the benefits of VT reduction. EIT facilitates real-time monitoring of derecruitment associated with VT reduction, guiding physicians in determining the optimal PEEP value after each decrease in tidal volume. This original description of using EIT under ECCO 2 R to adjust PEEP at a level compromising between recruitability and overdistention could be a crucial element for future research on ECCO 2 R.

Abstract. One of the proposed ways to reduce the climate impact of civil aviation is rerouting aircraft to minimise the formation of warming contrails. As this strategy may increase fuel consumption, it would only be beneficial if the climate impact reduction from the avoided contrails exceeds the negative impact of any additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the rerouted flight. In this study, we calculate the surface temperature response of almost half-a-million flights that crossed the North Atlantic sector in 2019 and compare to the response of hypothetical rerouted flights. The climate impacts of contrails and CO2 are assessed through the perspective of CO2-equivalence metrics, defined here as nine combinations of different definitions and time horizons. We estimate that the total emitted CO2 and the persistent contrails formed will have warmed the climate by 16.9 µK in 2039, 13.5 µK in 2069, and 14.0 µK in 2119. Under a scenario where 1 % additional carbon dioxide is enough to reroute all contrail-forming flights and avoid contrail formation completely, total warming would decrease by 4.6 (−27 %), 2.4 (−18 %), and 1.8 (−13 %) μK in 2039, 2069, and 2119, respectively. In most rerouting cases, the results based on the nine different CO2-equivalence metrics agree that rerouting leads to a climate benefit, assuming that contrails are avoided as predicted. But the size of that benefit is very dependent on the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics, contrail efficacy and CO2 penalty. Sources of uncertainty not considered here could also heavily influence the perceived benefit. In about 10 % of rerouting cases, the climate damage resulting from contrail avoidance indicated by CO2-equivalence metrics integrated over a 100-year time horizon is not predicted by metrics integrated over a 20-year time horizon. This study highlights, using North Atlantic flights as a case study, the implications of the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance, but the choice is ultimately political.

Relevance. Currently, the standardization at the international level has reached a high stage in the aviation industry. The high requirements for standardization of airfreight refer to the safety and punctuality of air travel. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to modernize and improve the technology of consolidation of dangerous goods into fire-resistant unit load device containers, which will reduce the risk of fire spread, and enable the crew to make a landing in the event of an incident. Methodology. The basis of the methodological approach in this study is a combination of system analysis of the main areas of the introduction of fire-resistant containers in modern air transport, with an analytical investigation of the main areas of modernization of fire-resistant containers intended for the transportation of dangerous goods, which in the future will contribute to a significant reduction in the risks of fires during air transportation and other emergencies that may cause forced landings of air transport. Results. It was determined that the use of fire-resistant containers reduces fuel costs and environmental improvements by minimizing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Conclusions. Thus, the developers of modern refractory materials used in the manufacture of air cargo containers have broad prospects. In addition, the use of such containers will improve working conditions due to their environmental friendliness.

Manipulation of selectivity in the catalytic electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) poses significant challenges due to inevitable structure reconstruction. One approach is to develop effective strategies for controlling reaction pathways to gain a deeper understanding of mechanisms in robust CO2RR systems. In this work, by precise introduction of 1,10-phenanthroline as a bidentate ligand modulator, the electronic property of the copper site was effectively regulated, thereby directing selectivity switch. By modification of [Cu3(btec)(OH)2]n, the use of [Cu2(btec)(phen)2]n·(H2O)n achieved the selectivity switch from ethylene (faradaic efficiency (FE) = 41%, FEC2+ = 67%) to methane (FECH4 = 69%). Various in situ spectroscopic characterizations revealed that [Cu2(btec)(phen)2]n·(H2O)n promoted the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates, leading to methane generation instead of dimerization to form C2+ products. Acting as a delocalized π-conjugation scaffold, 1,10-phenanthroline in [Cu2(btec)(phen)2]n·(H2O)n helps stabilize Cuδ+. This work presents a novel approach to regulate the coordination environment of active sites with the aim of selectively modulating the CO2RR.

The quality of the classroom environment, including ventilation, air quality and thermal conditions, has an important impact on children's health and academic achievements. The use of portable HEPA filter air cleaners is widely suggested as a strategy to mitigate exposure to particulate matter and airborne viruses. However, there is a need to quantify the relative benefits of such devices including the impacts on energy use. We present a simple coupled dynamic thermal and air quality model and apply it to naturally ventilated classrooms, representative of modern and Victorian era construction. We consider the addition of HEPA filters with, and without, reduced opening of windows, and explore concentrations of carbon dioxide (\co), \PM, airborne viral RNA, classroom temperature and energy use. Results indicate the addition of HEPA filters was predicted to reduce \PM~ by 40--60\% and viral RNA by 30--50\% depending on the classroom design and window opening behaviour. The energy cost of running HEPA filters is likely to be only 1\%--2\% of the classroom heating costs. In scenarios when HEPA filters were on and window opening was reduced (to account for the additional clean air delivery rate of the filters), the heating cost was predicted to be reduced by as much as -13\%, and these maximum reductions grew to -46\% in wintertime simulations. In these scenarios the HEPA filters result in a notable reduction in \PM~and viral RNA, but the \co\ concentration is significantly higher. The model provides a mechanism for exploring the relative impact of ventilation and air cleaning strategies on both exposures and energy costs, enabling an understanding of where trade-offs lie.

Green hydrogen is essential for producing renewable fuels that are needed in sectors that are hard to electrify directly. Hydrogen production in a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant necessitates smart planning to meet long-term hydrogen trading agreements while minimising costs and emissions. Previous research analysed economic and environmental impact of hydrogen production based on full foresight of renewable energy availabilty, electricity price, and CO2 intensity in the electricity grid. However, the full foresight assumption is impractical in day-to-day operation, often leading to underestimations of both the cost and CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production. Therefore, this research introduces a novel long-term planner that uses historical data and short-term forecasts to plan hydrogen production in the day-to-day operation of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant. The long-term planner co-minimises cost and CO2 emissions to determine the hydrogen production for the next day taking into account the remaining hydrogen production and the time remaining until the end of the delivery period, which can be a week, a month, or a year. Extended delivery periods provide operation flexibility, enabling cost and CO2 emissions reductions. Significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved with relatively small increases in the levelised cost. Under day-to-day operation, the levelised cost of hydrogen is marginally higher than that of the full foresight; the CO2 emissions can be up to 60% higher. Despite a significant portion of the produced hydrogen not meeting the criteria for green hydrogen designation under current rules, CO2 emissions are lower than those from existing alternative hydrogen production methods. These results underscore the importance of balancing cost considerations with environmental impacts in operational decision-making.

The rational design of renewable, highly active, and selective catalysts has always been the key to the practical application of CO2 electroreduction. In this study, biomass-based Zn/N doped carbon aerogels were fabricated for high-selectivity electrical reduction of CO2 to CO. After in situ Zn/N doping, carbon aerogels exhibited interconnected pores, high surface area, and exposed active sites, and their physicochemical properties are significantly affected by pyrolysis temperature. When the pyrolysis temperature increased to 950 °C, the number of surface active sites and pore structure parameters of carbon aerogels decreased significantly due to the escape of zinc and nitrogen. CAZN-850 exhibited the highest specific surface area of 1317.0 m2/g and abundant Zn-N sites, which results in its high activity and selectivity for electroreduction of CO2 to CO (FECO = 89 % at -1.0V vs. RHE). Moreover, the stability test results for CO2RR showed that the reduction value of FECO for Zn/N doped carbon aerogels was only 5% under long-time operation. This work provides a new idea for the design of biomass-based catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.

Effectively utilizing low-grade thermal energy is a promising approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while reducing the burden on centralized power grids. Current thermoacoustic heat pumps and power generators face challenges such as high onset temperature differentials and low performance. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a gas-liquid resonator into a thermoacoustic combined heat and power systems to recover low-grade thermal energy in residential buildings. Through Sage modeling and calculations, the internal characteristics of the proposed system and its output performance under different operating conditions are explored. At a heating temperature of 350 °C, the system can generate 6.4 kW of output thermal power, 0.9 kW of electricity, and overall exergy efficiency is 79.3%. Combining neural network models with case studies conducted in Spain and Finland, the system can annually save 5.6 MWh and 20.7 MWh in fuel energy, reduce emissions of 1374 kg and 5180 kg of carbon dioxide, and save a total cost of €611 and €2324, respectively. Furthermore, comparisons with other emerging micro-CHP systems highlight the efficiency of the proposed system. These results indicate the high potential of thermoacoustic combined heat and power systems in recovering low-grade thermal energy and achieving energy savings and emission reductions.

Drained peatlands are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. When abandoned, they become the most likely sites of peat fires. An effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent peatland fires in disused drained peatlands is through rewetting and wetland restoration. These can make significant contributions to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement within the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector and, ultimately, to climate change mitigation. An approach for estimating greenhouse gas emission reductions following rewetting, applicable to national and regional accounting, as well as to specific rewetting projects, is presented. It includes a methodology for determining effectively rewetted areas that can be considered wetlands, the application of IPCC greenhouse gas emission factors to said sites, and an uncertainty assessment. Starting from 2020 the Russian Federation National Report of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gasses not controlled by the Montreal Protocol utilised this approach in its inclusion of rewetted peatlands. An assessment of greenhouse gas emission reductions is presented using the example of a 1500 ha section of a peatland within the Fire Hazardous Peatland Rewetting Programme in Moscow Oblast (2010–2013). CO2 emission reductions were cumulatively 33.4 thous. t by 2022 (taking into account nitrous oxide fluxes, dissolved organic carbon removal and increased CH4 emissions—20 thous. t CO2-eq.) and are projected to reach almost 113 (68) thous. t by 2050. Greenhouse gas emission reductions not yet included as well as possible ways of accounting for them in the future are also noted.

Natural gas is considered one of the most attractive low carbon energy sources while the separation of CO2 is a crucial process for the natural gas purification. Herein, cellulose-based carbon molecular sieve (CMS) hollow fiber membranes with high CO2 affinity capability were fabricated through a post-treatment strategy of hydrogen-induced reduction followed by oxygen-doped modification (H-O treatment), and show good potential for high pressure natural gas purification. The CMS membranes were reduced by H2 at high temperatures (500–600 °C) to form active sorption sites in the carbon matrix, and subsequently chemically absorbed O2 to generate oxygen-containing functional groups, which are favorable for CO2 adsorption and diffusion. After being treated at 600 °C (CMS-600), the CMS membrane presented a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 62.78 cm3/g (298 K). As a result, the CO2 permeability was enhanced from 264 to 1125 Barrer, with approximately 400 % improvement. Moreover, mixed gas separation performances (CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4) were investigated at high pressure and impurities feedings. The CMS membrane exhibited a remarkable CO2/CH4 separation factor of 104 when operated at 20 bar and 500 ppm heptane existed.

The technology of CO2 geological storage and CH4 intensive mining (CO2-ECBM) in coal seams integrates greenhouse gas emission reduction and new fossil energy development and has great development prospects. The CO2 injection, CO2 sequestration mechanism and storage capacity, and CH4 stimulation effect constitute the core content of the effectiveness of CO2-ECBM, among which CO2 injection is the most critical. Traditional seepage analysis methods often struggle to tackle flow-related issues influenced by microscale effects and intricate channels. This paper highlights the advantages of employing lattice Boltzmann (LBM) numerical simulations to study CO2 seepage behaviors when teaching a Rock Mass Seepage Mechanics Course. This course primarily covers topics such as the pore structure of rock, unstable liquid seepage, gas seepage theory and related subjects. Its goal is to provide students with a solid theoretical foundation to address the complexities of fluid seepage in pours media encountered in practical scenarios. A novel LBM-based methodology was employed to estimate the CO2 seepage capacity by incorporating the effects of different concentrations of [Bmin]Cl solution (0 wt%, 1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 5 wt%). The CO2 velocity distribution cloud map of each coal sample was simulated; the average velocity distribution curve of each coal sample was obtained; and the velocity profile of the seepage channel of each coal sample was described. This study can provide theoretical guidance for the technology of CO2 geological storage and CH4 intensive mining in coal seams.

Global sustainable development faces a significant challenge in effectively utilizing CO2. Meanwhile, CO2 biological fixation offers a promising solution. CO2 has the highest oxidation state (+4 valence state), whereas typical multi‑carbon chemicals have lower valence states. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) changes of CO2 reductive reactions are generally positive and this renders it necessary to input different forms of energy. Although biological carbon fixation processes are friendly to operate, the thermodynamic obstacles must be overcome. To make this reaction occur favorably and efficiently, diverse strategies to enhance CO2 biological fixation efficiency have been proposed by numerous researchers. This article reviews recent advances in optimizing CO2 biological fixation and intends to provide new insights into achieving efficient biological utilization of CO2. It first outlines the thermodynamic characteristics of diverse carbon fixation reactions and proposes optimization directions for CO2 biological fixation. A comprehensive overview of the catalytic mechanisms, optimization strategies, and challenges encountered by common carbon-fixing enzymes is then provided. Subsequently, potential routes for improving the efficiency of biological carbon fixation are discussed, including the ATP supply, reducing power supply, energy supply, reactor design, and carbon enrichment system modules. In addition, effective artificial carbon fixation pathways were summarized and analyzed. Finally, prospects are made for the research direction of continuously improving the efficiency of biological carbon fixation.

N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis reveals that Ni-Na2ZrO3-CP prepared by the co-precipitation (CP) method shows small Ni crystalline size, moderate surface basicity, and excellent reducibility. ICCU-RWGS performance is investigated under isothermal conditions of 650 °C, 10 %CO2 and 35 %H2. The results indicate that Ni-Na2ZrO3-CP demonstrates excellent performance in ICCU-RWGS, with a notable CO2 capture capacity of 3.76 mmol CO2/g and a CO production rate of 3.10 mmol CO/g. Additionally, it exhibits relatively good operational stability. Detailed reaction paths of the ICCU-RWGS procedure for the Ni-Na2ZrO3 bifunctional materials are proposed. The findings will shed new perspectives on the design of synthetic bifunctional catalysts for ICCU-RWGS.

This work employs a combination of density functional theory-infrared (IR), conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS), and molecular dynamic (MD) methods to investigate the impact of hydroxyl functional groups on CO2 capture within dicationic ionic liquids (DILs). The COSMO-RS reveals that hydroxyl groups in DILs reduce the macroscopic solubility of CO2 but improve the selectivity of CO2 over CO, H2, and CH4 gases. Quantum methods in the gas phase and MD simulations in the liquid phase were conducted to delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms. The IR spectrum analysis confirms red shifts in CO2's asymmetric stretching mode and blue shifts in the CR-HR bond of the dication, indicating CO2-DIL interactions and the weakening of the anion-cation interactions caused by the presence of CO2. The results show that the positioning of anions around hydroxyl groups and HR atoms in rings inhibits the proximity of CO2 molecules, causing the hydrogen atoms within methylene groups to accumulate CO2. van der Waals forces were found to dominate the interaction between ions and CO2. The addition of hydroxyl groups strengthens the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds between dications and anions. The stronger interaction energy between ions in [C5(mim)2-(C2)2(OH)2][NTf2]2 limits the displacement of CO2 molecules within this DIL compared to [C5(mim)2-(C4)2][NTf2]2. Compared to [C5(mim)2-(C4)2][NTf2]2, [C5(mim)2-(C2)2(OH)2][NTf2]2 exhibits stronger ion-ion interactions, higher density, and reduced free volume, resulting in a reduction in CO2 capture. These results provide significant insights into the intermolecular interactions and vibrational properties of CO2 in DIL complexes, emphasizing their significance in developing efficient and sustainable strategies for CO2 capture.

Nanoparticle organic hybrid materials (NOHMs) have been proposed as excellent electrolytes for combined CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion due to their conductive nature and chemical tunability. However, CO2 capture behavior and transport properties of these electrolytes after CO2 capture have not yet been studied. Here, we use a variety of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to explore the carbon speciation and transport properties of branched polyethylenimine (PEI) and PEI-grafted silica nanoparticles (denoted as NOHM-I-PEI) after CO2 capture. Quantitative 13C NMR spectra collected at variable temperatures reveal that absorbed CO2 exists as carbamates (RHNCOO- or RR'NCOO-) and carbonate/bicarbonate (CO32-/HCO3-). The transport properties of PEI and NOHM-I-PEI studied using 1H pulsed-field-gradient NMR, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrate that coulombic interactions between negatively and positively charged chains dominate in PEI, while the self-diffusion in NOHM-I-PEI is dominated by silica nanoparticles. These results provide strategies for selecting adsorbed forms of carbon for electrochemical reduction.

The large-scale use of fossil fuels leads to the rising concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which leads to serious environmental problem. In order to alleviate this problem, it is an effective way to convert CO2 to C1 (such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formic acid and formate) as high value-added products, so as to make full use of carbon resources. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is the use of renewable energy to reduce CO2 to valuable C1 products by using CO2 and H2O as raw materials. It has the advantages of low energy consumption, mild reaction conditions and no pollution, which has attracted wide attention in recent years. In this review, we firstly describe the basic principle, performance evaluation parameters and reaction devices of CO2RR, summarize the preparation methods of working electrodes, enumerate the types and application scenarios of commonly used electrolytes, as well as electrochemical test parameters and common product analysis methods. Then, we systematically summarize the research progress of CO2 electroreduction catalysts, including the application of single-atom catalysts, dual-atom catalysts and nano-porous metal catalysts in CO2RR, overview the design, preparation and characterization methods of CO2 electroreduction catalysts, and the structure and synthesis methods of various catalysts in detail. Finally, the C1 products generated by CO2RR, such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formic acid and formate, are discussed, and the effects of catalysts with different structures on the products selectivity are analyzed.

Abstract Both laboratory tests and pilot wells have demonstrated the significant potential of CO2 as an EOR medium. Due to the weak pressure conduction and mass transfer of the CO2-oil system, multiple zones between the injection well and production well are generated in the ultra-low permeability reservoirs. This work aims to explore the characteristics of multiple zones and mechanisms of CO2-EOR, combining the experimental results, core-scale, and field-scale simulation. Long core displacement experiments were conducted under different miscibility pressures with production gas assayed using gas chromatography. When the core-scale simulation matched with the experimental results, the four CO2 fronts, which were used to distinguish different zones, were defined based on pressure, interfacial tension, and CO2 concentration along the long core. The distribution of five zones was upscaled to the field-scale model after the history matching of pilot wells. The final step was to evaluate the value of the miscible zone range, utilization factor of CO2 injection, oil recovery, and CO2 storage efficiency during the CO2 injection process. Results show that the boundary between the original oil zone and the oil transition zone exists at the CO2 component front, where the CO2 concentration is zero. Additionally, the location of the CO2 component front does not overlap with the contact interface of CO2-crude oil, meaning that the dissolution effect of CO2 in the oil transition zone results in the CO2 component front moving farther. Besides, when the formation pressure is higher than the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), the distance between the CO2-effective phase front and the CO2-effective component front further expands as the pressure increases, enlarging the miscible zone range. The pressure accumulates around the injection well because of slow pressure conduction. When the average formation pressure reaches 1.1 MMP, the miscible zone range is enlarged by 2.7% higher than that of the near miscible flooding (0.92 MMP), leading to a higher rate of oil recovery by 8.6% and a utilization factor of CO2 by 0.14t/t. It is for the first time that the range of five zones and the characteristics of four CO2 fronts migration is assessed, furnishing an in-depth understanding of the complicated mechanisms and phase behavior in CO2 EOR in the ultra-low permeability oil reservoir. This work contributes to providing significant information for designing an economic and environmental CO2 flooding strategy and is significant in the improvement of oil recovery and the reduction of CO2 emission.

The tandem application of CO2 electrolysis with syngas fermentation holds promise for achieving heightened production rates and improved product quality. However, the significant impact of syngas composition on mixed culture-based microbial chain elongation remains unclear. Additionally, effective methods for generating syngas with an adjustable composition from acidic CO2 electrolysis are currently lacking. This study successfully demonstrated the production of medium-chain fatty acids from CO2 through tandem acidic electrolysis with syngas fermentation. CO could serve as the sole energy source or as the electron donor (when cofed with acetate) for caproate generation. Furthermore, the results of gas diffusion electrode structure engineering highlighted that the use of carbon black, either alone or in combination with graphite, enabled consistent syngas generation with an adjustable composition from acidic CO2 electrolysis (pH 1). The carbon black layer significantly improved the CO selectivity, increasing from 0% to 43.5% (0.05 M K+) and further to 92.4% (0.5 M K+). This enhancement in performance was attributed to the promotion of K+ accumulation, stabilizing catalytically active sites, rather than creating a localized alkaline environment for CO2-to-CO conversion. This research contributes to the advancement of hybrid technology for sustainable CO2 reduction and chemical production.

Escalating industrial CO2 emissions necessitate innovative carbon capture and utilization strategies. This study explores the potential of mineral-carbonation of steelmaking slags, particularly White Slag (WS) and various Refractory Wastes (RWs), to mitigate CO2 emissions and valorize industrial wastes. Experiments were performed with waste materials from the production lines at CELSA (Barcelona, Spain). We delved into direct aqueous carbonation, evaluating the performance and characteristics of these wastes under different experimental conditions. Our findings reveal that all slags can effectively sequester CO2. This process is effective not only for pure CO2 but also for diluted flue gases under mild conditions (≤ 100 ºC, ≤ 6 bar). Specifically, WS exhibited peak CO2 sequestration capacities (SC) of 359.79 gCO2/kgslag (pure CO2) and 276.65 gCO2/kgslag (diluted flue gas). In contrast, the RWs presented different kinetic, reaching a maximum SC of 311 gCO2/kgslag after prolonged times. Given the large inhomogeneity of RWs, individual analysis of distinct RW fractions revealed significant variations in carbonation performance. Tundish RW exhibited the highest CO2 sequestration capacity, emphasizing the importance of waste source and mineral composition in the carbonation. Chemical and morphological evaluations confirmed the transformation of CaO to CaCO3, with MgO remaining largely inert. Additionally, the process indicated potential environmental benefits by reducing the mobility of toxic metals, particularly Pb, suggesting an ancillary avenue for waste treatment. This study underscores the utility of CO2 mineralization as a dual-benefit approach within the circular economy framework, offering insights into its application for sustainable waste management and CO2 emission reduction in the steel industry.

Abstract Mercury (Hg) is a naturally occurring element that has been greatly enriched in the environment by human activities like mining and fossil fuel combustion. Despite commonalities in some carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and Hg emission sources, the implications of long‐range climate scenarios for anthropogenic Hg emissions have yet to be explored. Here, we present comprehensive projections of anthropogenic Hg emissions extending to the year 2300 and evaluate impacts on global atmospheric Hg deposition. Projections are based on four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) ranging from sustainable reductions in resource and energy intensity to rapid economic growth driven by abundant fossil fuel exploitation. There is a greater than two‐fold difference in cumulative anthropogenic Hg emissions between the lower‐bound (110 Gg) and upper‐bound (235 Gg) scenarios. Hg releases to land and water are approximately six times those of direct emissions to air (600–1,470 Gg). At their peak, anthropogenic Hg emissions reach 2,200–2,600 Mg a −1 sometime between 2010 (baseline) and 2030, depending on the SSP scenario. Coal combustion is the largest determinant of differences in Hg emissions among scenarios. Decoupling of Hg and CO 2 emission sources occurs under low‐to mid‐range scenarios, though contributions from artisanal and small‐scale gold mining remain uncertain. Future Hg emissions may have lower gaseous elemental Hg (Hg 0 ) and higher divalent Hg (Hg II ), resulting in a higher fraction of locally sourced Hg deposition. Projected reemissions of previously deposited anthropogenic Hg follow a similar temporal trajectory to primary emissions, amplifying the benefits of primary Hg emission reductions under the most stringent mitigation scenarios.

The rapid development of society and economy has resulted in a substantial increase in energy consumption, consequently exacerbating pollution issues. Current research predominantly focuses on energy-saving and emission reduction in road transportation within individual cities or the three major economic regions of China:the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. However, there is a dearth of studies addressing the southeastern coastal economic region. Located at the heart of China's southeastern coastal economic development, the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang unavoidably face challenges associated with energy consumption and emissions while pursuing economic growth. To address these challenges, this study employed a LEAP model to construct various scenarios for road transportation in the key coastal cities of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang from 2015 to 2035. These scenarios included a baseline scenario (BAU), an existing policy scenario (EPS), and an improved policy scenario (MPS). The MPS and EPS encompassed vehicle structure optimization (VSO), improved fuel economy (IFE), and reduced annual average mileage (RDM). By simulating and evaluating these scenarios, the energy-saving and emission reduction potentials of road transportation in the key coastal cities were assessed. The results indicated that, in the primary scenario, the MPS exhibited the most significant improvements in energy-saving, carbon reduction, and pollutant reduction effects. By 2035, the MPS achieved a remarkable 75% energy-saving rate compared to that in the baseline scenario, accompanied by reductions of 68%, 59%, 66%, 70%, and 64% in CO2, CO, NOx, PM2.5, and SO2 emissions, respectively. In the secondary scenario, the improved scenario of enhancing fuel economy achieved a notable 30% reduction in energy consumption. Additionally, the scenarios involving vehicle structure adjustment (yielding reductions of 36%, 30%, 36%, 26%, and 40%) and annual average mileage reduction (resulting in reductions of 37%, 37%, 36%, 37%, and 36%) demonstrated significant reductions in CO2, CO, NOx, PM2.5, and SO2 emissions.

Recently, global-scale efforts have been conducted for the electroreduction of CO2 as a potentially beneficial pathway for the conversion of greenhouse gases to useful chemicals and renewable fuels. This study focuses on the development of selective and sustainable electrocatalysts for the reduction of aqueous CO2 to CO. A RuIIcomplex [Ru(tptz)(ACN)Cl2] (RCMP) (tptz = 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine, ACN = acetonitrile) was prepared as a molecular electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction in an aqueous solution. Density functional theory-calculated frontier molecular orbitals suggested that the tptz ligand plays a key role in dictating the electrocatalytic reactions. The RCMP electrocatalyst was grafted onto the graphene oxide (GO) surface both noncovalently (GO/RCMP) and covalently (GO-RCMP). The field emission scanning electron microscopy and elemental distribution analyses revealed the homogeneous distribution of the complex onto the GO sheet. The photoluminescence spectra confirmed accelerated charge-transfer in both nanohybrids. Compared to the bare complex, the GO-RCMP and GO/RCMP nanohybrids showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity, achieving >95% and 90% Faradaic efficiencies for CO production at more positive onset potentials, respectively. The GO-RCMP nanohybrid demonstrated outstanding electrocatalytic activity with a current of ∼84 μA. The study offers a perspective on outer- and inner-sphere electron-transfer mechanisms for electrochemical energy conversion systems.

Abstract Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO 2 ) has emerged as a nonthermal technology to guarantee food safety. This review addresses the potential of SC‐CO 2 technology in food preservation, discussing the microbial inactivation mechanisms and the impact on food products’ quality parameters and bioactive compounds. Furthermore, the main advantages and gaps are denoted. SC‐CO 2 technology application causes adequate microbial reductions (>5 log cfu/mL) of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms, enzyme inactivation, and improvements in the storage stability in fruit and vegetable products (mainly fruit juices), meat products, and dairy derivatives. SC‐CO 2 ‐treated products maintain the physicochemical, technological, and sensory properties, bioactive compound concentrations, and biological activity (antioxidant and angiotensin‐converting enzyme–inhibitory activities) similar to the untreated products. The optimization of processing parameters (temperature, pressure, CO 2 volume, and processing times) is mandatory for achieving the desired results. Further studies should consider the expansion to different food matrices, shelf‐life evaluation, bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds, and in vitro and in vivo studies to prove the benefits of using SC‐CO 2 technology. Moreover, the impact on sensory characteristics and, mainly, the consumer perception of SC‐CO 2 ‐treated foods need to be elucidated. We highlight the opportunity for studies in postbiotic production. In conclusion, SC‐CO 2 technology may be used for microbial inactivation to ensure food safety without losing the quality parameters.

Human activities releasing greenhouse gases are identified as dominant contributors to the observed climate change including global warming and its acceleration. The consequences for humanity are predicted to be severe. Therefore, to mitigate global warming, significant efforts are being devoted to reducing CO2 emissions and stabilizing (or even reducing) atmospheric CO2 concentration. This enormous endeavor of ‘decarbonization’ comes with substantial costs, running into trillions of USD in Western countries alone. Fundamentally, the entirety of endeavors, actions, and outcomes hinges upon the central hypothesis stating that the increase of CO2 concentration from approximately 0.03% to more than 0.04% causes a noticeable temperature rise. Given the paramount significance of this hypothesis, the generally accepted rules of science would necessitate rigorous scrutiny for substantiation. Such substantiation is typically provided by an experimental evidence. Yet, surprisingly according to the results of this research, exactly this essential experimental evidence supporting the central hypothesis seems to be lacking, not fully adhering to fundamental principles of scientific analysis. Consequently, robust experimental evidence must be presented to substantiate the hypothesis, as the failure to do so would necessitate a reassessment of the emphasis on CO2 emissions reduction as the primary solution to climate change.

Exploring high-efficiency photocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction is still challenging because of the limited charge separation and surface reactions. In this study, a noble-metal-free metallic VSe2 nanosheet was incorporated on g-C3N4 to serve as an electron capture and transfer center, activating surface active sites for highly efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction. Quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) unveiled that VSe2 could capture electrons, which are further transferred to the surface for activating active sites. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a kinetically feasible process for the formation of a key intermediate and confirmed the favorable production of CO on the VSe2/PCN (protonated C3N4) photocatalyst. As an outcome, the optimized VSe2/PCN composite achieved 97% selectivity for solar-light-driven CO2 conversion to CO with a high rate of 16.3 μmol·g-1·h-1, without any sacrificial reagent or photosensitizer. This work offers new insights into the photocatalyst design toward highly efficient and selective CO2 conversion.

Abstract Reservoir modelling tools have played a significant role in designing the subsurface fluid injection, such as CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However, these models are computationally expensive; they require extensive geological and engineering data that often are not available in the early phase of carbon utilization and storage projects. This work presents the development of fast predictive models and optimization methodologies to quickly evaluate the CO2 EOR and storage operations in mature oil fields. Considerable experience with CO2 EOR and storage has been gained by the petroleum industry. In particular, the Weyburn-Midale project (Canada) is a comprehensive case to show how an oil reservoir could securely store CO2. Employing the Weyburn-Midale project, we developed, trained and tested several types of proxy models in multiple scenarios to assess the performance of the miscible CO2 flood in recovering residual oil, increasing the ultimate oil recovery factor while maximizing the permanent CO2 storage. The history matching of the Weyburn-Midale CO2 EOR model involved 216 well histories (producers and injectors) from 1964 to 2006 using a compositional reservoir simulator. The predominant exploitation scheme was based on an inverted nine-spot pattern waterflooding, water alternating CO2, and consequently CO2 injection. Two simulation data sets were employed at different periods of 1956 through 2006, and 2007 through 2025. Among several proxy models, an artificial neural network (ANN) model proved to accurately estimate features of interest, namely fluid production (oil, water, gas), fluid injection (water, CO2) and the amount of CO2 stored in the reservoir. Additionally, an autoregressive exogenous input (ARX) model was implemented to predict the future outputs in response to a future input. Inspection of the relative estimation error and the model fitness score showed that the proxy model was capable of rapidly reproducing the trend in the validation set satisfactorily. Lastly, we evaluated the transfer of learning from a proxy model, trained to the Weyburn-Midale field (Canada), to assess the performance of CO2 EOR in another mature oil reservoir in Europe (Romania). The application of proxy models under geological and operation uncertainties offers huge reduction in computational time and engineering data requirements. The results from the Weyburn-Midale case study deliver critical insights into the analysis of many process factors and modeling techniques intended to assess the economic limits and long-term performance of CO2 EOR and storage in mature oil fields.

By purchasing emission reduction equipment or reducing production scale, it is possible to effectively decrease CO2. Therefore, understanding the marginal abatement cost (MAC) associated with these methods is crucial for making decisions. However, previous studies using the directional distance function (DDF) approach often mis-specified production functions and neglected data noise. They also assumed decision-making units (DMUs) to be on the production frontier and used proportional changes in inputs and outputs as abatement paths. This paper addresses these limitations by developing the convex quantile non-radial directional distance function (CQR-NDDF) method, which estimates the MAC of CO2 and determines optimal abatement paths for DMUs without assuming a specific production function, employing linear programming techniques. Applying this method to 30 provinces in mainland China from 2011 to 2019, the study finds that China's CO2 MAC increased from 182 to 247 yuan/ton. The lowest-cost abatement path varies by province and time. The club convergence and ordered probit model are employed to conclude that the second industry and urbanization increase the MAC of CO2, while factors such as foreign direct investment, openness level, and human capital decrease the MAC. Moreover, the CQR-NDDF method yields significantly lower MAC estimates than the NDDF method. In conclusion, this paper provides new insights into China's CO2 MAC, emphasizing the importance of considering inefficiency and data noise in MAC estimation. We anticipate that utilizing CO2 MAC as a benchmark for carbon trading market prices could lead to an increase in prices within China's carbon trading market.

Abstract The tight reservoir exhibits pronounced heterogeneity and possesses complex physical properties, thereby constraining crude oil exploitation. Water and CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery encounter challenges related to low sweep efficiency and viscous fingering, resulting in suboptimal recovery effectiveness. In recent years, there has been growing attention towards the synergistic advantages of oil displacement through the injection of fluids such as CO2, hydrocarbon gases, and chemical additives. This paper presents the design of a microscopic visualization experimental system specifically tailored for studying high-temperature and high-pressure composite fluid displacement in actual tight oil reservoir conditions. Based on the pore throat characteristics inside the core, a visual micro-nano scale pore throat model was created to simulate the flow of composite fluid in micro-nano channels under high temperature and high pressure conditions. The research findings indicate that adding dimethyl ether and ethane to composite gases enhances their solubility and expansion in crude oil. Comparing the occurrence characteristics of residual oil after CO2 injection development reveals that injecting a composite gas (CO2- C2H6-DME) leads to a notable reduction in residual oil in the form of Clustered and oil Porous. The experimental results show that the final recovery rate of composite gas flooding can reach 92.8%, which is 46.7% higher than pure CO2. This paper presents, for the first time, the synergistic enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology of injecting a composite gas mixture (CO2, C2H6, DME) into tight reservoirs. This study employs microscopic visualization techniques to assess the variation in residual oil characteristics and the enhancement of recovery in crude oils driven by different gases.

Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has set a target to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050, which is aligned with Oman’s country vision. A mid- and long-term strategy has been developed to identify cost-competitive abatement staircases, including elimination of routine flaring, driving energy efficiency across operating assets and increasing the share of power generation from renewable power sources (solar and wind). Although these activities will lead to a step-change reduction in CO2 emission levels, Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) will be a key enabler of PDO’s net zero targets. The extensive Mesozoic carbonate rock sequences of North Oman provide an exciting opportunity for CO2 storage in both dipping saline aquifers and structural traps. While hydrocarbons are produced from these carbonates in numerous fields in the country, they also have enormous potential for carbon storage with multiple reservoir-seal pairs, particularly in the Shuaiba, Kharaib, Lekhwair and Habshan Formations of the Kahmah Group. Unlike the majority of CCS projects globally which utilise clastic saline aquifers and depleted fields, carbonates present an additional challenge due to the pervasive nature of faults and fractures which can exert a large influence on both injectivity potential and containment of the CO2 plume.

In this study, an HIA (Heath impact assessment) model is developed to study the health and economic impacts of the electrification of public transport in Delhi. Health impact functions are obtained from C-R (concentration-response) models developed on the basis of relative risk studies and other epidemiological research. Baseline data on the economic values of health impacts is obtained from the available studies. The intervention scenario is based on powering all DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) buses by battery. The model results revealed a significant reduction of emission and related health and economic benefits. The expected reduction in annual mortality is estimated at 793 cases, which will be equivalent to annual savings of USD 515 M (million) as well as 0.491 million tons of reduction in CO2 emissions.

Objective Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) stands at the forefront of innovative solutions to combat climate change. This manuscript exploring into the promising realm of CCU, showcasing its role in transforming them into valuable products. The marriage of environmental sustainability and economic growth is the crux of CCU's appeal. This work conducts a comparative analysis of CCU methods, dissecting those with hydrogen integration and those without. By examining respective challenges, and potential driver for Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) deployment, insights will be provided that contribute to the ongoing discourse in Malaysia. The urgency to address climate change has fueled the exploration of innovative solutions, with CCU emerging as a frontrunner. Interest in Carbon Capture, Utilization and Sequestration (CCUS) in Southeast Asia has been growing in line with international trends. The renewed momentum for CCUS has been driven by strengthened climate commitments from governments and industry, including ambitious net-zero targets. Beyond the conventional approach of capturing CO2 emissions, CCU offers a dual benefit by repurposing the captured carbon into valuable products. This paradigm shift not only aligns with environmental sustainability goals but also opens avenues for economic growth, creating a synergy between climate action and financial viability. CCU with H2 hydrogenation is a way of converting CO2 into useful products or energy sources. Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction that adds hydrogen atoms to a molecule, usually to increase its stability or reactivity. In this case, hydrogenation of CO2 produces various fuels and chemicals, such as methane, methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, and hydrocarbons. There are different types of catalysts that can be used for CO2 hydrogenation with H2, such as metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, and metal carbides. The choice of catalyst depends on the desired product and the reaction conditions. Direct use of CO2 for utilization without hydrogen is another way of converting CO2 into useful products or energy sources. There are different ways to achieve this, such as using CO2 as a feedstock for chemical synthesis, building materials, or enhanced oil recovery. Unlike CO2 based Fuel processes which requires large input of energy due to splitting or reduction of CO2 molecule processes, incorporating CO2 molecule into the product such as CO2 in building materials require low energy. However, the estimated potential for the scale of CO2 utilization in fuels varies widely, from 1 to 4.2 Gigatonnes of CO2 per year while CO2 utilization pathways in concrete building materials are estimated between 0.1 and 1.4 Gigatonnes of CO2 per year over the long term[7]. Early commercial opportunities to use CO2 to cure concrete or in the production of aggregates are already being realized – in some cases demonstrating improved cost and product performance relative to conventional production. This process can enhance the strength and durability of the concrete, as well as reduce the amount of cement and other materials needed. By converting CO2 into products with economic value, CCU fosters a circular economy, where emissions are repurposed, contributing to a more sustainable and resource-efficient model by ensuring the final emissions to be appropriately repurposed or captured and the cycle continues.

Abstract Chichimene is an oil field located in the Colombian eastern basin. Since 2014, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) through the water injection process has been carried out successfully in part of this field. A polymer injection pilot was carried out over five injection patterns to optimize this process as a promising strategy for polymer-based EOR in challenging reservoir conditions with high temperatures and heavy oil. Polymer injection started in 2015 in the first injection pattern, and it was extended between 2018 and 2019 to five injector wells covering different areas of the oil field. 21.65 MSTB of polymer-augmented water were injected (approximately 7,000 t of polymer). At the end of 2022, the incremental oil production had reached around 4.9 MBbls (Million barrels of oil), and it is expected to increase up to 6.9 MBbls, resulting in a 9.84% incremental oil recovery factor. Considerable incremental oil recovery concerning the pilot patterns’ production baseline and notable carbon and energy intensity improvements were observed. Life cycle GHG (Green House Gas) emissions and energy consumptions associated with the crude oil production chain were estimated. Moreover, a suitable calculation tool of carbon footprint and energy intensity related to each stage of crude oil recovery by polymer injection processes was performed. The main contributions of GHG emission and energy consumption for the polymer-based EOR process analyzed were linked to lifting, oil dehydration, water clarification treatment, and Injection systems. The contribution of each stage in the total carbon footprint of crude oil production was calculated for the polymer flooding and compared with oil baseline production. The carbon footprint of implementing the oil recovery project was calculated for eight years. The results show that the carbon intensity of the crude oil baseline production in the five patterns is close to 20 kg CO2-eq/BO (barrels of oil) on average. Nevertheless, EOR by polymer injection decreases to 19.3 kg CO2-eq/BO. Regarding the energy intensity, the oil baseline production of the five patterns achieved 8.5 kWh/BO; however, the specific energy consumption in the EOR process by polymer injection decreased to 6.7 kWh/BO. The reduction is attributed mainly to energy use optimization in crude oil lifting and enhanced water re-injection with polymer. Furthermore, the carbon intensity reduction could lead to more than 3,200 t of CO2-eq avoided and improve the energy performance of polymer-based EOR by more than 20% concerning the baseline case. Nevertheless, a significant potential GHG emissions reduction of more than 4,000 t CO2-eq could be expected for the whole impact of this project in the Chichimene field.

During manure storage (1–6 months), valuable nutrients and organic contents are degraded, emitting substantial amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and odors. Through the application of acidification and cooling-down, the less emissions during storage and beneficial outcomes in further treatment can be expected. However, there is a concern whether these storage technologies really deserve or not. In the present work, at first, a comprehensive review was conducted on (1) the amount of GHGs and odor emissions from manure, (2) the reduction in emitting gases by acidification and cooling-down with mechanisms behind them, and (3) its consequences on the increased biogas production and crop yield. Considering all these, an environmental and economic assessment was performed for three climatic regions (warm, temperate, and cool). It was found that H2SO4-acidification can reduce GHGs emissions by 12.6–97.2 kg CO2 eq/ton manure (>75 % during the storage process), while the significant reduction was attained in warm region. And, except one case (cool, pH 5.5, and carbon price of 30 USD/kg CO2 eq.), the profit of 0.31–8.69 USD/ton manure was expected. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review addressing the importance of "keeping the freshness of manure" to save the planet and get more income.

A series of pure and 50% substituted Fe‐containing (LaFeO3, LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 and LaFe0.5Co0.5O3) and Co/Ni‐containing (LaCoO3, LaNiO3, and LaCo0.5Ni0.5O3) perovskites were used as precursors to synthesize metallic reduced catalysts to be tested for the liquid hydrogenation of furfural. The catalytic reaction was carried out in a batch reactor at 200 °C and 3.0 MPa of H2 pressure. The calcined perovskites and reduced catalysts were characterized by X‐ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption at 77 K, temperature programmed reduction (H2‐TPR), temperature programmed CO2 and NH3 desorption (CO2‐TPD and NH3‐TPD), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The LaCo0.5Ni0.5O3 reduced catalyst display the highest activity in furfural conversion, which was attributed to a cooperative effect between highly dispersed nickel and cobalt metal nanoparticles after reduction process. The effect of the nature of B‐cation have a high impact on the products selectivity in the hydrogenation of furfural, suggesting that enriched‐Ni metal surface was selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, meanwhile enriched‐Co metal surface was selective to furfuryl alcohol formation, which was also supported with adsorption mode of furfural over the active sites obtained by quantum calculation.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important components of various electrochemical systems such as water splitting, metal air batteries, and carbon dioxide reduction. However, the four-electron process of OER suffers from intrinsically sluggish kinetics, which contributes to significant overpotential in the electrochemical system. Herein, highly defective NiFeV layered triple hydroxide (LTH) catalyst was efficiently prepared using a one-step hydrothermal method. The crystal structure, electronic structure, and surface composition of NiFeV LTH were characterized by X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, NiFeV LTH demonstrated a superior OER catalytic performance with-low overpotential (158 mV @10 mA·cm -2 ), related small Tafel slope (102.3 mV·dec −1 ), and long-term stability at a high current density of 100 mA·cm -2 . In situ Raman spectroscopy was applied to investigate the surface reconstruction during the OER process. It is revealed that Ni species were the most active sites at low overpotential, with the potential increasing subsequently Fe and V gradually participates in the catalytic reaction, the Fe and Ni species as OER catalytic active sites lead to the excellent OER catalytic activity of NiFeV LTH, and inhibited the further dissolution of high-valence NiOOH at high overpotential. The mechanism induced the outstanding activity and stability at high current densities in NiFeV LTH system. Dissolution of vanadium excited the active sites of NiFeV LTH synthesized by hydrothermal method which promoted both activity and stability, while the changes of surface species at different OER potentials were detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy.

Summary The development of unconventional liquid-rich reservoirs, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) considers a promising fluid to further improve oil recovery of shale oil reservoirs in and after hydraulic fracturing. However, the scCO2 has some disadvantages to limit its application in hydraulic fracturing, such as ultra-low viscosity, asphaltene deposition and high miscible pressure. Diluted microemulsion (DME) shows great potential as the additive of fracturing fluid to improve the well productivity through strengthening the spontaneous imbibition during the shut-in period after hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, it is essential to further understand the synergic effects between scCO2 and DME at the pore scale. In this study, three soaking sequences are designed and compared, which include only scCO2 soaking, water-scCO2-DME soaking sequence, and DME-scCO2-DME soaking sequence using shale cores from the Lucaogou Formation. Low-field nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) technique are utilized to quantify the oil distribution among different pores in each soaking stage. Furthermore, component change of the produced oil is characterized by the gas chromatography (GC). Notably, T1-T2 spectra are introduced to verify the results of T2 spectra and GC. Results show that DME can replace the oil from small pores into large pores and thus improve the extraction effects of scCO2. The solid-liquid and oil-water/scCO2 interactions determine the adhesion work of heavy components. DME can enhance the heavy component (C17+) mobilization through interfacial tension (IFT) reduction and wettability alteration. Combing scCO2 and DME can effectively improve the mobilization of both light and heavy components of crude oil, and thus achieve a better ultimate oil recovery rate.

Abstract A major part of the energy transition transformation is reduction of carbon footprint in the current oil and gas operations. The energy consumption in the whole chain of operations needs to be evaluated. The energy efficiency of water flooding is compared to polymer flooding for extraction of heavy oil from an oil field in the UK sector of the North Sea is evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with the concept of Exergy-Return-on-Exergy-Investment (ERoEI). The LCA allows for separation of the process into material and work streams, assessing the impact of each separately. By applying the exergy concept, i.e. the amount of useful energy invested or returned, a comparison of different process steps and different extraction strategies can be achieved. The Oil field, characterized by an oil viscosity of approximately 80 cP, poses challenges for water flooding operations. Early water breakthrough in producers and high water cuts are anticipated outcomes. While thermal EOR methods could potentially address sweep efficiency concerns, they come at a considerable energy and CO2 cost. Building upon recent advancements in the understanding of polymer flooding for heavy oil extraction, a low-dosage polymer flood was implemented, yielding highly positive results. By utilizing the established water channels in the field, cross-flow of oil into the channels generates a rapid increase in oil production by polymer. In this paper we present the results of an expansion of the current polymer flood to new sections of the field. When comparing like for like development infrastructure and UR recovery times scales, polymer flood leads to a strong acceleration of the oil production which results in a significant increase in Net-Present-Value (NPV). Furthermore, there is an increase of 2.4 times the exergy return on exergy investment and a reduction of 35 % in CO2 emissions. Extraction of heavy oil has for a long time been dominated by energy intensive and/or inefficient methods. Our study demonstrates that the implementation of low-dosage polymer flooding not only significantly enhances recovery rates, accelerating production by decades, but also accomplishes this with reduced energy cost. The CO2 intensity (kg CO2/bbl oil) is quantified and providing a useful optimization factor for the polymer flood design.

Chicken fillets, predominantly encased in disposable plastic packaging, represent a common perishable commodity frequently found in the shopping baskets of British consumers, with an annual slaughter exceeding 1.1 billion chickens. The associated environmental implications are of considerable significance. However, a noticeable gap exists concerning the household-level ramifications of chicken meat consumption, which remains a prominent driver (165 kg CO2eyr−1 per capita) of environmental impacts in the United Kingdom (UK). This study's primary objective is to integrate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology with insights derived from a spectrum of interventions simulated within the Household Simulation Model (HHSM). The interventions that are simulated are influenced by various consumer behaviours related to the purchase, consumption, storage and disposal of chicken fillets. The overarching aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the environmental consequences associated with each intervention. The research encompasses eight distinct household archetypes and the UK average, with a focus on discerning differences in their environmental influence. The introduction of shelf-life extension measures leads to a reduction in the overall environmental impacts (in μPt), with reductions ranging from 1 % to 18 %. Concurrently, waste treatment's environmental burdens can be curtailed by 9 % to 69 % for the UK average. Of the 12 interventions tested, the intervention that combines a one-day extension in the shelf life of open packs and a three-day extension for unopened packs leads to the greatest reduction in environmental impacts, at 18 % for the entire process and 69 % for the waste treatment. This intervention is estimated to yield annual reductions of 130,722 t of CO2 emissions across the entire process and 34,720 t of CO2 emissions from waste treatment, as compared to the default scenario. These findings demonstrate the importance of integrating consumer behaviour, food waste, and packaging considerations within the domain of food LCA research.

Abstract A CO2-modified alkyl polyglycoside (C-APG) surfactant was synthesized from a commercial APG product under mild reaction conditions including a low temperature at 50 °C and a low pressure of 2.5 bar. With this reaction, CO2 was successfully incorporated into APG molecules for efficient reduction of carbon footprint. The performance of applying C-APG as chemical flooding for improved oil production application in carbonate reservoirs with heavy crude oil was investigated and compared with its precursor - APG surfactant. The synthesized C-APG was characterized by FTIR and the physicochemical properties of both APG and C-APG including compatibility, surface tension, interfacial tension (IFT) were evaluated. Both surfactants were compatible with the high-salinity water (HSW) and had a similar critical micelle concentration (CMC). However, C-APG exhibited a much pronounced effect in reducing IFT between oil and water. The IFT of C-APG was 10-fold lower than original APG surfactant, suggesting great potential in chemical flooding for oil displacement. Micromodel test showed that the produced heavy oil by injection of APG or C-APG solution was further enhanced after water flooding. C-APG shows higher effectiveness on oil displacement due to lower IFT and stronger emulsification. Core-flooding oil displacement test indicated that C-APG injection resulted in a lower differential pressure and a higher cumulative oil production comparing APG chemical flooding. The produced fluids from C-APG flooding and extended water flooding exhibited very strong emulsification comparing the fluids produced by APG flooding. The incomplete phase separation resulted in an underestimated oil displacement efficiency by C-APG flooding. This study shows a great potential of C-APG surfactant in terms of CO2 reduction and improving oil production.

A study is performed of cobalt/MgAl2O4 catalysts promoted with glucose at Co/C molar ratios of 16.5, 3.2, and 1.6 via sequential deposition and codeposition. Magnetometry and IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO show that raising the content of carbon in the catalyst contributes to the reduction of cobalt, regardless of how Co is introduced. Infrared spectroscopy reveals the main adsorption sites are cobalt cations and metallic Co. A strong contribution from adsorption sites characteristic of large Co particles is observed in systems synthesized via codeposition. Adsorption sites attributed to Co2+ and Coδ+ are structurally more homogeneous than ones attributed to metallic Co.

Abstract In pursuit of the 1.5°C climate threshold set by the Paris agreement above pre-industrial levels, achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 is identified as crucial. This necessitates leadership from the energy industries in formulating and executing sustainability development goals. Addressing all emissions sources is imperative for the success of this ambitious endeavor. The study investigates the application of an optimized dosage of a novel single-phase retarded acid (SPRA) fluid system to reduce the carbon footprint in stimulating horizontal extended reach wells targeting lower-permeability reservoirs in Middle East. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is commonly employed in matrix acidizing for creating wormholes in carbonate reservoirs, faces challenges in achieving the desired productivity index due to rapid reactions at high bottomhole static temperatures. The development of SPRA, an HCl-based fluid with enhanced retardation factor, demonstrated superior wormhole penetration depth through the synergistic action of two retarding agents. Employing stimulation modeling analysis, this work investigated optimized SPRA dosage and demonstrated its superior performance over regular HCl acid in post-stimulation skin reduction and wormhole generation. In most of the SPRA applications, the performance of the stimulation treatment is still higher compared to the straight acid, even at reduced volume. Subsequent history matching exercises confirmed the generation of longer wormholes and the effective reduction of skin across the entire lateral section of the well. Validation of simulation findings was achieved through flowback and production data collected after stimulation. The presented case studies demonstrate the implementation of the innovative SPRA fluid system, resulting in a significant reduction of up to 51%, equivalent to 274 metric tons of CO2 emissions throughout the entire value chain. This includes a 50% reduction in total acid volume and a substantial 67% decrease in flowback time. These findings underscore the considerable environmental and operational benefits of the SPRA fluid system in advanced carbonate acidizing of extended reach wells.

Abstract The design of bifunctional electrocatalysts toward reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (ECO 2 RR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in aqueous rechargeable Zn─CO 2 batteries (ZABs) still poses a significant challenge. Herein, Ni clusters (Ni x ) of 0.5 and 0.8 nm in diameter coupled with single Ni site (Ni−N 4 −C), denoted as Ni−N 4 /Ni 5 and Ni−N 4 /Ni 8 , respectively, are synthesized and the size effect of Ni nanoclusters are studied. Ni−N 4 /Ni 5 exhibits an ≈100% Faradaic efficiency ( FE CO ) toward ECO 2 RR for CO from −0.4 to −0.8 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, superior to that of Ni−N 4 −C ( FE CO = 55.0%) and Ni−N 4 /Ni 8 ( FE CO = 80.0%). The OER performance of Ni−N 4 /Ni 5 and Ni−N 4 /Ni 8 are superior or comparable to that of commercial RuO 2 but outperform that of Ni−N 4 −C. Theoretical calculation indicates that * COOH of ECO 2 RR intermediates bond synergistically with Ni x clusters and Ni−N 4 −C single atom site, promoting the activation of CO 2 and reducing the energy barrier of the potential determining step of ECO 2 RR. Such effect is strongly size‐dependent and larger Ni x nanoclusters result in too strong binding of * COOH intermediates, impede the formation of * CO. As a bifunctional cathode electrocatalyst of rechargeable alkaline aqueous ZABs, Ni−N 4 /Ni 5 exhibits a peak power density of 11.7 mW cm −2 and cycling durability over 1200 cycles and 420 h.

Abstract The study aims to quantitatively assess the risk of hydrate formation within the porous formation and its consequences to injectivity during storage of CO2 in depleted gas reservoirs considering low temperatures caused by the Joule Thomson (JT) effect and hydrate kinetics. The aim was to understand which mechanisms can mitigate or prevent the formation of hydrates. The key mechanisms we studied included water dry-out, heat exchange with surrounding rock formation, and capillary pressure. A compositional thermal reservoir simulator is used to model the fluid and heat flow of CO2 through a reservoir initially composed of brine and methane. The simulator can model the formation and dissociation of both methane and CO2 hydrates using kinetic reactions. This approach has the advantage of computing the amount of hydrate deposited and estimating its effects on the porosity and permeability alteration. Sensitivity analyses are also carried out to investigate the impact of different parameters and mechanisms on the deposition of hydrates and the injectivity of CO2. Simulation results for a simplified model were verified with results from the literature. The key results of this work are: (1) The Joule-Thomson effect strongly depends on the reservoir permeability and initial pressure and could lead to the formation of hydrates within the porous media even when the injected CO2 temperature was higher than the hydrate equilibrium temperature, (2) The heat gain from underburden and overburden rock formations could prevent hydrates formed at late time, (3) Permeability reduction increased the formation of hydrates due to an increased JT cooling, and (4) Water dry-out near the wellbore did not prevent hydrate formation. Finally, the role of capillary pressure was quite complex, where it reduced the formation of hydrates in certain cases and increased in other cases. Simulating this process with heat flow and hydrate reactions was also shown to present severe numerical issues. It was critical to select convergence criteria and linear system tolerances to avoid large material balance and numerical errors.

The first part of this research article documents the impact of the studied Regenerative Agriculture models in tea in respect of crop sustainability, pesticide load reduction and reduction of pest management cost. The findings indicated an increase (78 kg/ha) in crop productivity in the project area as against crop loss of 118 kg/ha in the non- project area during the same period. The finding also indicated a 52 to 77% reduction in the accumulated toxicity potential of the applied pesticides, improvement of soil quality indices and a 6.72% increase in the soil organic carbon stock. Most importantly, carbon assessment in terms of kg CO2 equivalent/ kg made tea (using ACFA version 1.0) indicated approximately 65 to 70 % lower footprint in the project area. The lowering of carbon footprint was due to a 20 to 30 % reduction in the chemical fertilizers along with improvement in carbon sequestration potential of the soil due to quality compost application and reduction of herbicides. The study indicated that Inhana Rational Farming (IRF) Technology can serve as an effective tool towards development of resource based Regenerative Agriculture Models that can ensure safe and low carbon tea cultivation without compromising crop yield and without increasing the cost of cultivation.

Metal hydride (MH) is an alloy that reversibly reacts with hydrogen gas and charges/discharges hydrogen into/from it. MH has some merits, such as low-pressure hydrogen storage, which can contribute to the abatement of environmental impacts, and high volumetric density, which can enhance the operation time per one charge. However, MH requires a long hydrogen charging time owing to the temperature increase caused by the exothermic reaction in its hydrogen-charging process. To address this problem, MH can be cooled to prevent the temperature increase during hydrogen charging. Thus, in this study, an MH cooling system using natural refrigerant GF-08 (MHG system) was investigated and compared with an MH cooling system using R410A (MHR system) and a conventional lithium-ion-battery-based energy storage system (Li-ion battery (LIB) system) in terms of the equivalent CO2 emission and charging time. It was determined that the CO2 reduction rate of the MHG system was 14.9% (MHR system) and 9.43% (LIB system). Moreover, by focusing on the charging time, it was found that the charging time of the LIB system was 10.3 times longer than those of the MHG and MHR systems. Therefore, MH cooling using GF-08 was proved to be effective at reducing both equivalent CO2 emissions and charging time compared to the MH cooling system using R410A and a lithium ion battery.

Herein, we report a phase-transformed fuel electrode to carry out the reversible CO–CO2 conversion in a reversible solid oxide electrochemical cell (RSOC), which is composed of self-assembled FeRu bimetallic nanoparticles and Ruddlesden-Popper Pr0.8Sr1.2Fe1−x−yRuxMoyO4 (FeRu@PSFRM). Electrochemical impedance spectra and their corresponding distribution of relaxation time demonstrate that the sub-electrode reaction process in the frequency ranging 100–102 Hz, including the gas adsorption, dissociation, and ionization reactions on the electrode surface, predominantly dominates the entire electrode reaction process. The single cell with the FeRu@PSFRM fuel electrode generates a maximum output power density of 170 W cm−2 at 800°C in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode, while yields a current density of −0.256 A cm−2 at 1.3 V in the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode. In addition, the reliable reversible CO–CO2 mutual conversion has experienced "activation-stabilization-degradation" three obvious stages in the first 42-h SOFC-SOEC cycling testing. Fortunately, the degraded fuel electrode can be regenerated by oxidizing it in the oxidizing gas and then retreating in the reductive atmosphere. Our findings reveal that the FeRu@PSFRM material generated by the in-situ exsolution technique is a promising fuel electrode candidate for efficient and durable mutual CO–CO2 conversion in a RSOC.

To accurately predict the life-cycle carbon reduction benefits of replacing a diesel heavy-duty truck with an electric one, taking a single heavy-duty truck as the object, the variation trend in electric and diesel carbon emission factors from 2023 to 2050 were predicted; coupled with the life spans and life-cycle mileage of the two types of heavy-duty trucks, a dynamic carbon emission model for the heavy-duty trucks was constructed in stages. The carbon footprints of the trucks under the "Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)", "Announced Pledges Scenario (APS)", and "Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)" were analyzed. In addition, the carbon reduction and carbon reduction rate were calculated. The results showed that battery manufacturing and battery recycling were the main factors to impair the improvement of carbon reduction in the production and recycling stages of electric heavy-duty trucks, respectively. For every 1 g·(kW·h)-1 reduction in the electricity carbon emission factor (CO2), an electric heavy-duty truck could reduce 1.74 t of carbon emissions over its life cycle. Under the three scenarios, the carbon emissions during the operation stage of both types of heavy trucks accounted for more than 90% of the total life-cycle carbon emissions. Carbon reduction benefits from the highest to the lowest were NZE, APS, and STEPS, and their corresponding life-cycle carbon emission reductions were 1054.68, 1021.78, and 1007.97 t, with carbon reduction rates of 54.38%, 52.68%, and 51.97%, respectively.

Heteroatom doping is essential for enhancing the performance of activated carbons (ACs) in various environmental-related applications. Herein, a scalable confined-space microwave heating (CSMH) strategy is proposed and demonstrated to achieve minute-level fast preparation of N/O co-doping ACs with well-developed porosity. The introduction of confined space prevents the escape of nitrogenous and oxygenous volatiles, enabling the sufficient reaction for heteroatom doping. Therefore, the nitrogen content of MWC-0.5 (6.0 at.%) is higher than that of MW-0.5 (3.5 at.%) and CH-0.5 (4.3 at.%). This causes a nearly 50% reduction in the consumption of nitrogenous reagents. Moreover, through CSMH strategy, N/O co-doped ACs (6.0 at% and 8.1 at% for N and O, respectively) with high pore volume (0.53 cm3·g-1) can be acquired to achieve an excellent adsorption performance for toluene (0.31 g·g-1) and CO2 (3.97 mmol·g-1 at 25 °C and 1 bar) and outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity (189 at 0.02 bar). This work for the first time develops a scalable confined-space N/O co-doped strategy for enhancing the chemical activity of ACs with low-spend nitrogenous reagents.

In terms of energy generation and consumption, ships are autonomous isolated systems, with power demands varying according to the type of ship: passenger or commercial. The power supply in modern ships is based on thermal engines-generators, which use fossil fuels, marine diesel oil (MDO) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The continuous operation of thermal engines on ships during cruises results in increased emissions of polluting gases, mainly CO/CO2. The combination of renewable energy sources (REs) and triple-fuel diesel engines (TFDEs) can reduce CO/CO2 emissions, resulting in a “greener” interaction between ships and the ecosystem. This work presents a new control method for balancing the power generation and the load demands of a ship equipped with TFDEs, fuel cells (FCs), and REs, based on a real and accurate model of a super-tanker and simulation of its operation in real cruise conditions. The new TFDE technology engines are capable of using different fuels (marine diesel oil, heavy fuel oil and liquified natural gas), producing the power required for ship operation, as well as using compositions of other fuels based on diesel, aiming to reduce the polluting gases produced. The energy management system (EMS) of a ship is designed and implemented in the structure of a finite state machine (FSM), using the logical design of transitions from state to state. The results demonstrate that further reductions in fossil fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions are possible if ship power generation is combined with FC units that consume hydrogen as fuel. The hydrogen is produced locally on the ship through electrolysis using the electric power generated by the on-board renewable energy sources (REs) using photovoltaic systems (PVs) and wind energy conversion turbines (WECs).

Abstract Sulfur Recovery unit is an essential part in Oil Refinery and gas treatment unit, it consist of MDEA enrichment unit, Claus Unit, Tail gas treatment unit and thermal incineration unit. Incineration process is used in order to make the process effluents releasable into the atmosphere. In which the hazardous and pollutant sulfur containing compounds are converted to sulfur dioxide. The case study of this work is about an existing thermal incinerator in Sulfur Recovery Unit, its streams are mainly consist of combustion air, MDEA waste gas, tail gas and fuel gas. Feed stream temperatures will be maximize more than current operating temperature in order to reduce fuel gas consumption and CO2 emission as well. The idea is utilized the produce high pressure steam from its Waste heat Boiler WHB to preheat feed stream including combustion air 40°C and tail gas 140°C and MDEA waste gas 40°C. in this study the target preheating temperature is 290°C for each stream. PROMAX Software is used as simulation tool, three scenarios have been chosen including maximize tail gas temperature, combustion air temperature and finally waste gas temperature. All input field date have been collected from operating system called distribution control system (DCS). Result show remarkable reduction of fuel gas consumption and CO2 emission for three scenarios (12.5%, 26 % and 36% respectively) comparing to existing situation for the case study. So installing high pressure steam pre-heaters on feed streams is strongly recommended for this case study in order to reduce operation cost and CO2 emission.

Photoelectrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction provide an attractive route to produce solar fuels while reducing the level of CO2 emissions. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been extensively studied for this purpose in recent years due to their suitable optoelectronic properties. In this review, we survey the recent achievements in the field. After a brief introduction to photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes, we discussed the properties, synthesis, and application of MHPs in this context. We also survey the state-of-the-art findings regarding significant achievements in performance, and developments in addressing the major challenges of toxicity and instability toward water. Efforts have been made to replace the toxic Pb with less toxic materials like Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. The stability toward water has been also improved by using various methods such as compositional engineering, 2D/3D perovskite structures, surface passivation, the use of protective layers, and encapsulation. In the last part, considering the experience gained in photovoltaic applications, we provided our perspective for the future challenges and opportunities. We place special emphasis on the improvement of stability as the major challenge and the potential contribution of machine learning to identify the most suitable formulation for halide perovskites with desired properties.

The Trombe wall is renowned for its effectiveness in passive heating during winter, but it can lead to overheating in summer. To address this issue, this study investigates a Trombe wall with fully opening glazing during the summer season, employing multi-fold glazing. The research, conducted in Ifrane, Morocco, focuses on a residential building using the Conduction Finite Difference Method within the DesignBuilder software, and examines three configurations: a reference configuration, classic Trombe wall, and Trombe wall with multi-fold glazing. The results demonstrate that the last configuration achieves a 63% (24,94 kWh/m2) reduction in total energy consumption compared to the reference configuration and a 34% (7,62 kWh/m2) reduction compared to the classic Trombe wall. Additionally, the implementation of sustainable ecological biomaterials, such as timber instead of concrete, is explored to reduce CO2 emissions. Further analysis of the Trombe wall with multi-fold glazing is conducted by considering five parameters: glazing type, emissivity, vent size, insulation, and PCM thicknesses. These parameters are examined across five different variables. Reducing emissivity leads to reductions of 51% and 30% in heating energy consumption and discomfort hours, respectively. Modifying the type of glazing results in an 11% reduction in heating energy consumption. Increasing insulation thickness leads to notable reductions of 15% in heating energy consumption and 6% in discomfort hours. Conversely, increasing PCM thickness and vent size yields had minimal impact on total energy consumption, each resulting in a 1% reduction. This research provides insights into optimizing Trombe walls by integrating multi-fold glazing to address summer overheating issues and by exploring additional parameters to enhance system performance.

In line with Global Climate Change Alliance initiated in 2007 by the European Commission, the South Korean government announced the "2050 Carbon-Neutral Strategy" in October 2020. The 2050 Carbon-Neutral Scenario was announced in October 2021, with the aim of reducing the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40 % by 2030 compared to those in 2018. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a scenario-based comparative analysis focusing on the forecast of greenhouse gas emissions and the potential for reduction within the building sector. The methodology employed in this study utilizes the greenhouse gas emission calculation methods outlined in the IPCC Guidelines of 1996 and 2006. Based on the national building energy and statistics database for the years 2015 to 2019, the study analyzes building types, building energy intensity, and floor areas to calculate emissions and energy consumption within the sector. The results indicate that the emissions will increase continuously from 2020 (156.9 million tons of CO2 equivalent) to 2050 (217.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent). We have considered the four scenarios outlined in the '2050 Carbon Neutrality Scenario' as the most effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. These include: (1) Mandatory implementation of Zero-Energy Buildings (ZEB) for new buildings by 2050, (2) 100 % execution of green remodeling for existing buildings, (3) Promotion of high-efficiency devices to achieve a 25–30 % improvement in energy consumption efficiency compared to 2018 and an enhancement of device energy use per unit, and (4) Expansion of clean heat utilization such as fuel cells and waste heat utilization in district heating. Thus, the possibility of South Korea achieving the 2050 carbon-neutrality target in the building sector is low. Therefore, it is important to develop effective emissions reduction policies and plans for the building sector.

Abstract Polymer injection projects need to reduce CO2 emissions, material demand for facilities, water use, and waste to compete as viable solutions in the energy transition. Steel production process is the main contributor to CO2 emission. To address this issue, we have embarked on reducing in 50% our mobile expansion concept, which replaces conventional massive injection plants with reusable ones storing energy in the subsurface. Here we propose to design a polymer injection project that is in line with circular economic concepts. We reduce the size of the needed facilities and reuse them by storing energy in the formation during injection periods (On) in half patterns and releasing it during shut-in periods (Off) in the other half of patterns. This mechanism is based on the high rock compressibility of the fluvial system in Manantiales Behr. Coupling the high rock compressibility with an On-Offcyclical injection strategy makes the system behave analogue to a spring-mass system that can store and release energy and has resonance conditions. We tested the idea in a conceptual simulator model, then in a sector model and finally, we implemented a pilot in four patterns that already had an oil response baseline by continuous polymer injection. Now, We expanded it to 14 patterns. We reduced more than 50% of the needs in steel consumption and the energy requirement for constructing and mounting a polymer injection unit. These savings amount to 170 to 405 tCO2 depending on the source of the steel which represents about 0.6% of the annual CO2 reduction per year in London. The incremental recovery factor is 19% incremental almost the same as continuous polymer injection. The reservoir simulations carried out show similarincremental recovery factors with this methodology than those that would be achieved with a massive injection for the same injection wells, achieving slightly lower production peaks, but with less decline and with polymer consumption 30% less than in the case of mass injection.On-Off injection strategy allowed us to feed a greater number of injectors with the same modular plant and reduce polymer consumption by not injecting massively into all the wells of the project at the same time. By Implementing this technology, we managed to reduce the environmental impact by lowering the number of modular injection plants needed and we improved the economics of the project by reducing both the CAPEX and OPEX involved. This process has a significant impact on all polymer flooding projects that are being undertaken in fluvial Complex Two of Comodoro Rivadavia Formation. Moreover, our mobile expansion concept with modular reusable plants (SPE-200355-MS) targets the installation of ten plants per year. Therefore, the potential reduction in emissions could be ten times greater.

Ride-splitting offers significant potential for reducing travel mileage and emissions. However, the patterns of ride-splitting demonstrate both diversity and complexity, yet there remains a deficiency in systematic and in-depth investigations of these patterns. This study aims to explore multiple patterns of ride-splitting and to evaluate the associated impacts on mileage and emission savings based on the pattern diversity. Firstly, two methods that are respectively for calculating the sub-pattern types from every ride-splitting pattern in theory, and for recognizing the actual sub-patterns in reality, are sequentially proposed. Then, the adjusted passenger mileage considering ride-splitting (i.e., APM) is proposed with detailed calculation methods for various ride-splitting patterns. Furthermore, a trip-level method for estimating emission reduction is developed by integrating the comparison of APM with the shortest mileage into the MOVES model. Finally, mileage saving and emissions reduction of ride-splitting in trip-level are investigated using the data sets of Beijing and Xiamen, respectively. The pattern diversity results show that 20 ride-splitting sub-patterns in actual data can be explored in Beijing and Xiamen. The average mileage savings can be obtained at the trip-level, which is 1.32 km for Beijing and 1.36 km for Xiamen. In the 20 sub-patterns, it is indicated that more trips involved in ride-splitting may not result in a more effective reduction, and the three-group-passenger pattern shows the best performance in CO2 reduction. The study can provide promising results for understanding the strength of ride-splitting in reducing emissions and supporting the promotion of low-carbon travel modes.

Mineral carbonation provides a way to increase the recycling of concrete waste in added-value products, and contributes to the principles of the circular economy. At present, most concrete waste is still downcycled. The high water absorption of recycled concrete aggregates, among other factors, impedes their recycling in the concrete industry. The quality of coarse recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) can, however, be enhanced by carbonation. Even when starting with high-grade RCA obtained from a selective demolition process, the carbonation process can decrease the water absorption of the RCA to as low as 3.0%. Concrete with a 50% replacement rate of carbonated RCA can be produced without a significant compressive strength reduction. The research further shows that carbonation can be performed at atmospheric pressure and low CO2 concentrations (e.g., 10%). The recycled concrete fines (RCF, 0–4 mm) in combination with 25% stainless steel slag were used to make zero-cement hollow blocks (39 × 19 × 9 cm) by carbonation curing without using any hydraulic binder. The hollow blocks have a compressive strength of 15.4 MPa at the lab scale. Both technologies were demonstrated on a pilot scale. In both processes, CO2 is immobilized in the resulting construction product. The developed production processes use less primary raw materials and cause less greenhouse-gas emissions than the production of traditional concrete products.

Abstract Platooning represents a crucial strategy for mitigating emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). This study evaluates the effects of platoon composition on the surrounding airflow utilizing a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, and quantifies the resultant fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. This study examines fuel consumption data reconstructed from field experiments to validate the CFD model’s ability to accurately simulate drag forces within a homogeneous three-truck platoon. The potential for fuel savings was assessed based on CFD-simulated fuel consumption, taking into account various inter-vehicle distances and driving speeds. The model successfully reproduced the fuel consumption observed in a platooning formation comprising lead, middle, and trailing trucks, with an error margin below 6.2%. While the lead and middle trucks exhibited increased fuel consumption with greater inter-vehicle distances, the trailing truck showed decreased fuel consumption with specific distance-to-length ratios (D/L), followed by an increase from a D/L of 1.1. Additionally, a significant decrease in total fuel efficiency was noted for D/L ratios exceeding 1.5. Considering the diverse platooning scenarios analyzed, the study anticipates an annual reduction of up to 7 tons of CO2 equivalent per vehicle. By optimizing platooning configurations, this research contributes to enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions from HDVs.

Abstract The Postle field is located in Texas County in the Oklahoma Panhandle and has been waterflooded since 1960 and CO2 flooded since 1996. In 2022, a streamline-based flood management workflow was initiated to optimize flood performance and improve cashflow. Initial recommendations included cutting existing CO2 purchases by 50%, generating a savings of $7.5MM. In 2023, due to a deterioration in profitability, the field went through several iterations of cost-cutting measures culminating in the elimination of purchased CO2 and a reduction in workover job. The loss of purchased CO2 effectively reduced the volume of injection volumes by about 20%, reducing the VRR from 1.5 to 1.2. This reduced the processing rate in the reservoir from 7% to 5% per year. This work outlines a streamline-based flood management approach, and results achieved from the implementation of this new workflow. The new flood management approach was adopted across the entire Postle field that consists of 4 units. This encompasses nearly 250 producers and 100 injectors. A streamline surveillance model was built for the entire field across the 3 main producing zones. The results from the surveillance model were used to identify interwell connections between producers and injectors. This allowed the injection impact or value of each injector to be properly quantified. The injection efficiencies were used to allocate the limited volume of CO2, where higher efficiency injectors were allocated more CO2. WAG parameters were also calibrated based on rate targets from the surveillance optimization module (floodOPT). The combination of rate targets and ranking of injectors based on efficiencies were used to determine WAG cycle lengths, WAG ratios and injection volumes. The injector efficiencies (or volume of oil associated with each injector) proved an accurate measure to the engineering teams to accurate rank injectors in order of priority for workovers and determine whether an injector was worth repairing or plugging. The initial results from the streamline model was obtained in 2022 and validated and verified with other measurements. The surveillance model produced a connectivity map between injectors and producers (FMAP) that was consistent with flow path directions from a tracer study in 2021. Furthermore, the interwell connectivities in the model across multiple patterns were consistent with well connections from production-injection data and field staff experience. This highlighted the challenge with using classical geometrical pattern allocations that are time-invariant, compared to dynamic patterns that are influenced by geology and rate. The model also flagged underperforming injectors i.e. injectors with low efficiencies that were in relatively immature areas. These injectors were known to have vertical conformance issues. The streamline model-based recommendations continued to be used through 2023. The models were updated with production and injection data quarterly. Injection rates were adjusted based on the updated injection efficiencies calculated from floodOPT with constraints based on the availability of injection volumes, well injectivity limitations, well failures and field facility limits. WAG parameters including cycle lengths and WAG ratios were set based on injection efficiency, area maturity and available CO2. Injectors with higher efficiency and lower maturity were allocated lower WAG ratios. CO2 allocation became more critical when purchases were eliminated in 2023. When the new flood management workflow was implemented, the field oil cut declines were approximately 14% pa with increasing GOR and WOR. Over a period of 6 months, favorable results were seen in these trends; GOR and WOR trends stabilized and reduced, and the oil cut decline was mitigated to less than 10% pa. Despite losing 20% of the available CO2 for injection, the oil rate in multiple patterns increased. The impact of the oil rate increase was difficult to observe on a field level because of multiple well failures and operational challenges. Nevertheless, field oil rate declines reduced from 14% pa to 9% pa; at the current decline rate, the improved management would yield an additional 300,000 bbls of oil production.

Landfills play a key role as greenhouse gas (GHGs) emitters, and urgently need assessment and management plans development to swiftly reduce their climate impact. In this context, accurate emission measurements from landfills under different climate and management would reduce the uncertainty in emission accounting. In this study, more than one year of long-term high-frequency data of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were collected in two Italian landfills (Giugliano and Case Passerini) with contrasting management (gas recovery VS no management) using eddy covariance (EC), with the aim to i) investigate the relation between climate drivers and CO2 and CH4 fluxes at different time intervals and ii) to assess the overall GHG balances including the biogas extraction and energy recovery components. Results indicated a higher net atmospheric CO2 source (5.7 ± 5.3 g m2 d-1) at Giugliano compared to Case Passerini (2.4 ± 4.9 g m2 d-1) as well as one order of magnitude higher atmospheric CH4 fluxes (6.0 ± 5.7 g m2 d-1 and 0.7 ± 0.6 g m2 d-1 respectively). Statistical analysis highlighted that fluxes were mainly driven by thermal variables, followed by water availability, with their relative importance changing according to the time-interval considered. The rate of change in barometric pressure (dP/dt) influenced CH4 patterns and magnitude in the classes ranging from -1.25 to +1.25 Pa h-1, with reduction when dP/dt > 0 and increase when dP/dt < 0, whilst a clear pattern was not observed when all dP/dt classes were analyzed. When including management, the total atmospheric GHG balance computed for the two landfills of Giugliano and Case Passerini was 174 g m2 d-1 and 79 g m2 d-1 respectively, of which 168 g m2 d-1 and 20 g m2 d-1 constituted by CH4 fluxes.

Silver is a prominent material for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to CO with high Faradaic efficiency (FE), relatively low price, and huge reserves. Size and structure control of metallic nanomaterials have been confirmed to significantly affect the catalytic performance. For this purpose, a microfluidic synthesis platform is built innovatively to achieve controllable, precise, and continuous preparation of monodisperse silver nanocubes (Ag NCs). Three stages of the growth process for Ag NCs are revealed through online regulation of residence time, and then the formation mechanism is proposed. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the catalytic role of Ag2S clusters and the synergistic capping effect of Cl− and PVP. Finally, the prepared Ag NCs are applied to CO2RR, achieving 95.6 % CO FE at −0.8 VRHE and stable operation for at least 12 h.

Abstract With the current market fluctuations trend outlook, it is severely more challenging to prove the viability of the major greenfield oil and gas field development. Various key factors in the design are identified to be able to contribute to effectiveness of the facilities concept towards achieving fit of purpose design in terms of cost, safety, and reliability. It is paramount deep dive on this study due to the facilities that mostly contributes 50% of the overall development cost and has significant impact on the project economics. Since offshore greenfield developments the cost are generally high, hence, It is paramount for the Field Development Team to find a balance between Facilities cost with strategy to design for GHG emission reduction. Since new upstream project are required to comply with zero flaring & zero venting approach, it is crucial for the project to develop surface facilities to capture the GHG emission in any one of the options i.e., Gas Disposal, Gas Injection for Reservoir Pressure Maintenance or team can also consider any Carbon Abatement Technology. Surface facility is designed to filter the CO2 in the hydrocarbon production at offshore CPP (Central Processing Platform) and re-inject the CO2 back into the formation via a dedicated gas injector well. The selection & optimization of surface equipment CO2 are of critical in ensuring that project will still be economical despite with additional cost invested to reinject the CO2 back into the reservoir. This paper would provide more insight into the study and analysis to be considered during designing new facilities development in a field with high CO2 that integrate development wells producing hydrocarbon and lesson learnt and best practices that are valuable for future project with similar scope. This paper goes beyond mere exposition and meticulously details the established process flow, deftly managed to effectively guide the Field Development Plan (FDP) team in formulating the most cost-effective development concept. This concept not only aligns with the company's aspirations for a sustainable field development plan towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions but also promises positive economic outcomes. Within these pages, the team not only narrates but vividly demonstrates a meticulously selected case or concept deemed as the most cost-effective among all the iterations evaluated. This chosen facilities concept doesn't stand in isolation; rather, it serves as a beacon, illuminating the pathway for other greenfield projects grappling with similar challenges in their fields—be it high contaminants or waxy crudes. It exemplifies the practical realization of an economical and sustainable Field Development Plan, harmoniously meeting the company's ambition of net-zero carbon emissions while ensuring positive economic projections. The insights shared within this paper are poised to resonate with and inspire a broader spectrum of projects facing comparable challenges, fostering a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and economically sound field development practices.

The Zn–Co double metal cyanide (DMC) complex is regarded as a promising catalyst for the copolymerization of CO2 and propylene epoxide (PO). Various methods have been adopted to improve the catalytic performance of DMC. In this study, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), as a co-complexing agent, was innovatively used to modify DMC and applied to the synthesis of poly(ether–carbonate) polyols from CO2, PO, and a chain transfer agent. The modified catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity than the catalysts prepared by conventional methods, with a nearly 10 % increase in PO conversion. The most critical breakthrough was a reduction of nearly 5 wt% in the byproduct propylene–carbonate. The results confirmed that amide groups in PVP could coordinate with active center Zn2+, providing the modified catalysts with advantages such as low-symmetry structure, high specific surface area, and strong acidity. Moreover, the dual effects of PVP coordination and dispersion led to dramatic differences in the microstructure and activity of the catalysts when added during different preparation processes of DMC. The coordination effect of PVP was dominant in the nucleation stages which affected the crystal structure and morphology, whereas, the dispersion effect was dominant in the aging stages which prevented the catalyst particles from growing and thus a higher specific surface area. This is critical for paving the way towards exploring the introduction of groups with high steric hindrance into Zn–Co complex catalysts. In addition, a detailed and in-depth insight into the structure–activity relationship of DMC for poly(ether–carbonate) polyols synthesis was summarized.

The scientific aim of this article is to elucidate the effects of various tillage practices on soil properties and crop yields; additionally, it seeks to highlight the significant potential of specific farming systems in enhancing soil organic carbon, thereby positively influencing CO2 emissions from soil. In the experimental station of Vytautas Magnus University, Kaunas District, Lithuania (54°52′50″ N and 23°49′41″ E), a long-term field experiment has been established since 1999, and studies have been conducted since 2003. The soil of the experimental site is classified as Epieutric Endocalcaric Planosol (Endoclayic, Episiltic, Aric, Drainic, Endoraptic, Uterquic), according to the World Reference Base (WRB, 2022). Two primary factors were assessed. Factor A incorporated practices of straw removal versus straw chopping and spreading, while Factor B evaluated a spectrum of tillage techniques: conventional deep plowing and two no-tillage practices, one of which involved cover crops. The findings from this long-term study highlight a significant increase in SOC stocks across all treatments over the 20-year period. Notably, the no-tillage practices, coupled with the spreading of chopped straw, demonstrated the most substantial growth in SOC levels, particularly in the top 0–10 cm soil layer. This trend underscores the effectiveness of minimizing soil disturbance and incorporating organic matter in boosting SOC stocks. The different tillage systems influence CO2 emissions from soil. Initially, direct sowing into uncultivated land, both with and without cover crops, led to a notable reduction in CO2 emissions compared to conventional plowing. However, this effect was found to vary over the growth cycle of the plant, highlighting the dynamic interaction between tillage practices, soil properties, and environmental conditions. Collaborative research efforts that involve farmers, scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders are crucial for the development of holistic, practical, scalable solutions that enhance the sustainability and productivity of agricultural systems. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable agriculture, providing insights for farmers, agronomists, and policymakers in their quest to promote environmentally sound and productive agricultural systems.

Copper-based bimetallic heterojunction catalysts facilitate the deep electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2RR) to produce high-value-added organic compounds, which hold significant promise. Understanding the influence of copper interactions with other metals on the adsorption strength of various intermediates is crucial as it directly impacts the reaction selectivity. In this review, an overview of the formation mechanism of various catalytic products in eCO2RR is provided and highlight the uniqueness of copper-based catalysts. By considering the different metals' adsorption tendencies toward various reaction intermediates, metals are classified, including copper, into four categories. The significance and advantages of constructing bimetallic heterojunction catalysts are then discussed and delve into the research findings and current development status of different types of copper-based bimetallic heterojunction catalysts. Finally, insights are offered into the design strategies for future high-performance electrocatalysts, aiming to contribute to the development of eCO2RR to multi-carbon fuels with high selectivity.

Moderate and intense low-oxygen dilution oxy-coal combustion (MILD-OCC) technology is prospective as a result of its high thermal efficiency, low NOx emission, and applications for carbon capture and sequestration. MILD-OCC experiments were carried out on the flat flame burner combustion facility where the diffusion flamelet can provide the stable hot coflow of the fixed temperatures and oxygen volume fractions. The flue gas species concentrations at different axial heights above the burner tip were measured by the flue gas analyzer. First, pulverized coal particle combustion experiments under CO2, N2 and Ar dilution with different coflow temperatures and oxygen volume fractions were carried out to quantitatively separate thermal and fuel NO. The NO formation kinetics were obtained through nth-order Arrhenius nonlinear fitting to calculate the relative contributions of thermal and fuel NO. Second, the comparison between the experiments of coal and char combustion was made to quantitatively separate the formation and reduction of volatile NO and char NO. Finally, different concentrations of initial NO were added to the oxidizer to simulate recycled NO, and the experiments on the influence of different concentrations of recycled NO were conducted to quantitatively separate the recycled NO reburning. Therefore, the NO formation and reduction mechanisms during the whole process of MILD-OCC were quantitatively separated, and their relative contributions were identified. With the increase of the coflow temperature from 1473 to 1873 K under the condition of 10% O2, the relative contribution rate of volatile NO reduction to fuel NO decreases from 25 to 17%, with the relative contribution rate of char NO reduction to fuel NO increasing from 2 to 9% and the relative contribution rate of recycled NO reburning to fuel NO increasing from 7 to 19%. The results can provide a comprehensive and quantitative perspective on the NOx routes and the control method of low NOx emissions for MILD-OCC.

A critical analysis of alkali-activated cements as sustainable materials demonstrates their advantages compared to traditional Portland cements. It also makes it possible to identify the main drivers of alkaline activation in the production of cements for mortars and concretes used in repairing building construction. These materials are effective for repairing, retrofitting, and rehabilitation of damaged structures (pavement, bridge decks, tunnel structures, highways, airport runways, berths, piers, coast-protecting structures, dams, etc.). Technical drivers are based on cements with high physical and mechanical properties and durability, due to a highly effective hydrate composition in cement stone. This has benefits due to a lack of free Ca(OH)2, ettringite, and highly basic calcium silicates in the presence of low basic calcium silicates and zeolite-like hydration products. Environmental drivers are associated with the reduction or elimination of non-renewable raw materials from Portland cement clinker, and the high clinker efficiency resulting from the activation and application of industrial by-products and wastes, as well as seawater. Commercial drivers are justified by low specific energy consumption in cement production, reductions in costs for exceeding CO2, SO2, and mercury emission quotas, and a low cost of raw materials, due to the use of a high proportion of by-products, such as fuel ashes, metallurgical slags, red mud, silica, ceramic powder, etc.

This study aims to evaluate the evolving municipal solid waste management (MSWM) strategies in Addis Ababa City, capital of Ethiopia, based on greenhouse gas (GHG) and short-lived climate pollutants (i.e., black carbon) emissions. Comparable to the existing practice of open disposal and burning, with only 5% recycling, four alternative scenarios were developed considering advances proposed on the City's Structural Plan of 2017–2027. The first scenario (S-1) suggests mixed-waste collection and disposal in a sanitary landfill while keeping the current recycling. The second (S-2) promotes the source-separated collection, organic waste composting, recycling in material recycling facilities, and disposal in a sanitary landfill. The third (S-3) adds incineration with energy recovery on S-2 to divert a portion of waste from landfills. The fourth (S-4) replaces composting in S-2 by anaerobic digestion with biogas energy production. The existing practice is estimated to emit 703,291 t CO2-eq GHG and 75.10 t black carbon (BC) from yearly waste. S-1 showed 55% increase in GHG emission and 92% reduction in BC; S-2 showed 1% increase in GHG and 93% reduction in BC; S-3 showed 83% reduction in GHG and 125% increase in BC; and S-4 showed 11% reduction in GHG and negative net emissions of BC. The results indicated that no proposed scenario is climate-friendly. However, S-3 performs better in GHG reduction, specifically for methane (CH4). S-4, in turn, is safe in terms of BC. Although the sensitivity analysis revealed GHG emission from S-3 increases with future waste composition changes, it will remain the first choice for the climate. The study identified CH4 and BC as critical parameters in tracking improvements. Hence, proper planning that involves increasing organic waste transformation, CH4 recovery from landfills, and strict flue gas management during waste incineration can optimize the results.

Despite the widespread utilization of variable valence metals in electrochemistry, it is still a formidable challenge to enhance the valence conversion efficiency to achieve excellent catalytic activity without introducing heterophase elements. Herein, the in-situ precipitation of Co particles on Co2VO4 not only enhanced the concentration of oxygen vacancies (Ov) but also generated a greater number of low-valence metals, thereby enabling efficient reduction towards Hg(II). The electroanalysis results demonstrate that the sensitivity of Co/Co2VO4 towards Hg(II) was measured at an impressive value of 1987.74 μA μM-1 cm-2, significantly surpassing previously reported results. Further research reveals that Ov acted as the main adsorption site to capture Hg(II). The redox reactions of Co2+/Co3+ and V3+/V4+ played a synergistic role in the reduction of Hg(II), accompanied by the continuous supply of electrons from zero-valent Co to expedite the valence cycle. The Co/Co2VO4/GCE presented remarkable selectivity towards Hg(II), with excellent stability, reproducibility, and anti-interference capability. The electrode also exhibited minimal sensitivity fluctuations towards Hg(II) in real water samples, underscoring its practicality for environmental applications. This study elucidates the mechanism underlying the surface redox reaction of metal oxides facilitated by zero-valent metals, providing us with new strategies for further design of efficient and practical sensors.

Developing an efficient and low-cost oxygen reduction electrocatalyst is essential for the application of aqueous zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we report a facile adsorption-confined pyrolysis strategy to fabricate the hybrid electrocatalyst (denoted as Co9S8/CoSA-PC) by embedding Co9S8 nanoparticles into Co single atoms (Co-SAs) anchored porous carbon sheets for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) durability. In this strategy, the Co2+ ions are first absorbed into oxygen-rich porous carbon nanosheets and further form the Co-SAs with the help of thiourea in the following pyrolysis procedure, which is believed to be able to confine the generated Co9S8 nanoparticles into carbon frameworks due to their interface interaction. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of different components, the obtained Co9S8/CoSA-PC electrocatalyst for ORR exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V and a distinguished long-term durability with a current retention of 80 % after cycling 80 h under alkaline conditions, which is superior to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the assembled ZABs with Co9S8/CoSA-PC as cathodic catalyst deliver a high specific capacity of 764 mAh gZn-1 at 10 mA cm-2 and the outstanding peak power density of up to 221.4 mW cm-2. This work provides a novel structure design strategy to prepare transition metal sulfide-based electrocatalysts with superior durability for ORR.

To reduce energy consumption and transportation emissions during car-following behavior on highways, we propose a car-following model for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). This new model considers spacing variation of the surrounding vehicles located immediately upstream and downstream. We optimize the key parameter of forward control weight of the proposed CAV model to stabilize traffic flow and ensure stable conditions. Then simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed CAV model in enhancing traffic flow stability and energy-saving in mixed traffic consisting of both CAVs and regular vehicles (RVs). Results show that traffic flow controlled by the proposed CAV model is less affected by disturbances. The increase of CAV penetration rates can gradually improve stability of the mixed traffic flow. CAVs equipped with our proposed model can effectively reduce energy consumption and transportation emissions, which decrease with an increase of CAV penetration rates under constant speed conditions. When CAV penetration rate reaches 100%, the average reduction of energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and NOx emissions at various speeds reach a peak value of 22.15%, 31.00%, and 56.41%, respectively. Speed also has significant influence on energy consumption and emissions, with potential reductions when speed falls within an appropriate range.

Limestone or quicklime is a necessary flux in the iron ore sintering process. Its production and application process will cause CO2 emissions and various environmental pollution, but this has not attracted enough attention. Carbide slag (CS) is a calcium-rich solid waste produced in acetylene production, the harmless disposal of which is still incomplete, resulting in soil and groundwater pollution. This study investigated the granulation characteristics and sintering performance of the sintering mixture with different proportions of CS. The results show that replacing limestone with an appropriate proportion of CS is promising and beneficial to the formation of high-quality bonding phase. When CS accounts for 75% of the total mass of CS and limestone, the tumbler index increases by 8.10% and the comprehensive index decreases only from 100 to 96.16, which is within the acceptable range. The application of CS in iron ore sintering can achieve a clean disposal of it and a considerable carbon emission reduction, as the main component of which is Ca(OH)2.

In this work, the reaction kinetics of CaO were investigated with interest in its application as a sorbent in the sorption-enhanced methanation process. Therefore, hydration and carbonation kinetics were studied under operating conditions analogous to those required by the process (i.e. atmospheric pressure and temperature range between 200 °C and 350 °C). Two different CaO-based materials were considered in this study. The experimental results indicated that a shrinking core model with chemical reaction control successfully predicted hydration and carbonation conversion for both CaO-based sorbents. The activation energy obtained was similar for both sorbents, being 1.69 kJ/mol and 1.76 kJ/mol for the hydration reaction and 22.27 kJ/mol and 21.60 kJ/mol for the carbonation reaction. Additionally, the present study investigated the impact of simultaneous hydration and carbonation reactions. Both sorbents showed a reduction in hydration capacity when CO2 was introduced into the reaction atmosphere due to the formation of a CaCO3 product layer.

To predict and evaluate the carbon footprint in the gas phase, furnace fuel oil oxidation in excess air (alpha factor 1.3) was studied over a wide temperature (T = 298–3000 K, P = 0.1 MPa). Equilibrium thermodynamic parameters (entropy, enthalpy, and internal energy) and the concentration distributions of C-, S-, N-, O-, and H-containing components and active particles in the gas phase were determined. Based on the total concentration distribution of C-, S-, N-, O-, and H-containing components and active particles in the gas phase, the weight content of carbon was calculated. Taking into account the chemical matrix of the furnace fuel oil–air system and the weight content of carbon, the man-made load of carbon in the gas phase was found. The results of the work made it possible to evaluate the carbon footprint in the gas phase because of the combustion of fuel, in particular, furnace fuel oil in air. Reduction of the man-made load of carbon oxides (CO, CO2) in the gas phase was achieved by modifying and burning furnace fuel oil in the form of oil-in-water (reverse) emulsions in E-1/9M industrial boilers.

The integration of high-rate activated sludge (HRAS), an effective carbon redirection technology, with partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) is a novel AB treatment process for municipal wastewater. In this study, an airlift HRAS reactor was operated in the continuous inflow mode for 200 d at a wastewater treatment plant. The balance between potential PN/A system stability and peak HRAS performance under decreasing hydraulic retention time (HRT) was optimized. Energy consumption and recovery and CO2 emissions were calculated. The results showed that the optimal HRT suitable with the PN/A process was 3 h, achieving 2–3 g/L mixed liquor volatile suspended solid, 67.8 % chemical oxygen demand (COD) recovery, 81 % total COD removal efficiency, 2.27 ± 1.03 g COD/L/d organic loading rate, 62 % aeration reduction, and 0.24 kWh/m3 power recovery potential. Such findings hold practical value and contribute to the development of the optimal AB process capable of achieving energy autonomy and carbon neutrality.

A low-carbon binder with ettringite as the main binding phase is prepared at ambient temperature using waste gypsum and metallurgical slag as raw materials. The technical limits of slow setting and low early strength are caused by the insufficient ettringite formation. This is tackled by fine tuning the thermodynamic route of ettringite formation process using polyaluminium compound via promoting the nucleation and Ostwald ripening process of ettringite formation. The high positive charge polymeric Al species and numerous Al(OH)4- generated by the hydrolysis of polyaluminium compounds increase the oversaturation degree and enhance the driving force of the Ostwald ripening process of ettringite. The volume ratio of ettringite/C-(A)-S-H in hydration products is further increased remarkably, resulting in the reduction of setting time and the enhancement of compressive strength. The carbon emission of the non-calcined ettringite-based binders developed in this study is 71–87 kg CO2-e/t. The research provides theoretical support for the development and application of a novel ettringite-based low carbon binders.

Retiring coal power plants can reduce air pollution and health damages. However, the spatial distribution of those impacts remains unclear due to complex power system adjustments and pollution chemistry and transport. Focusing on coal retirements in Pennsylvania (PA), we analyze six counterfactual scenarios for 2019 that differ in retirement targets (e.g., reducing 50% of coal-based installed capacity vs. generation) and priorities (e.g., closing plants with higher cost, closer to Environmental Justice Areas, or with higher CO2 emissions). Using a power system model of the PJM Interconnection, we find that coal retirements in PA shift power generation across PA and the Rest of PJM region leading to scenario-varying changes in the plant-level release of several air pollutants. Due to air pollution chemistry and transport and socio-demographics, these changes in turn give rise to a reduction of 10 to 182 PM2.5-attributable deaths in PJM across the six scenarios, with most reductions occurring in PA. Scenarios that reduce more coal power generation yield greater aggregate health benefits due to air quality improvements in PA and adjacent downwind regions. In addition, vulnerable populations&mdash;in both PA and Rest of PJM&mdash;benefit most in scenarios that prioritize plant closures in PA near Environmental Justice Areas. These results demonstrate the importance of considering cross-regional linkages and socio-demographics in designing equitable retirement strategies.

Abstract The combination of downhole electric heaters with Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) operations has been successfully piloted in a California heavy oil field. This paper focuses on a field case study of the installation of an electric heater in a horizontal CSS producer with the primary objective of extending the duration of the production phase of the well’s average steam cycle. History matched thermal reservoir simulations based on the results of this field trial predict that operating an electric heater in a comparable well from the beginning of its life could extend the duration of the average CSS cycle by at least 90% while maintaining equivalent cumulative oil production over a 5-year period. The history matched model was adapted for steam cycles of various durations ranging from 3 to 8 months, and the benefits of extending these cycles’ durations using the hybrid downhole heater application are analyzed. Further modeling work determined that doubling the length of the productive interval of the field’s average horizontal CSS well while electrically heating could completely eliminate the need for steam injection and increase oil production on a per-well basis by more than 10%. Reductions in CO2 emissions through the elimination of steam are estimated to be greater than 80%, and reductions in water consumption can reach as high as 100%. Whether electric heaters are used to complement CSS operations by extending steam cycle duration, or to replace CSS operations with longer horizontal wells, significant economic and environmental benefits can be realized by implementing the technology.

Abstract Associated gas needs to be handled properly especially if the gas is deemed to be uneconomical as flaring emerges as being the first ad-hoc" solution" and for many cases prolongs for a long time. Such flaring practices are exercised even more for the gas streams with undesirable compositions such as high CO2, as the separation costs could be significant. When the daily amount reaches significant numbers such as 60 MMSCF/D, the impact in terms of emission of greenhouse gases, air pollution and waste of resources become very significant. In this study, new approaches of zero gas flaring coupled with supplemental CO2/gas injection, for not only mitigating the flaring but also for recovery improvement, were introduced. The feasibility of gas re-injection was assessed using real field data. Input data was assessed using experimental information as well as numerical, and custom-made machine learning models. Reservoir fluid characterized using the available PVT reports from two oil production wells and one shut-in gas injection well were used to develop the EOS model in use. Moreover, the combination of produced gases and supplemental CO2 are evaluated in terms of solubility/swelling and miscibility and as well as compatibility with the in-situ reservoir fluids. Performance of the gas re-injection was evaluated and optimized using the final calibrated reservoir simulation model for the gas injection process. This study quantifies the amount of incremental oil recovery and improving field performance from the re-injection of produced gas. Produced gas is intended to increase reservoir energy through re-pressurizing the reservoir and as well as displacing the remaining oil with the optimized injection gas compositions, and thus, reducing the oil viscosity due to swelling, reduction in interfacial tension leading to increase in local displacement efficiency. Furthermore, the gas re-injection process leads to relaxing the GOR constraints from 2000 scf/stb up to 4000 scf/stb, as the excess gas can be utilized in the injection process. The placement of new gas injectors is optimized considering the existing gas injector location and by injecting into the gas-cap close to GOC while targeting the best rock types locally aiming to ensure that sustained good injectivity is achieved. The outcome of this coupled process demonstrated enhancement in the reservoir energy management by mitigation of the gas coning due to the movement of the secondary gas cap towards the producers and optimum utilization of the natural reservoir energy in combination with the injection process. Furthermore, injection of the gas in up-dip of formation and in the gas cap with optimum gas injection rate yield stable gas sweep efficiency with the help of the gravity forces. In this study, re-injection of the produced gas considering the reservoir heterogeneity, optimum injection gas compositions (including CO2 enhancement options) and limiting injection pressure of 5500 psi (below fracturing pressure) results in improved oil recovery while reducing the gas emission with the optimum utilization of reservoir energy. This paper presents guidelines for mitigation of gas flaring by re-injection of the produced gas along with the supplemental gas (where available)/water and hence leading to reduced emissions.

Ceramometal catalysts CuFeAlO/CuFeAl, obtained from various powdered Cu–Fe–Al precursors differing in stoichiometry and preparation method, were characterized by physicochemical methods and studied in the water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2). The catalysts are a monolith porous composites, in which metal particles are covered with an oxide shell. The sample Cu : Fe : Al = 45 : 22 : 33, synthesized from powder precursor in two stages was shown to be the most stable. At the first stage the mechanochemical melting of Cu and Fe powders was done. The mechanochemical treatment of obtained product and Al powder was performed at the second stage. This procedure provides the most homogeneous distribution of the components in the precursor. Initial and tested at 400°C ceramometal catalysts were characterized with XRD, SEM and XPS methods. It was revealed that the most active at 350°C catalysts after reductive treatment have Cu1+ and Fe3+ sites. The least active catalysts are completely reduced to Cu0 and partially – to Fe0. It was found that the activity at 330–400°C is determined not only by iron, but also by copper active centers on the surface of the catalysts, or their combined action. Two-stage mechanical activation, apparently, leads to a deeper chemical interaction of the components – Fe and Cu, which provides a higher activity of chromium-free CuFeAl ceramic-metal catalysts.

Toward decarbonization, it is expected that hydrogenation and electrification will progress in the industrial sector, which accounts for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in Japan. Research on measures and scenarios related to decarbonization are underway, and there are few previous studies that quantitatively evaluate the trade-off relationship of the environmental load impact between CO2 emission reduction and earth resource consumption which includes material consumption, land system change, atmospheric aerosol loading, and chemical pollution. In this study, a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of environmental load impact with footprint indicators is presented, considering the technical options for decarbonization from 2030 to 2050 in power generation. In the power generation process, there are some measures for decarbonization, including the utilization of renewable energy power generation. A special focus in this study is set on the future scenarios of energy and material requirements for the construction of renewable energy power plants and evaluating the direct and indirect environmental load required as footprint indicators with the material footprint, ecological footprint, carbon footprint, and chemical footprint, which is a new indicator estimating the environmental loads of chemical substances. The chemical footprint is the indicator defined as the occupation of a theoretical freshwater volume needed to dilute a chemical emission to the point where it causes no damage to the ecosystem. In this study, material and energy consumption, including chemical substances, are estimated according to future scenarios and the effects of chemical substances were mainly evaluated. As a result, there is a trade-off between an increase in ecological footprint and carbon footprint due to newly introduced steel resources and an increase in material footprint and chemical footprint due to copper resources as the composition ratio of offshore wind power generation increases. While promoting the decarbonization of power generation fuel for the purpose of directly reducing CO2 emission, the introduction of base metal materials accompanying the construction of new renewable energy power generation facilities will increase the indirect environmental load. In the evaluation of technical options for the decarbonization of the power generation process for the future, a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation framework, including the evaluation of the environmental load associated with the use of chemical substances, is presented.

Energy management in the residential sector contributes to energy system dispatching and security with the optimal use of renewable energy systems (RES) and energy storage systems (ESSs) and by utilizing the main grid based on its state. This work focuses on optimal energy flow, ESS parameters, and energy consumption scheduling based on demand response (DR) programs. The primary goals of the work consist of minimizing electricity costs while simultaneously extending the lifetime of ESSs in conjunction with extracting maximum benefits throughout their operational lifespan and reducing CO2 emissions. Effective ESS and photovoltaic (PV) energy usage prices are modeled and an efficient energy flow management algorithm is presented, which considers the life cycle of the ESSs including batteries, electrical vehicles (EVs) and the efficient use of the PV system while reducing the cost of energy consumption. In addition, an optimization technique is employed to obtain the optimal ESS parameters including the size and depth of discharge (DOD), considering the installation cost, levelized cost of storage (LCOS), winter and summer conditions, energy consumption profile, and energy prices. Finally, an optimization technique is applied to obtain the optimal energy consumption scheduling. The proposed system provides all of the possibilities of exchanging energy between EV, battery, PV system, grid, and home. The optimization problem is solved using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) in MATLAB with an interval time of one minute. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed system, presenting an actual cost reduction of 28.9% and 17.7% in summer and winter, respectively, compared to a base scenario. Similarly, the energy losses were reduced by 26.7% in winter and 22.3% in summer, and the EV battery lifetime was extended from 9.2 to 19.1 years in the winter scenario and from 10.4 to 17.7 years in the summer scenario. The integrated system provided a financial contribution during the operational lifetime of EUR 11,600 and 7900 in winter and summer scenarios, respectively. The CO2 was reduced by 59.7% and 46.2% in summer and winter scenarios, respectively.

N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have recently gained significant attention as capping ligands for gold nanoparticles due to their strong σ-donation properties. It has already been established that the strong σ-donation of NHCs enriches the surface of the gold nanoparticles, which controls the catalytic activity of the metal nanoparticles. Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) is a special class of carbene that offers stronger σ-donation than NHCs. This extremely electron-rich nature of CAAC projects it as a better surface capping ligand upon extrapolation on the Au(0) surface. In this work, we have isolated stable CAAC-stabilized AuNPs via a ligand exchange method and studied their catalytic behavior toward electrochemical CO2 reduction. These newly synthesized CAAC-stabilized AuNPs furnish a remarkable faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94% [at pH 6.3 for 2 h of controlled potential electrolysis at −0.7 V vs NHE (normal hydrogen electrode)] toward selective CO formation. Our work sets the platform for CAAC as a robust main group ligand on the surface of different metal nanoparticles, bridging the gap between main group ligands and surface chemistry.

This study verified the axial compression load-carrying capacity of concrete column members using normal concrete and recycled aggregate concrete to achieve a carbon-neutral and resource-recycling society in concrete structures. In addition, the axial compression load-carrying capacity of adhesive-applied PCM thickness increased column members using metal-grid verified as a reinforcing method for the assumed degraded damage. The proposed reinforcing method was a high-strength non-shrink mortar increasing thickness using 2 kinds of adhesive and metal grid. The experiment evaluated the axial compression load-carrying capacity of the existing RC column and the reinforced column members by an unconfined compression test. The result shows that the proposed reinforcing method increased the axial compression load-carrying capacity of RC columns using normal concrete and recycled aggregate concrete by 2.0 times due to the confined effect of the metal-grid. Therefore, the proposed reinforcing method can extend the service life of column members using normal concrete and recycled aggregate concrete without demolition and removal. Furthermore, the using recycled aggregate concrete is expected to contribute the reduction of CO2 emissions in a resource-recycling society for concrete structures.

The renovation of existing energy-inefficient residential buildings is an important measure to improve building energy efficiency and achieve CO2 emission reduction strategic tasks. At present, existing energy-inefficient residential buildings suffer from high energy consumption for heating, low efficiency, and poor indoor thermal comfort. It is necessary to implement energy-saving renovation on existing residential buildings and evaluate the renovation effect. This article took existing energy-inefficient residential buildings as the research object and selected a targeted evaluation system. Based on expert research, the hierarchical-grey correlation degree method was used to determine the weight of indices. Actual testing was conducted on the three nodes of the heat exchange station, secondary network, and the building ontology during the heating seasons of 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 (before and after renovation). Based on measured data, a fuzzy membership degree evaluation model was constructed, and the evaluation results were determined using a linear weighted method to form a complete evaluation system. The evaluation system covered 12 evaluation indices, and the evaluation indices with the largest weight in the criterion and index layer were energy consumption (0.308) and economic contribution rate (0.183), respectively. The average linear weighted evaluation scores before and after the renovation of each node were 14.16 and 29.04, respectively.

Abstract. Lightweight design is one of the methods to reduce CO2 emissions and optimize energy efficiency in the transportation sector. The main motivation of this study arise from weight reduction through multi-material design with the materials commonly used in the automotive industry, steel and aluminum. Metallurgical bonding of steel and aluminum carries the risk of forming brittle intermetallic phases. Hence, new joining techniques such as joining by forming or casting are promising for these multi-material components. Previously, a hybrid component method was presented using channel-like surface structures with undercuts on a steel sheet created in a modified cold rolling process. In a subsequent high-pressure die casting, the channels were filled with aluminum melt, forming an interlocking connection as it solidified. As automotive components demand increased complexity, the bending of the structured sheet before casting was investigated. This study aims to analyze how the surface structure affects the bending process. Numerical simulations and experiments were used to investigate the effect on the maximum bending force, the resulting bending angle and springback. Therefore, the parameters bending angle, bending radius, and the lateral or longitudinal orientations of the channel structure on either sides of the bend were taken into account. The results showed a strong influence of the lateral and longitudinal orientation on the maximum bending force. Furthermore, a minor effect of the bending radius on the force and springback was found.

The leaf spring is an important component in vehicles because it provides a comfortable ride and stability to the vehicle. The need to replace leaf springs with stronger and more lasting leaf springs is a key challenge in the transportation and automotive industries. In addition to offering ride comfort and stability, traditional steel leaf springs have a significant impact on the weight of the car. Fibre reinforced polymeric composites, therefore, are appropriate materials for various applications due to their many exceptional properties, including high wear resistance, high strength, long fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and low density. Fiber-reinforced polymeric composites find extensive application in several technical sectors, such as automotive, aviation, military, and marine industries. The utilization of composite materials has become imperative in the automotive industry to attain weight reduction without compromising material strength, as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have to be reduced. In this paper, three different types of composite-based mono leaf springs were designed and examined. The results of the investigations showed that the 0° unidirectional glass fiber system was unable to correctly produce the required spring rate. Consequently, many combinations of carbon and glass hybrid systems were studied. The analysis showed that the desired spring rate was produced by the material configuration of [0°6G / 0°2C / 0°22G] S. When the final results were contrasted with the FEA findings, it was found that they concurred.

Abstract Refrigerators, as other cooling systems, are responsible for a significant parcel of anthropogenic emissions since they are essential and heavy appliances that use energy during its lifespan and are loaded with refrigerant gases. Three types of commercial refrigerators and their new versions, with incorporated CO2 as refrigerant gas and an wireless system for maintenance monitoring (WSMM) were investigated to evaluate how optimization could impact on the environmental performance during their entire life cycle. This study conducted a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the refrigerators, from the production to their end-of-life. The findings revealed that the use phase and the raw materials were responsible for most of the environmental impact throughout the refrigerators' life cycle. Key impact categories such as Fossil Resource Scarcity, Freshwater Eutrophication, and Global Warming were particularly affected, largely due to the electricity mix in the use phase. Additionally, the extraction and production of raw materials, specifically steel and copper, made significant contributions to Terrestrial Ecotoxicity and Human Carcinogenic Toxicity categories. The optimization measures impacted mainly in the energy consumption during the use phase, resulting in a notable reduction of approximately 57% for models that underwent refrigerant change and 60% for the model that underwent both refrigerant change and electronic system installation. As a result of decreased energy consumption, there was a significant decrease of 13% to 16% across all impact categories, underscoring the positive environmental implications of these optimization strategies.

Abstract We describe a new concept to selectively reduce the water production from watered-out zones in oil wells: Heat an oil soluble compound to a temperature above its melting temperature and inject it into the formation as a liquid. When cooled to reservoir temperature, the chemical compound solidifies and reduces the formation permeability. Because of its oil solubility, the solidified compound is dissolved where oil is flowing. After a clean-up period, the oil permeability is fully regained. In the watered-out zones, the permeability reduction is permanent, simply because the solidified compound is not soluble in water. The concept has a large environmental improvement potential for the oil industry. By reducing production from watered-out zones, it will also reduce unwanted recycling of any injected water. Environmental savings might include power reduction and associated CO2 emission reduction linked to water treatment of produced and injected water, less need of chemicals to treat produced and injected water, and less produced water disposals to sea.Paraffin wax is a promising candidate. A paraffin wax with melting temperature of 61°C was injected at 70°C into a core plug. When lowering the temperature to 50°C, the injected wax resulted in stable permeability reduction. Brine backproduction for extended periods did not help to regain the permeability and the water permeability changed from initially 80 md to 1 md. During oil backproduction the oil permeability regained with less than 10 pore volumes of oil. The core flooding results agree well with bulk experiments of wax solubility in oil.Warmer reservoirs require waxes (or similar compounds) with higher melting temperature. Here we report results from the use of the hard carnauba wax, with melting temperature of 84°C. We confirmed that the wax melting temperature can be lowered, either by dilution of the hard wax in oil or by preparing a paraffin-carnauba blend. Core flood experiments with pure carnauba wax, carnauba wax diluted in oil and paraffin-carnauba blend all revealed excellent injectivity of the melted wax and the flow behavior was understood by two-phase oil-water flood. The water permeability, after a shut-in period, was low and stable while oil partly dissolved the solidified wax. However, the clean-up time for the carnauba-treated cores was significantly longer than for the paraffinic ones. We observed that dissolution rate depends on type of oil. Hexane (C6) revealed more rapid permeability regain than C10 and C16 alkanes. One explanation for the long clean-up period can be that the carnauba-containing waxes contributed to a more severe wetting alteration. Other wax alternatives with high melting temperature exists and are part of future research.Thinking ahead on oil field operational aspects, the concept seems ideal for low-volumes bull heading injection, where the whole near well area is treated with an invasion depth of a few feet. Temperature control of the wax before entering the porous rock will be paramount.

The conversion of native vegetation to agricultural areas leads to a natural process of carbon loss but these systems can stabilize in terms of carbon dynamics depending on the management and conversion time, presenting potential to both store and stabilize this carbon in the soil, resulting in lower soil respiration rates. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the effect of converting native Cerrado forest areas to agricultural systems with a forest planted with Eucalyptus camaldulensis and silvopastoral systems on the dynamics of CO2 emission and carbon stock at different soil depths. The experimental sites are located in the Midwest of Brazil, in the coordinates 20°22′31″ S and 51°24′12″ W. Were evaluated soil CO2 emission (FCO2), soil organic carbon, the degree of humification of soil organic matter (HLIFS), soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil chemical and physical attributes. The soil of the area is classified as an Oxisol (Haplic Acrustox). Soil samples were collected at depths of 0.00–0.10, 0.10–0.20, 0.20–0.30, and 0.30–0.40 m. The lowest FCO2 values were found in the silvopastoral system (1.05 μmol m−2 s−1), followed by the native forest (1.65 μmol m−2 s−1) and the eucalyptus system (1.96 μmol m−2 s−1), indicating a 36% reduction in FCO2 compared to the conversion of the native forest to the silvopastoral system and an increase of 19% when converting the native forest to the eucalyptus system. The soil chemical attributes (N, K+, Ca2+, H++Al3+, CEC, and organic carbon) showed a decrease along the profile. The shallowest depths (0.00–0.10 and 0.10–0.20 m) presented no differences between systems but the subsequent depths (0.20–0.30 and 0.30–0.40 m) had a difference (95% confidence interval), relative to N, Ca2+, H++Al3, CEC, and organic carbon stock (OCS), and the soil under silvopastoral system showed a higher concentration of these attributes than the native forest. The multivariate analysis showed that the eucalyptus and silvopastoral systems did not differ from the forest in the shallowest soil layer but differed from each other. This behavior changed from the second assessed depth (0.10–0.20 m), in which the silvopastoral system stands out, differing both from the eucalyptus system and from the native forest, and this behavior is maintained at the following depths (0.20–0.30 and 0.30–0.40 m). OCS, H++Al3, CEC, and nitrogen are strongly related to land use change for silvopastoral system. Regarding the behavior/relationship of attributes as a function of depth, the silvopastoral system contributed to soil carbon accumulation and stability over consecutive years.

Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are widely studied for loading of various catalysts due to their low cost and high structure flexibility. However, the prevailing close-packed nature of most TMOs crystals has restricted the available loading sites to surface only, while their internal bulk lattice remains unactuated due to the inaccessible narrow space that blocks out most key reactants and/or particulate catalysts. Herein, using tunnel-structured MnO2, we demonstrate how TMO's internal lattice space can be activated as extra loading sites for atomic Ag in addition to the conventional surface-only loading, via which a dual-form Ag catalyst within MnO2 skeleton is established. In this design, not only faceted Ag nanoparticles are confined onto MnO2 surface by coherent lattice-sharing, Ag atomic strings are also seeded deep into the sub-nanoscale MnO2 tunnel lattice, enriching the catalytically active sites. Tested for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), such dual-form catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (94%), yield (67.3 mol/g/h) and durability (∼ 48 h) for CO production, exceeding commercial Ag nanoparticles and most Ag-based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal the concurrent effect of such dual-form catalyst featuring facet-dependent eCO2RR for Ag nanoparticles and lattice-confined eCO2RR for Ag atomic strings, inspiring the future design of catalyst-substrate configuration.

In the past four years, the number of prosumers utilizing photovoltaic (PV) installations in Poland has increased significantly, exceeding 1.3 million, reaching a total power capacity of 10.5 GW by the end of 2023. This paper presents a three-year energy yield analysis of the prosumer PV systems operating in Eastern Poland. The 9.6 kW system consists of high-efficiency monocrystalline photovoltaic modules in half-cut technology. Over the three years of operation, specific yields have been analyzed along with weather parameters, such as solar intensity, outdoor temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, or snowfall. The average annual final yield was found to be relatively high, exceeding 1000 kWh·kW−1 in each of the analysed years. The highest monthly specific yields of the analysed period were noticed during the summer, reaching the maximum value of 164 kWh·kW−1 in 2022. The daily final yields varied from a minimum of 0.15 kWh·kW−1 in Winter 2021 to a maximum of 6.8 kWh·kW−1 in Spring 2022. Weather conditions increasing the energy yields, such as low average ambient temperatures together with high insolation periods, were noticed. Energy production in such favorable conditions reached a surprisingly high value of energy yield in April 2020, comparable to the summer months (151.0 kWh·kW−1). The occurrence of heavy rainfall in summer was also noted as a desirable effect that leads to the natural cleaning of the PV modules. The average performance ratio during the analyzed period was found to be 0.85. The energy production of the PV system allowed the reduction of about 21 tons of CO2 emission.

Biodiesel and alcohols are only two of the numerous alternative fuels that have found widespread commercialization in the transportation and industrial sectors. Cottonseed oil and n-octanol piqued our curiosity again in this regard. The engines used in the experiments are single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines with a power output of 1.5 kW. The tests are run at 1500 rpm with varying loads on the diesel, cottonseed oil, and graphene mixtures. i.e., BB1(Diesel 75%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 5%), BB2(Diesel 75%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 5%+ nanographene 25ppm), BB3(Diesel 75%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 5%+nanographene 50ppm), BB4(Diesel 70%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 10%), BB5(Diesel 70%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 10%+ nanographene 25 ppm), BB1(Diesel 70%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 10%+ nanographene 50ppm). The findings indicate that incorporating cottonseed oil leads to an improvement in brake thermal efficiency, along with a decrease in specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature. By increasing the amount of cottonseed oil in the blend, the emission parameters such as CO, CO2, NOx, and O2 are reduced, while HC emissions increase. Adding n-octanol and graphene to the cottonseed oil blend diesel fuel has a comparable impact to adding pure cottonseed oil in different proportions. This leads to an increase in brake thermal efficiency, a decrease in specific fuel consumption, and a reduction in exhaust gas temperature.

The measures needed to limit global warming pose a particular challenge to current fossil fuel exporters, who must not only decarbonise their local energy systems, but also compensate for the expected decline in fossil fuel revenues. One possibility is seen in the export of green hydrogen. Using Algeria as a case study, this paper analyses how different levels of ambition in hydrogen exports, energy efficiency and fuel switching affect the cost-optimal expansion of the power sector for a given overall emissions reduction path. Despite falling costs for photovoltaics and wind turbines, the results indicate that in countries with very low natural gas prices, such as Algeria, a fully renewable electricity system by 2050 is unlikely without appropriate policy measures. The expansion of renewable energy should therefore start early, given the high annual growth rates required, which will be reinforced by additional green hydrogen exports. In parallel, energy efficiency is a key factor as it directly mitigates CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and reduces domestic electricity demand, which could instead be used for hydrogen production. Integrating electrolysers into the power system could potentially help to reduce specific costs through load shifting. Overall, it seems advisable to analyse hydrogen exports together with local decarbonisation in order to better understand their interactions and to reduce emissions as efficiently as possible. These results and the methodology could be transferred to other countries that want to become green hydrogen exporters in the future and are therefore a useful addition for researchers and policy makers.

The mesoporous metal oxide semiconductors exhibit unique chemical and physical characteristics, making them highly desirable for catalysis, electrochemistry, energy conversion, and energy storage applications. Here, we report the facial fabrication of mesoporous gray SnO2 (MGS) electrocatalysts employing an evaporation-induced co-assembly (EICA) approach, utilizing poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymers Pluronic P123 (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymer as a template for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). By sustaining the co-assembly conditions and utilizing a thermal treatment technique based on carbon, gray mesoporous SnO2 materials with a high density of active sites and oxygen vacancies can be constructed. The MGS materials were employed in eCO2RR in a flow cell type, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity toward formate with a high partial current density of -234 mA cm-2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.60 % at -1.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Interestingly, the mesoporous SnO2 with a 1.5 wt% ratio of Sn precursor to P123 surfactant (MS-1.5@350N-400A) electrode exhibits a high level of Faradaic efficiency (FE) of (98%) at a low overpotential of -0.6 VRHE, which is a seldom recorded performance for similar systems. A stable FE of 96 ± 1% was observed in the range of -0.6 to -1.2 VRHE, which is the result of a large surface area (184 m2/g) and a high number of active sites and oxygen vacancies within the mesostructured framework.

Abstract Solar energy, which is widely acknowledged for its economic feasibility and sustainable nature, functions as a critical substitute for finite fossil fuels, effectively alleviating ecological consequences. The purpose of this study is to investigate the implementation of solar collectors as a means of harnessing the ample and unaltered solar radiation in Iran, specifically in locations situated within the solar belt. The incorporation of solar energy not only aids in the expansion of energy sources through diversification but also mitigates the rising expenses linked to fossil fuels. The preservation of natural resources, coupled with limited renewable energy options, further accentuates the importance of solar energy. The optimization of solar panel collector angles in photovoltaic systems assumes paramount importance for maximizing energy efficiency. This study, conducted in Yazd, Iran, utilized innovative mathematical and particle swarm optimization (PSO) models to assess ideal inclination angles. Results indicate peak solar energy absorption during June and July, contrasting with minimal absorption in January. The Klein model prescribes inclination angles based on γ values, while the PSO algorithm determines optimal slope and azimuth angles across various periods. Significant enhancements in energy generation, ranging from 23.24 to 25.02% across optimization models, were observed compared to a horizontal surface. These findings underscore the imperative of optimizing solar panel placement in urban settings to augment energy generation. Utilizing the optimal orientation for the photovoltaic power supply system can result in an annual reduction of 1169.6 kg of CO2 emissions in the building, emphasizing the positive environmental impact achievable through strategic solar panel configurations.

Abstract Low carbon transition strategies of power plants are crucial to meet China’s “Dual Carbon” targets. While the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, the “capital economic circles” of China, is suffering from serious air pollution, air quality co-benefits of low carbon transition policies in electricity system in BTH area remain unclear. Here, we estimate the impacts of low carbon transition policies, including one BAU, six single and five combined scenarios, in electricity system in BTH area on installed power capacity, CO2 emissions, air quality and human health through 2060 based on OSeMOSYS and ERSM models. Results show that the total installed capacity under single and combined scenarios (except RE and Tech single scenarios) fluctuates around the BAU level of 310.5 GW in 2060. While all single and combined scenarios would generally achieve “carbon peak” in BTH electricity system before 2030, only S4 (combining technological progress, renewable energy development and CCUS) and S5 (in additional to S4, including gas-fired power generation instead of coal-fired power generation) scenarios have the potential to realize carbon neutrality by 2060. The magnitude of reductions in air pollutant emissions and improvement in air quality in BTH area from the BAU level in 2060 under combined scenarios, especially S4 and S5, generally exceed that of six single scenarios. Importantly, S5 in 2060 contributes to about 8,528 avoided premature mortalities in BTH area, which are more effective than any other scenarios. The results suggest that S5 is a promising low carbon transition policies to achieve environmental improvement and produce health benefits.

The maritime industry is addressing environmental issues, and “cold ironing” offers a promising solution. This method involves supplying ships at port with energy, reducing fossil fuel dependence and emissions, and aiding in global climate change efforts. It is especially important for islands like Lesvos, which suffer from high energy costs and environmental issues due to imported fossil fuel reliance. However, research gaps exist in using renewable energy sources (RES) for cold ironing, mainly due to insufficient data on power needs and lack of monitoring for precise calculations and the very limited applications for the case of non-interconnected islands. This study uses real data from the port of Lesvos to evaluate power requirements for cold ironing and assesses the viability of a wind power park for an electrified port with the novelty and uniqueness of developing the application on a non-interconnected island. It also examines potential CO2 emission reductions. Data from Marine Traffic S.A. were used, considering factors like ship arrivals, hoteling duration, and engine types. This study also includes a simulation using RETScreen software for a 20 MW wind park intended for port operations. The findings show that the monthly energy demand at Mytilene port is around 6118 MWh, with an average power demand of 8.2 MW. The simulated wind park could supply about 72,080 MWh yearly, with a significant surplus (14,956 MWh annually) exportable to the grid. However, demand fluctuations mean the port might need an extra 924 MWh from the main grid. This underscores the need for additional strategies like energy storage and demand–response practices to fully transition to 100% RES-powered operations.

Climate change is a reality and its impact on the tea plantations is apparent in the rise of pest intensity, higher agrochemical use, inconsistent crop yields, declining grand growth period, increased abiotic stress and various other challenges; that threaten long-term sustainability of the Indian tea sector. The urgency to adopt sustainable practices is increasing by the day but to gain time bound results a comprehensive focus encompassing soil and plant health development will be crucial. To deal with climate challenge head-on, the Indian tea industry is making changes at various levels of operations. The sustainable tea initiative at Lakhipara tea estate, was one such attempt by the Goodricke Group Limited in their Dooars tea growing region of West Bengal. The program was initiated in 2014 with an aim to reduce pesticide use, improve soil quality, and produce quality teas while sustaining crop yields, improving renewable energy use and lowering the carbon footprint. Adoption of Inhana Rational Farming (IRF) Technology and taking the essence from ‘Trophobiosis Theory’ of French Scientist F. Chaboussou, the program focused on management of soil and plant health. Three years evaluation of crop yields in respect of the budgeted crop, revealed on an average an excess of 78 kg/ha/year in the project area. In rest of the garden area a contrasting crop loss of 118 kg was recorded per ha during the same period. The higher crop performance positively correlated with the higher nutrient use efficiency which was 17.7 percent higher in the project area (NUENPK : 8.86) as compared to the general garden area (NUENPK : 7.53), which reflected the impact of plant health management towards enhanced nutrient uptake, assimilation and utilization. Assessment of pesticide usage, revealed up to 77% decrease in usage in the project area during 2014-16, as compared to the pre- project year. Comparison with pesticide usage of the Dooars tea growing region during this same period, indicated a 62% lower Crop Pesticide Pollution Index (CPPI) in the project area. The finding indicated a 52 to 77% reduction in the accumulated toxicity potential of the applied pesticides in the project area; thereby accrediting safer tea development under this program, when adjudged in terms of pesticide residue. Assessment of soil quality revealed an overall eight percent increment in Soil Fertility Index (FI) value, with significant improvement in soil microbial activity potential (MAP) values i.e., by almost four times. The finding pointed towards the favourable impact of soil health management primarily through Novcom composting towards enhancement of soil microbial interactions. Post three years of experimentation the overall Soil Quality Iindex (SQI) value increased by 6% in the project area. The finding corroborated a concurrent 6.72% increase in the soil organic carbon stock during the same period. Reduction in use of non- renewable inputs viz. chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the project area was indicated by approximately 40 percent enhancement in energy use efficiency and energy productivity post the assessment period. Carbon assessment in terms of kg CO2 equivalents/ kg made tea (using ACFA version 1.0) indicated approx. 65 to 70 % lower footprint in the project area, primarily due to 20 to 30 % reduction in chemical fertilizers and 60 to 70 % reduction in the use of synthetic pesticides. The results indicated that while integrated soil management is the pre-requisite criteria towards rejuvenation of soil health and for restoration of the habitat for predators, it does not play a direct role in reducing the pest pressure and simultaneously the requirement of pesticides. Physiologically activated plants/ bushes on the other hand; due to their higher nutrient assimilation capacity and efficient protein synthesis are always lesser susceptible to pest attack. Hence, focus on activation of plant physiology can reduce the plant- pest interaction leading to a natural reduction in the requirement for pesticides vis-à-vis the pesticide usage.

Electrocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction that are pivotal for the energy transition, are multi-step processes occurring in a nanoscale electric double layer (EDL) at solid-liquid interfaces. Conventional analyses based on the Sabatier principle, using binding energies or effective electronic structure properties of the d-band center as descriptors, are able to grasp overall trends in catalytic activity in groups of catalysts. However, thermodynamic approaches fail to account for a plethora of electrolyte effects that arise in the EDL, including pH effects, cation effects, and anion effects. These effects have been observed to strongly influence electrocatalytic reactions. There is a growing consensus that the local reaction environment (LRE) prevailing in the EDL is the key to deciphering these complex and hitherto perplexing electrolyte effects. Equal attention is thus paid to designing appropriate electrolytes, positioning the LRE at center stage. Achieving this is essential for designing electrocatalysts with specifically tailored properties, which could enable much needed breakthroughs in electrochemical energy science. Theory and modeling are becoming increasingly important and powerful in addressing this multifaceted problem that involves physical phenomena at different scales interacting in a multidimensional parametric space. Theoretical models developed for this purpose should treat intrinsic multistep kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions, EDL effects from sub-nm scale to the scale of 10 nm, and mass transport phenomena bridging scales from < 0.1 to 100 μm. Given the diverse physical phenomena and scales involved, it is evident that the challenge at hand surpasses the capabilities of any single theoretical or computational approach. In this Account, we present a hierarchical theoretical framework to address the above challenge. It seamlessly integrates several modules: (i) a comprehensive microkinetic model accounting for various reaction pathways; (ii) an LRE model that describes the interfacial region extending from the nanometric EDL continuously to the solution bulk; (iii) first-principles calculations that provide parameters, e.g., adsorption energies, activation barriers and EDL parameters. The microkinetic model considers all elementary steps without designating an a priori rate-determining step. The kinetics of these elementary steps are expressed in terms of local concentrations, potential and electric field that are co-determined by EDL charging and mass transport in the LRE model. New insights on electrode kinetic phenomena, i.e., potential-dependent Tafel slopes, cation effects, and pH effects, obtained from this hierarchical framework are then reviewed. Finally, an outlook on further improvement of the model framework is presented, in view of recent developments in first-principles based simulation of electrocatalysis, observations of dynamic reconstruction of catalysts, and machine-learning assisted computational simulations

Low-enthalpy geothermal energy can make a major contribution towards reducing CO2 emissions. However, the development of geothermal reservoirs is costly and time intensive. In particular, high capital expenditures, data acquisition costs, and long periods of time from identifying a geothermal resource to geothermal heat extraction make geothermal field developments challenging. Conventional geothermal field development planning follows a linear approach starting with numerical model calibrations of the existing subsurface data, simulations of forecasts for geothermal heat production, and cost estimations. Next, data acquisition actions are evaluated and performed, and then the models are changed by integrating the new data before being finally used for forecasting and economics. There are several challenges when using this approach and the duration of model rebuilding with the availability of new data is time consuming. Furthermore, the approach does not address sequential decision making under uncertainty as it focuses on individual data acquisition actions. An artificial intelligence (AI)-centric approach to field development planning substantially improves cycle times and the expected rewards from geothermal projects. The reason for this is that various methods such as machine learning in data conditioning and distance-based generalized sensitivity analysis assess the uncertainty and quantify its potential impact on the final value. The use of AI for sequential decision making under uncertainty results in an optimized data acquisition strategy, a recommendation of a specific development scenario, or advice against further investment. This approach is illustrated by applying AI-centric geothermal field development planning to an Austrian low-enthalpy geothermal case. The results show an increase in the expected value of over 27% and a reduction in data acquisition costs by more than 35% when compared with conventional field development planning strategies. Furthermore, the results are used in systematic trade-off assessments of various key performance indicators.

In recent years, waste-to-energy systems are receiving more attention due to their dual benefit of reduction of pollution caused by waste materials and reducing the overconsumption of fossil fuels. Since plastic waste is readily available and has a high heating value, it is a viable source of energy.; plastic garbage makes an excellent source of energy. Today, a feedstock made up of several types of plastic is used to quickly pyrolyze and produce plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) or waste plastic oil (WPO). The oil could be utilized in internal combustion engines to produce heat and power. In the current work, waste polythene covers were transformed into value added products by utilizing fly ash catalyst and oil obtained is examined for suitability to run the diesel engine. In the primary phase simulation study is performed on a four-stroke single cylinder DI Compression ignition engine using Diesel-RK engine simulator, results indicated that, waste plastic oil was found to emit higher oxides of nitrogen compared to diesel therefore in the secondary phase the same engine simulated by implementing exhaust gas recirculation at 3.5%,7%,10.5% and 14% rates. In the end engine parameters get optimized using 3D parametric optimization technique. Simulation Results indicate that, Performance parameters such as brake power, brake thermal efficiency & brake specific fuel consumption were found to be decreased slightly under EGR conditions. Furthermore, Combustion parameters such as cylinder pressure and cylinder temperature decrease up on implementing the exhaust gas recirculation, similarly the emission characteristics such as CO2, PM and smoke found to be increase with increase in EGR ratio while Oxides of nitrogen emissions significantly decreased under EGR conditions. In order to reduce the emissions further, A 3D parametric optimization technique was adopted and optimal results obtained when engine runs at compression ratio of 16.49, injection timing of 18.21 and EGR percentage of 5.2%.

Abstract Introduction The relationship between sleep disruption characterized by polysomnography and migraine development remains unclear. This study elucidates this association, examining whether indices of sleep disturbance could serve as predictors of migraine. Methods In this longitudinal study, 132,705 participants (2000 to 2023) without pre-existing migraines were analyzed. Predictors included Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), Mean SaO2, arousal index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores. Covariates for adjustment comprised age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, neck size, end-tidal CO2, sleep stage percentages, and household income. Migraine incidence was ascertained using ICD diagnosis codes. Analysis employed univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. Results The cohort averaged 50.2 ± 19.0 years, was 54% male, and 76% Caucasian. Mean follow-up was 4.8 ± 4.1 years until migraine incidence. Adjusted regression showed higher AHI (per 5 units) was associated with a 1% reduction in migraine risk (HR=0.989, 95% CI 0.986-0.992). Also, higher mean SaO2 predicted a 4% increase in migraine incidence (HR=1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06). Reduced N1 percentage (HR=0.993, 95% CI 0.988-0.999), lower arousal index (per 1 unit, HR=0.993, 95% CI 0.991-0.996), and higher income (per $10,000, HR=0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.98) also decreased migraine development. However, elevated ESS scores (HR=1.04 per unit increase) and larger neck sizes (HR=1.005 per 1 cm) augmented migraine risk (both p&lt; 0.001). Conclusion More severe sleep disruption correlated with reduced migraine incidence, contrasting expectations. Apnea-induced vasoconstriction may trigger protective vascular changes in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)/serotonin pathways. Further study on mediating mechanisms is warranted.

ConspectusArtificial photosynthesis is a sustainable technology to convert solar energy into storable chemicals or fuels, which potentially paves the way for coping with the greenhouse gas emission and growing energy demand. Semiconductor photoelectrodes are vital constituents in artificial photosynthesis systems. Among them, silicon (Si) is extensively employed due to its earth abundance, suitable band gap, and low cost. However, Si-based photoelectrodes suffer from insufficient photovoltage, serious interfacial charge recombination, sluggish reaction kinetics, and low stability in electrolyte.Numerous strategies have been proposed to address these challenges. Si-based photoelectrodes comprising buried junctions, passivation/protective layers, and electrocatalysts as the main components have thus been developed. Unfortunately, several issues persist: (1) the additional defect state at the newly formed interfaces; (2) the contradiction between adequate passivation/protection and sufficient charge transfer; (3) the parasitic light absorption of electrocatalyst; and (4) the lack of compatibility with different application scenarios. Therefore, it is paramount to meticulously balance the functionalities and potential detrimental impacts brought about by different components to govern the photoelectrode design.This Account describes recent advances in Si-based photoelectrode design toward high efficiency, excellent stability, and practical applications in artificial photosynthesis. The charge utilization efficiency is determined by charge generation, separation, and transport processes, which could be simultaneously improved by the careful designs of homo/heterojunctions, bifacial passivation, and illumination-reaction decoupling. The above methods have been proven to be efficient, as through them we have obtained benchmark Si-based photocathodes. Apart from efficiency, stability is another key factor. We explored the charge transport and deactivation mechanisms of the traditional metal oxide protective layers, varied the coverage and surface energy of organic protective layers to control the flux of photogenerated charge, and discussed the merits of metal protective layers in illumination-reaction decoupled photoelectrodes. Moreover, the versatility of our Si-based photoelectrodes in unbiased water splitting with separated and integrated configurations, as well as in CO2 reduction with H-cell and flow cell, is proposed. Finally, the key challenges and future perspectives toward practical artificial synthesis are suggested. Our collective work outlines strategies for efficient and stable Si-based photoelectrodes. These general methods may be applicable to other semiconductor photoelectrodes for artificial synthesis.

Abstract Introduction Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an effective therapy for epilepsy that has previously been suggested to worsen obstructive and central sleep apnea. Management of medically complex patients in the traditional sleep laboratory can present logistical barriers given the minimal medical oversight. Innovative forms of sleep monitoring offer new options to evaluate sleep serially. Report of case(s) A 69-year-old female with a history of medically refractory generalized epilepsy, on a vagal nerve stimulator, presented to sleep clinic in September of 2022 after undergoing a polysomnogram significant for severe sleep apnea with AHI 3% of 56, AHI 4% of 48, and oxygen nadir of 83%. A November 2022 titration was unsuccessful (residual AHI of 48 and oxygen desaturation nadir of 88%). Periodic breathing proved refractory to CPAP, BiPAP, BiPAP S/T, adaptive servo-ventilation, and attempts to mitigate high loop gain physiology with CO2 modulation techniques, acetazolamide, and supplemental oxygen. VNS setting could not be manipulated in the sleep laboratory safely. She was placed on CPAP setting of 5-10 cm H2O with compliance data showing average residual AHI of 24.3 and 29% of nights being in Hunter-Cheyne-Stokes breathing (HCSB). A planned hospital admission in July 2023 was arranged to monitor sleep with the SleepImage Ring system, which offered measurement of AHI and periodicity without the need for manual scoring. The VNS battery proved depleted during the stay but 5 nights on the same CPAP settings with the VNS off showed a residual AHI 4% of 1-3 with minimal periodic breathing. Patient underwent replacement of VNS generator with reduction of output current to 1/3 of prior value with gradual up-titration. Subsequent CPAP compliance data showed gradual increase in AHI and periodic breathing with rising VNS setting. Currently, the patient is undergoing VNS adjustments to optimize seizure control with plans to restudy sleep breathing at lower nocturnal settings when stabilized. Conclusion Sleep apnea induced by VNS can be refractory to therapy. Tracking sleep with the SleepImage system and PAP compliance data allowed understanding of the role of neurostimulation in inducing sleep dysfunction.

Abstract North Kuwait Jurassic Gas (NKJG) fields are challenging HPHT wells with near-critical fluids in reservoir conditions. These wells are deep and sour with 2-8 % H2S and 1-3 % CO2 with average reservoir pressure ranging from 10,000 – 4,000 psi and average reservoir temperature of ~275oF. Best practices in terms of developing these fields by using the best technologies in drilling, completion, and production are essential to maximize the reserve recovery in order to deliver hydrocarbon to the market. Due to anhydrite presence and existing high variation of natural fracture distribution along the wellbore with different lithology and reservoir properties. There is differential pressure depletion happens within the entire reservoir, so these reservoirs have been divided into different flow units based on stratigraphy and pressure differential. These layers have different productivity index based on production logging records and calibrated well production models due to existence of dual-porosity tight matrix with natural fracture system which require proper pinpoint activation protocol by treating these layers separately. During the early development stages of these fields, these wells were completed with tapered type of completion with 3.5″ production tubing, which was used as the optimum flow rate for virgin or slightly depleted reservoirs. Nowadays, Monobore completion has been deployed so that these flow zones can be perforated, activated, stimulated, tested and isolated using plug and perf technique which provide proper stimulation fluids propagation into the target reservoir. In addition, the cluster perforation leads to better effective stimulation fracturing by bypassing formation damage due to drilling, completion & perforation debris from the illustrated case studies. This paper aims to illustrate the successful story of the cluster perforation technique in tight carbonate reservoir layers, and share its impact on pinpoint stimulation and hydraulic fracturing treatment by comparing the production performance of the studied wells with offset wells. As an additional achievement, the cluster perforation leads to cost reduction by reducing the perforation gun length, volumes of pumped treatment/wellbore diverters fluids and accelerating the well hookup to the production facility beside the sustainability of the production during the LTT. Also, that technique is better in terms of reservoir management as it supports depleting the reservoir layers uniformly. The success of this approach was proven by calibrated nodal analysis assessment and sustainability of well production at a stabilized rate, which supports reaching "optimal inflow distribution" along the different flow zones, which become a best practice approach in the newly completed wells aiming to maximize the gas recovery.

Abstract Introduction Hypertrophic burn scars present challenges for patients and clinicians. Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) and Ablative Fractional CO2 Lasers (AFCL) have shown promise in scar treatment by targeting vascular structures and promoting collagen production. While IPL-AFCL has been used in managing hypertrophic scarring in various dermatological conditions, limited data exist for burn scar treatment. In addition, scar vascularity can frequently limit the depth of penetration and density of AFCL yielding delayed results. The author's conducted a study assessing the efficacy of simultaneous IPL-AFCL therapy on hypertrophic burn scars using the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale (MVSS). To the author's knowledge, this is the first reported case series of simultaneous laser treatment in the treatment of hypertrophic burn scars. Methods In this retrospective study (April 2021 to July 2023), data from patients (pediatric and adult) receiving at least two IPL-AFCL treatments were analyzed. Demographics, burn details, and complications were collected. Linear regression assessed the impact of time from burn to first treatment on MVSS scores. Unpaired t-tests compared pre/post-MVSS scores for partial-thickness (PT) and full-thickness (FT) burns, and paired t-tests evaluated pre/post-treatment MVSS score differences after IPL-AFCL treatment. Results The study involving 33 patients (11 PT burns, 22 FT burns), the mean pre-MVSS score was 12.09 ± 2.77, and post-MVSS score was 6.24 ± 2.96. IPL-AFCL significantly reduced MVSS scores by a mean of 5.85 ± 0.43 (p &lt; 0.0001) with an average of 3.70 ± 1.69 IPL-AFCL treatments per patient. Significant reductions were also observed in pigmentation (p=0.001), vascularity, pliability, height, pain, and pruritus (p &lt; 0.0001). Linear regression analysis showed that the duration from burn injury to the first laser treatment significantly influenced pre-MVSS scores (p=0.008) but not post-MVSS (p=0.062). No significant differences were found in pre-MVSS (p=0.186) and post-MVSS (p=0.233) scores between PT and FT burns. As for complications, 4/33 patients experienced blistering following treatment which did not result in any long-term consequences. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that IPL-AFCL treatment effectively improved hypertrophic burn scars. MVSS scores did not significantly differ between PT and FT burns, but the time from the initial burn to the first treatment significantly influenced pre-MVSS scores. Applicability of Research to Practice Simultaneous use of different light/laser modalities is safe and effective and may offer advantages with symptomatic, functional and cosmetic benefits.

A tiered causal analysis focuses resources on key questions and guides the effort. The methodology has been used in national and international disputes. This chapter describes the method along with providing an overview of data quality objectives as this is an essential aspect of achieving parity regarding the evaluation of alternative causes. The methodology is illustrated using examples involving damages to vegetation, implications of sediment contamination, the decline of bee colonies, and the evaluation of toxicity in effluents.

Owing to its closed carbon cycle, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign fuels. The disadvantages of biodiesel include an increase in nitrogen oxide emissions, its incompatibility with cold weather, and the necessity of replacing engine parts such as fuel filters, fuel tanks, and fuel lines due to clogging on a regular basis. By using 2D nanomaterials as fuel additives, it is possible to improve the properties of fuels and overcome their shortcomings. Recent investigations on fuel-added substances showed the consideration of 2D nano-sized particles (metallic, non-metallic, oxygenated, natural, and blended) with diesel-biodiesel fuel emulsions. The thermophysical properties were improved, the heat transfer rate was increased, and the fuel mixtures were stabilized. In addition, depending on the dosage of the 2D nanofluid additives, the engine performance parameters increased, and the exhaust emissions decreased. The dispersion of 2D nanoparticles in liquid fuel and the effect of adding these particles on the performance and emission parameters of diesel engines are covered in this chapter.

The supporting regulatory impact assessments focus largely on the extent to which the regulatory alternatives are likely to achieve goals in a cost-benefit analysis. Critics have questioned the estimated magnitude, policy propriety, and legal basis of counting co-benefits. This chapter examines the controversy that co-benefits are overstated, or that other countervailing risks and costs are neglected. It argues in favor of counting the full portfolio or scope of important policy impacts, both benefits and harms. The chapter examines the treatment of ancillary impacts in case studies that address environmental policies under the Obama, Trump and Biden Administrations. It advocates estimating the full scope of important impacts to the extent caused by the policy option, and to the extent relevant to improving the policy process and decision.

Abstract An offshore Libya mature oil field with a large gas cap underlies a massive aquifer located in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir producing an extremely corrosive crude – naturally- from [SD3][AS4]14 monobore horizontal oil wells and one gas observation well drilled across gas cap. The field suffers from increased water cut and major crossflows across perforated intervals. In previous years, all systematic and maintenance shutdowns, including those caused by force-majeure due to security and political instability in the country, were feasibly overcome by naturally restarting the field. However, recently with the increased water cut, a greater volume of water flooding into the oil-producing zones would make it impossible to reactivate the field without use of artificial lift systems. Installing any artificial lift means in a monobore completion in the depleted field would require a large investment that would make the installation uneconomical. Hence, all future planned shutdowns would be at risk without making a big investment or developing an innovative solution. Developing such a solution meant solving a complex problem in short time that demanded attention to detail, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving, using the already available operational structure to restart the field safely. N2 kickoff was initially performed to reactivate the field without success due to the large N2 quantities required to produce all flooded water into oil zones which takes from a week to few months of lifting, in additional to the logistical challenges and involved cost. A rigless electrical submersible pump does not meet the required flow rates of more than 3,000 BLPD to stop the dynamic crossflow and hence, the reactivation would not be successful. The field was already producing 46 MMscf/D of gas, most of which was burnt out. It was proposed to use part of that wasted gas or to divert the gas production of the only gas well and inject the gas through temporarily installed coiled tubing as a single gas injection point at a predefined depth to offload the flooded water and reestablish the previous production figures. In 2017, 2 wells out of 14 producing wells suffered from liquid loading and were successfully revived using conventional carbon steel single-point coiled tubing gas lift system (CTGL). In 2022, all wells in the field were affected by increasing water cut. The field went on a complete shutdown and all wells required reactivation using the CTGL technique. However, the issues that were faced in the 2017 CTGL operation would be more challenging and complex due to the greater number of wells. These challenges included corrosion pitting, upstream pressure decline (the gas well's wellhead pressure) and lifting time and efficiency with more than 1 month required per well. The greater number of wells would increase CT cost, and the increasing water cut would increase lifting time per well, which would reduce production efficiency and increase corrosion rate. Additionally, because of the urgent timeline requirement for the execution, the single injection point design was extremely critical and had to work within the specifications of the available injection pressure, required flow rates of greater than 4000 BOPD, and available CT reels in country to reactivate all wells. A small error on chosen the injection point would compromise the entire reactivation process. Because this is a sour field, two categories of CT material were required to achieve a durable CT string with acceptable pitting based on a corrosion test. Carbon steel was chosen for a 2- to 3-week lifting period and chrome for a lifting period greater than 4 weeks. This innovative solution uses the already existing platform structure to deliver a green solution. Using the only gas well as a source of gas and pressure, the reinjected gas method aligns with green business objectives with a reduction of up to 80% less CO2 compared to the other possible long-term solutions available to the project.
