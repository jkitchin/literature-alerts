Abstract The electrochemical co‐reduction of CO 2 and NO 3 − to urea is an alternative to traditional urea synthesis. However, the significant difference in the energy barriers and reaction rates for CO 2 and NO 3 − reduction restricts the efficiency of the CN coupling. Herein, we report a strategy to coordinate the CN coupling intermediates by unilaterally increasing the efficiency of CO 2 reduction to match that of facile NO 3 − reduction. We demonstrate this strategy using an electrochemical reaction system consisting of a Cu 2 O‐loaded ordered gas‐diffusion electrode, which offers a high urea yield rate of 1373.5 μg h −1 mg cat. −1 at a low applied potential of −0.6 V versus RHE. This work not only provides a feasible strategy to coordinate the reductive coupling of CO 2 and NO 3 − , but also brings new insight into the reaction mechanism of urea electrosynthesis.

It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF‐based supported low‐nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three‐dimensional (3D) microporous Cu‐based MOF, that achieves a single‐product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at −1.0 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm−2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi‐site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C−C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2‐to‐ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2‐to‐EtOH.

With the advance of The Times, people's demand for fossil energy has greatly increased, and it is the main energy for people to develop economy and science and technology. However, the large-scale exploitation of fossil energy has led to environmental pollution and energy crisis, and the concentration of CO2 in the air continues to rise, and the greenhouse effect is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the conversion of CO2 into the high value-added fuels and chemicals we need will be a major measure to solve environmental problems. So, converting CO2 into fuels or high value-added chemicals using CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2RR) technology is an effective way to alleviate the current problems of energy and environment. In this paper, we summarize the research progress in reaction systems, electrolyte effects, and catalyst development in CO2RR experiments, focusing on the electrocatalytic aspects of CO2. Finally, we provide an outlook on the CO2 electrocatalysis industry.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO−) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO­2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal‐doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high‐purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal‐doped Bi catalysts, Co‐doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90% HCOO− selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0 V at a current density of 200 mA cm‐2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co‐doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72% after a 100‐hour operation under a current density of 100 mA cm‐2, generating 0.1 M HCOOH at 3.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co‐doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.

Abstract Um das Klima zu schützen, wird derzeit intensiv nach Alternativen zu fossilen Rohstoffen gesucht, die für die Erzeugung und Speicherung von Energie und für die Fertigung von Chemieprodukten genutzt werden können. Ein Forschungsansatz dabei ist, das klimaschädliche Kohlenstoffdioxid als Rohstoff zu erschließen. Es kann elektrochemisch durch eine homogen‐ oder heterogen‐katalysierte Reduktionsreaktion umgewandelt werden – z. B. in Kohlenstoffmonoxid, aus dem danach chemische Energieträger und wichtige Chemikalien für die chemische Industrie hergestellt werden können. Alternativ kann Kohlenstoffdioxid auch zu Ameisensäure umgesetzt werden, die beispielsweise als Energiespeicher geeignet ist. In diesem Beitrag wird eine Möglichkeit präsentiert, die elektrochemische CO 2 ‐Reduktion experimentell in der Schule durchzuführen, um dieses Thema aus der aktuellen Forschung in den Chemieunterricht einzubinden.

CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to generate valuable chemicals in acidic electrolytes can improve the carbon utilization rate in comparison to that under alkaline conditions. However, the thermodynamically more favorable hydrogen evolution reaction under an acidic electrolyte makes the CO2RR a big challenge. Herein, robust metal phthalocyanine(Pc)-based (M = Ni, Co) conductive metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) connected by strong metal tetraaza[14]annulene (TAA) linkage, named NiPc–NiTAA and NiPc–CoTAA, are designed and synthesized to apply in the CO2RR in acidic electrolytes for the first time. The optimal NiPc–NiTAA exhibited an excellent Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 95.1% and a CO partial current density of 143.0 mA cm–2 at −1.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in an acidic electrolyte, which is 3.1 times that of the corresponding metal–organic framework NiPc–NiN4. The comparison tests and theoretical calculations reveal that in-plane full π–d conjugation MCOF with a good conductivity of 3.01 × 10–4 S m–1 accelerates migration of the electrons. The NiTAA linkage can tune the electron distribution in the d orbit of metal centers, making the d-band center close to the Fermi level and then activating CO2. Thus, the active sites of NiPc and NiTAA collaborate to reduce the *COOH formation energy barrier, favoring CO production in an acid electrolyte. It is a helpful route for designing outstanding conductive MCOF materials to enhance CO2 electrocatalysis under an acidic electrolyte.

Electrochemical H2 generation and CO2 reduction address the energy and environmental crisis plaguing the world. An efficient electrocatalyst would require the lowest overpotential for these reactions. Given its position on the volcano plot near platinum, palladium presents itself as a viable alternative for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the activity is limited by a high overpotential. It is also a good electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to the favorable position of the d-band center. Nevertheless, the CO poisoning of the active site results in low electrocatalytic stability. Herein, we report a Ni-incorporated palladium catalyst, NiPd, which reduces water to H2 at a very low overpotential of 25 mV (η10). Furthermore, it reduces CO2 to formate with a very high faradaic efficiency of 97% at a potential of −0.25 V (vs RHE). DFT studies show that Ni inclusion leads to the facile activation of CO2 due to a bent adsorption configuration at the catalyst surface. The NiPd catalyst exhibits a strong and stable performance for HER (400 h) as well as for CO2RR (9 h) with high structural integrity as proven by postreaction characterization studies.

Abstract Exploration of molecular catalysts with the atomic‐level tunability of molecular structures offers promising avenues for developing high‐performance catalysts for the electrochemical co‐reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrite (NO 2 − ) into value‐added urea. In this work, a binuclear cobalt phthalocyanine (biCoPc) catalyst is prepared through chemical synthesis and applied as a C─N coupling catalyst toward urea. Achieving a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 47.4% for urea production at –0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), this biCoPc outperforms many known molecular catalysts in this specific application. Its unique planar macromolecular structure and the increased valence state of cobalt promote the adsorption of nitrogenous and carbonaceous species, a critical factor in facilitating the multi‐electron C─N coupling. Combining highly sensitive in situ attenuated total reflection surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the linear adsorbed CO (CO L ) and bridge adsorbed CO (CO B ) is captured on biCoPc catalyst during the co‐reduction reaction. CO B , a pivotal intermediate in the co‐reduction from CO 2 and nitrite to urea, is evidenced to be labile and may be attacked by nitrite, promoting urea production. This work demonstrates the importance of designing molecular catalysts for efficient co‐reduction of CO 2 and nitrite to urea.

The technology of carbon dioxide reduction has become a focus of research in the fields of environmental protection and sustainable development. With the exacerbation of global warming and energy crises, the issue of carbon dioxide emissions has become increasingly severe, exerting immense pressure on human society and the natural environment. In this context, carbon dioxide reduction technology has emerged as one of the important approaches to addressing climate change and energy demands. This technology involves the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen or other reducing agents to produce organic compounds or fuels. Its advent not only promises to reduce carbon dioxide emissions but also to convert carbon dioxide into useful organic compounds or fuels, thereby facilitating the recycling of resources. The development of carbon dioxide reduction technology holds significant implications for addressing climate change and energy demands. By employing this technology, discarded carbon dioxide can be transformed into valuable products, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and providing new energy sources for sustainable development. Furthermore, carbon dioxide reduction technology has the potential to integrate with other fields such as photocatalysis and electrochemistry, further expanding its application scope and reducing costs. This paper aims to provide reference and guidance for further research and industrial application of carbon dioxide reduction technology, promoting its sustainable utilization and environmental friendliness in practical production.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO−) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO­2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal‐doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high‐purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal‐doped Bi catalysts, Co‐doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90% HCOO− selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0 V at a current density of 200 mA cm‐2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co‐doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72% after a 100‐hour operation under a current density of 100 mA cm‐2, generating 0.1 M HCOOH at 3.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co‐doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.

The benefits of circularity and biogenic carbon storage are often overseen. This study links the circular design of buildings with prolonged biogenic carbon storage. Circularity in architectural design can involve extending the service life of a building frame, whilst forests grow back and store more carbon. Following this approach, Stora Enso has developed a mixed-use building concept with flexible and adaptable structures. Static and dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) has been carried out to assess different scenarios, modelling and quantifying its potential benefits regarding whole life carbon. While whole life carbon is lower in all timber scenarios compared to conventional concrete buildings, dynamic LCA makes clear the benefits of carbon storage and carbon sequestration. Total emissions, considering a reference service life of 50 years, are 2,84 kg CO2-eq./m² floor area/year, considering biogenic carbon storage and carbon sequestration in regrowing forests. An increase of the building lifetime to 80 years aligns with a longer rotation time of forest trees, resulting in whole life carbon of -0,09 kg CO2-eq./m² floor area/year. This demonstrates that the effective implementation of built-in flexibility and adaptability can extend the service life of a building, unlocking environmental benefits of biogenic carbon storage of wood products in buildings.

Abstract Emissions of microbially produced methane from lake sediments are a major source of this potent greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. The rates of methane production and emission are believed to be influenced by electron acceptor distributions and organic carbon contents, which in turn are affected by anthropogenic inputs of nutrients leading to eutrophication. Here we investigate how eutrophication influences the abundance and community structure of methane producing Archaea and methanogenesis pathways across time-resolved sedimentary records of five Swiss lakes with well-characterized trophic histories. Despite higher methane concentrations which suggest higher methanogenic activity in sediments of eutrophic lakes, abundances of methanogens were highest in oligotrophic lake sediments. Moreover, while the methanogenic community composition differed significantly at the lowest taxonomic levels (OTU), depending on whether sediment layers had been deposited under oligotrophic or eutrophic conditions, it showed no clear trend in relation to in situ distributions of electron acceptors. Remarkably, even though methanogenesis from CO2-reduction was the dominant pathway in all sediments based on carbon isotope fractionation values, taxonomic identities, and genomes of resident methanogens, CO2-reduction with hydrogen (H2) was thermodynamically unfavorable based on measured reactant and product concentrations. Instead, strong correlations between genomic abundances of CO2-reducing methanogens and anaerobic bacteria with potential for extracellular electron transfer suggest that methanogenic CO2-reduction in lake sediments is largely powered by direct electron transfer from syntrophic bacteria without involvement of H2 as an electron shuttle.

The rapid development of the battery industry has brought about a large amount of waste battery pollution. How to realize the high-value utilization of waste batteries is an urgent problem to be solved. Herein, cobalt and titanium compounds (LTCO) were firstly recovered from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using the carbon thermal reduction approach, and plasmonic attapulgite/Co(Ti)Ox (H-ATP/Co(Ti)Ox) nanocomposites were prepared by the microwave hydrothermal technique. H-ATP had a large specific surface area and enough active sites to capture CO2 molecules. The biochar not only reduced the spinel phase of waste LIBs into metal oxides including Co3O4 and TiO2 but also increased the separation and transmission of the carriers, thereby accelerating the adsorption and reduction of CO2. In addition, H-ATP/Co(Ti)Ox exhibited a localized surface plasmon resonance effect (LSPR) in the visible to near-infrared region and released high-energy hot electrons, enhancing the surface temperature of the catalyst and further improving the catalytic reduction of CO2 with a high CO yield of 14.7 μmol·g−1·h−1. The current work demonstrates the potential for CO2 reduction by taking advantage of natural mineral and spent batteries.

The stable operation of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers is known to be hindered by the accumulation of bicarbonate salt, which are derived from alkali metal cations in anolytes, on the cathode side. In this study, we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the correlation between the CO2RR activity and the transported alkali metal cations in MEA electrolyzers. As a result, although the presence of transported alkali metal cations on the cathode surface significantly contributes to the generation of C2+ compounds, the rate of K+ ion transport did not match the selectivity of C2+, suggesting that a continuous supply of high amount of K+ to the cathode surface is not required for C2+ formation. Based on these findings, we achieved a faradaic efficiency (FE) and a partial current density for C2+ of 77% and 230 mA cm−2, respectively, even after switching the anode solution from 0.1 M KHCO3 to a dilute K+ solution (<7 mM). These values were almost identical to those when 0.1 M KHCO3 was continuously supplied. Based on this insight, we successfully improved the durability of the system against salt precipitation by intermittently supplying concentrated KHCO3, compared with the continuous supply.

Abstract A key strategy for minimizing our reliance on precious metals is to increase the fraction of surface atoms and improve the metal-support interface. In this work, we employ a solvent/ligand/counterion-free method to deposit copper in the atomic form directly onto a nanotextured surface of graphitized carbon nanofibers (GNFs). Our results demonstrate that under these conditions, copper atoms coalesce into nanoparticles securely anchored to the graphitic step edges, limiting their growth to 2–5 nm. The resultant hybrid Cu/GNF material displays high selectivity in the CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) for formate production with a faradaic efficiency of ~94% at -0.38 V vs RHE and a high turnover frequency of 2.78 × 10 6 h -1 . The Cu nanoparticles adhered to the graphitic step edges significantly enhance electron transfer to CO 2 . Long-term CO 2 RR tests coupled with atomic-scale elucidation of changes in Cu/GNF reveal nanoparticles coarsening, and a simultaneous increase in the fraction of single Cu atoms. These changes in the catalyst structure make the onset of the CO 2 reduction potential more negative, leading to less formate production at -0.38 V vs RHE, correlating with a less efficient competition of CO 2 with H 2 O for adsorption on single Cu atoms on the graphitic surfaces, revealed by density functional theory calculations.

The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) is extensively regarded as a promising strategy to reach carbon neutralization. Copper sulfide (CuS) has been widely studied for its ability to produce C1 products with high selectivity. However, challenges still remain owing to the poor selectivity of formate. Here, a Bi/CeO2/CuS composite was synthesized using a simple solvothermal method. Bi/CeO2–decorated CuS possessed high formate selectivity, with the Faraday efficiency and current density reaching 88% and 17 mA cm−2, respectively, in an H-cell. The Bi/CeO2/CuS structure significantly reduces the energy barrier formed by OCHO*, resulting in the high activity and selectivity of the CO2 conversion to formate. Ce4+ readily undergoes reduction to Ce3+, allowing the formation of a conductive network of Ce4+/Ce3+. This network facilitates electron transfer, stabilizes the Cu+ species, and enhances the adsorption and activation of CO2. Furthermore, sulfur catalyzes the OCHO* transformation to formate. This work describes a highly efficient catalyst for CO2 to formate, which will aid in catalyst design for CO2RR to target products.

Transportation significantly influences greenhouse gas emissions—particularly carbon dioxide (CO2)—thereby affecting climate, health, and various socioeconomic aspects. Therefore, in developing and implementing targeted and effective policies to mitigate the environmental impacts of transportation-related carbon dioxide emissions, governments and decision-makers have focused on identifying methods for the accurate and reliable forecasting of carbon emissions in the transportation sector. This study evaluates these policies’ impacts on CO2 emissions using three forecasting models: ANN, SVR, and ARIMAX. Data spanning the years 1993–2022, including those on population, GDP, and vehicle kilometers, were analyzed. The results indicate the superior performance of the ANN model, which yielded the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 6.395). Moreover, the results highlight the limitations of the ARIMAX model; particularly its susceptibility to disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, due to its reliance on historical data. Leveraging the ANN model, a scenario analysis of trends under the “30@30” policy revealed a reduction in CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in the transportation sector to 14,996.888 kTons in 2030. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in the fields of strategic planning and sustainable transportation development.

Carbon neutrality or net zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases, refers to limiting emissions and eliminating greenhouse gases, thereby preventing their upsurge in the stratosphere that causes worldwide warming. Acute climate changes that could threaten the species' existence on earth. It is estimated that the sea level has augmented by 0.24 m and will be in the range of 0.3-1.5 m by 2100 due to global warming. The only way we can stop sustained and long-term sea level rise is to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to levels close to pre-industrial levels. This requires more than maintaining carbon levels. The carbon reduction would be the first big step for humanity to prevent the rapid destruction of the environment. The paper presents the issue of global warming due to greenhouse gases and necessary actions by Heating Ventilation Air-conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) industries for net zero emissions, which is the demand of the future and is a must for business growth without any harm to the environment.

The increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) have a huge environmental impact, and CO2 emission reduction is already a common view in our society. Recently, selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has attracted much attention because the process can effectively mitigate CO2 emissions and simultaneously produce high‐value‐added chemicals and fuels. The catalysts play a very important role in achieving high efficiency of CO2 to methanol. As one promising alternative, the alloy catalysts have demonstrated high performance in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol due to their unique geometry and electronic properties. Herein, we review the recent advances in alloy catalysts, including solid solution alloys and intermetallic compounds (mainly Cu‐based, In‐based, Ga‐based, and other alloy catalysts) for heterogeneous catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Moreover, the research ideas and development prospects of alloy catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol are overviewed to provide the ideas and references for the subsequent research on alloy catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation.

Metal–organic frameworks have demonstrated great capacity in catalytic CO2 reduction due to their versatile pore structures, diverse active sites, and functionalization capabilities. In this study, a novel electrocatalytic framework for CO2 reduction was designed and implemented using 2D coordination network-type transition metal–hexahydroxytricyclic quinazoline (TM–HHTQ) materials. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to examine the binding energies between the HHTQ substrate and 10 single TM atoms, ranging from Sc to Zn, which revealed a stable distribution of metal atoms on the HHTQ substrate. The majority of the catalysts exhibited high selectivity for CO2 reduction, except for the Mn–HHTQ catalysts, which only exhibited selectivity at pH values above 4.183. Specifically, Ti and Cr primarily produced HCOOH, with corresponding 0.606 V and 0.236 V overpotentials. Vanadium produced CH4 as the main product with an overpotential of 0.675 V, while Fe formed HCHO with an overpotential of 0.342 V. Therefore, V, Cr, Fe, and Ti exhibit promising potential as electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction due to their favorable product selectivity and low overpotential. Cu mainly produces CH3OH as the primary product, with an overpotential of 0.96 V. Zn primarily produces CO with a relatively high overpotential of 1.046 V. In contrast, catalysts such as Sc, Mn, Ni, and Co, among others, produce multiple products simultaneously at the same rate-limiting step and potential threshold.

The development of an inexpensive, highly active catalyst is important for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RRs) to produce fuels and chemicals. CO2 can be converted into formate electrochemically using tin-based composites. Due to the synergistic effects induced by interfaces between metallic and oxide phases, tin species with different oxidation states may enhance the catalytic activity. Therefore, synthesizing hybrid catalysts with heterogeneous active interfaces is desirable yet difficult. Herein, a heterointerface-rich tin/tin oxide encapsulated on a nitrogen-doped carbon (Sn/SnO2–CNx) composite was prepared for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. The catalyst shows formate as the major product with a small amount of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). The heterostructured (Sn/SnO2)15-CNx electrode showed 83.5 ± 2.3% faradaic efficiency and 16.7 mA/cm2 partial current density for formate production at 20 mA/cm2 applied current density in an H-type cell, which are better than those of bare SnO2 and bare Sn/SnO2 composites. The catalyst also shows good durability during CO2RR. To comprehend the experimental mechanism, density functional theory is used to compute the free energy profile of CO2-to-formate transformation on the Sn(200), SnO2 (110) surface, and Sn/SnO2 model, suggesting that the Sn/SnO2 model requires a low energy barrier compared to Sn and SnO2 to give the formate product. The high performance of the catalyst may be attributed to the presence of a heterointerface, porous configuration, high electrochemical surface area, and synergistic interaction between the catalyst and support. This work suggests that interface engineering could play a key role in the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for the CO2 reaction.

Abstract Fuel combustion for electricity generation emits a mix of health- and climate-relevant air emissions, with the potential for technology or fuel switching to impact multiple emissions together. While there has been extensive research on the co-benefits of climate policies on air quality improvements, few studies have quantified the effect of air pollution controls on carbon emissions. Here we evaluate three multi-pollutant emission reduction strategies, focused on sulfur dioxide (SO2) controls in the electricity sector. Traditional “add-on” pollution controls like flue gas desulfurization (FGD) reduce SO2 emissions from coal combustion but increase emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and carbon dioxide (CO2) due to heat efficiency loss. Fuel switching from coal to natural gas and renewables potentially reduces all pollutants. We identified 135 electricity generation units (EGUs) without SO2 controls in the contiguous US in 2017 and quantified the unit-level emission changes using pollution control efficiencies, emission rates, fuel heat input, and electricity load. A cost-benefit analysis is conducted, considering pollution control costs, fuel costs, capital and O&M costs, the monetized health benefits from avoided multi-pollutant, and the social cost of carbon as the benefit for carbon reduction. We find that add-on SO2 controls result in an average annual net benefit of $179.3 million (95% CI: $137.5-$221.0 million) per EGU, fuel switching from coal to natural gas, $432.7 million (95% CI: $366.4-$498.9 million) per EGU; and fuel switching from coal to renewable energy sources, $537.9 million (95% CI: $457.1-$618.9 million) per EGU. Our results highlight multi-pollutant emission reduction strategy as a cost-effective way to synergistically control air pollution and mitigate climate change.

The research explored how air pollution, particularly high ozone levels, negatively impacts sensitive crops like wheat, rice, and soybeans, posing significant threats to global food security. It emphasized the long-overlooked destructive effects of ozone and emphasized the immediate need for strategies to counter these impacts amid climate change. Furthermore, the study examined the crucial role of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on C4 crops, essential for global food security and biofuel production. Contrary to expectations, it challenged the belief that C4 crops inherently benefit from elevated CO2 levels in terms of enhanced photosynthesis. The study urged more experiments under changing climate conditions to refine predictions regarding crop yields. It emphasized the importance of focusing on ozone reduction, understanding how C4 crops respond to increased CO2, and assessing aerosol effects on specific crops. These insights aim to inform policies and strategies that can safeguard food security amidst rapid global economic growth and the challenges posed by climate changet.

Urban areas contribute to over 80% of carbon dioxide emissions, and considerable efforts are being undertaken to characterize spatiotemporal variations of CO2 (carbon dioxide) at a city, regional, and national level, aiming at providing pipelines for carbon mission reduction. The complex underlying surface composition of urban areas makes process-based and physiology-based models inadequate for simulating carbon flux in this context. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to develop and investigate their viability in estimating carbon flux at the ecosystem level. All the data used in our study were derived from the long-term chronosequence observations collected from the flux towers within urban complex underlying surface, along with meteorological reanalysis datasets. To assess the generalization ability of these models, the following statistical metrics were utilized: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Our analysis revealed that the RF model performed the best in simulating carbon flux over long time series, with the highest R2 values reaching up to 0.852, and exhibiting the smallest RMSE and MAE values at 0.293 μmol·m−2·s−1 and 0.157 μmol·m−2·s−1. As a result, the RF model was chosen for simulating carbon flux at spatial scale and assessing the impact of urban impervious surfaces in the simulation. The results showed that the RF model performs well in simulating carbon flux at the spatial scale. The input of impervious surface area index can improve the performance of the RF model in simulating carbon flux, with R2 values of 84.46% (with the impervious surface area index in) and 83.74% (without the impervious surface area index in). Furthermore, the carbon flux in Fengxian District, Shanghai, exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity: the CO2 flux in the western part of Fengxian District was less than in the eastern part, and the CO2 flux gradually increased from the west to the east. In addition, we creatively introduced the diurnal impervious surface area index based on the Kljun model, and clarified the influence of impervious surface on the spatiotemporal simulation of CO2 flux over the complex urban underlying surface. Based on these findings, we conclude that the RF models can be effectively applied for estimating carbon flux on the complex underlying urban surface. The results of our study reduce the uncertainty in modeling carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, and make the variety of models for the carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems more diverse.

There is a consensus on the need to reduce the emissions of carbon compounds. The increase in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the maritime industry poses a serious challenge to environmental sustainability, climate change, and the operating costs of ships. This article shows how hybrid versus diesel propulsion technology for ships can help reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption, and how these changes can be achieved. The need to reduce exhaust emissions and the increasing need for the shipping industry to seek alternative fuels means that existing regulations for marine engines and engine emissions are being updated almost constantly and new regulations are being formulated. The cost implications of the new regulations may lead to an increase in emissions as engines with lower fuel consumption are chosen, i.e., larger marine engines. Alternative approaches are needed to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption, which could ultimately lead to hybrid propulsion for ships. This paper examines the current state of greenhouse gas emissions in shipping by analyzing the CO2 emissions and operating costs of two ships of the same type with similar technical and technological characteristics and different propulsion systems to gain insight into the problem. This paper compares the reductions in CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and fuel costs for two suction hopper dredgers with standard diesel and hybrid propulsion. The technical characteristics, CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and price of the two ships were analyzed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each propulsion system. The novelty of this study is that two suction hopper dredgers from the same company with similar technical–technological characteristics but different propulsion systems were used for the case study and a mathematical procedure for calculating CO2 and other greenhouse gasses was presented in comparison, all to determine to what extent and in what way the hybrid propulsion system of a ship can contribute to reductions in CO2 emissions and fuel costs at the ship and company levels compared to a standard diesel propulsion system. This comparative analysis shows how much lower CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and fuel cost savings can be expected when using a hybrid propulsion system compared to a standard diesel propulsion system. Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the efficiency and environmental compatibility of the two systems.

To meet Greece’s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), it’s crucial to dissect the primary influencers of its greenhouse gas emissions. This study utilized the logarithmic mean Divisia index method in its additive form to delve into the main drivers behind carbon dioxide emissions in Greece from 1996 to 2020. The analysis revealed that the primary catalyst for the rise in CO2 emissions was the growth in GDP. Conversely, advancements in energy efficiency, as indicated by a decrease in energy intensity, played a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions. While population growth contributed to an increase in emissions, a decline in emissions intensity showcased a reduction in emissions per unit of output or consumption. The period from 1996 to 2020 witnessed a 38% change in emissions, demonstrating the effectiveness of Greece’s environmental policies. These findings highlight the pressing need for a sustained focus on enhancing renewable energy sources (RES) penetration and ensuring comprehensive attention across all sectors to further reduce emissions.

Transportation infrastructure plays a significant role in exacerbating climate change as it contributes to a substantial increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The sole economic sector in which European countries have not succeeded in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions is the transportation industry. Therefore, reducing transport-related emissions is a primary focus of emphasis in the European Union's efforts to meet its climate targets. Accordingly, this study analyzes the impact of renewable energy use, patent development, and energy taxes in the transport sector on the three different modes of transport-related emissions (aviation, road, and rail) in the 10 highest-income countries of the European Union over the period 2008–2020. The study uses the novel half-panel jackknife estimator for this analysis. The results of the estimation show that patents contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in aviation and rail transportation, while renewable energies are only effective in rail transportation. In the context of road transportation, energy taxes are effective in mitigating CO2 emissions. Based on these findings, it is recommended that European Union policymakers promote the use of electric vehicles and eco- friendly means of transportation in road transport through energy taxes, increase the use of renewable energy sources such as biodiesel in rail transport, and reduce CO2 emissions by supporting patents that promote green innovations in the aviation sector.

Capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) is still a major obstacle in the fight against climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To address this problem, we employed a simple Friedel–Crafts alkylation to investigate the effectiveness of porous organic polymers (POPs) based on triphenylamine (TPA) and trihydroxy aryl terms derived from chloranil (CH), designated as TPA-CH POP. We then treated the TPA-CH POP with (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (3-MPTS), forming a TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite to enhance CO2 capture. Utilizing FTIR, solid-state NMR, SEM, TEM, along with XPS techniques, the molecular makeup, morphological characteristics, as well as physical features of TPA-CH POP and the TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite were thoroughly explored. Upon scorching to 800 °C, the TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite demonstrated more thermal durability over TPA-CH POP, achieving a char yield of up to 71.5 wt.%. The TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite displayed a 2.5-times better CO2 capture, as well as a comparable adsorption capacity of 48.07 cm3 g−1 at 273 K. Additionally, we found that the TPA-CH POP-SH nanocomposite exhibited an improved CO2/nitrogen (N2) selectivity versus the original TPA-CH POP. Typical enthalpy changes for CO2 capture were somewhat increased by the 3-MPTS coating, indicating greater binding energies between CO2 molecules and the adsorbent surface. Our outcomes demonstrate that a TPA-CH POP composite coated with MPTS is a viable candidate for effective CO2 capture uses. Our findings encourage the investigation of different functional groups and optimization strategies.

The role of electricity is becoming significant in our advancing world. Currently, Ireland’s energy mix heavily relies on carbon-polluting fossil fuels, posing an environmental challenge. As per the Paris Agreement 2015, Ireland is ambitiously targeting to meet net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 and a 51% reduction by 2030. The country is shifting towards renewable energy sources to generate power to achieve this target. With abundant wind energy available, Ireland can meet its goal. However, due to the intermittent availability of wind energy, an energy backup for power generation is necessary. The use of curtailed or dedicated wind for producing hydrogen gas through electrolysis, and storing it in underground salt caverns is one approach to the problem. Northern Ireland has a rich source of Permian salt deposits offering a better place to store hydrogen which can be withdrawn for electricity generation, or used as fuel in transportation sectors. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the hydrogen systems can scrutinise the environmental impact of carbon emissions. This study analyses routes to reduce the environmental impact by evaluating polluting hotspots during the construction and operation phase of the system. This paper compares the impacts of the LCA on a hydrogen system which consists of a wind energy source for hydrogen production through electrolysis, transportation in pipelines and compression before storing it in salt caverns. A comparative analysis is carried out with the LCA of the hydrogen system with an electrical grid supply source. The results show that the impacts contributed by a renewable source are less than the electricity from the grid for the island of Ireland.

<p>因應氣候變遷導致極端氣候現象加劇，世界各國開始致力於推動節能減碳相關政策，期望藉由減少溫室氣體排放量來達到永續發展目標。而綠建築因相關規劃設計與設施設備之選用，能有效降低建築物所帶來的環境汙染與二氧化碳排放量，被視為是建築產業邁向低碳、淨零排放的重要手段。爰此，在未來提倡減碳之趨勢下，綠建築的發展地位勢必將更為重要，同時也易使得綠建築相關減碳效益將更加被放大檢視。然過往對於綠建築節能減碳相關研究多著墨於技術層面，反而缺乏從根本制度面上分析現行評估指標系統所能帶來的相關減碳潛力與影響。故本研究透過專家問卷調查之方式，採系統性的歸納、分析，加以檢視我國現行綠建築評估指標系統中各評估指標項目的相對減碳潛力關係，同時釐清在現行評估指標系統規範下，住宿類綠建築所可能具備的減碳潛力情形。本研究首先透過文獻回顧，將我國「綠建築評估手冊-住宿類2015版」之評估指標項目相關內容定義為四大指標面向、九大指標群與三十一項評估要項；接著，運用層級分析法專家問卷調查，取得各指標項目在專家學者共識下的減碳潛力相對權重值，了解「日常節能」、「CO2減量」與「綠化量」等指標群及其相關評估要項較具減碳潛力；而除了現行住宿類評估手冊門檻指標外，「地面綠化」、「結構合理化」、「建築輕量化」、「屋頂綠化」以及「直接滲透設計」等評估要項，未來在基於節能減碳觀點下，建議可規範作為優先或必選取之評估指標項目。最後，本研究認為未來在積極邁向淨零排放下，於選用綠建築評估指標項目時，「除了選多還要選對，選對更要精確」，透過鼓勵選用具備較高減碳潛力的評估指標，並精進相關規劃設計內容，才能真正落實並有效促進整體綠建築節能減碳發展。</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>In response to the intensification of extreme weather phenomena caused by climate change, countries around the world have begun to promote policies related to energy conservation and carbon reduction, hoping to achieve sustainable development goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Green buildings can effectively reduce environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions due to related planning and design and selection of facilities and equipment, and are regarded as an important means for the construction industry to move towards low-carbon and net-zero emissions. In the past, the research related to green building energy conservation and carbon reduction had mostly focused on the technical level, but lacked a fundamental institutional analysis of the relevant carbon reduction potential and impact brought by the current evaluation indicator system. In addition, the green building evaluation indicator system is rarely combined with practical cases for demonstration and comparison to clarify the effect of the evaluation indicator system in practice, which easily leads to the overall evaluation indicator system becoming a formality. Therefore, this study investigates the relative carbon reduction potential relationship of each evaluation indicator items in Taiwan’s current green building evaluation indicator system through systematic induction and analysis by means of expert questionnaires; meanwhile, this study also uses analysis results of expert questionnaires to clarify the carbon reduction potential circumstances that residential green buildings may have under the current evaluation indicator system. First, through literature review, this research defines the relevant content of the evaluation indicator items of Taiwan’s &quot;EEWH-RS 2015&quot; as four indicator orientations, nine indicator groups and thirty-one evaluation items. Then, use the AHP expert questionnaire to obtain the relative weight value of the carbon reduction potential of each indicator item under the consensus of experts and scholars, and understand that the indicator group such as &quot;Daily Energy Saving&quot;, &quot;CO2 Reduction&quot; and &quot;Greenery &quot; and their related evaluation items are regarded as more carbon reduction potential. In addition to the current threshold indicators of the residential evaluation manual, evaluation items such as &quot;ground greening&quot;, &quot;structural rationalization&quot;, &quot;building lightweight&quot;, &quot;roof greening&quot; and &quot;direct penetration design&quot; are suggested to be standardized as priority or necessary evaluation indicator items in the future based on the viewpoint of energy conservation and carbon reduction. Finally, this study believes that in the future, under the active move towards net zero emissions, when selecting green building evaluation indicators, &ldquo;in addition to selecting more indicators, you must choose right ones, and must choose more precisely.&rdquo; In order to implement and promote the overall green building energy conservation and carbon reduction development, it is effective by encouraging the concentrated selection of items with higher carbon reduction potential, and improving the relevant planning and design content for promoting the evaluation scores of each item.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

In the contemporary landscape, roughly one-fourth of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions stem from industrial energy usage. In the industrial sector, improving the efficient and flexible coupling among different energy demands (electricity, heating, and cooling) and exploiting the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and waste heat can lead to a drastic reduction in CO2 emissions, these are also the goals of the EU founded Horizon Europe FLEXIndustries project. This study aims to establish a cost-optimized decarbonization strategy for an energy-intensive industry, focusing on an Italian pharmaceutical company. It delves into the exploration of potential pathways and diverse energy mix configurations. The approach undertaken involves coupling a customized energy system simulation framework, specifically designed for the industrial site, with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). The study, conducted with a focus on the year 2024, involves a comparative analysis of three distinct scenarios. Within the intricate and challenging constraints of the industrial demo site, 13 technologies were investigated. The outcomes of each scenario identify a set of 500 Pareto optimal solutions, obtained through 40,000 simulations. These results shed light on the compelling potential of hybrid solutions, showcasing the feasibility of achieving substantial decarbonization with only moderate increases in costs. The availability of land for RES technologies, along with the existence of a biomass supply chain in the region, emerge as pivotal determinants.

In order to estimate the effective storage capacity of carbon dioxide in geological storage, it makes great significance to understand the seepage mechanism of flowing carbon dioxide fluid and its influence on the occurrence state in micropore. In this paper, the molecular simulation method was used to obtain the optimal configuration of kaolinite micropore and carbon dioxide molecules. The molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the flow characteristics of carbon dioxide fluid in kaolinite pores in differential depth of burial under constant pressure drop. The results show that the adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide fluid on the wall of kaolinite decreases with the increase of burial depth, the fluid density in the center of the micropore increases with the increase of burial depth, the diffusion capacity of the fluid changes significantly when the burial depth is greater than 2 km; when a constant differential pressure is applied, the flow of carbon dioxide fluid in the pore conforms to the classical poiseulle flow, the diffusion ability of the fluid increases with the increase of burial depth, nearly doubling, and the slip length also increases with the increase of burial depth; the flow behavior significantly reduces the total amount of carbon dioxide in kaolinite micropore, where the density of the first adsorption layer near the wall decreases by at least 20%, and its effect on fluid is greater than that caused by the increase of burial depth. Therefore, when estimating the effective storage capacity of carbon dioxide in geological storage, the influence of pressure drop and burial depth on the total reduction of geological sequestration should be considered at the same time. The purpose is to provide more detailed theoretical basis for carbon dioxide geological sequestration.

Abstract Traditional DID models overlook variations in policy intensity, causing estimation deviations from the actual situation and a limited understanding of the influence mechanism. In response, the Intensity Modified SDID Model is built to examine the influence mechanism of ETS's carbon reductions. Moreover, through model extensions, the study explores the spatiotemporal characteristics and heterogeneities of ETS’s effects. Results show that: (1) "Dual-circulation" influence mechanism is confirmed, where ETS directly contributes to carbon reductions (2.70% to 10.0% impact) through external pathways, and internal pathways continuously strengthen reduction effects, comprehensive mechanisms are thereby formed and enhanced based on interaction among internal and external pathways. (2) Reasonable ETS levels are estimated and proposed to achieve "Dual Carbon Target", constraining nationwide carbon quotas by 20 billion tons/year, increasing carbon trading volumes by 80 thousand tons/year, and elevating the carbon trading prices by 100 RMB (14 USD) per ton. (3) ETS's carbon reduction effects are identified with temporal and spatial characteristics, temporally, effects peak in the 4th period ( Event + 4 ) but diminish in the 5th period ( Event + 5 ), spatially, effects peak in areas distancing around 1000 km but disappear beyond 1500 km. (4) ETS also has synergistic effects with atmospheric pollution reduction, including industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide and smoke (dust), but are insignificant to industrial emissions of wastewater and solid waste.

This review paper addresses the growing challenges and developments in frequency control within power systems influenced by increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. It evaluates the advancements and limitations of renewable-based control technologies and explores the critical role of diverse energy storage technologies in providing fast frequency response ancillary services. Through a comprehensive analysis of global literature, this paper categorizes energy storage solutions according to their efficacy in meeting fast frequency response demands and potential for revenue generation. It reveals significant gaps in current research, which predominantly focuses on battery energy storage systems and microgrid applications, with insufficient attention to grid-scale storage solutions and innovative energy storage technologies. This analysis identifies a lack of detailed technical simulations and hybrid storage models for frequency control, as well as a minimal exploration of the environmental benefits, particularly in terms of carbon dioxide emission reductions, associated with deploying new energy storage technologies in ancillary service markets. The paper concludes by highlighting the necessity for further research incorporating detailed techno-economic evaluations and carbon dioxide reduction potential of modular, scalable energy storage technologies, facilitated by advanced network simulation models and comprehensive market analysis.

As the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ) celebrates its 10th anniversary, it is crucial to examine the impact of the FTZ's construction on regional carbon emissions under the dual carbon targets of carbon neutrality and carbon peaking. Based on panel data from 282 prefecture-level cities between 2006 and 2021, this article aims to provide insight into the impact of the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) pilot policy on urban carbon dioxide emissions levels. By constructing a difference-in-differences (DID) model, this study aims to investigate the effects of the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) policy on carbon emission reduction. In order to perform a mechanism test, two more mechanistic variables—namely, technical advancement and upgrading of the industrial structure—are incorporated. According to the findings from experiments, the policy of free trade zones can effectively reduce carbon emissions from urban areas. This is primarily achieved by optimizing the industrial structure and scientific and technological mechanisms.

Global warming is one of the key issues attracting international concern. The carbon dioxide emission produced by energy combustion is the main cause of the greenhouse effect, and reducing carbon emissions is considered the most effective way to deal with the greenhouse effect. The extensive production mode characterized by high energy consumption, high emission, and low efficiency in China’s construction industry intensifies the contradiction between economic development and resources and the environment, and the growth under this mode is at the expense of consuming a lot of resources and energy. The improvement of carbon emission efficiency is an effective means of achieving the goal of economic growth and carbon emission reduction simultaneously, making it necessary to accurately measure the carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry in each province, determine the influencing factors, and formulate reasonable emission reduction policies for this industry. In this study, an input-output index system of carbon emission efficiency of China’s construction industry was constructed, the carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry in each province was evaluated using the super-efficiency SBM model, and the factors affecting the carbon emission efficiency of this industry were analyzed via the Tobit model. The results showed that the average value of carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry generally showed a rising trend in a fluctuating way during the study period. From 2014 to 2022, the average carbon emission efficiency of the national construction industry presented an upward trend, from 1.122 in 2014 to 1.148 in 2022; the regional economic level (p= 0.020 < 0.05) and human capital level (p= 0.000 < 0.01) exerted obvious promoting effects on the carbon emission efficiency of China’s construction industry, while the urbanization development (p= 0.049 < 0.05) generated evident negative effects on carbon emission efficiency of this industry. The research results have important reference values for making cross-provincial emission reduction plans for the construction industry, promoting its carbon emission efficiency, and driving the research and development of green building materials and clean energy.

Carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) constitute vital measures for achieving net emissions reduction in China. Against the backdrop of the “dual carbon” initiative in China, this paper meticulously examines and analyzes the key technological principles, merits and demerits, and bottlenecks associated with CCUS carbon capture in the country’s thermal power plants at the current stage. It combines the prevailing industrial application status and the future development trajectory of pertinent technologies with considerations of industrial economic benefits and business models. Building upon this analysis, the paper summarizes the application status of CCUS technology in China’s thermal power plant industry and presents future prospects. On the technological front, the three capture methods grapple with the challenge of high costs. Therefore, there is a need to intensify efforts in developing low-cost and efficient carbon capture materials, as well as researching and practically applying low-cost oxygen generation technology. Economically, CCUS technology currently faces high costs, low returns, and certain commercial barriers, placing China in a demonstrative business model stage. To overcome these challenges and realize the economic benefits of CCUS technology, government incentives and technological innovation are imperative. These measures aim to reduce the overall cost of CCUS technology, stimulate the scale development, and foster commercialization, ultimately contributing to the achievement of China’s carbon emission reduction targets.

The long-term performance of lime-stabilised earthworks is a major concern for the sustainability and durability of infrastructure. The manuscript presents a comprehensive investigation into the impact of carbonation and leaching on lime-stabilised soil by focusing on the mechanical, chemical, and microstructure changes. The study employed accelerated carbonation experiments with carbon dioxide levels at 3% for 7 days on lime-treated soil cured for up to 365 days. For leaching experiments, the treated samples were subjected to water percolation under a hydraulic head of 15 kPa for 14 pore volumes of flow. The results showed that carbonation reduced the compressive strength and stiffness of lime-treated soil, impacting its load-bearing capacity. The micro-level analyses revealed carbonation of cementitious gels and excess carbonate precipitation to cause a reduction in particle-to-particle bonding and loss of mechanical strength. The ingress of moisture into lime-stabilised soil led to leaching and the dissolution of cementitious gels. The effects of water percolation were insignificant for specimens cured for extended periods due to their reduced hydraulic conductivity, which resulted in enhanced cementation over leaching. Further, presaturation or treatment with a higher lime content reduced the extent of leaching. The study reveals that exposure of short-term cured or soil treated with inadequate lime content to carbon dioxide or moisture can affect their engineering properties, contrary to the design expectations.

Sedation and general anesthesia produce profound changes in respiratory function, with the degree of change depending on drugs employed, species involved, depth of anesthesia, surgical procedure, and the health of the individual animal. Of greatest concern is significant reductions in gas exchange causing inadequate oxygen delivery to vital tissues and/or carbon dioxide removal from the body. It is important for the clinician to understand the physiologic effects of oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, in addition to their indications and contraindications, to maximize their benefits and minimize any potential negative effects associated with their use in the perianesthetic period. This chapter also discusses considerations for anesthetic management of patients with underlying respiratory diseases that require anesthesia for a variety of procedures.

Abstract As a highly developed region, Guangdong province has substantial industrial emissions. Its subtropical monsoon climate, characterized by abundant hydrothermal conditions, contributes to a substantial biomass potential. The adoption of potential biomass-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, such as biochar, presents an opportunity to mitigate emissions and work towards carbon neutrality in the future. However, the current state of the land carbon balance and the CDR potential of biochar in Guangdong province remains unclear. We first calculated the land carbon balance based on inventory data. Then we estimated the CDR potential of biochar derived from agricultural residues, forestry residues, and bioenergy crops cultivated on marginal lands in Guangdong province using life cycle analysis (LCA). Results show that Guangdong province has not yet achieved carbon neutrality, with a net emission (carbon emissions remaining after offsetting by carbon sinks) of 925.63 Tg CO 2 e (CO 2 equivalent, 1Tg = 10 6 t) in 2021. Emissions from energy consumption account for the highest proportion, contributing 83.8% of total emissions. In the highest biomass utilization scenario, the maximum CDR potential of biochar derived from all biomass types reaches 84.30 Tg CO 2 e yr -1 , which could offset 9.11% of net carbon emissions in Guangdong province. Our findings provide crucial guidance for setting emission reduction targets and implementing effective mitigation strategies in Guangdong province under temperature warming.

Hydrogen as a potential future energy source provides a number of benefits in terms of sustainability, high energy density, and zero emissions. The production of hydrogen via water splitting is regarded as the cleanest and sustainable process. In contrast, fossil fuel combustion causes significant environmental problems through the production and release of secondary gases such as NO x , SO 2 , and CO 2 . It is vital to focus on reducing these harmful gases. CO 2 , a major pollutant produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and various human activities, plays a central role in the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. It is therefore imperative to actively eliminate and mitigate CO 2 levels to preserve the global environment. MXenes and MXene‐based catalysts exhibit both outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and CO 2 reduction. In this review, recent progress is systematically examined and discussed in the preparation and utilization of MXenes as catalysts for HER and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The discussion begins with a concise overview of the fabrication and characteristics of MXenes, followed by a comprehensive exploration of their efficacy as catalysts for HER and CO 2 RR.

Abstract Despite the importance of understanding the urban emission characteristics of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollutants, few studies have conducted integrated assessments across diverse urban environments. Herein, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the emission characteristics of GHGs and air pollutants in seven cities in the Northern Hemisphere using ground‐based Fourier transform spectrometers. Our analysis primarily focused on emission ratios of excess column‐averaged dry‐air mole fractions of carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) (∆XCO:∆XCO 2 ) and those of methane (CH 4 ) to CO 2 (∆XCH 4 :∆XCO 2 ). We found that the emission ratios varied significantly across cities. Xianghe (China) and Pasadena (USA), known for severe air pollution, showed the highest emission ratios. Notably, Seoul (South Korea) showed lower ∆XCO:∆XCO 2 (3.32 ± 0.10 ppb/ppm) but relatively higher ∆XCH 4 :∆XCO 2 (4.85 ± 0.04 ppb/ppm), which was comparable to the ∆XCH 4 :∆XCO 2 value of Xianghe (5.15 ± 0.10 ppb/ppm), suggesting that targeted CH 4 reduction strategies may be required for climate change mitigation in Seoul.

Small Cu clusters are excellent candidates for the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR), and their catalytic performance is expected to be significantly influenced by the interaction between the substrate and cluster. In this study, we systematically investigate the CO2RR for a Cu3 cluster anchored on Janus MoSX (X = Se, Te) substrates using density functional theory calculations. These substrates feature a broken vertical mirror symmetry, which generates spontaneous out-of-plane polarization and offers two distinct polar surfaces to support the Cu3 cluster. Our findings reveal that the CO2RR performance on the Cu3 cluster is strongly influenced by the polarization direction and strength of the MoSX (X = Se, Te) substrates. Notably, the Cu3 cluster supported on the S-terminated MoSTe surface (Cu3(S)@MoSTe) demonstrates the highest CO2RR activity, producing methane. These results underscore the pivotal role of substrate polarization in modulating the binding strength of reactants and reaction intermediates, thereby enhancing the CO2RR efficiency.

Abstract The global energy system is in transition. It is attempting to reach net‐zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The systemic changes mean that the role of bioenergy will change. The potential of bioenergy to make a flexible contribution to the energy system is key for the achievement of global emission reduction ambitions and the functioning of the low‐carbon energy system and economy. As the volume of sustainably available biomass resources is limited, defining the contributions from bioenergy to a low‐carbon energy system and finding balances – and ideally synergies – between the different possible energy and climate system services that biomass can provide will be very important. The recognized system services include, among others, the flexible operation of bioenergy plants to integrate variable renewable energy sources and to provide negative carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Interest in flexible operation of bioenergy value chains, bioenergy with carbon capture and utilization as well as synergies with renewable hydrogen‐based value chains has increased recently. The objective of this paper is to present a holistic definition of flexible bioenergy as a system service based on the work conducted in International Energy Agency (IEA) Bioenergy Technology Collaboration Programme's Task 44 Flexible Bioenergy and System Integration, and to provide some practical examples. The paper also presents the different bioenergy system services and considers their definitions and interactions, as this is important in energy system design. The definition of flexible bioenergy shows that the flexibility provision from bioenergy goes far beyond the traditional definition of providing short‐term flexibility in the power sector. Indicators to demonstrate the value of services as well as further quantitative assessment of synergies and trade‐offs are needed to valorize the different services from bioenergy and create viable business cases.

The reductive coupling of CO2 and alkenes represents a compelling strategy for the synthesis of carboxylic acids. In this study, we show that Ni(OAc)2 and 6,6′-Me2bpy (dmbpy) catalyze hydrocarboxylation of terminal unactivated alkenes to afford the branched 2-methyl-substituted carboxylic acids. The nickel/dmbpy speciation in solution is elucidated through electrochemical and UV–visible and NMR spectroscopic methods. A catalyst deactivation process is identified, involving competitive reduction of CO2 to CO resulting in the formation of an inactive Ni–CO complex. The Ni catalyst may be reactivated by oxidative treatment of the Ni–CO complex to release CO; however, the results highlight an important complication that can arise in reactions of Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling with CO2.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full‐cell voltages, and cost‐effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH‐fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a results, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64% at 260 mA cm‐2, with a CO2‐to‐C2H4 single‐pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32% at 140 mA cm‐2 — nearly 1.3 times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM‐MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE‐MEA electrolyzer reduces the full‐cell voltage to 2.3 V at 100 mA cm‐2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.

All pathways which limit global temperature rise to &lt;2°C above pre-industrial temperatures now require carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in addition to rapid greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Novel and durable CDR strategies need to rapidly scale over the next few decades in order to reach Paris Agreement Targets. Terrestrial enhanced weathering (EW) involves the acceleration of natural weathering processes via the deployment of crushed rock feedstocks, typically Ca- and Mg-rich silicates, in soils. While models predict this has the potential to remove multiple gigatonnes of CO 2 annually, as an open-system pathway, the measurement (monitoring), reporting, and verification (MRV) of carbon removal and storage is challenging. Here we provide a review of the current literature showing the state-of-play of different methods for monitoring EW. We focus on geochemical characterization of weathering processes at the weathering site itself, acknowledging that the final storage of carbon is largely in the oceans, with potential losses occurring during transfer. There are two main approaches for measuring EW, one focused on solid phase measurements, including exchangeable phases, and the other on the aqueous phase. Additionally, gas phase measurements have been employed to understand CO 2 fluxes, but can be dominated by short-term organic carbon cycling. The approaches we review are grounded in established literature from the natural environment, but implementing these approaches for EW CDR quantification has strengths and limitations. The complexity inherent in open-system CDR pathways is navigable through surplus measurement strategies and well-designed experiments, which we highlight are critical in the early stage of the EW CDR industry.

For several years, CILAS has developed an expertise in the field of optical thin films deposition and in-situ optical monitoring techniques that enables today to successfully answer growing requests of optical coatings for astronomy and space applications, with large dimensions. In particular DIBS, PIAD and Magnetron sputtering techniques allow us to guarantee the production of dense coatings well adapted to severe environments. In this paper, we will first focus on recent projects realized for astronomy: antireflection coating on large diameter and high curvature CaF2 lenses, enhanced aluminum coating on 1.8m diameter secondary mirrors. Then we will present space-qualified enhanced silver and unprotected gold coatings dedicated to reflective surfaces (telescope mirrors, gratings) of instruments for Earth observation and black absorber coatings for parasitic light reduction. Finally, some complex optical functions developed and qualified for various space applications will be presented: mapping sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (MicroCarb) ; determining the composition of the Venus surface (Envision and Veritas) ; communicating in free-space (TELEO).

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to valuable C2+ chemicals has been demonstrated to be an effective and sustainable method using Cu-based catalysts. However, Cu catalysts still suffer from certain limitations, including high overpotential, low selectivity, and competitive hydrogen evolution. To achieve the valuable ethanol (C2H5OH) product from the CO2ER, a novel tandem catalyst featuring gradient doping of Cu in concave Pd nanoparticles (GD-PdCu1.8 NPs) was designed in this study. Electrochemical tests conducted on the GD-PdCu1.8 electrode reveal a nearly 100% faradaic efficiency (FE) for liquid products and a high FE of 40.0% for C2H5OH at the extremely low potential of −0.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Furthermore, in-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the underlying mechanism, indicating that gradient Cu doping in Pd can effectively facilitate the abundant formation of *CO, which then promotes the C–C asymmetric coupling step and ultimately leads to the production of C2H5OH with high selectivity. This study unveils the novel gradient doping of the tandem catalyst strategy to enhance multicarbon product selectivity at a relatively low overpotential for CO2ER, which can inform the rational catalyst design in the sustainable carbon cycle with high energy efficiency.

The results of the researching process of obtaining composition powder material B 4 C–TiB 2 by carbide reduction of titanium dioxide, using carbon reducing agent – carbon nanofibers, are presented. Furthermore, the results of studying of some properties of ceramics made using the synthesized powder are presented. The synthesis of composite materials was carried out in an induction crucible furnace for 20 min in the temperature range of 1200–1900 °C in an argon atmosphere. It has been established that the optimum temperature of the synthesis is 1650 °C, irrespective of the batch composition. The characteristics of the composite powders containing 10–30 mol. % of the TiB 2 phase have been studied. X -ray electron microscopy has revealed that the particles of the powder are predominantly aggregated. There are two peaks in the particle size distribution histograms. The part of the histogram with a smaller particle size mainly characterizes the B 4 C phase. The part of the histogram with a larger particle size characterizes the TiB 2 phase. The average particle size of the B 4 C phase is in the range of 5.3–5.5 µm, and that of the TiB 2 phase is in the range of 33.6–41.9 µm. The average size of 50 % of composite powder’s particles for these contents does not exceed 13.4 μm. The surface area of the samples does not exceed 5 m 2 /g. The oxidation of the composite powder materials by atmospheric oxygen begins at a temperature of approximately 500 °C. At the same time, when the temperature reaches 1000 °C, no more than 45 wt. % of the studied powders is oxidized. Ceramics made with the synthesized powder mixture B 4 C + 30 mol. % TiB 2 by hot pressing has shown rather high values of relative density (99.0±1.1 %) and fracture toughness (5.0±0.2 MPa∙m 0.5 ).

Governments worldwide are actively committed to achieving their carbon emission reduction targets, and one avenue under exploration is harnessing the potential of hydrogen. Blending hydrogen with natural gas is emerging as a promising strategy to reduce carbon emissions, as it burns cleanly without emitting carbon dioxide. This blending could significantly contribute to emissions reduction in both residential and commercial settings. However, a critical challenge associated with this approach is the potential for Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE), a phenomenon wherein the mechanical properties of pipe steels degrade due to the infiltration of hydrogen atoms into the metal lattice structure. This can result in sudden and sever failures when the steel is subjected to mechanical stress. To effectively implement hydrogen-natural gas blending, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of how hydrogen affects the integrity of pipe steel. This necessitates the development of robust experimental methodologies capable of monitoring the presence and impact of hydrogen within the microstructures of steel. Key techniques employed for this assessment include microscopic observation, hydrogen permeation tests, and tensile and fatigue testing. In this study, samples from two distinct types of pipeline steels used in the natural gas distribution network underwent rigorous examination. To induce hydrogen absorption, an electrochemical charging process is employed in a solution rich in H+ ions. This charging process, accomplished by a potentiostat applying a constant current, prompts the hydrogen evolution reaction at the steel specimen, acting as the cathode of the charging cell. Immediate tensile and fatigue testing following the charging process enables the evaluation of mechanical properties in comparison to non-charged samples. Different charging current densities are employed to simulate various hydrogen blend scenarios. The findings from this research indicate that charged samples exhibit a discernible decline in fatigue and tensile properties. This deterioration is attributed to embrittlement and reduced ductility stemming from the infiltration of hydrogen into the steel matrix. The extent of degradation in fatigue properties is correlated not only to the hydrogen content but also to the hydrogen permeability and diffusion rate influenced by steel&rsquo;s microstructural features, with higher charging current densities indicating a more significant presence of hydrogen in the natural gas pipeline blend.

It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF‐based supported low‐nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three‐dimensional (3D) microporous Cu‐based MOF, that achieves a single‐product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at −1.0 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm−2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi‐site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C−C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2‐to‐ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2‐to‐EtOH.

Mitigating global CO2 concentrations from anthropogenic sources through electrochemical conversion to value-added chemicals is the need of the hour. In this work, the fundamental concept of "Lattice Charge" has been strategically manipulated in materials to selectively produce multi-carbon products from greenhouse CO2 gas. To achieve this, a series of catalysts within a well-known ABX2 family (A = Ag, Cu; B = In, Ga, Fe; X = S, Se) have been explored, which exhibit significant activity toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and results in the formation of higher carbon chemicals including C3 products, acetone, and energy-dense isopropanol (FE = 24.5 ± 2.5%). The Hirshfeld charge analysis technique highlighted the structure–activity correlation and the importance of the optimized lattice charge distribution as a crucial tool to manipulate the eCO2RR product in electrocatalyst designs, and the real-time in situ ATR-FTIR technique probes the crucial intermediate species adsorbed during the CO2 reduction process.

Nowadays, the burning of fossil fuels, particularly petroleum, natural gas, and coal, meets the rising need for power and fuels for automobiles and industries.This has given rise to ecological and climate challenges.This thesis explores these issues from three distinct perspectives: (i) experimental, (ii) computational, and (iii) process simulation, with a focus on studying CO2 as an alternative and economically viable raw material.Firstly, the experimental study is focused on the synthesis, characterization, and testing of novel catalysts for electroreduction of CO2 and oxalic acid, an intermediate product of CO2.Electrocatalysts based on Cu supported by citrus (orange and lemon) peel biomass are prepared.These catalysts exhibit activity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, emphasizing the effectiveness of biomasses, particularly orange peels, as environmentally friendly precursors for sustainable and efficient electrocatalysts.In addition, graphitic carbon nitrides/TiO2 nanotubes (g-C3N4/TiNT) composites are prepared for the electrocatalytic reduction of oxalic acid to glycolic acid, revealing superior electrocatalytic properties compared to pristine TiNT.Characterization by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electronic microscopy were performed for all the prepared electrocatalysts.Delving into the reduction of CO2 on Cu catalysts, a computational study about the synthesis of methanol on Cu(111) surface is performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.A systematic study is carried out to define the activation energies of the elementary reactions by using mGGA DF.Consequently, it is shown that the rate-controlling step is CH3O* hydrogenation and the formate pathway on Cu(111) proceeds through the HCOOH* intermediate.Finally, the process simulation, performed by using the software Aspen Plus 11 from AspenTech Inc., is based on the comparison of a catalytic (oxidation of ethylene glycol) and an electrocatalytic process (CO2 electroreduction chain) to synthesize glycolic acid.An economic analysis of the operational and investment costs reveals that the catalytic process is more cost-effective due to the current instability of electrocatalysts and proton exchange membranes, resulting in increased maintenance costs and, consequently, higher prices for the product.

In March 2023, Pakistan's Cabinet approved a Clean Air Policy which established ambient air quality targets and identified priority actions in the major air pollutant-emitting sectors. This work describes a quantitative air pollutant and greenhouse gas mitigation modeling assessment at national and subnational scale that provided evidence to inform Pakistan's Clean Air Policy. Air pollutant emissions are quantified historically (2010–2021) and projected to 2050 for baseline (without implementation of mitigation measures) and for scenarios which model the implementation of 18 specific mitigation measures. The assessment identified five major air pollutant-emitting sources nationally: Households (35% national total primary PM2.5 emissions), Transport (5%), Industry (16%), Agriculture (17%), and Waste (24%). Pakistan's Clean Air Policy identifies a priority mitigation measure for each of these sectors, which collectively could reduce national PM2.5 emissions by 36.4% in 2030 compared to the baseline. Full implementation of all 18 mitigation measures would reduce primary PM2.5 emissions by 80% in 2050 compared with the baseline. Developing a Clean Air Policy was committed to in Pakistan's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to help achieve Pakistan's climate change commitment while improving public health. This study shows that the Clean Air Policy could also have benefits for Pakistan meeting its climate change goals, with an estimated 5% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and 42% reduction in methane emissions achievable by 2050 from full implementation of the actions evaluated in this assessment. As Pakistan's Clean Air Policy is implemented, progressively updating this air pollutant and climate change mitigation assessments can help track progress on its achievement.

Facing the current sustainability challenges requires reduction in building stock energy usage towards achieving the European Green Deal targets. This can be accomplished by adopting techniques such as fault detection and diagnosis and efficiency optimization. Taking an Estonian school as a case study, an occupancy-based algorithm for scheduling ventilation operations in buildings is here developed starting only from energy use data. The aim is optimizing the system’s operation according to occupancy profiles while maintaining a comfortable indoor climate. By relying only on electricity meters without using carbon dioxide or occupancy sensors, we use the historical data of a school to develop a DBSCAN-based clustering algorithm that generates consumption profiles. A novel occupancy estimation algorithm, based on threshold and time-series methods, then creates 12 occupancy schedules that are either based on classical detection with an on-off method or on occupancy estimation for demand-controlled ventilation. We find that the latter replaces the 60% capacity of current on-off schedules by 30% or even 0%, with energy savings ranging from 3.5% to 66.4%. The corresponding costs are reduced from 18.1% up to 62.6%, while still complying with current national regulations for indoor air quality. Remarkably, our method can immediately be extended to other countries, as it relies only on occupancy schedules that ignore weather and other location-specific factors.

Formic acid (HCOOH) is a highly energy‐efficient product of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Bismuth‐based catalysts have shown promise in the conversion of CO2 to formic acid, but there is still a great need for further improvement in selectivity and activity. Herein, we report the preparation of Bi nanosheets decorated by cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeOx) with high Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio and rich oxygen vacancies. The CeOx nanoparticles affect on the electronic structures of bismuth, enhance the CO2 adsorption, and thus promote the CO2RR properties of Bi nanosheets. Compared with elemental Bi nanosheets, the hetero‐structured CeOx/Bi nanosheets exhibit much higher activity over a wide potential window, showing a current density of 16.1 mA cm−2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 91.1% at −0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.

ABSTRACT The use of CO2 sensors has been reported as an effective tool in the early detection of signs of deterioration, allowing good accuracy in decision-making about the quality of stored grains. The objective of this study was to quantify the CO2 levels produced by maize grains stored at ambient temperature in a prototype silo, with initial moisture contents of 14, 16 and 18% w.b., and to evaluate the quality of the product over time and the technical breakage. Analyses of moisture content, ash, proteins, lipids, Hue Angle (color), germination and electrical conductivity were performed. Inside the silos, the amount of CO2, relative air humidity and temperature were monitored every hour. Grain quality evaluations were carried out at four storage times (0, 30, 60 and 90 days). A completely randomized design in a 3 × 4 factorial scheme with six replicates was used. Grains with higher moisture contents showed higher technical breakage and losses associated with CO2 emissions. Moisture content, protein, lipids, germination, bulk density, lightness and chroma decreased over time, while the electrical conductivity increased, resulting in greater damage to membranes and loss of quality of maize grains. Monitoring of CO2 in the grain mass is a good tool to assess the quality of grain, and higher initial moisture content caused greater level of CO2 emission and reduction in quality of maize grains.

The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) pathway significantly dictates the reversibility and overpotential of aprotic Li-CO2 batteries; however, it has remained incompletely understood due to the lack of direct in situ spectroscopic evidence. Herein, the Li-CO2RR pathways at the model Au | dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) interface are interrogated using a combination of in situ isotope-labeled spectroscopy techniques and theoretical calculations. This obtained direct spectroscopic evidence presents that the primary CO2RR proceeds through the CO2-to-CO pathway (i.e., 2Li+ + 2CO2 + 2e– → CO + Li2CO3) initiated at a low overpotential (ca. 2.1 V vs Li/Li+), and the CO2-to-Li2C2O4 pathway (i.e., 2Li+ + 2CO2 + 2e– → Li2C2O4) initiated at a high overpotential (ca. 1.7 V vs Li/Li+), where the potential-dependent pathways critically depend on the coverage of LiCO2 intermediates. Simultaneously, the entire Li-CO2RR process is also accompanied by parasitic reactions to form gaseous C2H4 with COOH* as the crucial intermediate, which is induced by the H+-abstraction reaction between the reactive LiCO2 intermediate and the DMSO solvent. These fundamental insights enable us to establish a molecular picture for Li-CO2RR pathways in aprotic media and will serve as a crucial guideline for reversible Li-CO2 electrochemistry.

Solid-oxide electrolysis cells are a clean energy conversion device with the ability to directly electrolyze the conversion of CO2 to CO efficiently. However, their practical applications are limited due to insufficient CO2 adsorption performance of the cathode materials. To overcome this issue, the A-site cation deficiency strategy has been applied in a layered perovskite PrBaFe1.6Ni0.4O6-δ (PBFN) cathode for direct CO2 electrolysis. The introduction of 5% deficiency at the Pr/Ba site leads to a significant increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies (nonstoichiometric number δ of oxygen vacancies increased from 0.093 to 0.132), which greatly accelerates the CO2 adsorption performance as well as the O2– transport capacity toward the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). CO2 temperature-programmed desorption indicates that A-site cation-deficient (PrBa)0.95Fe1.6Ni0.4O6-δ (PB95FN) shows a larger desorption peak area and a higher desorption temperature. PB95FN also exhibits a greater presence of carbonate in Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The electrical conductivity relaxation test shows that the introduction of the 5% A-site deficiency effectively improves the surface oxygen exchange and diffusion kinetics of PB95FN. The current density of the electrolysis cell with the (PrBa)0.95Fe1.6Ni0.4O6-δ (PB95FN) cathode reaches 0.876 A·cm–2 under 1.5 V at 800 °C, which is 41% higher than that of PB100FN. Moreover, the PB95FN cathode demonstrates excellent long-term stability over 100 h and better short-term stability than PB100FN under high voltages, which can be ascribed to the enhanced CO2 adsorption performance. The PB95FN cathode maintains a porous structure and tightly binds to the electrolyte after stability testing. This study highlights the potential of regulating oxygen defects in layered perovskite PrBaFe1.6Ni0.4O6-δ cathode materials via incorporation of cation deficiency toward high-temperature CO2 electrolysis.

The 1,2-insertion reaction of CO2 into metal–hydride bonds of d6-octahedral complexes to give κ1-O-metal-formate products is the key step in various CO2 reduction schemes and as a result has attracted extensive mechanistic investigations. For many octahedral catalysts, CO2 insertion follows an associative mechanism in which CO2 interacts directly with the coordinated hydride ligand instead of the more classical dissociative mechanism that opens an empty coordination site to bind the substrate to the metal prior to a hydride migration step. To better understand the associative mechanism, we conducted a systematic quantum chemical investigation on the reaction between CO2 and fac-(bpy)Re(CO)3H (1–Re–H; bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) starting with the gas phase and then moving to THF and other solvents with increased dielectric constants. Detailed analyses of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) and intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs) reveal that the reaction is enabled in all media by an initial stage of making a 3c-2e bond between the carbon of CO2 and the metal-hydride bond that is most consistent with an organometallic bridging hydride Re–H–CO2 species. Once CO2 is bent and anchored to the metal-hydride bond, the reaction proceeds by a rotation motion via a cyclic transition state TS2 that interchanges Re–H–CO2 and Re–O–CHO coordination. The combined stages provide an asynchronous–concerted pathway for CO2 insertion on the Gibbs free energy surface with TS2 as the highest energy point. Consideration of TS2 as a rate-determining TS gives activation barriers, inverse KIEs, substituent effects, and solvent effects that agree with the experimental data available in this system. An important new insight revealed by the analyses of the results is that the initial stage of the reaction is not a hydride transfer step as has been assumed in some studies. In fact, the loose vibration of the TS that can be identified for the first stage of the reaction in solution (TS1) does not involve the Re–H stretching vibrational mode. Accordingly, the imaginary frequency of TS1 is insensitive to deuteration, and therefore, TS1 leads to no significant KIE.

Forests and grasslands play an important role in carbon cycling. They not only absorb CO2 from the air through vegetation biomass and soil carbon sinks, but also reduce and control the horizontal transport of soil carbon (i.e., reinforcing soil carbon storage via soil conservation), thus avoiding erosion-induced CO2 emissions. In this study, vegetation biomass and soil carbon sinks, soil carbon reinforcement and reduced carbon emissions via soil conservation by forests and grasslands were quantified on the scale of the whole of China. The analysis was based on the distribution of biomass and the soil carbon pool and soil erosion rates derived from national surveys, as well as carbon density values from field surveys and literature. In 2021, forests and grasslands in China generated 394.18 Mt C/year (y) of steady-state carbon sinks through vertical biomass and soil absorption. The biomass carbon sinks of grasslands, and those of leaves, twigs, flowers and fruits of the forests, were not taken into account when quantifying the stable biomass sink, because they can become net producers of CO2 due to seasonal withering and carryover, or they can form soil organic carbon as potential soil carbon sinks. The amount of horizontal soil carbon reinforcement in China’s forests and grasslands in 2021 was 20.31 Mt C/y, which was positively correlated with the reduction in the water erosion area; consequently, vertical emissions of approximately 14.89–29.78 Mt of CO2 into the atmosphere were avoided. Overall, in 2021, China’s forests and grasslands absorbed atmospheric CO2 and reduced emissions by 1.46–1.47 Gt CO2/y, equivalent to approximately 13% of China’s annual fossil CO2 emissions. This study demonstrates the fact that the adoption of forest and grassland measures sequesters carbon in soil and biota and reduces the risks of CO2 emissions by both vertical and horizontal paths, which is important for achieving carbon neutrality and mitigating climate change.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds great prospects for transforming CO2 into useful chemicals. However, there is still a long way to go to develop effective and affordable electrochemical CO2RR catalysts. In this work, a nickel-decorated nitrogen-doped biomass-derived porous carbon (Ni@N-BPC) catalyst was developed. The catalyst displayed a high specific surface area and superior CO2RR capability. The Faraday efficiency of CO exceeds ninety percent, ranging from a broad potential of 400 mV (−0.7 to −1.1 V vs RHE), reaching approximately 98.41% at −0.9 V vs RHE. The reaction pathway of CO2 conversion to CO on Ni@N-BPC was analyzed by the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy method. Based on theoretical calculations, the rate-determining step shifts from the *COOH creation to the *CO desorption step by Ni anchoring. Meanwhile, N doping modulates the electronic structure and facilitates charge transport, lowering the overpotential of the rate-determining step, thus facilitating the formation of CO. This work offers fresh perspectives on the development and utilization of biomass-derived carbon materials as CO2RR electrocatalysts.

This study aims to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from China&#039;s sludge treatment industry and explore the potential of novel technologies to mitigate these emissions, promoting sustainable sludge management practices. Using a life cycle assessment approach, the total GHG emissions from sludge treatment in 2017 were estimated at 18.54 Mt CO2-eq, with significant regional variations. Incineration contributed the highest emissions (1,011.53 kg CO2-eq/t dry sludge), followed by landfill (717.51 kg CO2-eq/t) and land application (276.41 kg CO2-eq/t). The uneven distribution of emissions across cities highlights the need for targeted mitigation strategies that consider local sustainability challenges. Principal component analysis revealed that economic factors and treatment scale significantly influence emissions, emphasizing the importance of integrating sustainability goals with economic development. To reduce the carbon footprint of sludge treatment and enhance sustainability, the mitigation potential and costs of various technologies were evaluated, including thermal conversion, anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal processes, and wet oxidation. These technologies offer GHG emission reductions ranging from 0.09 to 0.46 t CO2-eq/t dry solids compared to conventional methods, while also promoting resource recovery and circular economy principles. However, further optimization is necessary to enhance their environmental and economic performance, ensuring long-term sustainability. By implementing these technologies and adopting optimization strategies, China&#039;s sludge treatment industry can significantly contribute to achieving the country&#039;s carbon neutrality goal and fostering sustainable development.

Agriculture has historically relied on fossil fuels as the primary source of energy, leading to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and exacerbating climate change. Brazil, as the third-largest producer and exporter of agricultural goods globally, plays a pivotal role in the transformation towards more sustainable practices. To this end, we propose a methodology to estimate CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions in agriculture, leveraging previous research on energy use in 23 crops in Brazil. The methodology aims to facilitate the comparison of emissions across different crops and production systems. Indirect emissions account for 36% of the total, while direct emissions account for 64%. Most direct emissions are due to the consumption of fertilizers and pesticides. The average emission per mass of product was 749.53 kg CO2-eq Mg−1, with cotton having the highest emissions and eucalyptus having the lowest emissions per product. The results highlight the importance of assessing GHG emissions from crops to identify emission reduction opportunities and promoting more sustainable agricultural practices. The study’s findings can inform policy recommendations and contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture practices globally, ultimately leading to a more environmentally friendly and economically viable agricultural sector.

Ecopetrol, based on the results obtained in the study "The Effect of Diesel Properties on the Emissions of Particulate Matter" (Bello et al., 2000), reformulated the diesel fuel distributed in Bogotá, becoming it lighter and with a lower sulfur content. In order to evaluate the environmental benefits that the reformulation of diesel fuel generate in Bogotá, Instituto Colombiano del Petróledo (ICP), with the assistance of Emissions Research and Measurement Division (ERMD) from Environment Canada, arranged a research project to determine the changes in CO, THC, NOx, CO2 and Particulate Matter emissions. The research program was developed in two steps. First one, developed in Bogotá, involved a fleet test with 15 public service buses that normally operate in Bogota’s Savannah, using a portable emissions sampling technology developed for ERMD (DOES2) and following a representative transient driving cycle. Second step, carried out in ERMD’s Heavy-Duty Engine Emissions Laboratory in Ottawa, tested a 1995 caterpillar 3406E 324,5 kW (435 HP) diesel truck engine on the same samples of Colombian diesel fuels used in the fleet tests performed in Bogotá, baselining the tests with a Canadian Commercial Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel. The two commercial Colombian diesel fuels used had the following properties: High Sulfur Diesel (HSD), with 3000 ppm (0,3 wt%) of sulfur and a Final Boiling Point (FBP) of 633 K and the new reformulated diesel fuel, with 1000 ppm (0,1 wt%) of sulfur and FBP of 613 K, which is currently been distributed in Bogotá. Fleet test show small reduction on CO, THC and TPM, and small increments on CO2 and NOx, but with not statistically significant results, while engine testing shows an strong reduction of 40,8% in TPM when you use the new reformulated diesel fuel (0,1wt% of sulfur) instead of high sulfur diesel.

Background: Lower birth weight and preterm birth may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes later in life. We examined whether maternal exposure to air pollution and greenness during pregnancy is associated with offspring birth weight and preterm birth. Methods: We analyzed data on 4286 singleton births from 2358 mothers from Respiratory Health in Northern Europe, a prospective questionnaire-based cohort study (1990–2010). Mixed-effects regression models with random intercepts for mothers and centers were used to estimate the association of exposures to particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), black carbon (BC), and greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in 300m-buffers [NDVI 300m ]) with birth outcomes, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Median (interquartile range [IQR]) exposures to PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , O 3 , BC, and NDVI 300m during pregnancy were 8.4(5.0) µg/m 3 , 14.4(8.3) µg/m 3 , 14.0(11.0) µg/m 3 , 54.7(10.2) µg/m 3 , 0.47(0.41) µg/m 3 , and 0.31(0.20), respectively. IQR increases in air pollution exposures during pregnancy were associated with decreased birth weight and the strongest association was seen for PM 2.5 (−49g; 95% confidence interval [CI] = −83, −16). However, O 3 showed an opposite association. IQR increase in NDVI 300m was associated with an increase in birth weight of 25 g (95% CI = 7, 44). Preterm birth was not associated with the exposures. Conclusion: Increased greenness and decreased air pollution may contribute to healthier pregnancies and improve overall health in the next generation. This emphasizes the need to adopt policies that target the reduction of air pollution emissions and exposure of the population.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the ﬁeld, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today’s limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy eﬃciency when pulsing between ‐1.85 and ‐1.05 V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by diﬀusion and not from pH‐induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83 % compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.

Water electrolysis is a sustainable method of hydrogen production with low levels of CO2 emissions. However, the problem of high economic costs must be resolved. Hybrid water electrolysis (HWE), derived by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, emerges as an alternative method to reduce power consumption. Recent studies on HWEs have focused on reporting cell potential reductions, but their impact on hydrogen production costs is still unclear. In this paper, power consumption and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) were evaluated to understand the economic impact of HWEs. Among various HWEs, HzOR showed an excellent energy consumption reduction (43.3 kWh/kg) resulting in the lowest LCOH ($1.92 kg–1). These results prove one of the most effective alternatives to water electrolysis in its current state. Although other HWEs show only small reductions in energy consumption and LCOH in their current state, these reactions still show high potential to reduce energy consumption and LCOH.

Background: This multicentric prospective study was carried out at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio Medico and Ospedale di Stato of St. Marino Republic. Between 1 January 2019, and 31 December 2022, all pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent, post-coital, and interstitial cystitis at both centers were included in the study. The main aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of vaginal CO2 laser treatment, alone or combined with intravesical hyaluronic acid instillations, in managing cystitis symptoms, such as dysuria, pollakiuria, and urgency, across the entire patient cohort. The secondary objective was to investigate the reduction in number of annual cystitis episodes post-treatment. Methods: Each woman underwent three to four sessions of micro-ablative CO2 vaginal laser treatment. A follow-up examination was conducted 12 months after the final laser session (up to December 2023), during which a post-treatment VAS assessment evaluated dysuria, daily pollakiuria, and urgency. The enrolled patients recorded the number of cystitis episodes experienced during the 12-month pre- and post-treatment period. Results: Results indicated the laser’s efficacy in reducing the total number of cystitis episodes per year and an improvement in symptoms up to one year post-treatment. Greater efficacy of the CO2 laser treatment, particularly when combined with intravesical hyaluronic acid instillation, was observed in both pre- and post- menopausal women. Conclusions: Fractional CO2 laser therapy represents a safe and efficacious, non-hormonal approach for pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent, post-coital, and interstitial cystitis

The synthesis, physicochemical, and functional properties of composite solids resulting from the surface spread of oxidized indium species onto nanoplatelets of anatase were investigated. Both the size and the interaction between the indium- and titanium-containing components control the functional properties. In the reduction of CO2 to CO, the best samples have an indium content between ca. 2 and 5 mol % and showed an excess rate over the photo and thermo-alone processes above 33% and an energy efficiency of 1.3%. Subnanometric (monomeric and dimeric) indium species present relatively weak thermal catalytic response but strong thermo-photo promotion of the activity. A gradual change in functional properties was observed with the growth of the indium content of the solids, leading to a progressive increase of thermal activity but lower thermo-photo promotion. The study provides a well-defined structure–activity relationship rationalizing the dual thermo-photo properties of the catalysts and establishes a guide for the development of highly active and stable composite solids for the elimination and valorization of CO2.

Both biotechnological and electrochemical processes have economic and environmental significance. In particular, biotechnological processes are very specific and stable, while electrochemical processes are generally very atom-and energy-efficient. A combination of these processes is therefore a potentially important approach to intensify biotechnological processes. In this paper, the relevant options for process integration are presented, key performance indicators for quantitative evaluation are given, and an evaluation based on performance indicators is carried out using the example of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate and the subsequent biotechnological conversion to the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate.

The purpose of the evaluation of the Peruvian energy generation system is to project the electricity generation and demand until the year 2050. To achieve this, three alternative scenarios have been defined and analyzed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) software. The scenarios are as follows: the first one, Business-as-Usual scenario, based on normal trends according to historical data and referencing projections made by Peruvian state entities; the second one is focused on Energy Efficiency, the highlighted characteristic is taking into consideration the efficient conditions in transmission and distribution of electric energy; and the third one, centered on Geothermal Energy, focused on the development of this type of energy source and prioritizing it. The primary purpose of this analysis is to identity advantages and disadvantages inherent in each scenario in order to get the best of each one. In this way, the intention is to propose solutions based on Peru&rsquo;s national reality or possible uses of the country&rsquo;s energy potential to supply its energy demand. Currently, Peru&rsquo;s energy demand relies on fossil fuels, hydraulic, and thermal energy. However, there is the possibility of transforming this system into a sustainable one, by strengthening existing and growing energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and new technologies for hydraulic and thermal energy, in addition to considering geothermal energy as the main energy source in the third scenario. The new system mentioned satisfactorily indicate that the CO2 equivalent emissions decrease significantly in the third scenario, with a 15.8% reduction compared to the first scenario and a 9.7% reduction in comparison to the second. On the other hand, the second scenario shows a 5.6% decrease in CO2 emissions compared to the first, resulting from improvements in technology and energy efficiency without requiring significant modifications or considerable investments, as in the third scenario.

Precisely engineering point defects holds promise for the development of state-of-the-art photocatalysts for CO2 conversion. This study demonstrates the controllable creation of nitrogen vacancies (VNs) in the centers of heptazine rings of graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) via a photochemical-assisted nitrogen etching strategy. Spectroscopic analyses and theoretical simulations elucidate the photochemical process to hydrogenate the nitrogen situated at the center of the g-C3N4 heptazine ring and then release an ammonia molecule, accompanied by the photooxidation of the sacrificial agents. The catalyst with an optimal VNs concentration achieves a CO generation rate of 35.2 μmol g–1 h–1 with nearly 100% selectivity, comparable to the performance of the reported g-C3N4 materials. The remarkably improved photoactivity is due to the adjustments of the electronic structures and the midgap states of g-C3N4 by the delocalized π electron cloud created in the 12-membered ring surrounding the VN, which maximizes the light-harvesting efficiencies and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The VNs also activates the neighboring catalytic carbon centers to reduce the energy barrier for CO2 reduction. This work provides a good design concept to regulate catalytic activity by engineering point defects.

We developed a simple strategy for preparing IrSn bimetallic clusters encapsulated in pure silicon zeolites via a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis by using diethylamine as a stabilizing agent. A series of investigations verified that metal species have been confined successfully in the inner of MFI zeolites. IrSn bimetallic cluster catalysts were efficient for the CO selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the presence of excess O2. Furthermore, the 13CO temperature-programmed surface reaction results demonstrated that NO2 and N2O could form when most of the CO was transformed into CO2 and that Sn modification could passivate CO oxidation on the IrSn bimetallic clusters, leading to more reductants that could be used for NOx reduction at high temperatures. Furthermore, SO2 can also influence the NOx conversion by inhibiting the oxidation of CO. This study provides a new strategy for preparing efficient environmental catalysts with a high dispersion of metal species.

Annual climate conferences draw public attention to the urgent need to ecologize CO2-neutral fuel systems and recognize that global temperature increases must be limited to less than 2 °C to avoid dangerous climate change. Based on the projections of the International Panel on Climate Change, it is now widely accepted that in order to stay within this temperature range, CO2 emissions need to be reduced by 80% by 2050. Furthermore, developing countries most affected by climate change are pushing for a reduction (as opposed to stabilization) of atmospheric CO2 equivalent levels from ~450 ppm to 350 ppm in order to stabilize at a 1.5 °C temperature rise. Electricity plays an important role in our everyday life, and its consumption is constantly increasing. Its traditional production based on fossil fuels has huge environmental problems, such as pollution of the atmosphere with greenhouse gases with further global consequences - the greenhouse effect. To overcome these effects, technologies based on non-conventional energy sources such as solar energy, wind energy, biofuels, etc. are being implemented. While solar photovoltaic and thermal energy are attractive, the need for bioenergy is becoming inevitable to replace fossil fuels. Natural photosynthesis offers the means for this, primarily through the use of plants. Land plants have already been used as a source of bioenergy, and this use will increase in the future, despite a number of associated problems. This study concerns a new technology of electricity production, namely, biotechnology, that is, the use of aqueous extracts of various plant resources. Some plants in nature have the ability to accumulate in their cells biologically active compounds capable of creating an electrolytic environment, in fact they are suitable for the production of electricity, which can be amplified.

This paper reviews the work in the areas of optimization and efficiency enhancement of multi-energy systems (MES) for power-to-X conversion. The first study delves into the deployment of Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH2) within district-scale MES, emphasizing the role of PtH2 in achieving zero operational CO2 emissions, especially in systems with high renewable energy generation. The study also highlights the significance of heat pump efficiency, battery capital cost, and lifetime in influencing PtH2 implementation. The second investigation focuses on the integration of energy strategies for the transport and building sectors. It introduces a multi-objective optimization model that considers both sectors, aiming to minimize costs and life-cycle emissions. The findings suggest a potential transition from internal combustion engines to battery electric vehicles and a shift from gas boilers to heat pumps, leading to substantial emission reductions by 2050. Lastly, the third research explores the potential of power-to-gas (P2G) technology in enhancing the integration of renewable energy. By coordinating P2G with CO2-based electrothermal energy storage (ETES), the study demonstrates a significant improvement in the recovery efficiency of surplus wind power. Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of optimizing MES for sustainable and efficient energy conversion.

Simply expressed, the circular economy implies that the people living on Earth should reuse and recycle the products that are currently in use as long as possible and reduce the waste produced, thus reducing CO2 emissions. The latter goal is fundamental from the perspective of mitigating the well-known greenhouse effect and the consequent global warming observed at the planetary scale. Under these conditions, advanced electrodeposition processes can play a fundamental role in the optimization of materials use and in the reduction of the energetic footprint for a wide variety of industrial processes. The aim of the present paper is precisely to suggest how this is possible, showing readers the potential that electrodeposition holds for efficient manufacturing of many different products that have a huge significance for industry.

Copper (Cu)-based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value-added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O-containing organic species (squarate (C4O4) and cyclohexanhexanone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu-O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6-Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7% at -1.0 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4-Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu-atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C-C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10 h with a high current density of 205.1 mA cm-2 at -1.0 VRHE, i.e. is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu-based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.

Carbon emission intensity is an important index reflecting an entity’s low-carbon competitiveness. This paper presents an extended logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model to dissect carbon intensity within China’s civil aviation from 1998 to 2019, revealing a significant reduction in CO2 emissions per air transport revenue. It attributes this decrease to technological advancements, optimized fleet structures, and improved operational efficiencies, highlighting the impact of larger, more efficient aircraft and enhanced load factors. The study also explores economic factors influencing carbon efficiency, suggesting a comprehensive approach encompassing technological innovation and strategic operational improvements for sustainable aviation development.

Selectivity control of supported metal catalysts, which are most widely utilized in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, is of great scientific significance to obtaining the desired chemical product in a multipath reaction but has remained a grand challenging issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation from CH4 to CO can be tuned by a robust and unique support doping strategy by changing the reduction activity of H species over M/Ce1–xPrxO2−δ (M = Ru, Rh) in which metal (M) nanoclusters showed the same existence form on differently doped ceria nanorod supports. The CH4 selectivity of the catalyst decreased with an increase in the Pr content in the support. The selectivity of CH4 on Ru/CeO2 was higher than 90%, while on Ru/Ce0.2Pr0.8O2−δ, the selectivity of CO reached 80%. A variety of techniques, including steady-state isotope transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) type in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)–mass spectrum (MS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), had been applied in this work to analyze the structure–activity relationship between the doping of Pr and the selectivity of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru sites were not directly involved in the hydrogenation of carbon-containing intermediate species (including bicarbonate and formate) during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The active H species on the support sites, which are incorporated in RE3+–OH, directly contacted and reacted with the carbon-containing intermediate species. The introduction of Pr in the support weakened the reducing ability of the support, thus decreasing the reducing ability of H species on the surface of the catalyst, which further hindered the conversion of formate into CH4, resulting in the declined CH4 selectivity. Our study clearly revealed the important role of support in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction and proposed a strategy to modulate the reaction selectivity via support doping. By changing the redox performance of the support, the activity of H species on the support can be adjusted. Thus, the conversion of important reaction intermediates (such as formate) can be affected, so as to achieve precise regulation of the reaction products. We have provided a broader perspective for the selective catalyst design of heterogeneous catalysis and the reaction mechanism study of supported metal catalysts.

Copper (Cu)‐based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value‐added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O‐containing organic species (squarate (C4O4) and cyclohexanhexanone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu‐O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6‐Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7% at ‐1.0 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4‐Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu‐atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C‐C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10 h with a high current density of 205.1 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.0 VRHE, i.e. is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu‐based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.

Due to their availability, low cost, and activity, cobalt-based catalysts are a promising alternative to platinum for the industrial propane dehydrogenation processes. However, their low stability due to sintering, phase transformation, and coke deposition leads to severe deactivation. In this work, the synthesis of amorphous, ordered mesoporous alumina with stabilized Co2+ nanoclusters (Co-m-Al2O3) via an evaporation-induced self-assembly synthesis route is presented. The ordered mesoporous alumina is characterized for containing a large amount of defective pentacoordinate Al3+ sites and a small amount of strong acid sites. The incorporation of Co2+ clusters within the m-Al2O3 structure enhances the dispersion and stability and preserves their reduction even after prolonged time on stream. This leads to a highly selective and steady catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction under industrial-relevant conditions. A significantly low deactivation rate of 0.53 d–1 with stable propylene selectivity of 95% is observed after 23 h, resulting in a 117% higher space–time yield toward propylene compared to the state-of-the-art impregnated Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, Co-m-Al2O3 leads to 4.6 times less coke formation, measured in situ for the first time. The detailed study of the nature of the cobalt sites, together with the acidic properties of the alumina supports, provides a deeper understanding of cobalt-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport industry, comprised almost entirely of CO2, account for around 23% of global emissions. Reducing these emissions is crucial, if countries are to meet their carbon reduction targets. Given that net zero carbon emissions are beginning to be enacted into various countries' laws, transport infrastructure owners now have time bound targets to meet. The accurate measurement of carbon currently expended by transport infrastructure is the first, and most critical, step of infrastructure owners' journey towards carbon reduction, as this Business as Usual carbon expenditure will form the basis for both carbon reduction measures and expansion of carbon measurement from limited embodied and construction scopes though to whole life cycle carbon assessment. This article provides an overview of a transferable method for calculating the carbon footprint of railway infrastructure assets, based on a novel carbon calculation data form. Use of this form will ensure a standardized and consistent approach in data collection methods, enabling the creation of carbon footprints for small scale case studies of individual railway earthworks (around 100 m linear length) with a specific focus on the construction life cycle stages. These stages form the basis for future expansions to the whole life cycle and therefore accuracy in carbon footprinting is vital. These figures can also be used for aggregation across multiple interventions, and again accurate data are required to ensure inaccuracies are not amplified.

One of the urgent problems today is the increased energy consumption in the industrial sector. This negatively affects the ultimate cost of the product and also leads to increased anthropogenic impact on the environment. Industrial-territorial clusters have extensive utility networks, which transfer heat between plants, so the development of methods to reduce their energy consumption will solve this problem. This paper presents a systematic approach to assessing the possibility of direct process integration of plants belonging to the same industrial-territorial cluster to maximize heat recovery. The determination of process flows used for direct process integration can be made based on the territorial location of plants and the availability of space for new heat exchange equipment and piping, and the maximum potential for heat recovery can be estimated using a composite curve graph. The study analyzes monomer production and assesses the potential for reducing energy consumption through direct process integration of pyrolysis and gas separation units, which amounted to 7.3 MW and can only be achieved with process integration. The total reduction in energy consumption with joint intraand direct process integration is 66.7 MW. This also leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 140,152 t/year.

The Rnf complex is the primary respiratory enzyme of several anaerobic prokaryotes that transfers electrons from ferredoxin to NAD+ and pumps sodium ions (Na+) across a membrane, powering ATP synthesis. Rnf is widespread in primordial organisms and the evolutionary predecessor of the Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqr)1. By running in reverse, Rnf reduces ferredoxin with NADH as reductant at the expense of the transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient and provides low potential electrons for nitrogenases as well as CO2 reductases. Yet, the molecular principles that couple the long-range electron transfer to the Na+ translocation across the membrane remain elusive. Here we resolve key functional states along the electron transfer pathway using redox-controlled cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that, in combination with biochemical functional assays and atomistic molecular simulations, provide key insight into the redox-driven Na+ pumping mechanism. We show that the reduction of the unique membrane-embedded [2Fe2S] cluster in the vestibule between the RnfA/E subunits electrostatically attracts the sodium ions, and in turn, triggers an inward/outward transition with alternating membrane access driving the Na+ pump and the reduction of NAD+. Our study unveils an ancient mechanism for redox-driven ion pumping, and provides key understanding of the fundamental principles governing energy conversion in biological systems.

Despite the importance of CO adsorption in many electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, there has been little investigation of the dependence of the free energy of CO adsorption on the applied potential. Herein, we report on the potential-dependent adsorption of CO on Cu electrodes using a grand-canonical density functional theory approach. We demonstrate that, within the working potential range of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on Cu(111) and Cu(100), the CO adsorption strength can change by over 0.1 eV. Our analyses explain the potential dependence through an interfacial capacitance loss upon CO adsorption as well as orbital relaxation induced by the electrode potential. Via sensitivity analysis with respect to two electrolyte model parameters (solvent dielectric constant and Debye screening length), we find that the surface excess charge density is a useful descriptor of the CO adsorption free energy.

Ag exhibits high selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) toward C1 products, while the hydrogenation involving the concerted proton–electron transfer (CPET) or sequential electron–proton transfer (SEPT) mechanism is still in debate. Toward a better understanding of the Ag-catalyzed electrochemical CO2R, we employed a microkinetic model based on the Marcus electron transfer theory to thoroughly investigate the selectivity of C1 products of electrochemical CO2R over the Ag(111) surface. We found that at an acidic condition of pH = 1.94, formate is the main product when U < −0.94 V via the CPET mechanism, whereas CO becomes the primary product when U > −0.94 V via the SEPT mechanism. Conversely, at an alkaline condition of pH = 13.95, formate is the main product following the SEPT mechanism. Our findings provide novel insights into the influence of external factors (applied potential and pH) on the product selectivity and hydrogenation mechanism of electrochemical CO2R.

This work explores technical challenges and potential methodologies for understanding electrochemical Reactive CO2 Capture (RCC) mechanisms. RCC offers potential energy cost advantages by directly converting captured CO into fuels and chemicals, unlike traditional carbon capture and utilization (CCU) processes that require sequential capture, concentration, and compression. However, direct conversion of captured CO introduces complexity due to additional equilibrium buffer reactions, making it challenging to identify active species for reduction in electrochemical studies. This work discusses methods to integrate transport, thermodynamics, and kinetics concepts to identify active carbon sources in RCC. Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) and transport models are validated against experimental results obtained in a gastight rotating cylinder electrode reactor and are shown as useful tools for studying RCC in heterogeneous electrocatalysts across different capture agents, solvents, and temperatures. This work establishes an experimental framework for advancing research in electrochemical RCC.

Transportation is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, making it essential to optimize traffic networks to reduce energy-related emissions. This paper presents a novel approach to traffic network control using Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC), a physics-informed machine learning methodology. We base our model on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) and the Networked Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (NMFD), offering a simplified representation of citywide traffic networks. Our approach ensures compliance with system constraints by construction. In empirical comparisons with existing state-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods, our approach demonstrates a 4 order of magnitude reduction in computation time and an up to 37% improvement in traffic performance. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of our controller to scenario shifts and find that it adapts well to changes in traffic patterns. This work proposes more efficient traffic control methods, particularly in large-scale urban networks, and aims to mitigate emissions and alleviate congestion in the future.

However, while the effectiveness of these policies on renewable energy outcomes have been well documented, the economy-wide impacts are rarely studied. This study examines the economy-wide and environmental impacts of renewable energy production subsidy in Nigeria. The study provides a novel modeling framework for analysing fiscal and other incentives for green energy in Nigeria by incorporating self-generated electricity, which is a major component of electricity supply in Nigeria, into a macroeconomic model. The study uses a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to analyse the effectiveness and economic impacts of renewable energy production subsidy in Nigeria. CGE models are commonly used to assess the economy-wide impacts of public policy. Specifically, the PEP-1-1 model, which is a static single-country model, is used for the analysis. The model is calibrated on Nigeria's updated social accounting matrix (SAM). The results of the analysis show that renewable energy production subsidy is effective in enhancing the development of the renewable-electricity sector and encouraging the use of renewable electricity but does not significantly reduce the use of conventional electricity sources. The subsidy, if financed by public deficit, has positive impacts on real economic outcomes such as GDP, household income, welfare, and employment, but has a smaller effect on CO2 emissions. In contrast, the economic effects are mostly negative, but the CO2 emissions-reduction effects are larger if the subsidy is financed by reallocation of public expenditure. In addition, the effects on sectoral outputs are mixed. The results of this study can be used by policy makers to ascertain how to finance green subsidies in fiscally constrained and energy-poor developing countries. Specifically, policy makers should take cognizance of economic and feedback effects when designing and implementing environmental policies. Beyond Nigeria and the specific case of fiscal subsidies, the modeling framework presented in this study can be applied to other green energy policies and can be adapted to other developing countries.

Deploying renewable generation to replace conventional fossil-fuel-based energy supplies provides an important pathway for the decarbonization of steelmaking plants. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to improve the flexibility of blast-furnace-gas-fired combined-cycle power plants (BFGCCs) to ease the accommodation of uncertain renewable generation. To this end, this paper proposes the deployment of a molten salt heat storage (MSHS) system in BFGCCs to store the heat of gas turbine flue gas so that the power–heat coupling of these BFGCCs can be unlocked to enhance the flexibility of the energy supply. A stochastic capacity optimization of an integrated BFGCC–MSHS–wind–solar (BMWS) energy system is presented to determine the optimal installed capacities of a BFG holder, MSHS, wind turbine, and PV panel, aiming to achieve an economic and safe energy supply for the entire system. Multiple scenarios considering uncertain fluctuations in load demands and renewable generation are generated with the Monte Carlo method based on a typical scenario. These scenarios are then reduced to representative scenarios using the synchronous substitution and reduction method for stochastic capacity optimization to enhance the reliability of the results. The case study results demonstrate that configuring MSHS reduces the total annualized cost of the BMWS system by 2.28%. Furthermore, considering the uncertainties of the power/heating load and wind/PV generation can reduce the expected annualized total cost of the BMWS system and the corresponding standard deviation by 5.66% and 81.45%, respectively. The BMWS system can achieve 730.68 tons of equivalent CO2 reduction in 24 h due to the successful utilization of renewable energy. This paper provides an effective approach for the decarbonization of energy generation systems in steelmaking plants.

Metal formyl and hydroxymethyl complexes are implicated as key intermediates in the (photo)electrochemical reduction of carbon oxides (CO2 or CO) to liquid fuels such as methanol. Formyl complexes—and to a lesser extent hydroxymethyl complexes—have been previously synthesized and characterized; nevertheless, the influence of electronic modifications to ligands supporting these reactive carbon fragments is not well understood. Herein, we report the synthesis of a family of ruthenium polypyridyl carbonyl complexes of the form [Ru(4,4’-R,R-bpy)(tpy)(CO)] 2+ bearing different substituents on the bipyridyl (bpy) ligand (R = OMe, H, CF3). Treatment with NaBH4 as a chemical reductant results in formation of the formyl and subsequently the hydroxymethyl and methyl complexes; each are characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and isotopic labeling studies. An electron-donating modification (R = OMe) to the bpy ligand is shown to significantly increase the lifetime of the formyl intermediate and the yield of released methanol. We observe a clear linear dependence of thermodynamic parameters on bpy electronics, however the stability of the formyl complex and the reactivity of the resulting hydroxymethyl complex do not depend linearly on ligand electronics. We anticipate that these results may be extended to future development of (photo)electrocatalytic systems for CO-to-methanol conversion.

The investigation of fundamental properties of low-valent molybdenum complexes bearing anionic ligands is crucial for elucidating the molybdenum’s role in critical enzymatic systems involved in the transformation of small molecules, including the nitrogenase’s iron molybdenum cofactor, FeMoco. The β-diketonate ligands in [Mo(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate), one of the earliest low-valent Mo complexes reported, provide a robust anionic platform to stabilize Mo in its +III oxidation state. This complex played a key role in demonstrating the potential of low-valent molybdenum for small molecule activation, serving as the starting material for the preparation of the first reported molybdenum dinitrogen complex. Surprisingly however, given this fact and the widespread use of β-diketonate ligands in coordination chemistry, only a very limited number of low-valent Mo β-diketonate complexes have been reported. To address this gap, we explored the redox behavior of homoleptic molybdenum tris-β-diketonate complexes, employing a tertiary butyl substituted diketonate ligand (dipivaloylmethanate, tBudiket) to isolate and fully characterize the corresponding Mo complexes across three consecutive oxidation states (+IV, +III, +II). We observed marked reactivity of the most reduced congener with heterocumulenes CE2 (E = O, S), yet with very distinct outcomes. Specifically, CO2 stoichiometrically carboxylates one of the β-diketonate ligands, while in the presence of excess CS2, catalytic reductive dimerization to tetrathiooxalate occurs. Through the isolation and characterization of reaction products and intermediates, we demonstrate that the observed reactivity results from the chemical non-innocence of the 𝛽-diketonate ligands, which facilitates the formation of a common ligand-bound intermediate, tBuMo(II)·CE2 (E = O, S). The stability of this proposed intermediate dictates the specific reduction products observed, highlighting the relevance of the chemically non-innocent nature of 𝛽-diketonate ligands.

To mitigate dangerous climate change, a drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is needed by 2030. Buildings contribute significantly to emissions, with the use phase of existing buildings being responsible for the majority of energy consumption. In addition, environmental problems associated with the production of raw materials, construction, and the end of life of buildings are serious concerns that require urgent solutions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and the EU-recommended Environmental Footprint (EF) are widely accepted tools to measure environmental impacts throughout a product life cycle. However, assessing the environmental performance of wooden buildings remains a challenge. This study presents a benchmark for an average new European wooden building fulfilling the European nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) requirement. The benchmark utilizes the recommended EU EF impact categories with normalization and weighting, allowing for easy and quick comparisons. The results communicate the average environmental impact per square meter of floor area over one year. This benchmark is a suitable comparison point for new wooden building designs and is used as an effective tool for architects and designers during the initial planning stages of wooden buildings. By using this benchmark, the environmental performance of the building can be improved, and the communication and interpretation of LCA results can be facilitated for customers and other relevant stakeholders.

The paddlewheel‐type dimetal core ([M2]) is a ubiquitous motif in the nodes in coordination polymers (CPs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). However, their preparation has relied on ligand‐substitution‐labile metal ions owing to challenges associated with crystallization. Consequently, examples featuring ligand‐substitution‐inert metal ions, such as Ru or Rh, are scarce. This study presents the synthesis of novel reticular imine‐linked CPs incorporating the paddlewheel‐type diruthenium(II, II) ([Ru2II,II]; 1‐Ru) or dirhodium(II, II) ([Rh2II,II]; 1‐Rh) subunits. The synthetic approach involved a Schiff base dehydration condensation reaction between p‐formylbenzoate‐bridged [Ru2II,II] or [Rh2II,II] precursors (i.e., CHO–Ru and CHO–Rh, respectively) and 2,5‐dimethyl‐1,4‐phenylenediamine in a 1:2 ratio. The catalytic activities of 1‐Ru and 1‐Rh for the photochemical reduction of CO2 in a heterogeneous system depended on the metal site. The 1‐Rusystem exhibited exceptional selectivity, generating 3.0 ´ 104 mmol g‐1 of CO after 24 h of irradiation, whereas the 1‐Rhsystem generated a lower amount of CO (3.2 ´ 103 mmol g‐1). The catalytic activity of 1‐Ru ranked with that of all relevant catalytic systems. This study paves the way for the exploration of [Ru2II,II]‐ or [Rh2II,II]‐based polymers with open metal site‐dependent functional properties.

The wide metabolic diversity of microalgae, their fast growth rates, and cost-effective production make these organisms highly promising resources for a variety of biotechnological applications, addressing critical needs in industry, agriculture, and medicine. The utilization of microalgae in consortia with bacteria is proving to be valuable in different biotechnological fields, including treating various types of wastewaters, producing biofertilizers, and extracting various products from their biomass. Monoculture of the microalgae Chlamydomonas has been a prominent research model for many years, extensively utilized in studying photosynthesis, sulfur and phosphorus metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, respiration, and flagella synthesis, among others. Recent re-search has increasingly recognized the potential of Chlamydomonas-bacteria consortia as a bio-technological tool for various applications. Bioremediation of wastewater using Chlamydomonas, and its bacterial consortia presents significant potential for the sustainable reduction of contam-inants, while also facilitating resource recovery and valorization of microalgal biomass. Using Chlamydomonas and its bacterial consortia as biofertilizers can offers several benefits, such as en-hancing crop yield, protecting crops, maintaining soil fertility and stability, aiding in CO2 miti-gation, and contributing to sustainable agriculture practices. Chlamydomonas-bacterial consortia play a significant role in the production of high-value products, particularly in biofuel and en-hancing H2 production. This review aims to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the po-tential of Chlamydomonas monoculture and its bacterial consortia, identifying current applications, and proposing new research and development directions to maximize its potential.

The adverse effects of heatwaves on viticulture could be, at least partly, mitigated by generous soil water availability. As climate change will also likely reduce irrigation water, knowing to which extent soil water availability could be decreased under the heatwaves without compromising plant performances would be important. In this pot experiment, we differentiated soil water availability by compensating 100% (T100), 70% (T70), 40% (T40) and 10% (T10) of vine transpiration. Grapevines (cv. Sauvignon) were then subjected to a 11-day heatwave (Tmax 40 °C) and to a post-heat stress recovery phase. Soil water potential between -0.05 to -0.2 MPa, respectively, in T100 and T70 enabled the plants to maintain high net CO2 assimilation (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), and leaf transpiration (Eleaf) which kept the leaf temperature (Tleaf) below the ambient temperature and promoted the plant growth. During the heatwave, T100 and T70 vines decreased their photochemical yield and dissipated the excess energy via regulated non-photochemical heat dissipation, and resumed their photochemical activities upon removing the heat stress. Further reduction in soil water potential to -0.4 and and -1.2 MPa in T40 and T10, respectively, decreased Pn and gs and restrained Eleaf, causing a significant increase in Tleaf during the heatwave, and limited the plant recovery after the heat stress. Nonetheless, the maximum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) showed quite high resistance to heat stress in all treatments. These findings suggest that decreasing soil water availability to reach soil water potential levels close to -0.2 MPa implies higher efficiency in using water resources during a heat wave without limiting plant growth.

Introduction The thoracic surgical procedure leads to a reduction in respiratory muscle strength. To restore it, certain strategies must be employed. Physiotherapy utilizes resources and techniques such as deep breathing stimulation, cough stimulation, use of incentive spirometers, mobilization, and ambulation. However, at times these resources and techniques may prove insufficient, and additional measures, such as Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), are employed Pieczkoski (2017). Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV) has been utilized to expedite pulmonary function recovery as well as to prevent and treat postoperative pulmonary complications Nasrala 2018. NIV diminishes the risk of ventilator-associated complications due to its non-invasive nature. Consequently, NIV has been adopted to avert post-extubation complications in postoperative patients Liu 2020. The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial and assess the efficacy of NIV in comparison to conventional physiotherapy in terms of pulmonary function among patients undergoing cardiac surgery at a selected hospital in Campina Grande, Paraíba, Brazil. Methods and analyses This randomized, controlled, double-blind (patient and analyst) clinical trial will be conducted at Hospital João XXIII in Campina Grande, Paraíba, Brazil. Patients do not know which group they are allocated to. Those in the group that use CPAP or BIPAP will not be able to distinguish one from the other. The data analyst at the end of the collections will also be blinded. Only the health professional who will be applying the protocol cannot be blinded. The sample size, determined via sample calculation, yielded a total of 21 patients per group (63 patients). The patients will be allocated into 3 groups (CPAP group - CPAP + standard physiotherapy, BiPAP group - BiPAP + standard physiotherapy, and Control group - standard physiotherapy) in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio.

Food security and climate change pose great threats to the future of the agriculture industry. By 2050, with 20% arable land reduction and an additional 2.2 billion people, agriculture will need to adapt. Before this research, precision agriculture had shown significant advantages in improving resource usage efficiency and yields with less land. However, most of the popular precision agriculture approaches are associated with the tag of high technical barriers to implementation and scalability. This dissertation aims to answer the central question: What approaches should be applied for precision agriculture, through both hardware and software applications, to understand the scientific connection between plant physiological response and changing environmental conditions, ultimately enhancing agricultural production? Several published, submitted, and drafted studies prepared the foundation for this interdisciplinary research discussed in Chapters 2 - 5. Chapter 2 delves into a manufacturing pathway dedicated to customizing cost-effective and performance-effective sensors for precision agriculture. Through extensive experimentation involving temperature, speed, and applied voltage, we employ electric field-assisted direct writing technology to fabricate 3D metallic structures. This innovative approach empowers us to adapt sensor functional and dimensional variations to suit the specific requirements for collecting environmental and physiological data, as elaborated in Chapter 5. The ability to rapidly prototype these sensors enhances the efficiency of plant science research, contributing to the broader goals of precision agriculture. In Chapter 3, we focus on developing a germination substrate with precise control over mechanical gripping forces, water regulation, plant respiration, and real-time root growth visualization. We achieve distinct mechanical characteristics by leveraging the anisotropic properties of 3D-printed Carboxylated methylcellulose (C-MC), ensuring liquid-free water access, oxygen supply, and carbon dioxide removal. This transparent substrate enables 100%germination, non-destructive evaluation of germination and facilitates root phenotyping, offering flexibility in experimental conditions for plant science research. Furthermore, it validates the viability of seed germination in hydrogels, which explores environmental conditions for lettuce growth and leverages the anisotropic mechanical performance afforded by additive manufacturing. Building upon the foundation laid in Chapter 3, which showcased the potential of MC hydrogel, we conducted further experiments involving formulation chemistry modifications. Chapter 4 explores the most influential environmental parameters affecting plants during germination. Through three rounds of trials and two iterations of Hoagland formulation optimizations tested with more than 900 seeds, we identify pH, hydrogel content, and photo energy as the most influential factors impacting germination. This chapter validates the earlier findings regarding the impact of mechanical differentiation on germination, as established in Chapter 3. The insights gained in this study provide valuable recommendations for selecting environmental parameters in Chapter 5, enhancing the effectiveness of plant physiological research. In Chapter 5, we turn our attention to the operational aspects of our research, emphasizing the collection of efficient data, signal processing, and the translation of data into valuable evaluation indices. We integrate the sensing matrix into a customized hydroponic growing system capable of monitoring controlled environmental conditions while non-destructively evaluating lettuce's physiological responses. By processing and analyzing high-frequency weight measurement data, we create 14 plant phenotyping and system operation efficiency evaluation indices. These indices serve two vital purposes: firstly, they scientifically elucidate the connection between environmental condition shifts and the corresponding physiological responses of the plants; secondly, they enable us to evaluate system performance and provide actionable operational insights. This study employs a system engineering framework to design a hydroponic system that serves as a platform for plant physiology research. Its functions include the validation of results from Chapter 4, the establishment of scientific connections between quantifiable data and plant physiology, the proposal of a non-destructive and in-situ data acquisition system that significantly reduces sample requirements and resource usage, and, perhaps most importantly, the advancement of crop modeling and precision agriculture while minimizing technological barriers and costs.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems are promising approaches for sustainable fuel processing. PEC devices, like conventional photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV-EC) systems, utilize solar energy for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Contrary to PV-EC systems, PEC devices integrate the photoabsorber, the ionic membrane, and the catalysts into a single reactor. This integration of elements potentially makes PEC systems simpler in design, increases efficiency, offers a cost advantage, and allows for implementation with higher flexibility in use. We present a detailed techno-economic evaluation of PEC systems with three different device designs. We combine a system-level techno-economic analysis based on physical performance models (including degradation) with stochastic methods for uncertainty assessments, also considering the use of PV and EC learning curves for future cost scenarios. For hydrogen, we assess different PEC device design options (utilizing liquid or water vapor as reactant) and compare them to conventional PV-EC systems (anion or cation exchange). We show that in the current scenario, PEC systems (with a levelized cost of hydrogen of 6.32 $/kgH2) located in southern Spain are not yet competitive, operating at 64% higher costs than the PV-driven anion exchange EC systems. Our analysis indicates that PEC plants' material and size are the most significant factors affecting hydrogen costs. PEC designs operating with water vapor are the most economical designs, with the potential to cost about 10% less than PV-EC systems and to reach a 2 $/kgH2 target by 2040. If a sunlight concentrator is incorporated, the PEC-produced hydrogen cost is significantly lower (3.59 $/kgH2 in the current scenario). Versions of the concentrated PEC system that incorporate reversible operation and CO2 reduction indicate a levelized cost of storage of 0.2803 $/kWh for the former and a levelized cost of CO of 0.546 $/kgCO for the latter. These findings demonstrate the competitiveness and viability of (concentrated) PEC systems and their versatile use cases. Our study shows the potential of PEC devices and systems for hydrogen production (current and future potential), storage applications, and CO production, thereby highlighting the importance of sustainable and cost-effective design considerations for future advancements in technology development in this field.

Tuning the interactions of solid multi-block polymer electrolytes is a cost-effective approach to target and advance specific properties for sustainable ion-conducting applications such as fuel cells, polymer actuators, gas separation, vanadium flow batteries, water desalination using electrodialysis, and water electrolysis to produce H2 and O2. The accelerated research interest in tailoring the properties of multi-block ionomers is fueled by their ability to assemble into various heterogeneous nanoscale structures. These structures' spatial arrangement and connectivity define film strength, durability, and molecule transport. Systematically designing the spatial arrangement is a key to understanding the structure and property relationships of proton-exchange membranes (PEM)/ionomers. Such a design may solve global challenges and contribute to renewable technologies like water and energy. In this dissertation, the morphological transitions of a multi-block ionomer known as a pentablock copolymer (PBC) are investigated to advance the basic science related to the design of functional materials and the development of morphology-composition-property-transport relationships related to random and multi-block ionomers. The intermolecular interactions of PBC were altered by manipulating their free energy, thermodynamics and equilibrium via polymer blending, systematic incorporation of metal salt, thermal annealing and impregnation of inorganic SiO2/TiO2 sols. A synergistic polymer blend consisting of PBC with ion-exchange capacities (IECs) of 1.0 and 2.0, and poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) revealed that PBC(2.0) exhibited greater clustering of ion groups and phase separation compared to PBC(2.0)/PPO blends, as evidenced by an increase in domain spacing from 33.1 nm to 37.0 nm. Notably, the PBC(2.0)/PPO (90/10) blend membrane showed potential in hydrogen fuel cells as they exhibited comparable proton conductivity (110ms/cm) to Nafion even when the water uptake (WU) was reduced by 58 wt%. Moreover, the PBC(1.0)/PPO blend demonstrated an H2 permeability ranging from 36.7 to 43.3 Barrers and an O2 permeability of 6.84 to 7.10 Barrers, with an ideal H2/O2 selectivity of 5.81 to 6.60, representing a hydrogen fuel cell crossover improvement over unmodified PBC(1.0). Tailoring the structure and function of PBC(1.5) with monovalent lithium and trivalent aluminum cations via both in situ and ex situ methods demonstrated that film properties were impacted by their Lewis acid strength, cation size, and interaction energy between the metal ion and sulfonated group. The Li+ formed the most stable pair with sulfonic acid groups in PBC(1.5) due to their comparable Lewis acid strength (LAS) with a Lewis base strength of 0.25 to 0.29. Lower interaction energies of 22.7 to 45.5 J/mol were exhibited by Al3+ as compared to Li+, indicating incomplete neutralization with sulfonic acid groups. At a metal salt concentration of 0.01 M, PBC(1.5)-Li-[0.01] and PBC(1.5)-Al[0.01] exhibited either 43.4% higher conductivity or similar conductivity to PBC(1.5)-H+ at all hydration levels (10% RH, 50% RH, 90% RH, and 100% wet). The results showed that metal cations incorporated via the in situ method in the PBC matrix allowed systematic tunability of these membranes for CO2/CH4 separations, elevating CO2 selectivity by 303%. Additionally, the PBC membranes with IEC 1.0 and 2.0 were blended to investigate the interplay between the simultaneous increase in the polymer backbone and sulfonic acid groups. Proton conductivity results demonstrated higher conductivity (164-224 mS/cm) in blend membranes compared to Nafion, even at 90% relative humidity (RH), with PBC(1.0)/PBC(2.0) (20/80) and (10/90) blends exhibiting superior performance. Under wet saturated conditions, PBC(1.5) showed excellent proton conductivity at 52% lower water uptake (WU) compared to PBC(2.0). Gas transport studies indicated higher selectivity for αH2/O2 (10.2-13.2) and αCO2/CH4 (4.32-36.2) in blend membranes with IECs between 1.6-1.7 mmol/g, making them potential candidates for preventing hydrogen fuel cell crossover and applications in natural gas separation. Further, the effects of manipulating the distribution of SiO2/TiO2 inorganic sols within a PBC(1.0) matrix through thermal annealing and incorporation in different physical states (solid/liquid) showed that the degree of crystallinity varied from 1.10-10.34%, with increased crystallinity correlating with decreased water uptake (WU%). Surface energy analysis revealed the enhancement of proton conductivity through the rearrangement of sulfonate domains at the surface of PBC(1.0) membranes, facilitating a more efficient path for ion conduction and varied from 17.8-30.5 mJ/m2. Notably, PBC(1.0) exchanged with liquid TiO2 sols outperformed control and benchmark Nafion membranes, exhibiting superior proton conductivity and dimensional stability, achieving 138 mS/cm conductivity even with a 12.6% reduction in WU and a 61% increase in crystallinity. Overall, this dissertation delves into the crucial role of optimizing the intermolecular interactions of PBC in achieving targeted properties. The findings hold tremendous promise for the development of sustainable ion-conducting applications, such as hydrogen fuel cells, as they enable high proton conductivity without sacrificing dimensional stability. Furthermore, these PBC membranes exhibited the potential to enhance membrane-based H2/O2 and CO2/CH4, gas separations.

To the Editor: The abdominal surgical procedures are linked to a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and may be mitigated by administration of lung-protective mechanical ventilation during anesthesia.[1,2] To date, no relevant studies have focused on protective lung ventilation strategies specifically for laparoscopic colorectal cancer (CRC). Herein, we propose an innovative easy-to-use lung-protective strategy with lower tidal volume (VT), pneumoperitoneum pressure (PnP) and deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and assess whether it is superior to conventional lung protection strategies in reducing PPCs. A single-center, randomized trial was conducted in patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery and followed up until 30 postoperative days (PODs). A total of 120 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to either the test group (protective lung ventilation with lower VT (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight [PBW] + low PnP [10 mmHg] + deep NMB) or the control group (conventional pulmonary ventilation [8 mL/kg of PBW for VT] + standard PnP [15 mmHg] + moderate NMB). The institutional Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (Approval No. NCC2018W-006) and the registry was completed at ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR1900021989). The written informed consent were signed by each patient before enrollment. The patient follow-ups were performed throughout the hospital stay once daily or by telephone and outpatient records when patients were discharged at Day 30 after operation [Supplementary Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. In all the groups, mechanical ventilation during anesthesia consisted of volume-controlled modes of VT according to the group and PBW,[1,2] positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, and alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs) at 30-minute intervals. The respiratory rate was adjusted as necessary to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) between 35 mmHg and 45 mmHg, with an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (I:E) of 1:2. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was maintained at 40–60% throughout the anesthesia treatment. A portable neuromuscular monitor was applied to the ulnar nerve to confirm the depth of the NMB. The indications of NMB depth were defined as train-of-four count (TOFC) = 0 and posttetanic count (PTC) ≥1 for deep NMB and TOFC = 1–3 for moderate NMB.[3] The primary endpoint of the PPCs was systematically assessed via the operational definition of Kroenke et al[4] with the grades ranging from 1 to 4 [Supplementary Table 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. For those suspected to have PPCs, low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) was routinely performed for confirmation. The secondary endpoints comprise postoperative analgesia and serological inflammatory factor expression. All the statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 25.0 (IBM SPSS, Inc., NY, USA). The Kaplan–Meier (K–M) method combined with log-rank analysis was used to compare the incidence of PPCs between the two groups. Quantitative data are presented as the medians (interquartile ranges) and were compared using Student's t-test or the Mann–Whitney rank test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square or the Fisher exact test. The two-tailed P values <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The sample size was calculated according to the results of our preliminary experiment. With a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a minimum of 55 patients were included in each group. Considering a 10% drop-out rate during the follow-up, 60 patients were enrolled in each group. In this study, 152 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery were initially included, and a total of 120 patients were ultimately enrolled. The patients in the two groups had comparable baseline characteristics [Supplementary Table 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. The K–M analysis revealed a significant difference in the incidence of PPCs within 30 days after surgery between the test group (9 of 60, 15.0%) and the control group (19 of 60, 31.7%) (P = 0.031; Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26). Of these, patients of grade 1 (primarily microatelectasis) account for the largest proportion of PPCs (test group vs. control group; 77.8% [7 of 9] vs. 68.4% [13 of 19]). For subgroup analysis, the test group exhibited superior analgesic outcomes and fewer related postoperative inflammatory responses than did the control group for individuals with a standard or overweight body mass index (BMI) <27.9 kg/m2, who were younger than 62 years, or who had an anesthesia duration of 3 hours or less [Supplementary Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. Atelectasis formation, a shift in the ventilation-to-perfusion ratio by reduced pulmonary compliance and increased chest pressure facilitates PPCs even in patients with healthy lungs. This pathophysiological alteration will be exacerbated during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Pulmonary atelectasis is the main cause of PPCs progression and is mainly attributed to compression of the lung parenchyma, absorption of alveolar gases, and impaired extra-alveolar function. The use of higher FiO2 (>80%) can also lead to absorptive lung atelectasis and exacerbate inflammatory lung injury.[2] PPCs can also cause lung injury, lung infection, or barotrauma in turn. Tidal volumes in the range of 6–8 mL/kg of PBW are widely accepted for non-injured lungs.[2] Single low-tidal volume ventilation plays the most important role in protective ventilation,[1,2,5] which may lead to decreased compliance and atelectasis formation. Therefore, in comparison to the control group, which had a concentration of 8 mL/kg, 6 mL/kg was adopted for the test group. The ideal level of PEEP to resist atelectasis remains in dispute, with low-risk patients receiving PEEP of less than 5 cm H2O but high-risk patients requiring higher levels of PEEP.[5] Once atelectasis has occurred, ARMs are required to recruit alveoli. Additionally, it has been proven that a lower PnP involves reduced peak inspiratory pressure and facilitates respiratory compliance, especially in the Trendelenburg position. Some evidence has shown that postoperative lung function is equivalent in patients receiving the same PnP, regardless of whether deep or moderate NMB is used, thus demonstrating a close correlation between PnP and postoperative PPCs.[6] Postoperative pain is another critical factor in the formation of PPCs, pain-induced restriction of abdominal breathing initiates the microatelectasis and subsequent atelectasis formation. Despite using the same standardized analgesic protocol in both groups, our results indicate that the lung-protective strategy was associated with lower short-term postoperative VAS scores (P = 0.016 for postoperative 1 h, P = 0.071 for POD 1 [Table 1]) and decreased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression on POD 3 (P = 0.017). Of note, the subgroup results reveal a superior advantage in analgesia and systemic inflammation suppression in the test group, especially in those with BMI <27.9 kg/m2, age <62 years, or anesthesia duration ≤3 hours [Supplementary Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. One potential mechanism through which analgesia is achieved could be the reduction in tension exerted on the abdominal wall facilitated by deep NMB, thereby reducing postoperative incisional pain.[7] Additionally, low PnP can relieve visceral and shoulder pain by lowering the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and reducing inflammatory cytokines/oxygen-free radicals arising from visceral ischemia–reperfusion injury. Given that inflammation is implicated in the progression of pain, lung injury, and PPCs,[1] the causal relationship remains undetermined.

As a single-center study, only one study site cannot be representative of the clinical practices in a larger patient population. Chronic postsurgical pain and more detailed pain categories should be further explored. Furthermore, mechanistic studies in the outcome after novel treatment strategies need to be investigated. In conclusion, the holistic anesthetic strategy of protective lung ventilation combined with deep NMB and low PnP can reduce the PPCs in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Further studies are needed to test the efficacy and heterogeneity of the clinical application of this easy-to-use anesthetic strategy.

<p>我國綠建築評估系統EEWH至今已有20年歷史，然而在住宿類建築當中綠建築標章案件數仍僅占總使用執照數量1%以下，標章案之總樓地板面積僅占總使用執照總樓地板面積20%以下，因此對於推廣綠建築之成果仍有進步空間。分析綠建築申請率低的原因，包含大眾認為綠建築之成本較高、綠建築標章之總建築專案期程較久、所需之審查資料繁多&hellip;等。再者，申請綠建築標章時之分數常少於申請候選綠建築證書時之分數，甚至有案件未申請綠建築標章。專案管理係指對於專案生命週期之各項工作項目予以妥善管理，以減少專案成果與預期目標的落差。於過往在建築業的案例與相關研究中，指出專案管理對於管控建築成本與工期具有實際績效，然而案例多為大型工程與廠辦類建築物，對於住宿類建築物之探討相對較少。故本研究先透過專家問卷探討建築專案管理管控綠建築指標項目之能力，以提出在專案管理思維下，設計住宿類綠建築時可優先考量採用之建築技術，以消除大眾對於綠建築在成本與時程上之顧慮。研究成果顯示，不同綠建築技術與設施設備之採用情形，對於建築專案的管控能力確實具有差異性。在EEWH-RS版本下之指標項目，以日常節能指標與二氧化碳減量指標下之指標項目，較能夠受專案管理管控。但綠化量指標、水資源指標以及汙水垃圾改善指標等，由於其技術已經成熟、成為標準配備或已規格化，致使專案管理對其無法具有較高的影響能力。研究成果係可協助建築設計師於住宿類綠建築規劃設計時，擬定出較易管控成本與時程之方案，進而提升業主採用綠建築技術與設施設備之意願。</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Taiwan&rsquo;s green building assessment system (EEWH) has a history of 20 years, but the number of green building label cases in residential buildings still accounts for less than 1% of the total number of Building Use permit, and the total floor area of the label cases are less than 20% of the total building which get Building Use permit. So there is still room for promoting the achievements of green buildings. Analyze the reasons for the low green building application rate, including the public’s view that the cost of green building is relatively high, the overall construction project period of the green building label is longer, and the amount of review information required is more than general building... Furthermore, the score for applying for a green building seal is often less than the score for applying for a candidate green building certificate. There are even cases where the green building seal is not applied. Project management refers to the proper management of various work items in the project life cycle to reduce the gap between project results and expected goals. In the past cases and related research in the construction industry, it was pointed out that project management has actual performance in controlling construction costs and duration. However, most of the cases are large-scale projects and factory buildings, and there is relatively little discussion on residential buildings. Therefore, in this study, an expert questionnaire will be used to discuss the ability of the construction project management to control the green building index project, in order to put forward the construction technology that can be considered first when designing residential-type green buildings under the project management thinking, so as to eliminate the public’s cost and schedule for green buildings Concerns. The research results show that the adoption of different green building technologies and facilities and equipment has indeed different management and control capabilities for construction projects. The indicators under the EEWH-RS version are more able to be controlled by the project management based on the daily energy saving indicators and the CO2 reduction indicators. However, the greenery indicators, water resource indicators and sewage and garbage improvement indicators, etc., because their technology has matured, become standard equipment or has been standardized, the project management cannot have a high influence on it. The research results can assist architects in the planning and design of residential-type green buildings, and draw up plans that are easier to control costs and schedules, thereby enhancing the owners’ willingness to adopt green building technologies and facilities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
