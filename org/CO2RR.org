Constructive defect engineering has emerged as a prominent method for enhancing the performance of photocatalysts. The mechanisms of the influence of defect types, concentrations, and distributions on the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of CO2 reduction were revealed for this paper by analyzing the effects of different types of defects (e.g., metallic defects, non-metallic defects, and composite defects) on the performance of photocatalysts. There are three fundamental steps in defect engineering techniques to promote photocatalysis, namely, light absorption, charge transfer and separation, and surface-catalyzed reactions. Defect engineering has demonstrated significant potential in recent studies, particularly in enhancing the light-harvesting, charge separation, and adsorption properties of semiconductor photocatalysts for reducing processes like carbon dioxide reduction. Furthermore, this paper discusses the optimization method used in defect modulation strategy to offer theoretical guidance and an experimental foundation for designing and preparing efficient and stable photocatalysts.

In this study, a comprehensive theoretical analysis was undertaken to elucidate the remarkably efficient conversion of CO2 into HCOO– employing a coordination polymer featuring Pb–S bonds, namely [Pb(tadt)]n (where tadt stands for 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-dithiolate), referred to as KGF-9. The catalytic activity of this visible-light responsive solid photocatalyst has been carefully compared with that of PbS, a typical compound that also contains the Pb–S bond. The former shows a very high catalytic activity, while the latter shows almost no activity. The photoreduction process of CO2 on the KGF-9 surface was analyzed in detail using periodic density functional theory calculations. The reduced catalyst surface was modeled as a hydrogenated surface. The reaction at the active center of a formate dehydrogenase provides an interesting contrast, suggesting that the S–H group plays an important role in the conversion of CO2 to HCOO–. However, the S–H group on the reduced PbS surface does not facilitate the conversion to the same extent as KGF-9. This is because the electrons supplied to CO2 on the PbS surface come from deep within the solid, whereas on KGF-9, they come from the top surface. This difference is due to differences in the electronic structure of the S–H bond, band gap, and valence band maximum position between the two surfaces, accounting for the marked difference in their catalytic activity. These insights are consistent with experimental and computational results on the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the CO2 reduction reaction of KGF-9 and PbS, and provide guidance for the design of CO2 photoreduction catalysts.

Silver is one of the most studied electrode materials for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, a product with many industrial applications. There is a growing number of reports in which silver is implemented in gas diffusion electrodes as part of a large-scale device to develop commercially relevant technology. Electrochemical models are expected to guide the design and operation toward cost-efficient devices. Despite decades of investigations, there are still uncertainties in the way this reaction should be modeled due to the absence of scientific consensus regarding the reaction mechanism and the nature of the rate-determining step. We review previously reported studies to draw converging conclusions on the value of the Tafel slope and existing species at the electrode surface. We also list conflicting experimental observations and provide leads to tackling these remaining questions.

Long-chain hydrocarbons and oxygenates are used as fuels as well as in many daily applications. The majority of these molecules are derived from fossil fuels, which is a non-renewable commodity. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has been recently found promising in producing C4+ molecules. Herein, we summarize recent works on this topic. The design of C4+ -producing catalysts is compared with those that produce C1-C3 products. Mechanisms for the C–C coupling step are reviewed.

This study investigates the utilisation of organometallic network frameworks composed of fourth-period transition metals and tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ) in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed in analysing binding energies, as well as the stabilities of metal atoms within the THQ frameworks, for transition metal TM-THQs ranging from Y to Cd. The findings demonstrate how metal atoms could be effectively dispersed and held within the THQ frameworks due to sufficiently high binding energies. Most TM-THQ frameworks exhibited favourable selectivity towards CO2 reduction, except for Tc and Ru, which experienced competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and required solution environments with pH values greater than 5.716 and 8.819, respectively, to exhibit CO2RR selectivity. Notably, the primary product of Y, Ag, and Cd was HCOOH; Mo produced HCHO; Pd yielded CO; and Zr, Nb, Tc, Ru, and Rh predominantly generated CH4. Among the studied frameworks, Zr-THQ displayed values of 1.212 V and 1.043 V, corresponding to the highest limiting potential and overpotential, respectively, while other metal–organic frameworks displayed relatively low ranges of overpotentials from 0.179 V to 0.949 V. Consequently, it is predicted that the TM-THQ framework constructed using a fourth-period transition metal and tetrahydroxyquinone exhibits robust electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 catalytic activity.

Renewable and nuclear energy are seen as clean and eco-friendly substitutes for energy derived from fossil fuels. Which of the two is better, though, is still up for debate. In order to meet their combined global energy objectives and perhaps become carbon neutral or even carbon negative in the near future, a shift to additional renewable energy sources and nuclear energy will be necessary. One such method of improving energy usage through the implementation of a renewable energy management system (REMS) that will help attain a continuous and reliable source of energy, allowing for the proactive and effective management of renewable assets and dependable supply. This article investigates attitudes and opinions about nuclear and renewable energy production technologies by analyzing the dependence of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on non-renewable energy sources, renewable energy sources, and nuclear energy in the group of twenty (G20) countries, over the period from 2000 to 2021. This study employs advanced panel data econometric techniques in the presence of outliers in the G20 dataset, utilizing a random coefficient regression (RCR) model via the robust M-estimation approach to study the impacts of non-renewable, renewable, and nuclear energy use with respect to CO2 emission mitigation in G20 countries. The overall conclusions of the econometric analysis confirm renewable and nuclear energy's importance in reducing CO2 emissions. The findings indicate that energy derived from renewable sources reduces CO2 emissions. Total energy consumption, on the other hand, increases CO2 emissions in the long run. Furthermore, the findings pinpoint that nuclear energy greatly cuts CO2 emissions in all G20 countries. According to these findings, it is pivotal for the G20 countries to increase nuclear energy use and employ REMS to reduce the majority of G20 countries' reliance on fossil fuels in order to minimize CO2 emissions.

In this study, we experimentally screen a promising class of intermetallic alloys for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 toward hydrocarbon products. Based on previous DFT-based screening papers, combinations of strongly CO-binding metals such as iron, cobalt, and nickel with weakly CO-binding metals such as gallium, aluminium or zinc were selected as potentially promising catalytic materials. Despite the challenging production of these alloys, we report a general two-step synthesis method for intermetallic alloys and discuss the specific synthesis conditions that must be taken into account when synthesising these materials. After their synthesis, we use a recently developed differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) setup to rapidly quantify the CO2 reduction products over a range of potentials. Almost all newly developed intermetallic catalysts are shown to produce methane and ethylene, while the CoSn catalyst showed higher selectivity towards formate production. However, all tested catalysts mostly produced hydrogen and only reduce CO2 to a small extent, despite the favourable computational screening results. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy and outline a more holistic approach for linking future DFT studies with experiments.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) offers a pathway to produce valuable chemical fuels from CO2. However, its efficiency in aqueous electrolytes is hindered by the concurrent H2 evolution reaction (HER), which takes place at similar potentials. While the influence of cations on this process has been extensively studied, the influence of anions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study how eCO2RR selectivity and activity on a gold catalyst are affected by a wide range of inorganic and carboxylate anions. We utilize in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) for real-time product monitoring, coupled with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show, that anions significantly impact eCO2RR kinetics and eCO2RR selectivity. MD simulations reveal a new descriptor – free energy of anion physisorption – where weakly adsorbing anions enable favorable CO2 reduction kinetics. By leveraging these fundamental insights, we identify propionate as the most promising anion, achieving nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency while showing high CO production rates that are comparable to those in bicarbonate. These insights underscore the vital role of anion selection in achieving highly efficient eCO2RR in aqueous electrolytes.

The catalytic role of hydride intermediate in the CO2 reduction to formate (HCOO−) by NiII-NHC complexes is investigated in detail by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that a NiII-hydride is sufficiently hydridic to facilitate the efficient transfer of hydride to the carbon center of CO2, leading to the HCOO− production. Importantly, the direct hydride transfer path proposed here bypasses the conventional CO2 insertion into a metal-hydride bond. This mechanism is elucidated through a detailed analysis of the free energy changes of the reaction and the activation barriers, where key parameters such as reduction potentials, pKa values, and the thermodynamics of hydride transfer are thoroughly evaluated. The thermodynamic hydricity of the NiII-hydride, calculated to be ΔGH− = 19.2 kcal/mol, is in sharp contrast with the less effective NiIII-hydride with ΔGH− = 52.4 kcal/mol, highlighting the enhanced reactivity of NiII-hydride in HCOO− formation. Additionally, an examination of the competitive formation of CO and H2 reveals the preferential tendency of NiII-hydride to produce HCOO− over these byproducts. Insights into the influence of the pKa for the proton source on the feasibility of H2 production and HCOO− selectivity are also provided, suggesting a way to optimize reaction conditions for improved selectivity and efficiency. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the CO2 reduction to HCOO− by NiII-NHC catalysts, emphasizing the direct hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical CO2 insertion mechanism.

The imperative reduction of carbon dioxide into valuable fuels stands as a crucial step in the transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Perovskite oxides, with their high compositional and property adjustability, emerge as promising catalysts for this purpose, whether employed independently or as a supporting matrix for other active metals. In this study, an A-site-deficient La0.9FeO3 perovskite underwent surface decoration with Ni, Cu or Ni + Cu via a citric acid-templated wet impregnation method. Following extensive characterization through XRD, N2 physisorption, H2-TPR, SEM-EDX, HAADF STEM-EDX mapping, CO2-TPD and XPS, the prepared powders underwent reduction under diluted H2 to yield metallic nanoparticles (NPs). The prepared catalysts were then evaluated for CO2 reduction in a CO2/H2 = 1/4 mixture. The deposition of Ni or Cu NPs on the perovskite support significantly enhanced the conversion of CO2, achieving a 50% conversion rate at 500 °C, albeit resulting in only CO as the final product. Notably, the catalyst featuring Ni-Cu co-deposition outperformed in the intermediate temperature range, exhibiting high selectivity for CH4 production around 350 °C. For this latter catalyst, a synergistic effect of the metal–support interaction was evidenced by H2-TPR and CO2-TPD experiments as well as a better nanoparticle dispersion. A remarkable stability in a 20 h time-span was also demonstrated for all catalysts, especially the one with Ni-Cu co-deposition.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals has been considered as a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming. Iron porphyrins have been extensively studied for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and are well documented to promote CO2-to-CO conversion. However, the mechanism of CO2-to-HCOO- conversion by Fe porphyrin remains unclear. Here, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigated the detailed mechanism of a novel Fe porphyrin catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO- in its Fe(I) state. Our results demonstrated that the reduction of CO2 to HCOO- proceeds through the C-protonation of an FeII-OCO·- complex rather than through the hydrolysis of an FeIII-COOH complex or CO2 insertion in an Fe-H bond. Moreover, the FeIII-COOH complex is not a stable intermediate. The protonation of its hydroxyl group with concomitant C-OH bond cleavage to produce CO is thermodynamically and kinetically unfeasible. Instead, the FeIII-COOH complex can undergo a coordination switch followed by a conformational change to form the active FeII-OCO·- complex for production of HCOO-. Moreover, the single-electron reduction of FeIII-COOH gives FeII-COOH, which leads to formation of CO rather than HCOO-. The insights gained from this work may be useful for designing the electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction to formate.

Plasma technology has emerged as a very helpful tool in a variety of sectors, notably metallurgy. Innovators and scientists are focused on the problem of finding a more ecologically friendly way of extracting titanium and iron metal from natural ilmenite concentrate for industrial applications. A direct current (DC) plasma torch operating at atmospheric pressure is used in this study to describe a decarbonization process for reducing an ilmenite concentrate. The plasma gases employed in this torch are CO2 and CH4. The molar ratio of the gases may be crucial for achieving a satisfactory reduction of the ilmenite concentrate. As a result, two molar ratios for CO2/CH4 have been chosen: 1:1 and 2:1. During torch operation, a thin layer of graphite is formed on the cathode to establish a protective barrier, prolonging the cathode’s life. The material was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The output gases were analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS). In addition, a thermodynamic analysis was performed to predict the development of thermodynamically stable phases. An economic assessment (including capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX)) and a carbon balance were developed with the feasibility of the piloting in mind.

Photobiocatalytic CO2 reduction represents an attractive approach for conversion of solar light and abundant resources to value-added chemicals. However, the design of suitable systems requires a detailed understanding of the interaction between artificial photosensitizer and biocatalyst interface. In this work, we investigate the effect of surfactant charge utilized in the preparation of a phenoxazine-based organic molecule nanorods photosensitizer on the interaction with the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase II from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans within biohybrid assemblies for photobiocatalytic CO2 reduction into CO. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay in pair with cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and detailed physicochemical characterization are conducted to understand the interaction at the biohybrid interface in order to suggest the strategy for future functionalization of nanoparticles that fulfill the needs from biocatalyst for green fuel production.

The bifunctional CO‐dehydrogenase/acetyl‐CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl‐moiety and CoA to acetyl‐CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. Here, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket‐brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.

We have established a correlation between photocatalytic activity and dynamic structure/bond evolutions of BiOIO3‐based photocatalysts during CO2 reduction by combining operando X‐ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy. More specifically, the selective photo‐deposition of PtOx species on BiOIO3 (010) facets could effectively promote the electron enrichment on Bi active sites of (100) facets for facilitating the adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of Bi sites with high oxidation state and the shrink of crystalline structures. With introducing light irradiation to drive CO2 reduction, the Bi active sites with high oxidation states transformed into normal Bi3+ state, accompanying with the expansion of crystalline structures. Owing to the dynamic structure, bond, and chemical‐state evolutions, a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity for CO evolution has been achieved on PtOx‐BiOIO3 (195.0 μmol g‐1•h‐1), much higher than the pristine (61.9 μmol g‐1•h‐1) as well as metal‐Pt decorated BiOIO3 (70.3 μmol g‐1•h‐1) samples. This work provides new insights to correlate the intrinsically dynamic structure/bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity, which may help to guide future photocatalyst design.

Ni/CeO2 catalysts were synthesized to evaluate the effect of varying Ni concentration on the CeO2 structure, studying their structural and catalytic properties in the conversion of CO2 to CH4. The impact of Ni concentration on the Ni/CeO2 catalyst properties was evaluated by TG-DTA-DTG, FTIR, XRD, nitrogen physisorption, SEM, and TEM-EDS analyses. XPS analyses of Ce 3d, Ni 2p, and O 1s were conducted to understand the surface structural organization of these catalysts. In situ monitoring followed by Quick-XAS during activation was performed to obtain results on chemical species that may coexist in the catalytic reduction process and evaluate the performance of each catalyst in the reduction process. Ni-O-Ce solid solutions were identified by MCR-ALS analysis, and their importance in CO2 methanation was discussed throughout this work. The catalytic activity of catalysts with a balanced phase between Ni-O-Ce solid solutions and Ni0 metallic area proved more efficient.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low‐carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in‐situ chemical bath deposition (named as c‐CdS/a‐Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c‐CdS/a‐Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (>90%) under a wide potential window of 1.0 V, with the highest value reaching ~100% at the applied potential ranging from −2.16 V to −2.46 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c‐CdS/CP and c‐CdS/c‐Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7 mA cm−2 at −2.76 V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c‐CdS/a‐Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three‐dimensional structure and the introduction of a‐Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to HCOOH is one of the most feasible and economical methods to achieve carbon neutrality. Bismuth (Bi), as a metal catalyst for CO2RR, is considered to have great potential for application and has been widely studied due to its high formate selectivity, low toxicity, cheapness, and abundance. Unfortunately, low current density and short electrode lifetime have hindered its progress towards practical applications. In this work, we present a method that enables the chemical etching of Bi on Cu, which is capable of spontaneously accomplishing the loading of Bi on Cu foam in the liquid phase at room temperature. Additionally, to provide more abundant catalytically active sites, twisted Bi nanowires (BiNWs) with lattice dislocations were successfully prepared on the surface of Cu foam using a three-step chemical method involving oxidation, reduction, and in-situ etching. The Cu Foam@BiNWs was found to be a highly active electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to formate at a low applied potential, achieving a faradaic efficiency for formate (FEFormate) of 95 % and a formate partial current density of ∼ 12 mA cm−2 at −0.78 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). Even within such a wide potential window of −0.68 ∼ -1.08 V vs. RHE, the FEFormate is consistently above 90 %. Such exceptional CO2 reduction activity can be attributed to the distortions and lattice dislocations present in the surface BiNWs. Furthermore, the Cu Foam@BiNWs electrode demonstrated a total current density close to 100 mA cm−2 at −0.98 V in an alkaline flow cell, while maintaining excellent catalytic stability over a prolonged 30-hour period of high current density electrochemical activity, thus showing potential for advancing the industrialisation of formate production. This work emphasizes the crucial role of size-dependent catalysis and crystal defect engineering strategies in the field of electrocatalysis, elucidates the mechanism of the rate-determining step (RDS) in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process on the developed catalysts, which can provide valuable insights into the design and development of high performance electrocatalysts not only in CO2RR but also in other fields.

The rational design of copper (Cu)-based catalysts with different oxidation states is essential to achieve highly selective and efficient CO2 electroreduction. However, the effect of different oxide states of Cu-based catalysts has rarely been studied. Herein, the reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation into CO on Cu-based catalysts with different oxidation states, such as Cu(1 1 1), Cu2O(1 1 1) and CuO(1 1 1), was studied using the density functional theory. The most favored pathway for CO production and the rate-controlling step on the three catalyst models were determined. The results show that, Cu2O (1 1 1) shows the best catalytic activity among the three catalysts due to the lowest activation barrier. The electronic structure analysis shows that Cu2O has the proper electronic structure to activate CO2 which is further reduced to CO. This work provides an important insight on the effect of oxidation state of Cu-based catalysts on the reduction of CO2 to CO.

Bipolar membranes (BPM) are a special class of ion-exchange membranes constituted by a cation- and an anion-exchange layer, allowing the generation of protons and hydroxide ions via water dissociation. This unique feature makes them useful in a wide range of application. In this work, we have fabricated a novel BPM, with SnO2 hollow spheres used as water dissociation catalyst. Such fabricated BPM has been served as a diaphragm to construct a three-chamber electrolyzer for CO2 electro-reduction to CO in organic electrolyte. During the long-term electrolysis process, the cathodic current density has reached to ∼96.5 mA·cm-2, with the Faraday efficiency of CO stabled at ∼92.6%. Compared with widely used commercial BPM, as-prepared BPM exhibited many advantages, such as lower hydrolysis over-potential, high catalytic efficiency and low total resistance. This technology extends the prospect of BPM application in the field of CO2 reduction.

Membrane reactor processes can be used to overcome the constraints of the chemical rate equilibrium of methanol (MeOH) synthesis products. In this thermodynamics-limited work, three different selective sulfonated poly(ether ether ketones) (SPEEK) membranes were applied in an engineered unit operation with a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 surface catalyst for several CO2/CO-involving chemistries. A detailed mathematical model with micro-kinetics was developed, optimised and utilised to assess the vessel with barrier by using CERRES (Chemical Reaction and Reactor Engineering Simulations). Scaled separation tests were described by the integrated reference values of permeance. The permeability for all compound molecules (H2, H2O, CO, CO2, MeOH…) was determined by adjusting parameters to account for the experimental gas composition on the permeate, interface and retention segment side after reduction. The specific kinetic characteristics of the mechanism of elementary step reactions were analysed in fixed bed design. A comparison of the estimated data prediction for the packed system with related definite numbers showed excellent statistical agreement. Similarly, a very good reliability was obtained between the results for 3 SPEEK membrane cases. Thus, the defined particular evaluations of derived theoretical expressions were benchmarked accurately. Although (validated) performance, i.e. the yield of MeOH, was overestimated, discrepancy was not so large so as to simulate behaviour verily. The (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (polyamide) over a SPEEK layer performed best for intensification. Herein, the pressurised (>50 bar) CO2 hydrogenation pathway was not only shifted by in situ removal as a proof of concept, but also modelled intrinsically, considering transport phenomena resistances, adsorption and desorption as well. The storage of hydrogen can benefit from MeOH production reengineering.

Catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO via reverse water-gas shift reaction on Ni-based catalysts is challenging due to the competing methanation reaction. In this work, the reduction of CO2 toward CO and CH4 has been studied by density functional theory calculation and microkinetic simulations on Ni(211) and Ag@Ni(211) surfaces. On both surfaces, direct CO2 dissociation is more favorable over formate and carboxyl pathways toward CO, and direct CO dissociation is the major pathway toward CH4. The presence of Ag shifts the d-band center of adjacent Ni atoms away from the Fermi level, resulting in reduced affinity to CO2/CO/intermediates and slightly increased barriers for most elementary steps. In particular, the apparent barrier for direct CO2 dissociation is slightly reduced by ∼0.1 eV while direct CO dissociation is strongly inhibited by ∼0.3 eV along the reaction coordinate, leading to CO as the predominant product on Ag@Ni(211), which agrees well with the experimental results.

A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin‐2’‐one‐1,2,3‐triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2‐diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue‐green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475 nm (ε = 4500 M‐1cm‐1), which is assigned to the metal‐to‐ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin‐2’‐one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo‐driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo‐driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)‐porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge‐accumulation properties, the non‐innocent benzoquinoxalin‐2‐one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)‐based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

Simple, large-scale synthesis of metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) is limited by the aggregation of metal atoms on the support material surface. The N atoms in small organic ligands (SOLs) can anchor single metal atoms, affording abundant surface-active sites. In this study, we investigated the effect of the nitrogen/carbon ratio (N/C) in SOLs on the properties of the resultant Ni single-atom confined nitrogen-doped carbon black (Ni-NCB). The N/C ratio affected the thermal stability of Ni-NCB_N/Cs during carbonization, and the optimal Ni-NCB (Ni-NCB_0.5) was synthesized with the SOL 2-methylimidazole. Ni-NCB_0.5 achieved a CO partial current density of > 500 mA cm–2 and high CO Faradaic efficiency (96.4%) in the CO2 reduction reaction. The 3- and 4-cell stack systems with Ni-NCB_0.5 (25 cm2 area per unit cell) exhibited an overall current of 10 A, high CO selectivity (> 96.0%), and long-term stability (50 h). This synthetic strategy for SACs can be commercialized and even extended to other industrial electrocatalysts.

Sulfidogenesis is a promising technology for the selective recovery of chalcophile bulk metals (e.g. Cu, Zn, and Co) from metal-contaminated waters such as acid mine drainage (AMD) and metallurgy waste streams. The use of elemental sulfur (S0) instead of sulfate (SO42-) as electron acceptor reduces electron donor requirements four-fold, lowering process costs, and expands the range of operating conditions to more acidic pH. We previously reported autotrophic S0 reduction using an industrial mesophilic granular sludge as inoculum under thermoacidophilic conditions. Here, we examined the effect of pH on the S0 reduction performance of the same inoculum, in a continuously fed gas-lift reactor run at 30 C under neutral (pH 6.9) and acidic (pH 3.8) conditions. Steady-state volumetric sulfide production rates (VSPR) dropped 2.3-fold upon transition to acidic pH, from 1.79 g L-1 d-1 S2- to 0.71 g L-1 d-1 S2- Microbial community analysis via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that at pH 6.9, the S0-reducing genera Sulfurospirillum, Sulfurovum, Desulfurella, and Desulfovibrio were present at the highest relative abundance, while at pH 3.9 Desulfurella dominated the sequenced reads. The detection of acetic acid and the relative abundance of Acetobacterium at pH 6.9 pointed towards acetogenesis, explaining the dominance of the heterotrophic genus Sulfurospirillum in this H2 and CO2-fed bioreactor.

The liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry stands at the cusp of a transformation driven by the climate imperative. Focussing on the Middle Arm Industrial Precinct, this paper shows how carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are being reduced in a proposed world-class LNG project by assessing, screening and selecting known technologies using a Marginal Abatement philosophy linked to key emissions drivers. (1) We propose a new breed of electrified LNG facilities that could deliver an up to 90% reduction in CO2 intensity. (2) We show that through developing strategic partnerships in upstream renewable power, hydrogen supply, and enabled downstream carbon capture and storage (CCS), the significant low carbon energy requirements of an LNG facility can be delivered. (3) We discuss a Marginal Abatement assessment strategy which ensures a pathway to viable lowest cost opportunities selected in an ‘Avoid & Mitigate’ first approach. This proposed strategy ensures that CO2 emission reduction opportunities are assessed and selected consistently to determine both a lifecycle cost ($) and volume (tons CO2e) of emission reduction. These innovative strategies collectively articulate a roadmap for a low carbon future for LNG and other heavy industrial industries, underlining Australia’s potential to become a leading provider of low-carbon natural resources.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is critical in Australia for future production of lower-carbon natural gas for domestic use and international export. There may also be targeted applications in other sectors, such as electricity, industrial heat generation and manufacturing, but only a small portion of the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are likely to be addressed with carbon capture. That leaves significant CO2 storage potential untapped. Wood Mackenzie’s analysis suggests that Australia’s CCS opportunity lies less in the reduction of domestic emissions, and more in enabling other countries’ net zero ambitions. This involves building hubs to transport and store CO2 at scale, using Australia’s vast geological resources. Such hubs are major capital projects and typically require billions of dollars of investment. However, supporting CO2 storage hubs with public funding may feel like a bitter policy pill to swallow, if there is not a large Australian emissions reduction number on the other side of it. So, why should Australia put its money towards this, and fast? In this paper, we will size the economic opportunity, benchmark Australia’s competitiveness with other aspiring hubs in the region and assess the amount of investment and policies required to get there.

The cement industry accounts for 8% of global energy- and process-related greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve global net-zero emission targets by 2050, the need for commercially ready low-carbon construction materials is becoming increasingly urgent. The fixation of captured carbon dioxide in concrete through CO₂ sequestration is a crucial area of study to reduce concrete embodied carbon. This paper discusses the development of a low-carbon ready-mix concrete (RMC) with aqueous CO2 sequestration, and the synergy between carbon dioxide and other constituent materials. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated through mineralogical composition analysis using TGA, and the mechanical and rheological properties of various concrete mixes were studied. Aqueous CO2 sequestration using carbonated mixing water can stably fix up to 0.84% of CO2 by weight of cement within the cement matrix as CaCO3. The poor workability and incompatibility with GGBS that results from this approach were addressed by the inclusion of RCA as an external source of alkalinity and lubrication. This mix of low-carbon RMC has similar strength and rheological properties to conventional RMC and achieved an embodied carbon reduction of approximately 47%.

The paper analyses European trends in reducing emissions of harmful substances and carbon dioxide. Today, the problem of increasing CO2 is an acute one, and thus the task of decarbonising the planet is an important task for the global community. Along with this, the negative impact of other pollutants, such as NOx and SO2, on the environmental situation in Ukraine and the world as a whole is also important.In order to reduce the amount of polluting gases in the air of Ukraine, it was decided to turn to the experience and practice of the European Union (EU) countries and analyse what has already been done, as well as what is planned to be done in this direction in the coming decades. To this end, we analysed the actual data on the reduction of CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions by European countries and compared their plans for further emission reductions in the coming years.The theoretical data of the study on the actual reduction of air pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions by European countries, as well as their plans for further reduction of these emissions, are of practical importance, as they show global trends in this problem of global importance and should be applied in all future energy plans both in Ukraine and other countries where this is not taken into account. Therefore, an effective and scientifically based plan for energy saving, clean energy production, and diversification of energy resources is needed to accelerate the transition to clean energy, increase energy independence from unreliable suppliers and unstable supplies of imported fossil fuels (in particular, accelerated phase-out of russian fossil fuels by 2030, which are used by the aggressor as an economic and political weapon), and help solve the climate crisis.

Aerobic composting acknowledged as a crucial technology in the management of food waste, offers a potential approach to sustainable production practices by producing top-notch organic fertilizers and soil conditioners. Nevertheless, the natural process of composting contributes to environmental pollution by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. This study examines the effectiveness of adding calcium peroxide to the composting process to improve the availability of oxygen, reduce CO2 emissions, and enhance the quality of the final products. The study involved conducting experimental trials using different doses of calcium peroxide (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) to evaluate its effect on reducing CO2 levels. The results demonstrate a substantial decrease in CO2 emissions, where concentrations of 20% lead to a reduction of 36.82%while in 5%, 10%, and 15% the reductions were 19.15%,26.36%, and 36.32%, respectively. In addition, the inclusion of calcium peroxide raises the pH of food waste samples and introduces calcium ions (Ca2+) into the end product. The results emphasize the significance of dealing with carbon emissions in composting procedures to adhere to Sustainable Development Goals 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 13 (climate action), thus progressing towards more sustainable waste management techniques.

Increased world energy demand due to population and rapid technological growth, and urbanisation has induced climatic change through increased atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration, of which the atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies have been identified as the pertinent pathway towards the reduction of this GHG. These CDRs serve as an adaptation and mitigation approach to abate the impacts of climate change. Different CDR strategies are encapsulated in the term Carbon sequestration, describing natural and technological approaches by which carbon dioxide (CO2) is removed from the atmosphere. Technologically, Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) is a CDR strategy that encompasses both carbon capture and storage (CSS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies. Its developmental pathways and implementation depend on understanding the natural carbon source and sink contained in the natural carbon cycle and CO2 capture technology. CCS technologies capture CO2 from large point sources, mainly power plants and industrial processes and store it in underground geological formations that include the deep saline aquifer, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, unminable coal seams and oceanic basaltic formations. The captured CO2 is also stored through in-situ mineral carbonation and direct ocean injection. Other processes that enhance CO2 removal include ocean fertilisation, ocean alkalinity enhancement and marine/terrestrial photosynthetic conversion, which stores CO2 in the pedosphere or surface ocean relative to natural carbon sequestration. CCU is a CCS complimentary technology that converts the captured CO2 into value-added products through CO2- ex-situ mineralization, value-added storage (enhanced oil/gas recovery, enhanced geothermal system, and enhanced coalbed/shale gas recovery) and CO2- chemical feedstock and biofuels. At present, there is no CCUS project in Nigeria. However, different preliminary site characterisation studies have been carried out for CCUS project development, which is being delayed by a lack of funding, robust policies, and public awareness.

The urban residential building footprint is expected to increase four-fold during 2020-2050 in the Indo-Gangetic Plains region of India. The business-as-usual construction technology of RCC frame with solid burnt clay brick as the walling material use large quantities of steel, concrete and solid brick and is highly resource and carbon intensive. The region produces 110-140 billion solid burnt clay bricks per year. Brick production is associated with large energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission, air pollution and degradation of agricultural land. The study presents an innovative new burnt clay product – vertically cored interlocking burnt clay block that is being manufactured by a brick manufacturer in the region. The study presents the results of the life cycle analysis (as per EN 15804) and quantifies reductions in carbon and resource consumption for the product and the building element (wall). The analysis is based on the data collected from the industry. The cradle to gate analysis shows a reduction of 31% in the CO2 emissions (kgCO2/m3 of burnt product) and 58% in soil consumption (m3 of soil/m3 of burnt product) for the vertically cored hollow block. A 150 mm thick wall made of vertically cored hollow block results in 55% reduction in the CO2 emissions (kgCO2/m2 of wall) when compared to a 230 mm thick wall of solid brick. In addition, the cement consumption in mortar reduces by 66% and sand consumption by 62% per m2 of wall area. The study further indicates a significant reduction in concrete and steel consumption by extending the analysis to the building level.

Pig farmhouses face unprecedented challenges in meeting the growing demand to feed an increasing population. To do so, these farms contribute significantly to the production of approximately 35 % of the world's NH3 emissions, a highly harmful air pollutant. In response to this critical environmental issue, the CO2 Management Pig Slurry Strategy (CO2-MPS) proposes an innovative solution to mitigate NH3 emissions by leveraging the biogenic CO2 produced within pig farmhouses. This groundbreaking Carbon Dioxide Utilization (CDU) approach based on utilizing this biogenic CO2 to form a protective blanket over pig manure lagoons promises the reduction of over 8 million metric tons of NH3 emissions annually. Such NH3 emissions are well-documented initiators of Particulate Matter, particularly PM2.5, highlighting the potential positive impact on air quality of this strategy.

Methane pyrolysis and water electrolysis offer alternative hydrogen pathways to methane reforming that utilise renewable power and avoid generating carbon dioxide (CO2). On a scope 1 and 2 basis, both technologies have the potential to generate carbon neutral emethanol fuel when combined with biogenic CO2. However, pyrolysis requires significantly less energy and has a lower capital expenditure (CAPEX). Being a more nascent technology, it also has upside potential for cost reductions and valorisation of the solid carbon by-product can yield lower hydrogen costs than the incumbent technology, however, limited demand from existing markets is a potential constraint. Industry decarbonisation is constrained due to a lack of available renewables and hydrogen infrastructure. Pyrolysis offers a potential cost-effective use of the available renewable assets in the early stages while the carbon by-product is not a constraint and until sufficient renewable infrastructure is in place to support water electrolysis at a cost-effective scale.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is central to clean energy transition. Globally, potential aggregated carbon dioxide (CO2) storage resource capacity is ~13,000 billion tonnes. Assuming global greenhouse gas emissions of 51 billion tonnes per annum, CO2 storage capacity equates to 250 years of global emissions reduction. While there is significant momentum to deploy CCS technology for meeting Paris Agreement targets, the key challenge for offering CCS to all industrial sectors is that many major CO2 emission sources are located hundreds of kilometres away from geological storage sites. To address this key challenge, there is a need to develop a long-distance and large-scale CCS value chain that utilises liquefied CO2 (LCO2) ship transportation. This paper discusses key technical, commercial, and regulatory considerations that must be addressed in parallel for developing such a CCS value chain. More specifically, it will cover the following: (1) technical – CO2 liquefaction condition, CO2 supply specification and LCO2 ship parcel size; (2) commercial – business model (ownership of CO2 retained by emitters or transferred to CCS project proponent), CO2 supply or CCS facility lease terms and conditions; and (3) regulatory – domestic versus transboundary projects and associated needs for policy and legislative underpinning.

The urban carbon footprint (UCF) is an important tool for assessing an organization’s ecological impacts and in guiding sustainability efforts. This calculation is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq). Calculations provide important data to determine strategies to reduce the carbon footprint and establish sustainability targets. Various standards and protocols guide UCF calculation, and many organizations aim to make these data transparent to their stakeholders and the public. This study aims to calculate the UCF of Sarıçam Municipality (SM) in the Adana Province of Türkiye. This study includes the greenhouse gas emission inventories resulting from all activities of the SM main service building, guest house, construction site service building, Cultural Center service building, and additional service buildings between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022. The calculations include generator fuel consumption, electricity consumption, the refrigerant gas leaks and refills resulting from these activities, the fuel consumed in vehicles owned by the company or whose fuel consumption is under company control, emissions originating from personal travel, emissions originating from customers and visitors, emissions originating from business travel, purchases, etc. Emissions from products purchased and emissions from waste transportation are included. The findings show that, in 2022, the total UCF of SM was equal to 10,862.46 tons of CO2-eq. The Paris Agreement aims to reduce the per capita emissions to approximately two tons of CO2-eq by 2030. The carbon footprint per employee within the municipality was calculated at 12.43 tons of CO2-eq, as derived from the analyzed data. The results reveal the importance of implementing sustainable practices and strategies within SM, such as energy efficiency measures, waste reduction, and the adoption of renewable energy sources, to mitigate its carbon footprint. This study plans to provide a basis for SM’s reduction efforts by keeping greenhouse gas emissions under control.

Abstract We study Japan’s net-zero emissions target by 2050 in a multi-model framework, focusing on residual emissions and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Four energy-economic and integrated assessment models show similar but stronger strategies for the net-zero target, compared to the previous, low-carbon policy target (80% emissions reduction). Results indicate that around 90% (inter-model median) of the current emissions are reduced through abatement, including improved energy efficiency and cleaner electricity and fuels. Models deploy new options such as CDR based on carbon capture and storage (CCS) (bioenergy with CCS and direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage) and hydrogen to achieve net zero. The scale of CCS-based CDR deployment reaches an inter-model median of 132Mt-CO2/yr. The median hydrogen share of final energy in 2050 increases from 0.79% to 6.9% between the low-carbon and net-zero scenarios. The CDR sensitivity analysis reveals that limiting the use of CDR significantly increases the mitigation costs for net zero. Achieving Japan’s net-zero goal will require exploring methods to reduce residual emissions, including demand-side solutions, and accelerating responsible CDR policies.

Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in disturbed tidal wetlands remain less investigated, albeit the importance of these 'blue carbon' ecosystems in mitigating climate change has been increasingly recognized. The invasion of smooth cordgrass into China's unvegetated tidal wetlands promotes the carbon sink, however little is known about the changes in NEE when the cordgrass is intensively removed. Here, two-year continuous eddy covariance measurements from Nov. 2021 to Oct. 2023 were used to examine how intensive cordgrass removal affects NEE in a cordgrass-dominated saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone of Southeast China. The results showed (a) this wetland acted as a monthly CO2 sink throughout the pre-removal year with nearly 90 % of the annual sink (−719.7 g C m−2 yr−1) in the cordgrass growing season from Apr. to Oct.; (b) the cordgrass removal turned this high-sink wetland into a weak CO2 source at an annual scale (39.0 g C m−2 yr−1), while the change of the sink was diurnally and seasonally unequal with daytime and growing season, respectively, accounting for the majority of the reduction; (c) tidal inundation exerted inhibitive effects on the response of daytime and nighttime NEE to photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature, respectively, with the changes in all-day NEE more driven by photosynthesis than ecosystem respiration. As one of the first assessments on the impacts of cordgrass removal on NEE, this study confirms the reduction in annual CO2 sink is predominantly attributed to the cordgrass removal instead of the climatic difference. This study highlights the importance of the interactive effects among phenological, meteorological, and tidal factors in regulating the seasonality of NEE and its changes along with cordgrass removal. Future longer flux measurements with extended years are needed to complement the present assessment of the cordgrass removal-induced impacts on NEE from a long-term perspective.

Abstract Stabilizing climate requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in land or ocean systems. Soil management practices can reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester atmospheric CO2 into inorganic and organic forms. However, whether soil carbon strategies represent a viable and impactful climate mitigation pathway is uncertain. A specific question concerns the role that land-management practices and soil amendments can play in realizing California’s ambition for carbon neutrality by 2045. Here we examine the carbon flux impacts of soil conservation (i.e., compost, reduced tillage, cover crop) and enhanced silicate rock weathering (EW) practices at different areal extents of implementation in cropland, grassland, and savanna in California under two climate change cases. We show that with implementation areas of 15% or 50% of private cultivated land, grassland, and savanna in California, soil conservation practices alone can contribute 〖1.4〗_0.7^2.1 % ( -〖1.8〗_(-0.9)^(-2.7) Mt CO2eq y-1) and 〖4.6〗_2.3^6.9 % (〖-6.0〗_(-3.0)^(-8.9) Mt CO2eq y-1) of the additional emissions reduction needed (beyond previous targets) to meet the 2045 net neutrality goal (-129.3 Mt CO2eq y-1), respectively, on an average annual basis, including climate uncertainty. Including EW in these scenarios increases the total contributions of management practices to 〖4.1〗_2.5^5.6 % (〖-5.2〗_(-3.2)^(-7.3) Mt CO2eq y-1) and 〖13.5〗_8.2^18.6 % (〖-17.5〗_(-10.7)^(-24.2) Mt CO2eq y-1), respectively, of this reduction. This highlights that the extent of implementation area is a major factor in determining benefits and that EW has the potential to make a real contribution to net reduction targets. Results are similar across climate cases, indicating that contemporary field data can be used to make future projections. With EW there remains mechanistic uncertainties, however, such as rock dissolution rate and environmental controls on weathering products, which require additional field research to improve understanding of the technological efficacy of this approach for California’s 2045 carbon neutrality goal.

Synthetic ammonia production sustains food production for more than half of the world’s population. Many regional ammonia plants convert all ammonia to ammonium nitrate fertiliser. With these, all carbon in the feed ends up as carbon dioxide (CO2), with around 2 tonnes of CO2 released per tonne of ammonia produced using natural gas. Conveniently, ammonia plants produce a substantial pre-concentrated CO2 stream. Ammonia plants are high-capex, long-life assets that operate for 40+ years. With the energy transition, replacing such assets is very high cost and will dramatically impact the cost of food production. Further, green energy is highly variable, leading to the need for additional supply side assets to stabilise energy supply. This paper outlines a transition approach for a 30% CO2 reduction (also a 43% case) to extend the useful life of these assets while re-using much of the plant, with the ability to turn on/off the green energy with minimal disruption for stable operation. The example plant is based on a typical 750 tpd ammonia gas Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) plant. The approach considers adding and integrating green power and biogas into this plant to reduce net reportable CO2 emissions. Methanation of CO2 has been demonstrated in several projects and is considered key in developing a transition pathway for an existing gas-based plant, extending its operational life and flexibility to operate with varying degrees of variable green energy supply. Further, whilst Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) is used in this case, the approach can be beneficially applied with methanol and other Power-to-X opportunities.

The liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector relies extensively on gas turbines for on-site power generation and to drive refrigeration compressors. They provide an efficient and reliable energy source for LNG operations in remote locations. With upcoming changes to the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia, there is an increased focus on Scope 1 emissions, so management and targeted reduction are a priority to reduce liabilities. Despite technology advancements, gas turbines remain one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in LNG production facilities. Also, in Australia, many facilities are not grid-connected, meaning that displacement of Scope 1 emissions through renewable electricity sourcing is a challenge. To develop deeper cuts in Scope 1 emissions, one solution is to deploy post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) on existing gas turbines, with the potential to reduce associated emissions by over 90%. Globally, a number of LNG facilities are already deploying CCS to permanently store reservoir CO2 from the LNG processing trains. Several Australian LNG facilities are located in close proximity to potential CO2 storage reservoirs, meaning that a coordinated approach to both reservoir and post-combustion CO2 should be considered when sizing pipelines, shipping systems and storage wells to optimise and leverage the required investment. This paper outlines the technological, economic and policy aspects of integrating both reservoir post-combustion CCS on LNG facilities, including barriers and opportunities for deployment. It will discuss new developments and enablers for CCS to be more widely deployed at LNG production sites.

Abstract The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2060. Direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) is critical for the country to meet its net-zero target given its reliance on fossil fuels and limited options for carbon dioxide removal (CDR). However, the role of DACCS in KSA’s national climate change mitigation has not been studied in the literature. In this study, we aim to understand the potential role of DACCS and the effect of its deployment timing in KSA’s transition toward its net-zero target using GCAM-KSA, which is a version of Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) with KSA split out as an individual region. We find that the annual DACCS CO2 sequestration in KSA reaches 0.28 to 0.33 Gt/yr by 2060 depending on its deployment timing. Early DACCS deployment, driven by its early and rapid cost reduction worldwide, could bring significant savings (~420 billion USD during 2020¬¬–2060) in the cost of climate change mitigation in KSA, approximately 17% reduction relative to delayed DACCS deployment. Our study suggests a strong role for KSA to proactively invest in the R&D of DACCS, initiate early DACCS deployment, and explore a broad suite of CDR options.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical component of proposed pathways to limit global warming, though considerable upscaling is required to meet emissions reduction targets. Quantifying and managing the risks of fault reactivation is a leading barrier to scaling global CCS projects from current levels of ~40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide(CO2) per year (to target levels of several gigatonnes of CO2 per year), because CO2 injection into reservoirs can result in increased pore-fluid pressure and temperature changes, which can reduce the strength of rocks and faults and induce brittle failure. This can result in induced seismicity, whilst hydraulic fracturing of seals could provide pathways for CO2 leakage. Consequently, identifying favourable geomechanical conditions (typically determined through data on pre-injection rock stress, mechanical and elastic properties, and pore-fluid pressures) to minimise deformation of reservoirs and seals represents a key challenge in the selection of safe and effective sites for CCS projects. Critically, however, such geomechanical data are typically spatially limited (i.e. restricted to wells) and mainly consist of pre-injection crustal stress orientation measurements, rather than a full 3D description of the stress tensor and related geomechanical properties. This paper reviews some key geomechanical issues and knowledge gaps (particularly those associated with data availability and limitations) that need to be understood to enable successful reservoir and seal management for CCS projects. We also highlight recent advances in multi-scale and dimensional geomechanical modelling approaches that can be used to assess sites for the secure storage of CO2 as well as other gases, including hydrogen.

Global warming has evolved into a global environmental concern. Despite the significant impact of rivers on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there remains a lack of wide quantification of emissions at high temporal resolution. This research investigated the characteristics of the CO2 exchange flux (FCO2) and CH4 exchange flux (FCH4) at the interface of water and gas, as well as the primary determinants that impact these fluxes, at both the seasonal and 24-h scales, in the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River (IMYR). FCO2 was 52.52 ± 78.26 mmol·m−2·d−1 in summer, which was higher than autumn (30.81 ± 51.24 mmol·m−2·d−1) and spring (-96.09 ± 264.31 mmol·m−2·d−1). FCH4 peaked in summer (928.45 ± 513.31 μmol·m−2·d−1) and declined in the fall (326.76 ± 576.31 μmol·m−2·d−1). The lowest FCH4 was recorded in spring (61.75 ± 190.26 μmol·m−2·d−1). Wind speed (WS) and organic carbon mineralisation were the primary determinants of FCO2 at the seasonal scale, whereas temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the primary determinants of FCH4. Monitoring FCO2 and FCH4 at night revealed higher average levels than during the day. FCO2 was regulated by levels of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total phosphorus (TP) levels over a 24-h period, whereas FCH4 was regulated by levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) and total nitrogen (TN). Throughout the majority of the time period, the IMYR river segment emits carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Due to the fact that emission patterns and driving mechanisms of riverine CO2 and CH4 differ across time scales, it is necessary to conduct more precise observations with high spatial and temporal resolution in order to acquire the most reliable data and comprehend more targeted approaches to carbon emission reduction.

The respective Federal petroleum and greenhouse-gas (GHG) storage legislation was examined in detail to understand the interactions between the technical requirements in the legislation, the overarching emissions-policy framework and the existing and likely future technical capabilities of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry. Key elements of the GHG legislation were then stress-tested using CCS project examples to determine applicability. The number of CCS projects required to meet the nation’s emission reduction targets over the next 5–25 years is high (probably between 20–40 projects of 4 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa)), but the existing 8–10 year approvals timeline provides only a maximum of 2.5 full project cycles to undertake 20–40 projects, a goal not considered possible without substantial regulatory reform. Opportunities for improvement should focus on facilitating a robust and rapid CCS project rollout and could include the following: changing the legislation to facilitate the accelerated utilisation of depleted petroleum fields to storage facilities, including allowing the progressive expansion of the awarded injection licence (IL); changing the concept of containment to emphasise carbon dioxide (CO2) plume management via assessing risk and potential impacts, not by artificial constraints into GHG permits and licences; including unitisation and combination pathways in the GHG legislation; ‘CO2 plume’ is not defined in legislation, even though the spatial location of a plume is central to numerous approvals, such as declaration of storage, demonstrating containment and all measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) programs; developing a framework to manage future CCS project interactions at a basin scale, as is undertaken in groundwater management onshore.

In the face of increasing demand for hydrogen, a feasibility study is conducted on its production by using Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), especially from wind and solar sources, with the latter preferring photovoltaic technology. The analysis performed is based on climate data for the Province of Brindisi, Apulia, Italy. The various types of electrolyzers will be analyzed, ultimately choosing the one that best suits the case study under consideration. The technical aspect of the land consumption for RER exploitation until 2050 is analyzed for the Italian case of study and for the Apulia Region. For both the 200 MW and 100 MW RER Power Plants, an economic analysis is carried out on the opportunities for using hydrogen. In the last part of the economic analysis, the trade-off between the high specific investment cost and the Capacity Factor of Wind technologies is also investigated. The results show the affordability of building high-scale Wind Farms, harnessing the existing scale economies. The lowest Hydrogen selling price is achieved by the 200 MW Wind Farms equal to 222 €/MWh against 232 €/MWh of the 200 MW Photovoltaic (PV) Farm. Finally, the feasibility analysis considers also the greenhouse gas emission reduction by including in the economic analysis the carbon dioxide (CO2) Average Auction Clearing Price leading for the 200 MW Wind Farms to a hydrogen selling price equal to 191.2 €/MWh against 201 €/MWh of the 200 MW Photovoltaic Farm.

For over 50 years Gippsland Basin Joint Venture (GBJV) has been producing oil and gas from the Gippsland Basin. Through hard work, challenging the status quo and innovation, the business, the operation and the people have been on a transformational journey. You may have heard about our conventional expansion opportunities, Kipper-Tuna-Turrum development and Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, but have you heard about how GBJV is progressing carbon dioxide (CO2) to sales with BOC and Air Liquide or how the team has reduced flare by 46% since 2018? Have you heard how the team increased Longford’s capacity by 11% in 2022 to deliver the highest gas production since 2017 to meet market demand. Or about how we are transforming the operation through our Gippsland Asset Streamlining Project, where we will no longer have a Crude Stabilisation Plant or a Gas Plant 1 at Longford? We continue to focus on our reliable gas operation through upcoming projects such as Hastings Generation Project, and Kipper Compression Project while also pursuing meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions such as South East Australia Carbon Capture and Storage Project in the Gippsland Basin. Our transformation to a ‘Modern Australian Gas Business’ has not only meant change for our facilities but also change for our people in how we work and the culture we have built. Every day, our teams work to supply essential energy to Australian homes and businesses while also being on a transformational journey to improve the sustainability of our operation and contribute to the energy transition.

Globally many countries have committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and their dependence on fossil fuels with most large emitting countries now committing to ‘net-zero’ targets sometime in the second half of this century and earlier intermediate targets in 2030. With only 6 years to go until the deadline to meet 2030 emission reduction targets, what is the verdict? How are Australian and global emission reduction projects tracking? World electricity demand in 2022 was 28,500 TWh with 39.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted in the same year as a result. The global energy mix hasn’t changed much: fossil fuel consumption as a percentage of primary energy in 2022 remained steady at 82% and in July 2023 the International Energy Agency projected 2023 oil demand to be 102.1 million barrels a day, an all-time high. This paper will take a look at decarbonisation efforts around the world and provide an overview of what was targeted in previous years and compare it with what has actually been achieved. How far are we truly on the road to decarbonisation? Are decarbonisation initiatives including carbon capture, utilisation and storage, hydrogen projects, solar and wind farms providing the intended results? Incorporating recent key regulatory initiatives from governments around the world including the US, Australia and the EU, this paper will outline progress to date and attempt to show possible paths going forward in answering the question whether it is possible to achieve the proposed emission reduction targets in 6 years.

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global economy slowdown. Sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) economy is gradually recovering from the pandemic. This study examines whether climate change variables (such as temperature, carbon dioxide emissions) and technological innovation (measured by total patent applications) can forecast the economic recovery of 19 selected countries in SSA from 2000 to 2022. We applied Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), a machine learning technique, while controlling for financial development, human capital and inflation rates. Our findings indicate that climate change exerts a negative and significant influence on SSA's economic recovery. Specifically, rise in average annual surface temperature change and carbon dioxide emissions decrease in economic recovery. An increase in average technological innovation improves in economic recovery. Inflation rate is associated with reduction in economic recovery. We discuss policy implications and mechanisms through which technological innovation and climate change affect the SSA economy, offering practical policy suggestions.

The population increase and the demand for water and energy, accompanied by the implications of environment pollution for natural and human resources, indicate the critical necessity for a coherent movement towards nexus between water, energy, and environment. Due to the fact that power generation industry is responsible for a significant proportion of water and fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emissions within the world, in this research, the application of the hybrid renewable system in a thermal power plant has been assessed based on the approach of analyzing the link between energy, water and environment. The design of the solar system and the assessment of carbon balance during the power plant lifetime have been conducted in PVsyst application in 2022. Moreover, ReCipe environmental model has been used for assessing the effect of decrease in carbon emission on the ecosystem. The findings of the research indicate that the replacement of at least 2 % of the nominal capacity of the fossil fuel power plant with the renewable one, prevents the emission of 1431.28 tons of carbon dioxide yearly. This amount equals to 380.34 cubic meters of reserve in fossil fuel consumption and 391.73 tons of crude oil. The results also showed that in addition to preserving natural resources, the hybrid cycle design leads to significant water demand reduction which equals to 3842 cubic meters with the capacity to supply underground water sources. Due to the interests of preserving water and energy resources and decreasing carbon emission in power plant industry, within the framework of nexus approach, management of energy supply by replacing resources and using water and heat recovery technologies and application of energy demand management policies based on energy efficiency and environmental implications is recommended.

Electrochemical reactions are those that occur on the surface of a charged catalyst, including carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction in total hydrolyzed water, anode fuel oxidation reaction, and cathode oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells and so on. Usually, active sites of these catalysts used in the aforementioned electrochemical reactions are noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Ru, which are limited by high cost and low reserves. In comparison, transition metals with low cost and high reserves are gradually used in these electrochemical fields, and have the potential to replace common noble metal catalytic materials. As a typical transition metal, copper is not the best choice as active site in catalysts for electrochemical reactions, but its properties offer unique characteristics in different electrochemical reactions. For example, in CO2RR process, moderate adsorption capacity of CO intermediates on Cu active site promotes the formation of a carbon-carbon bond, which will increase the proportion of multi-carbon products. In other electrochemical reactions, the use of copper can affect the electronic structure of other transition metal active sites to improve the catalytic capacity. Therefore, this chapter gives an overview of the application of copper used as active site or dopant in the field of electrochemistry.

Abstract The unavoidable and unpredictable surface reconstruction of metallic copper (Cu) during the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction process is a double‐edged sword affecting the production of high‐value‐added hydrocarbon products. It is crucial to control the surface facet reconstruction and regulate the targeted facets/facet interfaces, and further understand the mechanism between activity/selectivity and the reconstructed structure of Cu for CO 2 reduction. Based on the current catalyst design methods, a facile strategy combining chemical reduction and electro‐reduction is proposed to achieve specified Cu(111) facets and the Cu(110)/(111) interfaces in reconstructed Cu derived from cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O). The surface facet reconstruction significantly boosted the electrocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into multi‐carbon (C 2+ ) products comparing to the unmodified catalyst. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the Cu(110)/(111)s interface between Cu(110) and a small amount of Cu(111) can tailor the reaction routes and lower the reaction energy barrier of C–C coupling to ethylene (C 2 H 4 ). The work will guide the surface facets reconstruction strategy for Cu‐based CO 2 electrocatalysts, providing a promising paradigm to understand the structural variation in catalysts.

The unsustainability of conferences, whose carbon footprint is mostly made of air travel, has remained an academic taboo, even more so that virtual conferences, despite being carbon-efficient, have revealed their limitations. This concern bears an even greater significance for the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), considering its emphasis on climate change-related issues. This essay seeks to raise awareness and stimulate action within the ASLO community, building upon well-established scientific approaches. We perform an estimation of the travel-related CO2 emissions of the aquatic science meetings (2004–2023), further used as a benchmark to explore alternatives to significantly reduce emissions while retaining physical attendance. Taking the leap toward such alternatives would make ASLO a role model of a genuinely sustainable and committed scientific society. The ASLO community is firmly committed to a sustainable future, and themes of the past conferences often infer a link between aquatic systems evolution and climate change. At the latest Aquatic Sciences Meeting (ASM) in 2023, climate change and carbon-centered topics were salient themes, making up to 50% of all contributions (Fig. 1). Many keynotes were remarked on for their willingness to engage toward actions and solutions and go beyond the sole report of dangers and threats posed by climate change and other overpassed planetary limits. Taking part in international scientific conferences such as ASM makes an integrated component of our academic life. Expectations from scientific conferences are to provide an opportunity to stay informed about the latest developments, disseminate one's own research, discuss perspectives and ideas, and get inspired. Scientific conferences also foster a sense of belonging to a community and offer a social context in which to expand research networks. In line with this, academic incentives and travel support are high and on the rise (Bojica et al. 2022). Yet, scientific conferencing also generates significant CO2 emissions at the Worldwide scale. Eighty percent of the carbon footprint of international conferences is made up of air travel, with a lower estimate of roughly 1 tCO2−e (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, that is, the number of metric tons of CO2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas) emitted per attendee for transportation (Klower et al. 2020; Tao et al. 2021). If half of the 8 million worldwide academics were to take part annually in an international conference (Sarabipour et al. 2021), transporting academics to international conferences would generate a back-of-the-envelope estimate of 4 MtCO2−e, rivaling with annual emissions of countries such as Niger, Nicaragua, or Latvia (Crippa et al. 2022). Meeting the Paris Agreement to contain warming to the 1.5°C target requires that the emissions per capita fall down to 2.3 tCO2−e by 2030 (Gore 2021), while, due to their hypermobile lifestyle, the sole professional travel-related annual emissions for academics can easily reach 6 tCO2−e per capita (Ciers et al. 2019). The significance of the carbon footprint of scientific conferences has led individual academics and scientific societies to question the current model for conferencing (Malcolm 2008; Achten et al. 2013; Arsenault et al. 2019; Klower et al. 2020; Tao et al. 2021). Despite extending beyond our immediate community, this issue holds particular significance for us within the ASLO community, as we travel the World and generate such greenhouse emissions specifically to meet and devise climate-related matters and the resilience of aquatic systems. It is not the 1st time that the carbon footprint of ASLO conferences has been raised (Harazin 2020). However, we are unaware of any previous attempt to quantify the carbon footprint of ASM, although the exercise has already been undertaken for closely related scientific communities, such as the Ecological Society of America (Alexandra and Jarrett 2011) or the American Geophysical Union (Klower et al. 2020). We believe that this sizing exercise is important for two reasons. First, experience shows that even scholars working in scientific fields closely related to the issues of climate change tend to underestimate their own travel-related emissions (Whitmarsh et al. 2020; Passalacqua 2021). Second, quantifying the C-footprint of ASLO conferences is a required benchmark from which we can explore the efficiency of scenarios aimed at significantly reducing the carbon footprint of ASM while preserving its essence. Many ways are being evoked to engage in a more sustainable conferencing model (moving online or hybrid, optimizing location, setting meatless conditions; Leochico et al. 2021), in which actual efficiency in reducing emissions is rarely quantitatively assessed. Going 100% online appeared, at 1st sight, as the most straightforward way to run conferences for <5% CO2−e emissions of traditional conferences (Klower et al. 2020; Tao et al. 2021). However, our past 3-yr virtual experience has shown that it largely undermines several of the benefits we expect from conferencing and face-to-face interactions (Brucks and Levav 2022). Is there then a way-out, by which we could significantly reduce the carbon footprint of conferences while escaping the ghost of going fully online? We estimated the travel-related CO2−e emissions of ASM from 2004 to 2023, from a computational approach similar to Klower et al.'s (2020) study. Based on anonymized attendees' data for each ASM, we computed the distances between the attendees' closest airport and the main airport of the conference venues. For a 1st assessment, we assumed that all attendees flew to the conference location and used a conservative estimate (only direct flights in economy class). Computed emissions (CO2−e) included greenhouse gases produced by fuel consumption, emissions associated with extracting, refining, and transporting fuels, and changes in radiative forcing due to water vapor emissions at higher altitudes (average emission factor of 163 gCO2−e km−1). In a 2nd step, we considered that attendees within 1000 km of the conference venue used landbound-based transportation (i.e., rail, coach, or shared car, considering an average emission factor of 30 gCO2−e km−1). All conversion factors were extracted from the greenhouse gas reporting of United Kingdom (Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and Department for Business 2022). We also assessed the CO2−e emissions saved by the ASM 2023 initiative of meatless catering, considering that a meat-based and a vegetarian meal corresponds respectively to 3.07 and 0.68 kgCO2−e per capita (Takacs et al. 2022). For methodological details and reproducibility of the essay, we refer to our GitHub (see Data availability statement). Total CO2−e emissions for a 1-week ASLO conference ranged between 0.5 and 4.5 ktCO2−e over the past 20 yr, with an average value of 2.1 ktCO2−e (Fig. 2a). 56% of travel-related emissions were due to long-haul flights (>4000 km one way). The interannual variability of total emissions results from both the conference's location (Fig. 2b) and the attendance (Fig. 2c). Mean emissions per attendee were 1.3 tCO2−e, a number that is comparable with what had been estimated for international conferences of other scientific societies (Klower et al. 2020), but varied considerably depending on the venue. Islander venues generated a 53% increase of the emissions per attendee, with record emissions from conferences held in Honolulu. Finally, the delocalization of the conferences outside North America since 2006 has fulfilled the goal of ASLO to diversify the origin of attendees and increase attendance (Fig. 2c). ASM held in Europe were, on average, twice more attended than those in Northern America, and attendees from Europe or Asia preferentially attended ASM held on their own continents. As Hawaii meetings stand out in promoting the highest emission both per conference and per attendee, excluding outskirt, islander locations is an essential lever to cut-off travel-related C-emissions for ASM (Harazin 2020). However, mainland, central, well-connected locations still lead to per-capita emissions above 1 tCO2−e; that is, 46% of what we should emit within a full year by 2030. Rendering ASM sustainable will not be acquired by acting on conference location alone. Seen as an immediate lever to reduce the carbon footprint of academics, more and more universities from the North are encouraging attendees to buy carbon credits. However, we argue that relying on the purchase of carbon offsets to compensate for emissions generated by scientific conferencing cannot be considered an efficient or acceptable alternative. Carbon offset projects backed by airlines fail to remove any carbon dioxide (Greenfield 2021) and rely on overstated promises of true carbon removal (West et al. 2020). On the carbon market, 88% of the sold offsets do not constitute any emission reduction (Probst et al. 2023), and more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by the biggest certifier are worthless (West et al. 2023), to the point that the so-called carbon offset projects could even worsen climate change. Besides being counter-effective, carbon credit is a very lucrative trade that favors those who could afford to purchase such offsets while counteracting ASLO's efforts to get more inclusive. Shifting to multi-hub conferences is the structural change that we explore here. The principle of multi-hub conferences implies that meetings take place in several locations at the same time. Attendees go to their closest hub (Klower et al. 2020; Parncutt et al. 2021). Face-to-face interactions are maintained within hubs, while hubs are connected by virtual links (Parncutt et al. 2021). Using the data for ASM 2023, whereby attendance and attendees' diversity were high, we assessed the net reduction of travel-related CO2−e emissions of shifting from the traditional to a multi-hub model for ASM (Fig. 3). We compared flight paths and CO2−e emissions between the current traditional ASM model and scenarios of a two-hub model (one central location in Europe and one in North America) and a three-hub model (adding a central hub in Asia). Adding continental hubs significantly reduces the number of intercontinental flights (Fig. 3a–c). The sum of traveled distances decreases significantly as the number of hubs increases, from 22 million km flown in the traditional one-hub model down to 10 million km in the two-hub and 8 million km in the three-hub scenario, leading to a reduction of total CO2−e emissions by 52% and 65%, respectively (Fig. 3d). Multi-hubs contribute to reducing per-attendee emissions, with a more balanced share of the C-burden across the attendees' continent of origin (Fig. 3e). Promoting land-bound transportation has a rather minor impact on CO2−e in a one-hub model (<3% of total CO2−e). But with the multi-hub model, the potential benefit of promoting land-bound transportation is >10% (Fig. 3d). Serving vegetarian food has only a symbolic impact compared to travel-related emissions in a one-hub scenario. The "meatless day" at the ASM 2023 saved 11 tCO2−e, that is, 0.3% of the total emissions of the ASM 2023. In a three-hub scenario, shifting to a meatless week (−58 tCO2−e) has the potential to decrease emissions by another 5%. The IPCC is clear that limiting warming at manageable levels requires that all sectors do their share, and scientific societies make no exception. In the current academic model, we are stuck within a cognitive conundrum (Whitmarsh et al. 2020): we travel the world to present our studies on the inner causes and consequences of climate change, leading to a demonstrated undermining of our scientific credibility (Attari et al. 2016), while being part of a scientific society committed to raising public awareness on water-related environmental challenges (www.aslo.org). And yet, tackling the question of the C-footprint of conferences, and of academic activities in general, remains an uncomfortable and sensitive topic, if not a complete taboo (Higham and Font 2020; Whitmarsh et al. 2020). The traditional conferencing model is "an outdated luxury the planet cannot afford anymore" (Malcolm 2008). As shown here, low-carbon ASM will require more than a marginal fix, whereby we just avoid outskirt locations or promote carbon offsets. Here, we argue that only structural changes can lead to more sustainable conferencing. Switching to multi-hub ASLO conferences would significantly cut-off on the travel-related CO2−e emissions while maintaining efficient face-to-face scientific interactions. As multi-hub conferences develop, favoring landbound transport and serving vegetarian food also make an impactful difference, while being symbolic only in a one-hub scenario. While here we aimed only for a 1st-order demonstration of the potential of multi-hubbing, the implementation of such a model shift should come with a revision of what drives the choice of the venues, echoing concerns of Harazin (2020). The choice of the hub locations should be based on criteria oriented toward reducing the C-footprint, and more generally the environmental impact, over touristic attractiveness. For instance, an isochrone map could define optimal cities reachable by train within 10 h, thus incentivizing economic returns for cities and countries actively investing in railway transportation. Some may argue that multi-hub conferences will be challenging to organize, due to time zone differences, and difficulties in managing both online and physical communication. If indeed this would imply to revise our habits, other societies, some of size comparable to the ASLO, have already undertaken the turn (such as the American Meteorological Society in 2022 and the Royal Geographical Society in 2023), and have provided guidelines and feedbacks (Parncutt et al. 2021; Kremser et al. 2024). Those technical requirements should be an integral part of the ASLO's contract specification with conference organizing companies, many of which are currently developing capacities for multi-hubbing. Others may express concerns regarding the financial implications of adopting a multi-hub model because of the escalated demand for audio–visual equipment across diverse venues. Nonetheless, technological advancements have led to more affordable, compact, and reliable audio-visual gear. Additionally, hosting conferences in smaller hubs could potentially necessitate more modest and cheaper conference venues than those needed for the typical one-hub model. While it remains challenging to precisely gauge the financial impact of multi-hubbing at this stage, it is imperative to couple the multi-hub framework with a financial restructuring to ensure that registration fees do not increase. Engaging in a transformative turn to truly more sustainable conferences through multi-hubs has also the potential to leverage some of the well-known inequalities of traditional conferences, a central mission of the ASLO community. Conference travel opportunities are strongly inequitable (Sarabipour et al. 2021). For economic, family or time-related reasons, academics working in the developing world, and those with care responsibilities have reduced access to the privilege of conference travel, with potential disadvantages to their career development. This also appears in the presented data as scholars outside North America favor ASM within their (sub)continents, when it does not imply traveling too far. Multi-hub ASM will serve ASLO's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equality, by reducing the cost, time and C-burden associated with ASLO conferencing. The average traveling distance per attendee is cut to less than a 3rd in the three-hub model (1300 km) as compared to the traditional one-hub model (4600 km). Thereby, shall this multi-hub model be successful and lead to a rebound effect of +25% of attendance, most of the additional attendees could travel with landbound transportation, leading to a relatively low increase in CO2 emissions. Finally, our scientific credibility is challenged by our current difficulty to "walk our talk" (Attari et al. 2016) and actively engaging into a transformative model specifically targeted to reduce the C-emissions of conferences is one lever to restore public trust. Some scholars have already chosen not to attend conferences overseas (Higham and Font 2020), even at the risk of being less visible. Yet, a real transformative change implies a collective engagement and a cultural change (Whitmarsh et al. 2020), only possible if led and fostered by scientific societies. Rethinking the conference model provides an opportunity to revise what makes the success of a conference. How often do we need to attend? Is a bigger conference more effective in terms of scientific outcomes and feedbacks? Boosting symbolic capital and enjoying paid trips to nice locations are also reasons that drive frequent conference participation. How much of our perceived incentive to attend is actually a social construction rather than a real scientific benefit? ASLO has already proven its commitment to diversity and equality issues, by putting it into action through its "amplifying Voices" program. For such a strong community of academics at the forefront of climate issues, taking the leap toward committed actions for a sustainable and climate-friendly conference model would place the ASLO at the vanguard of scientific societies. This essay benefited from the suggestions of the associate editor and two reviewers. We thank Patricia Glibert, the ASLO president, and Chris Schneider, from ASLO, for providing access to the ASM data for attendance and abstracts. This study's idea came from a discussion between MEP and EK on the ferry boat on the way back from the ASM 2023.

In the contemporary tramp shipping industry, route optimization and scheduling are directly linked to enhancements in operations, economics, and the environment, making them key factors for the effective management of maritime transportation. To enhance effective ship-to-cargo matching and the refinement of maritime transportation itineraries, this paper introduces a time efficiency and carbon dioxide emission multi-objective optimization algorithm named ETE-SRSP (efficiency–time–emission multi-optimization algorithm). ETE-SRSP incorporates several factors, including the initial positions of ships, time windows for loading and unloading operations, and varying sailing speeds. Within the ETE-SRSP framework, pioneering an approach that integrates ballast and laden sailing velocities as decisional parameters, it employs a multi-objective optimization technique to investigate the intricate interplay between temporal efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the model’s proficiency in mitigating emissions and managing costs is clearly demonstrated through the optimization of these objectives, thereby offering a robust framework for decision support. The experimental results show that the optimal sailing speeds derived from the ETE-SRSP, under typical time-weight scenarios, can achieve an optimal balance between emission reduction and cost control. In summary, this study underscores the optimization strategy’s potential to effectively address the maritime sector’s need for economic growth and ecological conservation, showcasing its practical value in the industry.

Since 1999 successive Australian Commonwealth governments have provided direct funding for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects, notably the carbon capture and storage (CCS) Flagships Fund (Rudd government, 2009). The most recent CCUS Hubs and Technologies Fund (Morrison government, 2022) was later revoked (Albanese government, 2022) marking a shift from direct funding (‘carrot’) to emission reduction through a strengthening of the Safeguard Mechanism, the introduction of a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, and the establishment of the Net Zero Authority (‘stick’). Reports such as the ‘Net Zero Mobilisation Report’, have delineated the need for, and size of, the role of CCUS in Australia, especially for hard-to-abate sectors and the report states ‘private investment in a CCUS industry requires targeted government support’ i.e. funding. As government focus moves from direct funding support for CCS to CCU and direct air capture (DAC), the development of underground geological storage of carbon dioxide will be largely left to fossil fuel emitters, especially large liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies, reflected in current Western Australian government policy (Cook government, 2023) to develop CCS strategy as part of the LNG Jobs Taskforce. The only current exception is CarbonNet, operated by the Victorian government and one of the early CCS Flagship funded projects.

Abstract As a result of electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), value-added chemicals like as synthetic fuels and chemical feedstocks can be produced. In the current state of the art, copper-based materials are most widely used being the most effective catalysts for this reaction. It is still necessary to improve the reaction rate and product selectivity of CuOx for electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The main objective of this work was synthesized and evaluate the copper oxide electrocatalyst combined with silver (CuO 70% Ag 30%) for the conversion of carbon dioxide into synthetic fuels. The catalysts have been prepared by the oxalate method and assessed in a flow cell system. The results of electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature and at different potentials (-1.05 V–0.75 V vs. RHE in presence of 0.1 M KHCO 3 ) and gas and liquid chromatographic analysis are summarized. The CuOx-based electrodes demonstrated the selective of ~ 25% at -0.55 V for formic acid (HCOOH) and over CuO -Ag and selective of ethylene at ~ 20% over CuOx at -1.05 V. Other products were formed as ethylene, ethanol, and propanol (C 2 H 4 , EtOH, PrOH) at more positive potentials. On the other hand, carbon monoxide, acetate, ethylene glycol, propinaldehyde, glycoaldehyde and glyoxal (CO, CH 3 COO, C 2 H 6 O 2 , C 3 H 6 O, C 2 H 4 O 2 , C 2 H 2 O 2 ) have been formed and detected. Based on the results of these studies, it appears that the formation of synthetic fuels from CO 2 at room temperature in alkaline environment can be very promising.

Due to impedance mismatch and a single loss mechanism, carbon fiber fails to meet the requirements for efficient absorbers in terms of lightweight construction and broad absorption band. In this study, we have successfully prepared one-dimensional beaded SiO2@SiC@C nanofiber (SSCF) composites with multiple heterogeneous interfaces by employing the electrospinning-carbothermal reduction method. The beaded SSCF composites effectively address the impedance mismatch issue by controlling silicon dioxide and silicon carbide through carbothermal reduction. This optimization enriches the defects and interfaces of carbon fibers composites, consequently enhancing the electromagnetic wave absorption performance. The SSCF composites demonstrate remarkable performance, with a minimum reflection loss of -59.53 dB at a matched thickness of 2.21 mm and a maximum absorption bandwidth of 6 GHz. This outstanding performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the multi-phase composition, bead structure, and one-dimensional network structure. These features not only optimize impedance matching but also enhance defect loss, interface polarization loss (SiC/SiO2, C/SiO2, SiC/C, C/Air), conduction loss, and relaxation loss of the SSCF composites. Furthermore, radar cross-section analysis utilizing computer simulation technology confirms the excellent attenuation of microwave energy by the SSCF composites under realistic far-field conditions. This study provides valuable insights for designing efficient one-dimensional carbon-based electromagnetic wave absorbers.

Abstract Climate change has driven the need for carbon capture to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, yet current thermochemical methods are hampered by high energy intensities. Electrochemically mediated carbon capture (EMCC) utilizing redox‐active carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) carriers is an attractive alternative for carbon capture. Here, an economical vat dye compound, indigo, is presented, which can reversibly capture and release CO 2 upon electrochemical reduction and oxidation, respectively. Electrode and electrolyte engineering strategies are utilized to improve the reversibility and stability of indigo for EMCC. A bench‐scale prototypical fixed‐bed carbon capture device is constructed to demonstrate indigo's EMCC performance under various practically relevant conditions, such as simulated flue gas and extremely dilute sources pertinent to direct air capture. A hybrid sorbent electrode‐gas diffusion layer approach is revealed to alleviate CO 2 mass transport limitations, achieving ≈80% CO 2 capacity utilization under a 15% CO 2 feed stream. Furthermore, a reactive‐diffusive mass transport model is developed to illustrate engineering approaches that can be universally applied to optimize fixed‐bed EMCC systems. This work advances the potential for a class of low‐cost sorbents for EMCC while underscoring the importance of molecular, electrolyte, materials, and device engineering strategies to enable high‐performance carbon capture.

Abstract Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance in various catalytic reactions. However, the low metal loading (<1.0 wt.%) and the difficulty in precisely modulating their coordination configurations hinder the practical yield of target products and the understanding of actual reaction mechanisms. To overcome these obstacles, a series of strategies are proposed to design SACs with a precise coordination configuration and/or a high density of active sites. For an insightful and comprehensive understanding of these strategies, it is worth analyzing and categorizing them according to their intrinsic mechanisms and applicational perspectives. In this review, the synthesis strategies of precise and/or high‐density SACs are first summarized. Moreover, taking typical electrochemical processes, including oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction, metal–sulfur batteries, etc., as examples, the applications of these SACs are discussed, focusing on their advantages in enhancing the yield of target products, improving the efficiency of energy storage, and revealing the unique effects. Finally, the challenges and perspective of precise modulation and densification of metal sites for SACs are proposed. It is expected that this review can provide a useful reference for the design and preparation of high‐density and/or controllably coordinated SACs.

Developing land use strategies to optimize carbon sinks and improve carbon footprints involves proposing efficient nature-based solutions that industries and businesses can implement while considering financial and legislative constraints. The pulp and paper industry is associated with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily due to the substantial carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) footprint of its mills. Also, some forestry operations contribute to the release of carbon to the atmosphere in the form of CO 2 and methane (CH 4 ). Conversely, this industry could potentially be a significant ally in the fight against climate change by favoring forestry practices that reduce carbon emissions and increase its sequestration, namely, by adding value to industrial by-products (e.g., biosolids) instead of treating them as wastes and landfilling them. Notably, the pulp and paper industry has been seeking alternative uses of its by-products, such as fertilizers to maximize tree growth. In this paper, we identify opportunities and challenges that exist for the pulp and paper industry in regard to recycling industrial by-products to: 1) lower GHG emissions directly at the mill and 2) improve its GHG budget by increasing carbon sequestration in forests and plantations. We illustrate our analyses by describing a case study of a pulp and paper mill in southern Quebec, Canada, that uses its biosolids and other by-products as fertilizers. This case study highlights that this strategy could not only contribute to the reduction of GHGs but could also create added value and improve economic returns of forest operations.

Distillation remains the leading and most frequently adopted technique for the separation and purification of condensable mixtures in numerous industries. However, the inherently poor thermal efficiency of distillation requires a large amount of thermal energy, making it the chief factor in total process energy usage and a significant emitter of carbon dioxide due to the combustion of fossil fuels. To address this issue, electrification has arisen as a popular approach to reduce carbon emissions in different processes by primarily replacing the energy source with electricity derived from renewable energy resources. This review is designed to thoroughly explore the electrification concept in decarbonizing distillation and present a detailed analysis and summary of the cutting-edge technologies used in various distillation operations. The focus is on creating electrified distillation processes and their associated utility systems, making use of a range of power-to-heat and intensification strategies, to achieve simultaneous carbon reduction and energy savings. With the increasing variety of operating environments that incorporate renewable power, this review additionally encompasses the control and operation aspects to ensure efficient management of electrified distillation processes. To further delve into the advantages of incorporating electrification into distillation, this work proposes future directions from the viewpoints of technological advancement, design optimization, operation, and real-time scheduling of electrified distillation processes. Furthermore, this review highlights the enormous potential of electrification in dramatically lowering carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices in the distillation industry.

Low erosion high-energy propellant is one of the research directions to extend the weapon's life and improve the weapon's capability. In this study, energetic propellants containing different corrosion inhibitors were designed and prepared. Close bomb tests and semi-confined bomb experiments were used to investigate the burning and erosion properties of the propellants. The mechanism of erosion-reducing of titanium dioxide (TiO2), talc, and octaphenylsilsesquioxane (OPS) on the propellant was comparatively analyzed. The results show that OPS has the lowest burning rate and the longest burning time, and a minimized loss of fire force, with the best effect of explosion heat reduction. The erosion reduction efficiency of OPS is twice that of TiO2 and talc. The mechanism analysis shows that the decomposition and heat absorption of OPS can effectively reduce the thermal erosion effect and carbon erosion, and the gas produced can reduce the loss of chamber pressure and form a uniformly distributed nano-SiO2 protective layer. This solid-state high-efficiency organosilicon erosion inhibitor is an important guide for designing high-energy low-erosion gun propellants.

Due to the cumulative effect of the recycled flue gas in oxy-fuel combustion, the reduction of NO has become the focus of research in which the role of CO2 gasification has a nonnegligible effect. In this article, the heterogeneous gasification mechanisms of CO2 on coal char during oxy-fuel combustion were studied by density functional theory and transition-state theory. The zigzag char model and char(N) model were selected to investigate the CO2 adsorption and gratification reactions at the molecular level. By comparison, the CO2 gasification reaction is preferred to occur on the zigzag char model with a reduction in the energy barrier and an increase in the reaction rate. When considering char nitrogen conversion, the gasification reaction is more prone to releasing NO first, leading to the contraction of the aromatic ring and the generation of CO at high temperatures. Therefore, the study further highlights the promoting role of CO2 gasification on the homogeneous and heterogeneous reduction of NO, which is mainly reflected in the reduction effect of CO. Moreover, it also accelerates the consumption of coal char and NO formation, which is favorable for the reduction reactions to a certain extent.

Abstract Bismuth‐based electrocatalysts are effective for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction to formate. However, at room temperature, these materials are only available in solid state, which inevitably suffers from surface deactivation, declining current densities, and Faradaic efficiencies. Here, the formation of a liquid bismuth catalyst on the liquid gallium surface at ambient conditions is shown as its exceptional performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 (i.e., CO 2 RR). By doping a trace amount of bismuth (740 ppm atomic) in gallium liquid metal, a surface enrichment of bismuth by over 400 times (30 at%) in liquid state is obtained without atomic aggregation, achieving 98% Faradic efficiency for CO 2 conversion to formate over 80 h. Ab initio molecular simulations and density functional theory calculations reveal that bismuth atoms in the liquid state are the most energetically favorable sites for the CO 2 RR intermediates, superior to solid Bi‐sites, as well as joint GaBi‐sites. This study opens an avenue for fabricating high‐performing liquid‐state metallic catalysts that cannot be reached by elementary metals under electrocatalytic conditions.

Copper (Cu) electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) have attracted much attention due to their ability to produce high value-added C2+ products (e.g., C2H4, C2H5OH, and n-propanol). However, achieving high selectivity of Cu electrocatalysts for C2H5OH in aqueous-based electrolytes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we report Cu octahedra modified with low-coordinated Cu nanoclusters (Cu oct @Cu_NCs) as an efficient electrocatalyst for CO2RR to C2H5OH. Notably, the defect-site-rich Cu nanoclusters can promote the adsorption of *CO and increase the *CO coverage on Cu octahedra enclosed by Cu(1 1 1), thus promoting CO2RR to C2H5OH. We achieved a high Faradaic efficiency(FE) of 48.16 % for C2H5OH, and that of the C2+ products is 83.31 % at −1.17 V vs. RHE. This study provides a surface nanostructured route for rationalizing efficient and selective copper electrocatalysts for CO2RR.

Abstract With the continuous increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to human activities and the resulting severe climate issues, there is global concern about energy conservation and emission reduction. However, detailed data on energy consumption and emissions at a fine-grained scale, particularly regarding spatial dimensions and sector-specific emissions, remains insufficient and in need of refinement and timely updates. In Japan, following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, there has been a significant shift from nuclear power generation to reliance on fossil fuels across various sectors, highlighting disparities in emissions data across different regions and industries. Our work extends the emissions time series for Japan’s 47 prefectures, incorporating their socioeconomic characteristics over a broader time frame and with a more detailed sectoral classification. The emissions inventory, covering the period from 1990 to 2020, is based on the consumption of the three main fossil fuels across 32 sectors, with emissions carefully allocated for regional power generation. This dataset, presented in a unified format, is expanded to include longer time scales and more detailed socioeconomic data. It is anticipated to offer crucial insights for establishing regional emission reduction targets and identifying sectoral priorities for decarbonization.

In today’s climate-conscious world, companies across the globe continue to push to optimise energy use and reduce or eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions. Investments aimed at emission monitoring and reduction are driven by the need to optimise consumption of electricity, gas, oil, and water to meet emissions reduction targets and sustainability goals. Tracking and reducing emissions can improve process uptime through predictive maintenance and reduce product losses across the process. Methane emissions are in particular focus as methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated that a third of methane emissions in North America come from the industrial sector, and similar figures come from the European Commission. It is no wonder that government and industry are laser-focussed on improving their approach to the reduction of methane emissions. As companies drive their own corporate standards to achieve net zero emissions, there is also a need to comply with existing and upcoming governmental emissions standards and regulations, and report emissions on a periodic basis. The trend to move fugitive emissions monitoring from periodic to continuous provides operators with a greater insight into emissions sources which drives efficiencies through the reduction of lost product and a more predictive approach to maintenance. Investors are increasingly focussed on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting and favouring companies that can demonstrate strong ESG performance. Fugitive emission leaks can translate into billions of dollars of lost productivity annually, and serious occupational accidents.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbon dioxide primarily originate from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. The implementation of the Chinese "double carbon strategy" is expected to impact the distribution of PAH emissions, consequently influencing the spatial distribution trend of PAHs in surface soil. Therefore, it is crucial to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the Chinese "double carbon strategy" on soil PAH pollution for the purpose of "the reduction of pollution and carbon emissions". This study utilized 15,088 individual PAH concentration data from 943 soil samples collected between 2003 and 2020 in China, in conjunction with PAH emissions at a 10 km resolution, for meta-analysis. The calculated PAH emissions in this study are in line with the global PAH emission inventory (PKU-PAH-2007), with a relative standard deviation at the provincial level of less than 25 %. Subsequently, a novel method was developed using emission density and Kow of PAHs to predict PAH concentrations in surface soil based on a least-squares regression model. Compared to other environmental models, the method established in this study significantly reduced the percent sample deviation to less than 70 %. Furthermore, energy consumption data for China were simulated based on the implementation plan of the "double carbon strategy" to project PAH emissions and soil PAH levels for the years 2030 and 2060. The predicted PAH emissions in China were estimated to decrease to 41,300 t in 2030 and 10,406.5 t in 2060 from 78,815 t in 2020. Moreover, the heavily contaminated areas of soil PAHs (i.e., total PAH concentrations in soil exceeding 1000 μg kg−1) were projected to decrease by 45 % and 82 % in 2030 and 2060, respectively, compared to levels in 2020. These findings suggest that the implementation of the "double carbon strategy" can fundamentally reduce the pollution of PAHs in surface soil of China.

The carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is one of the most promising solutions for realizing carbon neutralization via converting the emitted CO 2 into value‐added chemicals. The CC coupling step for CO dimerization is the rate‐determining step for C 2 pathways, which have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, the direct cation stabilization effects on CO dimerization for *OCCO formation on the representative Cu(100) and Pt(100) surfaces are investigated. Density functional theory calculations show that the presence of alkali metal ions plays a vital role in promoting the coupling of *CO monomers on both metal surfaces, where Cu shows a stronger stabilization effect. More importantly, a strong linear correlation ( R 2 ≈ 0.9) between the dimer stabilization energy and the reaction energy is revealed for the first time, which is a promising indicator for the selectivity of C 2 pathways. Further investigations on electronic structures reveal that the promoting effect on *OCCO formation is strongly related to the negative charges of the molecules, in which the negative charge accumulation is favored by the directional electron transfer due to the chemisorption of *OCCO on Cu(100) surface. This work offers insights into the understanding of CC coupling reactions for CO 2 RR mechanisms.

Concerns about high-strength concrete (HSC) have increasingly grown in tandem with the building industry's rapid development. However, the high CO2 emissions, high hydration heat, and high autogenous shrinkage of HSCs considered key issues that limit their wide application. In this study, various proportions of dry ice (solid CO2) were added to concrete to optimize HSC. The test results indicated that adding solid CO2 decreased the hydration heat and autogenous shrinkage and increased the mechanical properties and surface electrical resistivity of HSC. This is primarily attributed to the physical and chemical effects of solid CO2 in HSC curing. At 28 d of curing, the sample containing 3 wt.% solid CO2 exhibited the most significant optimization effect. This is attributed to the fact that, at lower solid CO2 content (3%), the production of carbonation products compensates for the loss of strength caused by the reduction of hydration products. In addition, the addition of solid CO2 caused a decrease in the initial temperature, which delayed the hydration reaction and reduced the autogenous shrinkage. Adding solid CO2 led to an increase in acidity and promoted the formation of AFt, further reducing the autogenous shrinkage. And the more solid CO2 added, the greater the reduction in CO2 emissions for the mixture. Therefore, adding solid CO2 can play a role in optimizing the performance and promoting the sustainability of HSC and can contribute to the objectives of low CO2 emissions, low hydration heat, and low autogenous shrinkage of HSC.

Photochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) using molecular transition metal complexes as catalysts has been previously documented to proceed via either of the two mechanisms: CO2 insertion into metal hydride bonds, or hydrogenation of CO2. We present herein photoreduction of CO2 to HCOOH that adopts both these pathways by a single monometallic molecular catalyst featuring earth-abundant cobalt - a characteristic not observed in other molecular catalysts for CO2 photoreduction to date. This dual functionality stems from distinctly different, active forms of the catalyst, at different temporal stages of irradiation. We employ in situ NMR spectroscopy to monitor potential catalytic intermediates at various time points of irradiation by visible light. These observed states align with the kinetic profiles of product evolution, proving instrumental in revealing the catalyst's unique behavior. We advocate for the integration of such in situ NMR monitoring in future studies as it provides a valuable tool for an informed design of photochemical CO2 reduction by molecular catalysts.

We report a solvothermal method for the synthesis of an oxygen vacancy-enriched ZrO2 photocatalyst with Co single atoms and Ni clusters immobilized on the surface. This catalyst presents superior performance for the reduction of CO2 in H2O vapor, with a CO yield reaching 663.84 μmol g–1 h–1 and a selectivity of 99.52%. The total solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency is up to 0.372‰, which is among the highest reported values. The success, on one hand, depends on the Co single atoms and Ni clusters for both extended spectrum absorption and serving as dual-active centers for CO2 reduction and H2O dissociation, respectively; on the other hand, this is attributed to the enhanced photoelectric and thermal effect induced by concentrated solar irradiation. We demonstrate that an intermediate impurity state is formed by the hybridization of the d-orbital of single-atom Co with the molecular orbital of H2O, enabling visible-light-driven excitation over the catalyst. In addition, Ni clusters play a crucial role in altering the adsorption configuration of CO2, with the localized surface plasmon resonance effect enhancing the activation and dissociation of CO2 induced by visible–near-infrared light. This study provides valuable insights into the synergistic effect of the dual cocatalyst toward both efficient photothermal coupling and surface redox reactions for solar CO2 reduction.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the primary drivers of global climate change. Human activities, particularly those related to energy production, transportation, and industry, have long contributed to the escalating levels of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere. Recognizing the significance of this issue, universities, including Thammasat University, play a vital role in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions research and education, carrying a responsibility to address the matter. This study is aimed aims to assess the greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation measures at Thammasat University (Lampang campus), Thailand. The emissions are categorized into 3 types: (1) direct GHG emissions; (2) energy-related indirect GHG emissions; and (3) other indirect GHG emissions. Activity data from the years 2019 to 2022 was used for the calculations, resulting in GHG emissions of 1051.70, 778.28, 558.64, and 1034.531 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Among these emissions, energy-related indirect GHG emissions from electricity purchases represent the majority, accounting for approximately 78.55% of the total emissions. Consequently, implementing mitigation strategies, such as solar panel installations and solid waste reduction (combined scenario), has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by up to 57.78%. Furthermore, the university should actively promote GHG emissions reduction through the enactment of energy-saving policies and the adoption of energy-efficient technologies to reduce reliance on energy purchases.

Abstract Modelling of the co-electrolysis process requires understanding of the underlying reaction pathways under H2/H2O/CO/CO2-atmospheres. These include the electrochemical steam reduction/hydrogen oxidation, the electrochemical CO2 reduction/CO oxidation and their coupling via the catalytic (reverse) water gas shift reaction ((R)WGS). The assumption of a very fast RWGS and therefore neglectable electrochemical CO2 conversion is commonly used to model the co-electrolysis process. In contrast, previous studies on Ni/GDC fuel electrodes suggest that the electrochemical conversion of CO / CO2 can be present in H2/H2O/CO/CO2-atmospheres. To deconvolute surface-related and non-surface-related processes in the impedance response we present results from a complex variation of operating parameters for process identification by the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the subsequent impedance analysis by the distribution of relaxation times. A physically meaningful equivalent circuit model, based on a single channel transmission line, is then derived. The model enables quantification of the surface reaction resistance under varied C/H-ratios. From a kinetic analysis it is shown that the electrochemical H2/H2O conversion is dominant for y_CO+y_(CO_2 )≤ 50% and electrochemical CO/CO2-conversion onsets from y_CO+y_(CO_2 )≥ 60%.

Continuing a comprehensive study of the reduction of COx over supported Ru catalysts, we explored the interaction of CO2 with Ru/g-Al2O3 by TAP reactor measurements, focusing on dynamic aspects in adsorption/desorption, reaction and oxygen exchange processes. Pulse shape analysis in H2/CO2 multipulse sequences provides information on the interaction of reactant/product species with the catalyst. The measurements provide information on the dynamic build-up of reaction intermediates and more stable adspecies during pulsing, and its relation to CH4 formation. Facile oxygen exchange between CO2 and catalyst, followed by isotope labelling experiments, is quantitatively reconciled in a simple model, relating the ratio between different CO2 isotopologues to the 18O : 16O ratio in the total exchangeable oxygen on the surface and in the CO2 pulse. The results provide detailed insight into various aspects of the interaction between CO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts important for a mechanistic understanding of various catalytic reactions involving CO2.

The environmental impact caused by the intensive exploitation of fossil fuels to generate heat and electricity has already reached a critical level. Also, as the industrial sector is the largest energy consumer, mainly in the form of heat, it has then become compulsive to implement the use of renewable solar heat in industrial processes, such as those found in the food processing and beverages industries, which do not require high temperatures. Consequently, this study examines the viability of supplying heat as hot water at 80 °C and saturated steam at 160 °C to a medium-sized brewery factory through a hybrid solar plant composed of flat plate and parabolic trough collectors and sensible thermal energy storage. The study was conducted numerically using the meteorological conditions of a city different from that where the factory is located because it benefits from higher insolation levels. The mean annual solar fractions achieved were 49.9% for hot water production and 37.3% for steam generation, at a levelized cost of heat of 0.032 USD/kWh, which can be considered competitive if compared against the values reported in other similar solar projects. Also, the decrease in fossil fuel consumption allowed an annual reduction of 252 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction has gained significant attention in the field of sustainable energy, especially the Cu-based catalysts for CO2 conversion to valuable alcohols. In this study, we developed Cu nanoparticles supported on pyridinic N-B doped graphene nanoribbons/amorphous carbon (Cu/BNC-1) as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction, exhibiting substantially improved ethanol (EtOH) conversion rate in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The Cu/BNC-1 achieved a remarkable 58.64% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for producing EtOH at -1.0 V vs. RHE with a current density of 20.4 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. In-situ Raman, FT-IR, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the high C2+ product selectivity of Cu/BNC-1 attributed to the pyridinic N-B modulation, lowering the CO dimerization barrier. Moreover, the synergistic confinement effect of Cu and BNC can stabilize the C-O bond of the ⁎HOCCH intermediate, thereby increasing the yield of EtOH.

Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs), featuring attractive electronic/geometric configuration and excellent catalytic performance, have emerged a novel class of heterogenous catalysts. However, the linear limitations of ADMCs for complex catalytic reactions, such as the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR) for C2+ products, constrain the further improvement of the catalytic performance. Hence, we proposed a tandem ADMCs (T-ADMCs) model for the first time, which is inspired by the tandem catalysis observed in the multienzyme catalytic cycles of biocatalytic systems. The coupled multistep reactions occurring at the adjacent sites in T-ADMCs may promote flow-line ECO2RR and optimize the overall catalytic performance. This perspective overviews the recent research advances on T-ADMCs for ECO2RR and highlights the advancing orientation of T-ADMCs. Reaction mechanisms based on CO, formic acid, and acetaldehyde intermediates on T-ADMCs are proposed. The activity-promoting effects of tandem catalyst are elucidated, including the regulation of electronic structure via long-range interaction, breaking of linear scaling relationship, and modulation of local microenvironment through intralayer or interlayer diffusion. The challenges, opportunities, and further development of T-ADMCs and reaction mechanisms under realistic electrocatalytic environment are proposed. This work sheds new light on the design of high-performance T-ADMCs.

Previous studies on future scenarios identified two key effects of increasing CO2 on the African summer monsoon (ASM): Rising CO2 leads to an enhancement in moisture supply, favoring an increase in ASM precipitation (the thermodynamic effect). However, it also results in a weakening in mean atmospheric flow, thus facilitating a dryness across the ASM region (the dynamic effect). Therefore, the ultimate change in ASM precipitation stems from the balance of both the thermodynamic and dynamic effects. This study further examines the impact of rising CO2 on ASM rainfall, by taking into account various climate states. Our results suggest that an increase in CO2 during warm interglacial periods has a stronger influence from thermodynamic factors than from dynamic factors, resulting in an enhancement in ASM rainfall. In contrast, if CO2 increases under cold glacial climate backgrounds, its dynamic impact dominates a reduction of rainfall in the ASM region.

An efficient gas diffusion electrode (GDE) is crucial for enhancing mass transport involving gas-phase CO2 conversion in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Microtubular hollow fiber GDE (HFGDE) with a porous hierarchical wall has garnered significant attention, which can modulate the triple-phase reaction zone and improve the performance of CO2RR. Simultaneously, engineering nano/microstructure surfaces of electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to effectively enhance the selectivity and activity in CO2RR. Here, we developed a porous microparticle Ag-based HFGDE via an in situ electrochemical oxidation–reduction method. Both the activity and selectivity of CO2 to CO conversion in the porous microparticle Ag-based HFGDE showed significant enhancement over the pristine and thermal reduced Ag HFGDE without surface reconstruction. At −1.2 V vs RHE, the faradaic efficiency for CO is 94%, with a partial current density of 83.4 mA cm–2, surpassing that of thermal treatment electrodes, which is only 26% with a partial current density of 12.3 mA cm–2. The distinctive reconstruction nano/microstructure on the electrocatalyst surface could be attributed to decreasing the activation energy barrier in the rate-limiting step of initial electron/proton transfer. This work represents a facile strategy for surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts in HFGDE as advanced electrode materials to enhance the efficiency of the CO2 conversion.

ABSTRACT This paper examines the influence of shading devices in non-residential buildings on enhancing cooling loads, mitigating environmental impact, and reducing energy consumption in semi-arid climates. The focus is on educational buildings as part of Algeria's national strategy to enhance sustainability and decrease energy usage. To achieve this, a comparative analysis was conducted, encompassing both numerical and experimental assessments of the effects of four indoor shading techniques and three outdoor shading techniques. Subsequently, the impact of the optimal shading combination on four main orientations was evaluated using dynamic building simulation software. The outcomes demonstrate that the optimal combination of shading devices substantially affects cooling loads, leading to noteworthy energy savings and a reduction in CO2 emissions. Notably, these savings can reach up to 7% in cooling load reduction and up to 32% in energy and CO2 emission reductions. Furthermore, the study concludes that distinct design considerations should be tailored to climate attributes and building orientations to achieve maximal cooling load reductions. This research enriches the existing knowledge concerning the optimization of shading devices for educational buildings with a focus on cooling load reduction. The findings emphasize the necessity for architects, builders, and proprietors to incorporate passive design alternatives that align optimally with energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and overall building sustainability.

A Cu/Co tandem catalysis protocol was developed to conduct the hydroformylation of olefins using CO2/H2 and PMHS (polymethylhydrosiloxane) as a readily available and environmentally friendly hydride source. This methodology was performed via a two‐step approach consisting of the copper‐catalyzed reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane and subsequent cobalt‐promoted hydroformylation with H2 and the in situ formed CO. The optimized triphos oxide ligand, which presumably facilitates the migratory insertion of CO gives moderate to excellent yields for both terminal and internal alkenes. This earth‐abundant metal catalysis provides a reliable and efficient way to afford useful aldehydes in industry using silicon by‐product PMHS as hydrogen source and renewable CO2 as carbonyl source.

Growing trend of air pollution has become one of the familiar environmental hazards for the society. It is a mixture of toxic compounds emerging from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Depending on the source and rate of emission the components of air pollution change dramatically. The primary human-made sources of air pollution may include vehicle emissions, natural gas to heat homes, fuel oils, and by-products of manufacturing and power generation and fumes from chemical production. In addition to that, various hazardous substances such as methane and other gases are released by decomposing organic matter in soils, and other gases include ash and smoke from volcanic eruptions, which are frequently caused by humans. Various reports around the world have consistently demonstrated that air pollution is a significant adaptable risk factor for enhanced mortality. Air pollutants can harm the health of humans, animals, plants, and buildings. The pollutants are in the form of gases, solid particles, or liquid droplets. Ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are some of the gaseous pollutants that contribute to air pollution. The pollution is now the leading environmental cause of premature death. Cardiovascular events such as acute ischemic account for the majority of the additional mortality caused by air pollution. Aside from increased mortality, air contamination is linked to significant reductions in worker productivity. Exposure to air pollution has a wide range of negative consequences on people's health. The effects of air pollution can be divided into short-term and long-term effects. The discomfort, such as irritation to the nose, eyes, throat or skin, as well as infections like bronchitis are short-term symptoms that are transient. It can also cause headaches, nausea and dizziness. The long-term effects of pollution can last for years and cause various respiratory diseases. Long-term damage to people's nerves, brains, kidneys, liver, and other organs, birth defects are the consequences of air pollution (Brook et al. 2004; Newby et al. 2015; Zivin and Neidell 2018; Hamanaka and Mutlu 2018).

Synergistic reduction of carbon emissions and air pollution is the core means to address the two major strategic tasks of fundamentally improving the ecological environment and the 'Dual-carbon target'. The issue of synergistic reduction at the provincial level needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Taking Henan Province, the largest economy in central China, as an example, this study uses environmentally extended input-output analysis and structural path analysis to identify the key sectors that contribute to CO2, SO2, and total particulate matter (TPM) emissions, and to sort out key emission pathways (e.g., Final Demand → Sector…). The results indicate that S2 (Mining of Fossil Energy), S10 (Nonmetal Mineral Products), S11 (Metal Smelting), S13 (Power and Heat) and S17 (Transportation) are mainly responsible for CO2, SO2, and TPM direct emissions on the production side, while S16 (Construction), S12 (Equipment) and S18 (Services) account for more than 45 % of CO2, SO2, and TPM embodied emissions on the consumption side. 32 shared emission pathways are extracted from the top 100 pathways for CO2, SO2, and TPM emissions, which account for 27 %-51 % of total emissions in Henan Province. P9 (Export → Nonmetal Mineral Products), P10 (Export → Metal Smelting) and P21 (Gross Capital Formation → Construction → Nonmetal Mineral Products) are the leading paths responsible for embodied emissions. The research results provide the foundation and guidance for well-designed mitigation policies, as well as a reference for better synergistic control in provinces facing similar situations.

To achieve a sustainable electricity grid, affordable and dispatchable power capacity that supports grid stability and does not increase atmospheric CO2 levels will be required. Combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) with post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) can meet these requirements by capturing and permanently storing all combustion CO2 emissions and, coupled with negative emissions technologies, any remaining life-cycle emissions. For the first time, we present a comprehensive analysis of the technical and financial challenges of producing zero-carbon electricity from CCGTs on a life-cycle basis. We conclude that when the design is optimised, fossil CO2 capture fractions can be increased from 96% to 100% with minimal process modification, commercially available technology and an additional 0.5% decrease in thermal efficiency. This represents a significant 60–70% reduction in the additional efficiency penalty required to reach zero CO2 emission operation. The Cost of CO2 Avoided of 100% fossil CO2 capture is just 128 £/tCO2, a 3 £/tCO2 increase over the 95% gross CO2 capture fraction required to permit PCC projects in the UK. Indeed, within the bounds of the UK power CCS business model, we show that 100% fossil CO2 capture maximises both variable and capacity payments to the producer, resulting in a 2% decrease in the cost of power produced. For zero-carbon electricity on a life-cycle basis, the recapture and permanent geological storage of all remaining life-cycle CO2e emissions from plant construction & decommissioning, CO2 T&S network operation and the natural gas supply chain (operational CO2e emissions and methane leakage) increases the median Cost of CO2 Avoided to 178 £/tCO2 (130–371 £/tCO2), leading to the novel conclusion that a market mechanism equating to a CO2 price of over 178£/tCO2 is likely sufficient to incentivise the development of truly CO2-neutral CCGTs.

Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) can efficiently utilize renewable energy to achieve efficient CO2 reduction and CH4 reforming for syngas production. In this work, a high-performance quasi-symmetric Ni-based electrolyzer with Ni–Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 (GDC) porous cathode and Ni–Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92 (YSZ) microchannel anode, is designed for efficient CO2 electrolysis and electrochemical oxidation of CH4. The electrolytic current density of SOEC reaches 3.2 A cm−2 at the voltage of 1.5 V for CH4-assisted CO2 electrolysis. Highly efficient and stable electrolysis of CO2 is achieved at the thin porous Ni-GDC cathode without external protective gases through the regulation of methane concentration and increasing the electrolysis current. The designed SOECs exhibits a stable operation for 400 h at a highly electrolysis current density of 2 A cm−2 without external protective gases and does not experience detrimental effects from the carbon deposits, despite the presence of a small amount of carbon deposits observed in the anode channels confirmed by the EDS analysis. This study has demonstrated that the design of quasi-symmetric Ni-ceramic electrolyzer is a highly efficient strategy for achieving electrochemical reforming of CH4 with CO2.

Electrochemical co-reduction of CO2 and nitrate provides a novel route to convert waste emissions into value-added chemicals such as urea. However, at the actual reaction interface, the insufficient supply of CO2 reactants as well as the excessive coverage of proton and nitrate on the electrocatalyst surface usually lead to complex product distributions from individual hydrogen evolution or nitrate reduction as side reactions, instead of C-N coupling. Here, we rationally optimize this interface by polycation functionalization, forcing highly selective urea electrosynthesis. The abundant polyamine nodes within the functional layer are conductive to in situ capturing of CO2 and filtering of proton, which pertinently control the reagent concentration to promote the selective C-N coupling and inhibit the undesired side reactions. When this tailored interface is coupled with efficient electrocatalyst with neighboring active sites, the proof-of-concept system delivers a maximum urea generation yield rate of 1254.2 μg h−1 mg−1 along with a Faradaic efficiency of 83.4 %, as well as outstanding Nurea-selectivity of 91.3 % and Curea-selectivity of nearly 100 %, which is one of the most selective urea generation systems reported so far. This work provides new insights in regulating the catalysis microenvironment for the improvement of overall performance in electrochemical C-N coupling.

In this study, an integrated technology is proposed for the absorption and utilization of CO2 in alkanolamine solution for the preparation of BaCO3 in a high gravity environment. The effects of absorbent type, high gravity factor, gas/liquid ratio, and initial BaCl2 concentration on the absorption rate and amount of CO2 and the preparation of BaCO3 are investigated. The results reveal that the absorption rate and amount of CO2 follow the order of ethyl alkanolamine (MEA) > diethanol amine (DEA) > N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and thus MEA is the most effective absorbent for CO2 absorption. The absorption rate and amount of CO2 under high gravity are higher than that under normal gravity. Notably, the absorption rate at 75 min under high gravity is approximately 2 times that under normal gravity. This is because the centrifugal force resulting from the high-speed rotation of the packing can greatly increase gas-liquid mass transfer and micromixing. The particle size of BaCO3 prepared in the rotating packed bed is in the range of 57.2−89 nm, which is much smaller than that prepared in the bubbling reactor (>100.3 nm), and it also has higher purity (99.6 %) and larger specific surface area (14.119 m2/g). It is concluded that the high gravity technology has the potential to increase the absorption and utilization of CO2 in alkanolamine solution for the preparation of BaCO3. This study provides new insights into carbon emissions reduction and carbon utilization.

Advancing the Faraday efficiency (FE) and current density of Cu catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) reaction to produce C2+ products is important for its practical applications. Constructing a hydrophobic interface to regulate the local reaction environment is an effective method to improve the selectivity of C2+ products, but it is limited by the low reaction current density. In this work, we fabricated a novel hydrophobic and ECR active copper stearate (CuSA2) decorated CuO nanoparticle catalyst (CuO/CuSA2) for ECR reaction toward C2+ products. As a result, the CuO/CuSA2 catalyst achieved an FE of 61.33 % and a partial current density of 429.33 mA cm−2 for C2+ products. The CuSA2 and CuO nanoparticle cooperate very well for the formation of C2+ products. The in-situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and electrochemical adsorption experiments indicated that the hydrophobic CuSA2 regulated the local ECR reaction environment. The local ∗CO2.- and *CO adsorption were strengthened by hydrophobic CuSA2 modification while the H2O adsorption was inhibited. CuO nanoparticle promotes *CO coupling reaction and enhances C2 intermediates (*OCCOH and *OC2H5) adsorption. Hydrophobic CuSA2 and CuO nanoparticle synergistically promote the generation of C2+ products. This work provides new insights into the design of hydrophobic CO2 reduction electrocatalysts for the preparation of C2+ products.

To mimic the carbon cycle at a kinetically rapid pace, the sustainable conversion of omnipresent CO2 to value-added chemical feedstock and hydrocarbon fuels implies a remarkable prototype for utilizing released CO2. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have been recognized as remarkable catalytic systems for achieving large-scale applicability in energy-driven processes. POPs offer mesoporous characteristics, higher surface area, and superior optoelectronic properties that lead to their relatively advanced activity and selectivity for CO2 conversion. In comparison to the metal organic frameworks, POPs exhibit an enhanced tendency toward membrane formation, which governs their excellent stability with regard to remarkable ultrathinness and tailored pore channels. The structural ascendancy of POPs can be effectively utilized to develop cost-effective catalytic supports for energy conversion processes to leapfrog over conventional noble metal catalysts that have nonlinear techno-economic equilibrium. Herein, we precisely surveyed the functionality of POPs from scratch, classified it, and provided a critical commentary of its current methodological advancements and photo/electrochemical achievements in the CO2 reduction reaction.

Abstract. The escalating climate crisis requires rapid action to reduce the concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and lower global surface temperatures. Methane will play a critical role in near-term warming due to its high radiative forcing and short atmospheric lifetime. Methane emissions have accelerated in recent years, and there is significant risk and uncertainty associated with the future growth in natural emissions. The largest natural sink of methane occurs through oxidation reactions with atmospheric hydroxyl and chlorine radicals. Enhanced atmospheric oxidation could be a potential approach to remove atmospheric methane. One method proposes the addition of iron salt aerosol (ISA) to the atmosphere, mimicking a natural process proposed to occur when mineral dust mixes with chloride from sea spray to form iron chlorides, which are photolyzed by sunlight to produce chlorine radicals. Under the right conditions, lofting ISA into the atmosphere could potentially reduce atmospheric methane concentrations and lower global surface temperatures. Recognizing that potential atmospheric methane removal must only be considered an additive measure – in addition to, not replacing, crucial anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission reductions and carbon dioxide removal – roadmaps can be a valuable tool to organize and streamline interdisciplinary and multifaceted research to efficiently move towards understanding whether an approach may be viable and socially acceptable or if it is nonviable and further research should be deprioritized. Here we present a 5-year research roadmap to explore whether ISA enhancement of the chlorine radical sink could be a viable and socially acceptable atmospheric methane removal approach.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to formate is an attractive carbon emissions mitigation strategy due to the existing market and attractive price for formic acid. Tin is an effective electrocatalyst for CO2R to formate, but the underlying reaction mechanism and whether the active phase of tin is metallic or oxidized during reduction is openly debated. In this report, we used grand-canonical density functional theory and attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to identify differences in the vibrational signatures of surface species during CO2R on fully metallic and oxidized tin surfaces. Our results show that CO2R is feasible on both metallic and oxidized tin. We propose that the key difference between each surface termination is that CO2R catalyzed by metallic tin surfaces is limited by the electrochemical activation of CO2, whereas CO2R catalyzed by oxidized tin surfaces is limited by the slow reductive desorption of formate. While the exact degree of oxidation of tin surfaces during CO2R is unlikely to be either fully metallic or fully oxidized, this study highlights the limiting behavior of these two surfaces and lays out the key features of each that our results predict will promote rapid CO2R catalysis. Additionally, we highlight the power of integrating high-fidelity quantum mechanical modeling and spectroscopic measurements to elucidate intricate electrocatalytic reaction pathways.

The hydrogenation of CO2 holds promise for transforming the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. However, the challenge lies in developing robust and selective catalysts for this process. Transition metal oxide catalysts, particularly cobalt oxide, have shown potential for CO2 hydrogenation, with performance heavily reliant on crystal phase and morphology. Achieving precise control over these catalyst attributes through colloidal nanoparticle synthesis could pave the way for catalyst and process advancement. Yet, navigating the complexities of colloidal nanoparticle syntheses, governed by numerous input variables, poses a significant challenge in systematically controlling resultant catalyst features. We present a multivariate Bayesian optimization, coupled with a data-driven classifier, to map the synthetic design space for colloidal CoO nanoparticles and simultaneously optimize them for multiple catalytically relevant features within a target crystalline phase. The optimized experimental conditions yielded small, phase-pure rock salt CoO nanoparticles of uniform size and shape. These optimized nanoparticles were then supported on SiO2 and assessed for thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation against larger, polydisperse CoO nanoparticles on SiO2 and a conventionally prepared catalyst. The optimized CoO/SiO2 catalyst consistently exhibited higher activity and CH4 selectivity (ca. 98%) across various pretreatment reduction temperatures as compared to the other catalysts. This remarkable performance was attributed to particle stability and consistent H* surface coverage, even after undergoing the highest temperature reduction, achieving a more stable catalytic species that resists sintering and carbon occlusion.

This research paper aims to optimize electrical system modeling to minimize CO2 emissions, improve reliability, and reduce costs. It proposes integrating Elman Neural Network (ENN) and metaheuristic algorithm to evaluate environmental impact and optimize system performance. The goal is to create a mathematical model considering renewable energy sources, grid energy, CO2 emissions, and maintenance costs, and use metaheuristic algorithms to determine the optimal combination of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels. To train the ENN model and optimize the system, a three-stage approach is proposed. Quasi-random numbers are generated using Sobol techniques to create input data, which is then processed by TRNSYS for simulation. The proposed approach incorporates an ENN with Boosted version of the Coyote optimization algorithm to accurately model and predict the behavior of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems for Zero Energy Buildings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our method significantly reduces energy consumption, costs, and system reliability, achieving a 25% reduction in energy consumption and 12% reduction in system cost, and is effective in optimizing hybrid solar/wind and hydrogen storage systems. The optimal system configuration significantly reduces CO2 emissions, achieves a high level of system reliability, and minimizes costs. Comparative analysis with previous studies showcases the superiority of the proposed method in achieving comprehensive optimization. In conclusion, this study combines AI techniques and metaheuristic algorithms to optimize electrical system design, considering environmental, technical, and economic factors. The proposed approach overcomes limitations in previous studies and offers an effective solution to address the optimization problem.

Here, a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst by integration of copper phthalocyanine with carboxyl grafting (CuTcPc) and BiVO4 nanosheets (BVO) via the hydroxyl induced assembly strategy has been developed for selective CO2 photoreduction. The optimal CuTcPc/BVO catalyst delivers a 21-fold increments in CO yields compared with pristine BVO and 91 % selectivity towards CO2 reduction, coupled with nearly stoichiometric O2 in pure water. As unraveled by experimental results and theoretical simulations, the remarkably improved photoactivity is attributed to the complementary light absorption of BVO and CuTcPc, the enhanced charge transfer and separation due to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction and most importantly the preferable CO2 adsorption and activation brought by the adjusted local coordination and electronic environment of central Cu-N4 sites by electron-withdrawing substituents. This study provides a feasible avenue to manipulate the active sites from the perspective of functional substitute tailoring on metal phthalocyanine over novel BiVO4-based Z-scheme heterojunctions for artificial photosynthesis.

The nanointerfaces of ZnO-Cu and the size of active nanoparticles (NPs) play crucial roles in the development process of CO2 hydrogenation. Herein, Zn-PBC80 with an unsaturated coordination Zn2+ center was constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3,5-bis(4′-carboxyl-phenyl) pyridine (H2PBC), serving as an anchoring site for supporting Cu2+ and a platform for encapsulating NPs. The different loading concentrations of Cu2+ and pyrolysis of the MOFs-based precursor vary the chemical environments of the catalysts, resulting in different distributed states and average sizes of active sites. Specifically, the pyrolysis of Zn-PBC80-Cu-1 with a concentration ratio of 1:1 facilitates the construction of an interfacial ZnO-Cu nanocomposite and smaller NP size. Among a series of CO2 catalysts, the resultant ZnO-Cu-1-700 exhibits the best catalytic performance with a satisfying CO2 conversion rate (16.5%), outstanding CO selectivity (100%), and promoting catalytic stability over 30 h. The best catalytic performance could be attributed to the more stable electronic structure of metallic Cu NPs and the generation of oxygen vacancies resulting from the unique ZnO-Cu nanointerfaces among the catalysts. This discrepancy in catalytic performance indicates that the active nanointerfaces affects the electronic structure of active centers, providing valuable insight into the design of efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction.

This paper investigates the potential benefits of integrating rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) with buildings to reduce energy and CO2 costs, contributing to urban decarbonization efforts. This integration not only advances sustainable urban agriculture but also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) - Affordable and Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) - Sustainable Cities and Communities, through its energy-efficient, low-carbon approach. We hypothesize that this integration can significantly lower energy use in integrated RTGs (i-RTGs) and set out to validate this through dynamic models for both building and i-RTG climates, focusing on CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature. Central to our approach is the implementation of a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework, which utilizes these dynamic models to make control decisions aimed at minimizing total control costs. This framework operates in a receding horizon procedure, regulating climate factors within the i-RTG and building using various actuators. We validate our approach by simulating an i-RTG atop a building in eleven different cities, demonstrating interactions such as energy, moisture, and CO2 exchange. Significantly, our study reveals that integrating i-RTG with buildings under the NMPC framework leads to a 15.2% reduction in control costs. Additionally, we find that the i-RTG model is adaptable to different climates, with colder regions showing greater cost reduction potential. Our study underscores the viability and advantages of integrating i-RTGs with buildings, offering a sustainable, decarbonizing solution for urban agriculture and building management that contributes to the fulfillment of SDG7 and SDG11.

Bio-based polymers have garnered significant interest across the manufacturing industry, global economy, and various engineering disciplines such as packaging, tissue engineering, controlled drug delivery, wound dressing, and textiles. In the current era, bio-based polymers, notably polysaccharides, offer a promising platform for constructing intricate and versatile structures in the biomedical sector. These structures encompass applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM), drug delivery devices, coatings for biomedical devices, and wearable sensors, thanks to their distinctive features such as inherent biocompatibility, flexibility, stretchability, mechanical strength, renewability, physiological activity, and favorable biological environment. In this review, we offer a concise overview of diverse types of polysaccharide-based polymers and their composites, properties, and interactions with specific cells and tissues. The review encompasses recent progress in tissue scaffolds designed for cartilage, skin, neural, vascular, cardiac, and bone regeneration, employing both conventional and modern manufacturing techniques. Additionally, it delves into the development of other biodegradable biomedical devices, including drug delivery systems (DDSs), antibacterial coatings on medical devices, wearable sensors, and electronic devices for the healthcare sector. Furthermore, it also elucidates research directions and future perspectives while emphasizing the importance of regulatory approvals and commitment to environmental sustainability. This well-organized and critical review is expected to assist practitioners and researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of current trends, challenges, and potential solutions, thereby harnessing the immense potential of polysaccharide-based biomaterials in the healthcare system. Additionally, the utilization of polysaccharides in the biomedical sector aligns with principles of nature, contributing to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.

Among the approaches to facilitating negative CO2 emissions is biochar production. Biochar is generated in the pyrolysis of certain biomasses. In the pyrolysis process, carbon in the biomass is turned into a solid, porous, carbon-rich, and stable material that can be captured from the soil after a period of from a few decades to several centuries. In addition to this long-term carbon sequestration role, biochar is also beneficial for soil performance as it helps to restore soil fertility and improves the retention and diffusion of water and nutrients. This work presents a Life Cycle Assessment of different pyrolysis approaches for biochar production. Biomass pyrolysis is performed in a fixed-bed reactor, which operates at a mild temperature (550 °C). Biochar is obtained as solid product of the pyrolysis, but there are also liquid (bio-oil) and gaseous products (syngas). The pyrolysis gas is partly used to fulfil the energy demand of the pyrolysis process, which is highly endothermic. In the conventional approach, CO2 is produced during the combustion of syngas and emitted to the atmosphere. Another approach to facilitate CO2 capture and thus obtain more negative CO2 emissions in the pyrolysis process is burning syngas and bio-oil in a Chemical Looping Combustion unit. Life Cycle Assessment was performed of these approaches toward biomass pyrolysis to evaluate their environmental impact. The Chemical Looping Combustion approach significantly reduced the values of 7 of the 16 environmental impact indicators studied, along with the Global Warming Potential among them, it slightly increased the value of one indicator related to the use of fossil resources, and it maintained the values of the remaining 8 indicators. Environmental impact reduction occurs due to the avoidance of CO2 and NOx emissions with Chemical Looping Combustion. The CO2 balances of the different pyrolysis approaches with Chemical Looping Combustion configurations were compared with a base case, which constituted the direct combustion of wheat straw to obtain thermal energy. Direct biomass combustion for the production of 17.1 MJ of thermal energy had CO2 positive emissions of 0.165 kg. If the gaseous fraction was burned by Chemical Looping Combustion, CO2 was captured and the emissions became increasingly negative, until a value of −3.30 kg/17.1 MJ was generated. If bio-oil was also burned by this technology, the negative trend of CO2 emissions continued, until they reached a value of −3.66 kg.

Epicardial (Epi) access is commonly required during ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. Conventional Epi (ConvEpi) access targets a "dry" pericardial space presenting technical challenges and risk of complications. Recently, intentional puncture of coronary venous (CV) branches with Epi carbon dioxide insufflation (EpiCO2) has been described as a technique to improve Epi access. The safety of this technique relative to conventional methods remains unproven. To compare the feasibility and safety of EpiCO2 to ConvEpi access. All patients at a high-volume center undergoing Epi access between 1/2021 and 12/2023 were included and grouped according to ConvEpi or EpiCO2 approaches. Access technique was according to the discretion of the operator. Epi access was attempted in 153 cases by 17 different operators (80 ConvEpi vs 73 EpiCO2). There was no difference in success rate whether ConvEpi or EpiCO2 approach was used (76 [95%] vs 67 [91.8%], p=0.4). Total Epi access time was shorter in the ConvEpi group compared to the EpiCO2 group (16.3±11.6min vs 26.9±12.7min, p<0.001), though total procedure duration was similar. Major Epi-access related complications occurred in only the ConvEpi group (6 [7.5%] ConvEpi vs 0 [0%] EpiCo2, p=0.02). Bleeding ≥ 80 mL was more frequently observed following ConvEpi access (14 [17.5%] vs 4 [5.5%], p=0.02). After adjusting for age, repeat Epi access and antithrombotic therapy, EpiCO2 was associated with a reduction in bleeding ≥ 80 mL (OR=0.27, 95%CI 0.08 – 0.89, p=0.03). EpiCO2 access is associated with lower rates of major complication and bleeding when compared to ConvEpi access.

The reduction of carbon emissions has become a critical global issue, and the use of monoethanolamine (MEA) solution for CO2 absorption is prevalent in industry. To elucidate the mass transfer mechanisms in reactive multiphase flow, we employed high-speed photography and digital image processing to examine the dynamics and mass transfer behavior of CO2 bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell. The results indicate that as the MEA solution concentration increases, oscillations during bubble ascent diminish, and the terminal velocity decreases. Based on changes in the mass transfer coefficient, the reaction process can be segmented into a phase of intensified mass transfer, marked by a rapid decrease in bubble equivalent diameter, and a phase of deteriorating mass transfer, where the diameter stabilizes. Additionally, we introduced a dimensionless mathematical model for the Sherwood number based on experimental findings, and its reliability was confirmed.

: Effective decarbonization of the power generation sector requires a multi-pronged approach, including the implementation of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies. The Graz cycle features oxy-combustion CO2 capture in a power production scheme which can result in higher thermal efficiencies than that of a combined cycle. However, the auxiliary consumption required by the air separation unit to provide pure O2 results in a significant energy penalty relative to an unabated plant. In order to mitigate this penalty, the present study explores the possibility of chemical looping combustion (CLC) as an alternative means to supply oxygen for conversion of the fuel. For a midscale power plant, despite reducing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by approximately 12.6% at a CO2 tax of EUR 100/ton and a natural gas price of EUR 6.5/GJ and eliminating the energy penalty of CCS relative to an unabated combined cycle, the cost reductions of CLC in the Graz cycle were not compelling relative to commercially available post-combustion CO2 capture with amines. Although the central assumptions yielded a 3% lower cost for the Graz-CLC cycle, an uncertainty quantification study revealed an 85.3% overlap in the interquartile LCOE range with that of the amine benchmark, indicating that the potential economic benefit is small compared to the uncertainty of the assessment. Thus, this study indicates that the potential of CLC in gas-fired power production is limited, even when considering highly efficient advanced configurations like the Graz cycle.

CO2-based binary mixtures are promising in energy engineering to improve efficiencies of thermodynamic cycles where supercritical CO2 prevails. Indeed, under supercritical pressure and transcritical temperature conditions, special thermophysical properties of binary mixtures make the heat transfer process accompanied by enhanced cross-diffusion effects, i.e., the Soret effect and the Dufour effect. Their influences on heat transfer have not been well understood yet. This paper numerically investigates turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection in CO2-C2H6 binary mixture. Calculations are performed based on a spectral element method solver considering various temperature differences and pressures. Results indicate that the flow field presents a double-vortex structure. The thickness of the boundary layer is negatively correlated with the flow intensity. Under a positive separation ratio, the concentration gradient induced by cross-diffusion effects enhances buoyancy, which in turn reinforces the natural convection and heat transfer. The enhancement becomes stronger as the critical pressure is approached. Turbulent fluctuations are also strengthened by cross-diffusion effects, except for temperature fluctuations. The unusual reduction in temperature fluctuations is attributed to the increased size of the thermal plume caused by the Dufour effect.

CO2 geological sequestration in coal seams can achieve the dual objectives of CO2 emission reduction and enhanced coalbed methane production, making it a highly promising carbon capture and storage technology. However, the injection of CO2 into coal reservoirs in the form of supercritical fluid (ScCO2) leads to complex physicochemical reactions with the coal seam, altering the properties of the coal reservoir and impacting the effectiveness of CO2 sequestration and methane production enhancement.In this paper, theoretical calculations based on ReaxFF-MD were conducted to study the interaction mechanism between ScCO2 and the macromolecular structure of both low-rank and high-rank coal, to address the limitations of experimental methods. The reaction of ScCO2 with low-rank coal and high-rank coal exhibits significant differences. At swelling stage, the low-rank coal experiences a decrease in aromatic structure and aliphatic structure, high-rank coal shows an increase in aromatic structure and a decrease in aliphatic structure, while swelling phenomenon is more pronounced in high-rank coal. At dissolution stage, low-rank coal is initially decomposed into two secondary molecular fragments, and then recombine to form new molecular structure, the aromatic structure increased and the aliphatic structure decreased. In contrast, high-rank coal occurs stretches-breakage-movement-reconnection, a reduction in aromatic structure and an increase in aliphatic structure.The primary reasons for these variations lie in distinct molecular structure compositions and the properties of ScCO2, leading to different reaction pathways of functional group and aromatic structure. The reaction pathways of functional groups and aromatic structures in coal can be summarized as follows: the breakage of the O-H bond in hydroxyl groups, the breakage of the C-OH bond in carboxyl groups, transformation of aliphatic structures into smaller hydrocarbon compounds or formation of long-chain alkenes, and various pathways involving broken, rearrangement, recombination of aromatic structures. In low-rank coal, there is a higher abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures. The breakage of O-H and C-OH chemical bonds results in the formation of free radical ions, while some aliphatic structures detach to produce hydrocarbons. Additionally, some of these aliphatic structures combine with carbonyl groups and free radical ions to generate new aromatic structures. Conversely, in high-rank coal, the lower content of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures, along with stronger intramolecular forces, results in fewer chemical bond breakages and makes it less conducive to the formation of new aromatic structures.These results elucidate the specific deformations of different chemical groups, offering a molecular-level understanding of the interaction between CO2 and coal.

Developing highly active and robust cathodes remains challenging for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Therefore, we report an A-site medium-entropy double perovskite oxide PrBa0.5Sr0.25Ca0.2Ce0.05Co2O5+δ (PBSCCC) and its electrocatalytic activity and CO2 tolerance property are systematically probed. The PBSCCC cathode exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a low polarization resistance of 0.027 Ω cm2 at 700 °C. More importantly, compared to PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBC) and PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+δ (PBCC) oxides, its CO2 resistance is prominently enhanced with significantly less BaCO3 and Co3O4 impurities formed. The superior ORR performance and structure stability are mainly attributed to its high electrical conductivity and significantly reduced surface cation segregations. Our results show that the potential of PBSCCC as a cathode material for SOFCs is enormous and also prove the rationality and feasibility of entropy engineering for cathode development.

Copper (Cu) based catalysts are frequently used in CO2 hydrogenation, particularly in reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) and CO2-to-methanol reaction. Cu0 and Cu + are the key species affecting the catalyst performance and product distribution. Therefore, constructing and adjusting Cu0/Cu+ active pairs is significant for the catalyst design. In this study, Cu0/Cu+ active pairs are obtained by utilizing the properties of perovskite-type oxides (PTOs). A series of CaTi1-xCuxO3 and Ca0.8La0.2Ti1-xCuxO3 (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50) were synthesized via citric acid complexing method and part of the Cu species entered the PTOs lattice. After reduction, large Cu particles and highly-dispersed Cu clusters were obtained simultaneously. The dispersed Cu clusters have more interfaces with the PTOs and provide abundant Cu + while large Cu particles tend to aggregate and supply mainly Cu0. Cu0 activates H2 and CO2 and plays a vital role in the rWGS reaction. Cu+ is the active site for methanol synthesis and it can strongly absorb CO. The ratio of Cu0/Cu + varies with different Cu content and doping La can also adjust the chemical state of surface Cu. The performance test demonstrates that both excessively high and low Cu0/Cu+ ratios are beneficial for CO generation, while a moderate ratio is suitable for methanol synthesis. These insights provide a method for regulating the chemical state of surface metal species and help the catalyst design for CO2 hydrogenation.

The aviation industry is responsible for over 2% of global CO2 emissions. Synthetic jet fuels generated from biogenic feedstocks could help reduce life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum-based fuels. This study assesses three processes for producing synthetic jet fuel via the synthesis of methanol using water and atmospheric CO2 or biomass. A life cycle assessment and cost analysis are conducted to determine GHG emissions, energy demand, land occupation, water depletion, and the cost of producing synthetic jet fuel in Switzerland. The results reveal that the pathway that directly hydrogenates CO2 to methanol exhibits the largest reductions in terms of GHG emission (almost 50%) compared to conventional jet fuel and the lowest production cost (7.86 EUR kgJF–1); however, its production cost is currently around 7 times higher than the petroleum-based counterpart. Electrical energy was found to be crucial in capturing CO2 and converting water into hydrogen, with the sourcing and processing of the feedstocks contributing to 79% of the electric energy demand. Furthermore, significant variations in synthetic jet fuel cost and GHG emissions were shown when the electricity source varies, such as utilizing grid electricity pertaining to different countries with distinct electricity mixes. Thus, upscaling synthetic jet fuels requires energy-efficient supply chains, sufficient feedstock, large amounts of additional (very) low-carbon energy capacity, suitable climate policy, and comprehensive environmental analyses.

This study investigates the techno-economic feasibility of a photovoltaic power plant integrated with hydrogen energy storage and a dual-fuel reciprocating engine for gas-to-power and power-to-gas operations. The system is optimised for maximising constant grid supply, minimising CO2 emissions, and lowering the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) to assess its value in future energy landscape. Multi-objective optimisation identified a configuration with a hydrogen-fuelled engine generator offering a constant 10 MW grid supply with minimal CO2 emissions (78 kg/MWh), at a LCOE of $335.52/MWh. This system comprises a 93 MW PEM electrolyser, a 4 MW compressor, and 29 t of compressed hydrogen storage, within the limits of the industry's current or projected capacities. A key highlight of the engine-based approach is its ability to readily enhance grid supply through increased diesel consumption without significantly impacting LCOE, provided CO2 emissions stay within acceptable sector cap. This flexibility surpasses alternative technologies. Further analysis explored potential LCOE reductions using global projected data, bringing optimised LCOE values down to $138.76/MWh, making it competitive to current market prices. Sensitivity analysis revealed the LCOE's highest sensitivity to the discount rate, followed by minimal impact from variations in fuel and electricity prices due to the optimised system configuration. Furthermore, the tightening CO2 emission limits do not affect the optimised system's performance, except for limiting the maximum achievable grid supply in 2050 by increased diesel reliance.

The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction serves as a critical pathway for converting CO2 into diverse chemicals. The Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which leverages lattice oxygen as the oxidant and oxygen vacancies as reductants, offers an alternative catalytic strategy for the selective RWGS reaction. While Mn-substituted SrTiO3 (i.e., SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3) has been shown to promote the RWGS reaction selectively via the MvK mechanism, achieving a sufficient conversion of CO2 necessitates elevated temperatures. This study investigated the effect of Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 on the activation of adsorbed H2 molecules, which generated oxygen vacancies and enhanced CO2 conversion. Notably, 1.0 wt% Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 yielded 13.4% of CO at 673 K, whereas pristine SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 and Pd-loaded SrTiO3 yielded negligible or minimal amount of CO. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed that Pd promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies via both thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and kinetic studies revealed that the RWGS reaction over Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 proceeded primarily via the MvK mechanism with a partial contribution from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. This study underscores the effectiveness of combining metal and MvK-type catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the RWGS reaction.

The imperative need for decarbonization within the energy-intensive steel industry, a pivotal sector for meeting global warming mitigation targets, underscores the significance of deploying cost-effective CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) measures. The substantial external costs and resource consumption associated with traditional CCS methods present practical challenges. Here, we proposed a pragmatic strategy to integrate CCS into the steel industry through recycling inherent resources from steelmaking waste streams for in-situ CCS (ICCS). The composites prepared from blast furnace slag (BFS) and steel slag (SS) demonstrated the capacity to capture a maximum of 2.77 mol/kg of CO2 from the simulated flowing flue gas at 75 °C, and the energy required could be sourced from steelmaking waste heat. Comprehensive characterizations revealed the evolution of phase compositions and pore structures in different BFS/SS-incorporated composites, providing insights into accelerating the carbonation by elevating temperatures and SS dosages. Notably, ICCS strategy was validated to offer significant potential in CO2 emission reduction (up to −570.0 kg CO2e/t) normalized by compressive strength of the conventional construction materials. Overall, ICCS strategy can minimize the external resource consumption and additional units for implementing collaborative waste recycling in the steel industry with significant environmental benefits.

The mechanistic understanding of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under electrochemical conditions is crucial for optimizing the overall catalytic performance. While electrolyte ions have received considerable attention, it remains unclear how the condition of interfacial cations modulates the CO2RR and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we explore the CO2 activation and Volmer step representing the critical first electron transfer during the CO2RR and HER, respectively. This investigation involves manipulating the cation identity (K+, Li+, and H+) and concentration at Au–water interfaces, which is carried out via the slow-growth sampling approach integrated with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that the high local alkali metal cation (AM+) concentration facilitates the CO2RR following the order of 2K+ > 1K+ > 2Li+ > 1Li+ > 0AM+, and the highly promoted CO2 activation kinetics originate from the short-range coordination between alkali metal cations and reaction intermediates. However, the interfacial HER behaves very differently with the kinetic order of 1Li+ > 0AM+ > 1K+ > 2Li+ > 2K+, closely related to the interfacial water structures, which are affected by both cation identity and local concentrations. Overall, the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR at the Au–water interface can be enhanced by increasing the local cation concentration (K+ > Li+). These findings highlight the critical roles of alkali metal cations and reaction microenvironments in modulating interfacial reaction kinetics.

Acidic CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) shows advantages in high carbon utilization efficiency yet encounters great challenges in suppressing undesired hydrogen evolution competition and increasing C2+ product selectivity. Although it is known that Cu0/Cu+ interfaces are conducive to C–C coupling processes, the oxidation state of copper cannot be well maintained under the strong reductive condition and large current electrolysis operation. Herein, we propose an I2 addition involved strategy to protect the oxidation state of Cu and promote dynamic Cu0/Cu+ interfaces during acidic CO2RR. With the addition of I2 in the electrolyte, a high C2+ product Faraday efficiency of above 70% can be achieved at 0.4–0.6 A cm–2 even under a low K+ concentration of 0.3 M, which is comparable to those reported performances with almost ten times higher K+ concentrations (2–3 M). This low K+ concentration in electrolytes significantly avoids salt crystallization in the CO2 transport channel to enhance the electrolyzer's stability. As proved by the surface Pourbaix diagram and experimental results, adding excessive I2 into the electrolyte boosts the generation of CuI; also, CuI and metallic Cu coexist under electrochemical reduction conditions, demonstrating that a redox loop of Cu → CuI → Cu exists. The loop holds the key to constructing the dynamic Cu0/Cu+ interface, which is tightly bound to the adsorption of the *CO reaction intermediate and further promotes the C–C coupling process.

Abstract. The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) stores freshwater equal to more than seven meters of potential sea level rise and strongly interacts with the Arctic, North Atlantic and global climate. Over the last decades, the GrIS has been losing mass and is projected to lose mass at an increasing rate. Interactions between the GrIS and the climate have the potential to amplify or reduce GrIS mass balance responses to ongoing and projected warming. Here, we investigate the impact of ice sheet-climate interactions on the climate and mass balance of the GrIS using the Community Ice Sheet Model version 2 coupled to the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2-CISM2). To this end, we compare two idealized simulations with a nonevolving and evolving ice sheet topography in which we apply an annual 1 % increase in CO2 concentrations until stabilization at four times pre-industrial (PI) CO2 concentrations (4xCO2). By comparing the 1- and 2-way coupled simulations, we find significant changes in atmospheric blocking, precipitation and cloud formation over Greenland as the GrIS topography evolves, acting as negative feedbacks on mass loss. We also find that a uniform temperature lapse rate represents temperature changes in the ablation area, leading to an overestimation of the positive melt-elevation feedback in the 1-way coupled simulation, resulting in an overestimation of mass loss. Furthermore, we analyze an idealized simulation in which we first apply a 4xPI CO2 forcing and thereafter annually reduce atmospheric CO2 by 5 % until PI concentrations are reached. During the 350 year 4xCO2 forcing period, the ice sheet loses a total mass of 1.1 m sea level equivalent, and part of its margins retreat landward. When the PI CO2 concentration is restored, melt decreases rapidly, leading to a small positive surface mass balance. Combined with the strongly reduced ice discharge resulting from the widespread retreat of the ice sheet margin, this results in the halting of GrIS mass loss, despite a remaining global warming of 2 K. The GrIS, Arctic and North Atlantic ocean strongly interact, causing a complex transitional phase towards a colder climate during the century following the CO2 reduction. Elevated atmospheric temperatures, larger ocean heat transport and a deteriorated state of the snowpack, compared to the initial pre-industrial state, result in limited regrowth of the ice sheet under reintroduced PI CO2 conditions.

The anaerobic-multistage anoxic/aerobic (A-MAO) process has shown good potential for advanced nitrogen removal in recent years, but its greenhouse gas emissions still need to be fully explored. The effects of the influent distribution and external carbon source sodium acetate on nutrient removal, greenhouse gas emissions, and the microbial community structure in a continuous plug-flow A-MAO reactor fed with real low C/N ratio domestic sewage were investigated. The results showed that altering the allocation of carbon source resulted in average chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) concentration in effluent reduced to 26.10 ± 4.86 and 6.65 ± 1.73 mg/L, respectively. Both operations reduced the emission rate of greenhouse gas. While the addition of external car-bon sources leaded to lower N2O emission rates and higher CO2 and CH4 emission rates. The addition of sodium acetate facilitated nitrification and denitrification processes, thereby leading to a reduction in N2O production. Meanwhile, it spurred the growth of methanogenic bacteria and heterotrophic microorganisms, thus boosting the production of CO2 and CH4. Influent distribution promoted the increase of Bacteroidota, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteriota of the reactor. The enrichment of typical hydrolytic bacteria and glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) increased the utilization efficiency of carbon sources in the system after the addition of sodium acetate. The significant increase of typical denitrifying bacteria (DNBs) Azospira reduced the N2O emission during heterotrophic denitrification process, which was considered to be an important functional genus for increasing nitrogen loss in this system. The rational utilization of carbon source makes the difference in metabolism function. The study provides a valuable strategy for comprehensively evaluating the pollutant removal and greenhouse gas emission reduction from the A-MAO process.

We combined ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface science techniques, electrochemical measurements, and computational modeling to investigate electrocatalytic systems that are crucial components of the carbon management effort, including oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). Well-defined Model catalysts were grown on substrates in the UHV chamber and characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Selected model electrocatalysts were then tested in electrochemical cells to establish the structure-property relationships in OER and CO2RR. Our results showed that the edge sites of Fe2O3 grown on Au(111) were the most active toward OER and incorporation of Ni at the edge sites (NiFeOx) further boosted their OER activity. We also resolved the size-dependent electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion of the Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with average particle diameter between 2 to 6 nm: smaller diameter (< 3 nm) particles favored H2 evolution reaction (HER) due to a high population of Ag edge sites, whereas larger diameter particles favored CO2RR as the population of Ag(100) surface sites grew. We further discovered that electronic interactions between small diameter Ag particles and highly defective carbon supports could break the size-dependent CO2RR selectivity, resulting in highly selective (CO Faradaic Efficiency > 90%) and active Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with sizes < 2 nm diameter.

The pressure-swing distillation traditionally used in the industry for separating dimethyl carbonate/methanol (DMC/MeOH) commonly suffers from high energy consumption and challenges in achieving high-purity separation due to the existence of pinch zone. Hence, energy-saving extractive distillation system is explored to achieve the high-purity separation of DMC/MeOH azeotrope. With the analyses of isovolatility and residue curve maps based on Wilson model calibrated by vapor–liquid equilibrium experimental data, an extractive distillation process using O-Xylene (OX) as the most suitable entrainer were modeled and validated by using extractive distillation experiment. Furthermore, the design, optimization, and comparison of a 10000 t/a DMC extractive distillation process and a pressure-swing distillation process are investigated. It is demonstrated that the extractive distillation process presents significant economic and emission advantage, specifically with 34.66 % and 26.95 % reductions in operating cost (OC) and in total annual cost (TAC) respectively, as well as 42.53 % reduction in CO2 emissions. This work should provide a feasible and promising approach to energy saving, low-carbon, and high-purity separation of DMC/MeOH azeotrope.

Electrocatalysis plays a crucial role in the production of renewable clean fuels and carbon reduction. However, the catalytic efficiency of transition metal-based electrocatalysts often falls short due to unfavorable surface structures. To address this challenge, the phase transition technique has emerged as a promising surface structure optimization strategy that can modify the crystal and electronic structure of catalysts, thereby enhancing their electrocatalytic efficiency. This comprehensive review explores the mechanism of phase transition in catalysts and its potential for enhancing electrocatalysis.

Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges associated with implementing phase transition strategies to achieve advanced catalytic performance. By providing valuable insights, this review aims to inspire further research in phase transition modulation, paving the way for the advancement of the catalysts that contribute to sustainable and eco-friendly energy production.

This study offers an in-depth analysis and optimization of a microgrid system powered by renewable sources, designed for the efficient production of hydrogen and dimethyl ether—key elements in the transition toward sustainable fuel alternatives. The system architecture incorporates solar photovoltaic modules, advanced battery storage solutions, and electrolytic hydrogen production units, with a targeted reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the enhancement of overall energy efficiency. A rigorous economic analysis was conducted utilizing the HYSYS V12 software platform and encompassing capital and operational expenditures alongside profit projections to evaluate the system’s economic viability. Furthermore, thermal optimization was achieved through heat integration strategies, employing a cascade analysis methodology and optimization via the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), yielding an 83% decrease in annual utility expenditures. Comparative analysis revealed that the energy requirement of the optimized system was over 50% lower than that of traditional fossil fuel-based reforming processes. A comprehensive assessment of CO2 emissions demonstrated a significant reduction, with the integration of thermal management solutions facilitating a 99.24% decrease in emissions. The outcomes of this study provide critical insights into the engineering of sustainable, low-carbon energy systems, emphasizing the role of renewable energy technologies in advancing fuel science.

The circular economy has come with momentum to settle in the countries as a new model of economic growth. Thus, sustainable development and the objectives set forth by the United Nations for its achievement and expansion highlight the concern and preoccupation of society for these issues. For this reason, this chapter deals with four specific aspects of the agricultural industry sector, which aim to improve our lives and the sustainability of our planet. These aspects refer to the use of biomass residues and their contribution to the food sector, the generation of biofuel and electricity from biogas for agricultural use, as well as the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation. Finally, a decrease in cotton production and the use of regenerated cotton by the textile industry will be considered. Based on the theoretical framework, four specific proposals are established to achieve the aggregate global growth requirement posed by Sustainable Development Goal 8, compared to the reduction in the use of CO2, together with the reduction in the use of resources (Goals 6, 7, 9, 12 and 15). These proposals cover aspects such as the reuse of organic and biodegradable wastes, the reuse of water through different irrigation methods and its application based on its components, and the reuse of cotton from existing clothing. All of this provides economic agents, administration, companies, and households with opportunities for reflection and implementation of a more sustainable economic and social model.

Combining biomass co-firing with oxy-fuel combustion is a promising Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology. It has the potential to achieve a large-scale reduction in carbon emissions from traditional power plants, making it a powerful tool for addressing global climate change. However, mercury in the fuel can be released into the flue gas during combustion, posing a significant threat to the environment and human health. More importantly, mercury can also cause the fracture of metal equipment via amalgamation, which is a major risk for the system. Therefore, compared to conventional coal-fired power plants, the requirements for the mercury concentration in BECCS systems are much stricter. This article reviews the latest progress in mercury control under oxy-fuel biomass co-firing conditions, clarifies the impact of biomass co-firing on mercury species transformation, reveals the influence mechanisms of various flue gas components on elemental mercury oxidation under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various mercury removal methods, and finally provides an outlook for mercury control in BECCS systems. Research shows that after biomass co-firing, the concentrations of chlorine and alkali metals in the flue gas increase, which is beneficial for homogeneous and heterogeneous mercury oxidation. The changes in the particulate matter content could affect the transformation of gaseous mercury to particulate mercury. The high concentrations of CO2 and H2O in oxy-fuel flue gas inhibit mercury oxidation, while the effects of NOx and SO2 are dual-sided. Higher concentrations of fly ash in oxy-fuel flue gas are conducive to the removal of Hg0. Additionally, under oxy-fuel conditions, CO2 and metal ions such as Fe2+ can inhibit the re-emission of mercury in WFGD systems. The development of efficient adsorbents and catalysts is the key to achieving deep mercury removal. Fully utilizing the advantages of chlorine, alkali metals, and CO2 in oxy-fuel biomass co-firing flue gas will be the future focus of deep mercury removal from BECCS systems.

Methanol is considered as an essential base chemical, which is widely known for its versatility and broad potential use contexts in future chemical industries and energy storage applications. Methanol production pathways powered by renewable electricity sources, also known as power-to-methanol processes, are characterized by low specific life-cycle emissions and are therefore of paramount interest. One possible renewable process chain features proton-conducting high temperature electrolyzers combined with a direct hydrogenation of CO2. In this paper, a techno-economic forecast study of this process chain is presented and specific production costs of renewable methanol under different electricity supply scenarios are determined and discussed for the years 2030 and 2050. The studies showed that flexible grid-supported scenarios through direct spot-market participation and renewable scenarios enable the largest production cost reduction potential in the upcoming decades.

Hungary boasts exceptional geothermal capabilities, with an Earth's crust thermal gradient nearly double the global average. However, the current utilization of these resources is often one-sided and lacks careful consideration. This comprehensive study offers updated insights into Hungary's geothermal potential and its current energy utilization. By presenting a practical example and employing scenario-based analyses, this study demonstrates how basic calculations can guide investment decisions in geothermal infrastructure. The aim is to address the prevailing issue of cities and towns prioritizing fossil fuel-based energy sources, thereby overshadowing renewable energy alternatives, despite advancing technology. Notably, in the case of Székesfehérvár, it was determined that annual natural gas consumption could be reduced by an impressive 40–50%, leading to a substantial reduction of 5,000–9,200 tons of CO2 emissions, depending on the specific scenarios examined.

Plastic polymers are present in most aspects of routine daily life. Their increasing leakage into the environment poses a threat to environmental, animal, and human health. These polymers are often resistant to microbial degradation and are predicted to remain in the environment for tens to hundreds of years. Fungi have been shown to degrade complex polymers and are considered good candidates for bioremediation (biological pollutant reduction) of plastics. Therefore, we screened 18 selected fungal strains for their ability to degrade polyurethane (PU), polyethylene (PE), and tire rubber. As a proxy for plastic polymer mineralization, we quantified O2 consumption and CO2 production in an enclosed biodegradation system providing plastic as the sole carbon source. In contrast to most studies we demonstrated that the tested fungi attach to, and colonize the different plastic polymers without any pretreatment of the plastics and in the absence of sugars, which were suggested essential for priming the degradation process. Functional polymer groups identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and changes in fungal morphology as seen in light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used as indicators of fungal adaptation to growth on PU as a substrate. Thereby, SEM analysis revealed new morphological structures and deformation of the cell wall of several fungal strains when colonizing PU and utilizing this plastic polymer for cell growth. Strains of Fusarium, Penicillium, Botryotinia cinerea EN41, and Trichoderma demonstrated a high potential to degrade PU, rubber, and PE. Growing on PU, over 90 % of the O2 was consumed in <14 days with 300–500 ppm of CO2 generated in parallel. Our study highlights a high bioremediation potential of some fungal strains to efficiently degrade plastic polymers, largely dependent on plastic type.

Understanding structure–property relationships in atomically precise metal nanoclusters is vital in finding selective and tunable catalysts. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was used to benchmark seven exchange correlation functionals at different basis sets for 17 atomically precise nanoclusters against experimentally determined geometries, band gaps, and optical gaps. The set contains both monometallic and bimetallic clusters that possess at least two types of 3d transition metals (specifically, Cu, Ni, Fe, or Co). The benchmark highlights that PBE0 is a good functional to use regardless of the basis set, and Minnesota functionals do well with respect to specific metals. Further, while long-range corrected functionals overestimate band and optical gaps, they model absorption features better than the other considered functionals. The study additionally looks at the photoinduced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the CO2 reduction mechanism on nanoclusters reported from the literature.

Magnetron sputtering (MS) is a very promising approach for electrode preparation due to its versatility, environmental benignity, and sustainability. In particular, by allowing high control of the deposited nanostructures, MS is characterized by: high deposition rates at low temperatures, deposition of complex species just selecting a specific target, high-density films, and outstanding adhesion of the films on supports. In the following study, the preparation by MS, and thus avoiding toxic chemical reagents, of NbRe thin films, for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), was reported. Firstly, the electrocatalytic activity of NbRe thin films was tested towards HER showing promising performance: negligible overpotentials and very small Tafel slopes. Secondly, in the context of carbon recycling, and considering renewable sources intermittence, the electrodes were tested towards CO2RR, obtaining selectively C3 compounds. Overall, the proposed study aims to contribute to the development of sustainable catalytic electrochemical processes, supporting the ecological transition.

The anode has not been extensively studied in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) systems because it is believed to have no significant effect on the catalytic selectivity and activity of the cathode. Herein, we report that the anode can indeed influence the catalytic activity of the CO2RR by regulating the transfer of water and ions in a membrane electrode assembly. Despite employing identical cathode conditions, we observed optimal ethylene production at different current densities for distinct anode substrates: carbon paper (CP) and Ti meshes. Based on the results of in situ/operando analysis and transparent cell tests, CP creates an environment deficient in water and cations, thereby promoting local pH effects. Consequently, this leads to a higher valence state of Cu during the CO2RR, resulting in increased catalytic activity for ethylene production. However, in the high-current-density region, the catalytic activity of CP degrades due to the uneven distribution of the reaction. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the reaction environment for CO2RR and offers insights for optimizing the catalytic activity of CO2RR systems.

In this work, La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 HEO nanoparticles with a perovskite-type structure are synthesized and used in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalyst demonstrates high performance as an electrocatalyst for the CO2RR, with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5% at a current density of 21.9 mA cm–2 under −0.75 V vs a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). Particularly, an FE above 54% is obtained for methyl isopropyl ketone (C5H10O, MIPK) at a partial current density of 16 mA cm–2, overcoming all previous works. Besides, the as-prepared HEO catalyst displays robust stability in the CO2RR. The excellent catalytic performance of La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 is ascribed to the synergistic effect between the electronic effects associated with five cations occupying the high-entropy sublattice sites and the oxygen vacancies within the perovskite structure of the HEO. Finally, DFT calculations indicate that Cu plays a vital role in the catalytic activity of the La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 HEO nanoparticles toward C2+ products.

Corporate revenues from environmentally friendly products and services are surging, having reached US$4.69 trillion worldwide in 2023. In this paper, I provide a comprehensive evaluation of these green revenues across countries over the 2008-2023 period. I find that foreign institutional ownership, particularly from countries with stringent environmental norms and regulations, significantly increases green revenue intensity. This correlation is further supported by evidence from index inclusions, indicating a causal relationship. Additionally, firms that tie executive compensation to ESG goals and those with gender-diverse leadership show enhanced green revenue intensity. Leveraging the EU Green Deal as a natural experiment, I demonstrate that increases in green revenues are associated with reductions in CO2 emissions and enhancements in environmental policies and profitability. These effects are mostly concentrated in carbon-intensive industries. Overall, these findings highlight how environmental considerations are integral to shaping corporate strategies and illustrate the pivotal role of institutional investors in fostering the green transition.

Here, in situ assembly in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and CoFe2O4 composite (LSCFC) cathode was induced by Pr to form La0.6Sr0.4CoxFeyO3-δ/PrCoO3/Co3O4/PrO2 (LSCFC-PI) multiphase heterostructures. The surface of LSCFC-PI forms uniform nanoparticles, and the unique core-shell structure prevents Sr segregation, thereby enhancing CO2 tolerance and increasing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) active sites. Furthermore, compared with LSCFC, LSCFC-PI increases the oxygen vacancy content of the cathode due to the existence of multiphase heterostructure, improves the ORR kinetics, and the conductivity is also greatly improved. The peak power density (PDD) of LSCFC-PI as a single-cell cathode at 700 ℃ reached 1.51 W cm-2, which was 2.65 times higher than that of LSCFC's 0.57 W cm-2, and in the long-term stability test at a constant voltage ~0.8 V for 100 hours, showing excellent stability. In situ assembly of multiphase heterostructures is expected to become a new strategy for developing high-performance IT-SOFC cathodes.

Herein we propose a Ba-site Gd doping protocol in layered perovskites, demonstrating highly active bifunctional PrBa1-xGdxCo2O5+δ electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from enhanced oxygen surface exchange and chemical diffusion kinetics, resultant PrBa0.95Gd0.05Co2O5+δ (PBG0.05CO) exhibits an area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.038 Ω cm2 at 700 oC, reduced by ∼46.5% relative to undoped PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBCO). When evaluated as the air electrode, the as-fabricated single coin fuel cell delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 1230 mW cm-2 at 700 oC. For the CO2-electrolysis at 750 oC, the large current density (J) of 2630 mA cm-2 is achieved in the PBG0.05CO anode-based electrolysis cell at a voltage (V) of 1.8 V. Furthermore, exceptional operating stability is realized in both ORR and OER manners. Our findings highlight an effective strategy to optimize the electrocatalytic properties of layered perovskites, endowing potential applications in energy storage and conversion aspects.

Global energy demand has been above 80% fossil fuels for decades, creating a greater and more complicated energy crisis. Biodiesel is a great alternate energy source for future energy demand. Producing biodiesel from a mixture of waste and non-edible oils may be a practical solution to address the growing global need of biodiesel. In this study, hybrid biodiesel is produced from a ternary oil mixture of Waste cooking oil, Ricinus communis oil, and Melia azedarach oil. The hybrid biodiesel blends are prepared by 10% blending (HB10), 20% blending (HB20) and 30% blending (HB30) and 30ppm multiwall carbon nanotube has been added in the blended fuel through sonicating process. At steady 1500rmp and variable load (0–100%), the engine behavior has been examined. The results show that the hybrid biodiesel blend (HB10) with 30ppm MWCNT has shown highest cylinder pressure of 70.9 bar, maximum mean gas temperature 1467.56°C. The engine shows 34.08% rise in net heat release and 9.13% rise in exhaust gas temperature as compare to diesel. The maximum rise in break thermal efficiency of 19.74% and minimum reduction in break specific fuel consumption of 13.79% is noticed in comparison to B00. The highest reduction of HC emission is found as 20.83% for HB20MWCNT30 and 19.34% for HB30MWCNT30 as compare to B00. The inclusion of multiwall carbon nanotube in hybrid biodiesel reduces the HC, CO, NOx and smoke emission and increases CO2 emission as compare to respective hybrid biodiesel blend and diesel. The hybrid biodiesel-diesel blend, with multiwall carbon nanotube can be utilized efficiently in diesel engine with improved overall engine behavior.

This thesis aims to enhance our understanding of metal segregation in supported bimetallic catalysts, to maximize the synergy between metals. It covers the assessment, effects, and origin of metal segregation as exemplified by supported alloyed Pd-Ni nanoparticles. To assess the degree and type of metal segregation in detail, we introduce a novel analytical technique to study industrial mesoporous catalysts – atom probe tomography (APT). Due to its nature, measuring mesoporous catalysts was not yet possible with APT, thus we have developed a resin-based sample preparation approach. This enables to unravel sub-nm compositional heterogeneities within/between nanoparticles, which is crucial for the optimization of industrial catalysts. With this upgraded arsenal of analytical techniques, we investigated the origins and effects of metal segregation for bimetallic catalysts prepared via industrially relevant incipient wetness impregnation. It spans most of the catalyst’s lifetime from precursor decomposition during calcination, alloy formation during reduction, and restructuring under steady and modulating operating conditions. Hereby, we elucidate the pathways for alloy formation for less uniform catalyst materials, describe the origin of reduction promotion, and showcase the catalyst’s state under operando conditions. However, next to revealing pathways which lead to alloy formation, we shed light on the origins leading to metal segregation. Therefore, we followed the metal precursor decomposition using different gas atmospheres. This allowed to assess the degree of metal segregation and pinpointed which role the decomposition of precursors plays. Finally, we elucidated how metal segregation/alloying between Pd and Ni affects catalysis mechanistically for both CO2 hydrogenation and chitosan depolymerization.

Solar energy is one type of clean energy resource, and currently the IMO, EU and UK are targeting net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This paper delves into the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into hybrid vessels in order to meet their strategies and targets. The technical challenges that come with designing such systems as well as their economic and environmental impacts are examined. By optimizing the usage of harnessed solar energy, we discover the operational strategy that provides maximal benefits through day-to-day savings as well as over the 25 year lifespan of solar panels. It demonstrates impressive economic viability, with cost savings of up to GBP 4.55 per day and a payoff period as short as 9 years. It also displays a modest emission reduction of up to 8.002 kg of CO2, which serves as proof for a pathway to greener practices in the maritime industry. This report highlights the operational flexibility that a hybrid vessel possesses once paired with a PV system through the ability to withstand regulatory and market changes. Also, when looking ahead, further adoption of PV technology creates opportunities for innovation in adopting renewable energy solutions in maritime transportation.

Biomass pyrolysis has the potential to be transformed into valuable chemicals and fuels. Nitrogenous chemicals exert a substantial influence on the quality of bio-oil. Studying the impact of lignin on the transformation of nitrogen-containing elements in biomass during biomass pyrolysis is crucial for achieving efficient and effective utilization of biomass resources. In this study, tube furnace experiments, thermogravimetric infrared experiments (TG-FTIR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) were used to investigate the interaction between typical lignins (vanillin and syringol), nitrogenous components (glutamic acid) during the co-pyrolysis process as well as the effect of lignin on the pyrolysis gas release and pyrolysis products of glutamic acid, and combined with quantum chemical calculations, the impact of lignin on the effect of pyrrolidone formation from glutamic acid.The experimental findings demonstrated that the co-pyrolysis of lignin and glutamic acid resulted in a reduction in the pyrolysis temperature. This reduction facilitated the release of HCN, NH3, and CO2 while notably impeding the formation of nitrogen-containing compounds in the oil. The nitrogen concentration in the pyrolysis oil declined from 97% to a range of 51.06% to 79.63%, and the inhibitory impact decreased as the pyrolysis temperature increased. At an elevated pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, lignin facilitated the decarboxylation process of glutamic acid, resulting in an increased production of pyrrolidone.Simulation results demonstrated that the lowest energy barrier paths were the dehydration condensation process and the Maillard reaction involving glutamic acid and lignin and their pyrolysis intermediates, with a particular competitive connection between the two pathways. The results explained the interaction mechanism between the two pyrolysis products and provided a fundamental theoretical basis for nitrogen conversion in biomass pyrolysis.

The change in the corrosion activities of SS304 and the carbon steel A36 were studied during their exposure for 30 days to hybrid pumice-Portland cement extract (CE), to simulate the concrete–pore environment. The ionic composition and the initial pH (12.99) of the CE were influenced by the reduction of Portland cement (PC) content, volcanic pumice oxides and alkaline activators. Because of the air CO2 dissolution, the pH decreased and maintained a constant value ≈ 9.10 (established dynamic ionic equilibrium). The CE promoted the passivation of both steels and their free corrosion potential (OCP) reached positive values. On the surfaces, Fe and Cr oxides were formed, according to the nature of the steel. Over the time of exposure, the presence of chloride ions in the pumice caused a localized pitting attack, and for carbon steel, this fact may indicate an intermediate risk of corrosion. The chloride effect was retarded by the accumulation of SO42− ions at the steel surfaces. Based on electrochemical impedance (EIS), the polarization resistance (Rp) and the thickness of the passive layers were calculated. Their values were compared with those previously reported for the steels exposed to CEs of Portland and supersulfated cements, and the hybrid cement was considered as a PC “green” alternative.

Steam reforming of medium-low temperature coal tar (SRT) to produce H2 is important for addressing the energy crisis and challenges of global climate change. However, current catalysts still suffer from low H2 selectivity, low tar conversion and poor long-term stability due to the complex composition of real coal tar. Herein, a series of Ni-Ca/H-Al catalysts were prepared by different methods. The results showed that the acid pretreatment effectively removed the hydroxyl groups on the surface of γ-Al2O3 to form oxygen vacancies (Ov), and the NiO was mainly anchored in the Ov. The cit-Ni-2Ca/H-Al catalyst prepared by citric acid-assisted impregnation exhibited the highest H2 yield (152.74 mmol/g-tar), while CO2 was only 22.11 mmol/g-tar. Characterization showed that the addition of CaO improved the dispersion of NiO and increased the Ov concentration. The increase in Ov weakened the NiO bonds in NiO and facilitated the low-temperature reduction of NiO. The cit-Ni-2Ca/H-Al catalysts prepared by the citric acid-assisted impregnation method had better dispersion and strong basic sites compared with the impregnation and precipitation methods, leading to more active sites for CO2 and H2O adsorption, and improving the carbon build-up resistance and reusability of the catalysts. Py-GC/MS results showed the cit-Ni-2Ca/H-Al had excellent tar deoxidation ability and effectively promoted the breakage of CC bonds in furans, benzene ring branches, and CO bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The cit-Ni-2Ca/H-Al catalyst exhibited high tar conversion (90.96%) and H2 yield (146.27 mmol/g-tar) without any treatment for at least 8 cycles. Interestingly, the H2 yield reached 151.58 mmol/g-tar by the simple regeneration of cit-Ni-2Ca/H-Al. This study provides a theoretical basis for efficient steam reforming of real coal tar for H2 production and catalyst preparation.

This study redefines resource efficiency in the renewable energy sector by repurposing construction waste into high-performance thixotropic soils for additive manufacturing. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that these engineered soils achieve compressive strengths up to 30 MPa—indicating a 50% increase over traditional substrates—and flexural strengths reaching 5 MPa. Rigorous life cycle assessments quantify a reduction in carbon emissions by 20% and a resource efficiency enhancement to 85%, surpassing conventional materials which average 500 kg CO2 eq/ton in carbon footprint and 60% in resource efficiency. Fine-tuned 3D printing parameters deliver unparalleled precision, achieving layer accuracy to ±0.1 mm and reducing material wastage by 30%, while accelerating construction timelines by 40%. Additionally, the materials exhibit thermal stability with only a 0.1% variation under elevated temperatures and a durability that sustains less than 0.5 MPa degradation over a 10-month period. These quantitatively robust results support the thixotropic soils' adoption, not just as a sustainable choice but as a superior alternative to conventional building materials, setting a new paradigm in the construction of environmentally resilient and economically viable renewable energy infrastructures.

Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p‐type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90 eV, which causes the upward band bending of p‐type Sb2S3, forming a hole‐transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back‐illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches −5.38 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC‐CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of −0.44 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 0 V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than −0.03 mA cm−2 without CuxS.

The co-processing of different wastes as fuels in the manufacture of cement clinker not only meets the objectives of a circular economy but also contributes to the reduction in CO2 emissions in the manufacture of Portland cement. However, waste used as alternative fuels, such as sludge or organic-rich residues, may contain naturally occurring radionuclides that can be concentrated during the combustion process. In this study, the presence of natural radionuclides (radioactive series of uranium, thorium, and 40K) and anthropogenic radionuclides (137Cs) in these wastes has been investigated by gamma spectrometry. Possible relationships between the radioactive content and the obtained chemical composition, determined by X-ray fluorescence, have also been studied by applying a principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the wastes with the highest radioactive content were sewage sludge with activity concentrations of 238U and 210Pb of 321 ± 38 Bq kg−1 and 110 ± 14 Bq kg−1, respectively. A correlation between radioactive content and Fe2O3 concentration was also observed. The annual effective dose rates to workers for the ashes estimated from the ash content ranged from 0.0033 mSv to 0.092 mSv and therefore do not pose a risk to workers as they are lower than the 1 mSv per year limit for the general public (DIRECTIVE 2013/59/EURATOM).

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of decarbonizing the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic, pivotal for addressing climate change and fostering economic growth. Employing the robust-decision making methodology, we studied multiple scenarios via computational models, capturing inputs from stakeholders and evaluating each scenario across 1,000 futures to capture deep uncertainty. Four scenarios were examined: baseline, reference, natural gas, and renewable. The renewable scenario emerged as the most advantageous, proposing the replacement of coal-fired power generation with renewable sources, primarily solar and wind, coupled with batteries. A significant investment, averaging US$3.3 billion, is necessary for this shift toward renewable energy; however, these investments are overcompensated by savings in operational costs. Crucially, this transition promises substantial benefits by 2050: an estimated cumulative average net economic gain of US$2.7 billion, an 8% reduction in average generation costs in 2050, the creation of 160,000 direct jobs, and the avoidance of circa 140 million tons of CO2. The findings underscore the feasibility and economic viability of transitioning to a 55% renewable energy generation by 2050. The study offers a critical roadmap for policymakers, highlighting renewable energy expansion, transmission grid strengthening, and strategic coal generation replacement, thus offering a comprehensive blueprint for the nation's energy transition.

In addition to its use as a lightweight material, pure magnesium is a promising candidate for prospective bioimplants considering its excellent biocompatible properties. Regardless of what Mg application is used, the ultimate goal is to improve magnesium's mechanical properties and degradation behaviour. Because of the high affinity for oxygen native oxide layer of gas-atomized powders is naturally formed in contact with the atmosphere. S/TEM investigation of the native oxide of the Mg powder particles revealed a nonhomogeneous nano-crystalline MgO layer. MgO is relatively soluble in water and does not provide sufficient corrosion protection. Among various surface treatment methods, conversion of the non-protective magnesium oxide to carbonate products is possible depending on the environmental conditions. This work used a simple experimental method using CO2 and water vapour to achieve surface carbonation of Mg powders. Two carbonated samples and pure magnesium were prepared by direct extrusion. The samples after carbonation retained good mechanical properties and the layer of carbonates had a significant impact on corrosion resistance. 1 day carbonation resulted in transformation of native oxide into amorphous layer and reduction of corrosion rate. Longer carbonation (10 days) revealed layer growth and transformation of native oxide to crystalline nesquehonite structure.

The closed-loop wastewater source heat exchanger (WSHE) has advantages such as being non-clogging and resistant to corrosion, but their heat transfer efficiency is relatively low, therefore it is still not the mainstream form of heat exchanger of wastewater source heat pump (WSHP). A novel CO2 direct-expansion wastewater source heat exchanger (DX-WSHE) is proposed in this paper, aiming to significantly improve the heat transfer rate of the heat exchanger and the energy efficiency of the heat pump system. The direct-expansion heat transfer process is complex, large grid number and long calculation time will be required if calculated by conventional numerical simulation software. Therefore, a three-dimensional transient heat transfer model was developed based on the thermal resistance and capacity model, which offers the advantages of fast computation speed and strong flexibility. The heat transfer and energy efficiency characteristics under different parameters were studied. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the direct-expansion wastewater source heat pump (DX-WSHP) can be increased by 31.0% compared to conventional design, and the heat flux of the direct-expansion wastewater source heat exchanger can be up to 250 W/m for the standard group. Compared with conventional designs, the direct-expansion wastewater source heat pump has excellent heat transfer and energy efficiency capabilities, which is a promising building energy saving and emission reduction technology.

The chemical looping gasification of plastics (CLGP) is a process that offers an innovative solution for transforming post-consumer waste plastics into high-value products. The process utilizes a co-current moving bed reducer reactor with Iron-titanium-based oxygen carriers to gasify plastic feed and generate syngas autothermally. Its distinguishing feature is its ability to operate over a wide range of feed loadings and co-injection of mixed plastic species without any performance losses. Isothermal bench-scale experiments reveal a syngas purity of ∼95%, aligning with the thermodynamic simulations. The moving bed reactor facilitates a deeper reduction of the oxygen carriers to the Fe+FeTiO3 phase, leading to the high syngas purity, which is then verified with additional TGA, XRD, and SEM analysis. For an autothermal operation of CLGP process, an active material content of 20% is found to be sufficient to satisfy the kinetic and thermodynamic constraints. Further integration with downstream production of H2 is presented and compared to a steam gasification process. The process integration simulations show that the CLGP process outperforms the steam gasification system in terms of cold gas efficiency (CGE), effective thermal efficiency (ETE), and H2 yield. CO2 emissions are impressively reduced by ∼30% in the CLGP system over that in the steam gasification system due to its ability to autothermally operate the process, unlike the highly endothermic steam gasification process.

This study evaluated the environmental impact and overall benefits of incorporating humus composites in the anaerobic co-digestion of kitchen waste and residual sludge. The life cycle assessment method was used to quantitatively analyze the environmental impact of the entire anaerobic co-digestion treatment process of waste, including garbage collection, transportation, and final product utilization. Moreover, the comprehensive assessment of the environmental impact, energy-saving and emission-reduction abilities, and economic cost of using humus composites in the anaerobic co-digestion treatment process was conducted using a benefit analysis method. The results showed that the anaerobic co-digestion of kitchen waste and residual sludge significantly contributed to the mitigation of global warming potential (GWP), reaching −19.76 kgCO2-eq, but had the least impact on the mitigation of acidification potential (AP), reaching −0.10 kgSO2-eq. In addition, the addition of humus composites significantly increased the production of biogas. At a concentration of 5 g/L, the biogas yield of the anaerobic co-digestion process was 70.76 m3, which increased by 50.62% compared with the blank group. This amount of biogas replaces ~50.52 kg of standard coal, reducing CO2 emissions by 13.74 kg compared with burning the same amount of standard coal. Therefore, the anaerobic co-digestion treatment of kitchen waste and residual sludge brings considerable environmental benefits.

Abstract In situ resource utilization systems based on cyanobacteria could support the sustainability of crewed missions to Mars. However, their resource-efficiency will depend on the extent to which gases from the Martian atmosphere must be processed to support cyanobacterial growth. The main purpose of the present work is to help assess this extent. We therefore start with investigating the impact of changes in atmospheric conditions on the photoautotrophic, diazotrophic growth of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7938. We show that lowering atmospheric pressure from 1 bar down to 80 hPa, without changing the partial pressures of metabolizable gases, does not reduce growth rates. We also provide equations, analogous to Monod’s, that describe the dependence of growth rates on the partial pressures of CO2 and N2. We then outline the relationships between atmospheric pressure and composition, the minimal mass of a photobioreactor’s outer walls (which is dependent on the inner-outer pressure difference), and growth rates. Relying on these relationships, we demonstrate that the structural mass of a photobioreactor can be decreased – without affecting cyanobacterial productivity – by reducing the inner gas pressure. We argue, however, that this reduction would be small next to the equivalent system mass of the cultivation system. A greater impact on resource-efficiency could come from the selection of atmospheric conditions which minimize gas processing requirements while adequately supporting cyanobacterial growth. The data and equations we provide can help identify these conditions.

The wind tower is a sustainable architectural solution designed to improve natural ventilation and thermal comfort in buildings while reducing energy consumption. This study examines thermal comfort, natural ventilation, and heat transfer in a wind tower-room system with air humidification, such that the interaction of mixed convection with these parameters can be linked. The performance of the system is evaluated considering both natural and forced convection, influenced by differential heating and air inlet through the tower, respectively. A parametric analysis explores various parameters like outside air temperature, humidity, and velocity, along with room wall temperatures. Reynolds and Grashof numbers range from 8.57×103-1.99×105 and 2.20×109-1.31×1010, respectively. Simulations are validated against experimental data, with deviations under 5.0%, 10.0%, and 19.6% for dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and air velocity. The system shows improved heat extraction efficiency under dominant forced convection conditions. Humidification yields PPD values between 10.0% to 46.0% and PMV values below 0 at air temperatures range 25.0-30.0 °C. At air temperatures of 35.0 °C with air humidity below 40.0%, PPD values remain below 20.0%. However, above 40% humidity, humidification is less effective. The air exchange effectiveness reduction due to humidification is minimal at 0.61%. These results illustrate the combination of parameters necessary for the optimal performance of the tower-room system, this study provides a valuable guide for integrating wind towers with humidification systems in building design and contributing to reduced electricity use and CO2 emissions.

Introduction Surgical cap attire plays an important role in creating a safe and sterile environment in procedural suites, thus the choice of reusable versus disposable caps has become an issue of much debate. Given the lack of evidence for differences in surgical site infection (SSI) risk between the two, selecting the cap option with a lower carbon footprint may reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures. However, many institutions continue to recommend the use of disposable bouffant caps. Methods ISO-14044 guidelines were used to complete a process-based life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impact of disposable bouffant caps and reusable cotton caps, specifically focusing on CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions, water use and health impacts. Results Reusable cotton caps reduced CO2e emissions by 79% when compared to disposable bouffant caps (10 kg versus 49 kg CO2e) under the base model scenario with a similar reduction seen in disability-adjusted life years. However, cotton caps were found to be more water intensive than bouffant caps (67.56 L versus 12.66 L) with the majority of water use secondary to production or manufacturing. Conclusions Reusable cotton caps have lower total lifetime CO2e emissions compared to disposable bouffant caps across multiple use scenarios. Given the lack of evidence suggesting a superior choice for surgical site infection prevention, guidelines should recommend reusable cotton caps to reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures.

With increasing focus on equitable and just energy transition, it is critical to understand the trade-offs of different decarbonization outcomes across economic, environmental, and social sustainability criteria. In this analysis, we use a multi-criteria decision analysis to quantify sustainability outcomes across 32 decarbonization outcomes in 2050 in the U.S. The economic sustainability criteria we use are system cost, national average retail rate, and electricity system employment. The environmental sustainability criteria we use are life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, life cycle water depletion, life cycle land transformation, and air pollution fatalities. The social sustainability (distributional impacts) criteria we use are retail rate equality across states, electricity employment equality across low-income households, and air pollution disparities across census tracts. We evaluate performance across these criteria under eleven different stakeholder preference scenarios. We find that decarbonization policies with indefinitely extended tax credits have the highest sustainability score under equal criteria weighting, with greater investments in renewable energy technologies, and result in better environmental, system cost, job, and air pollution disparities compared to mid-case scenarios, that only include current policies and CO2 reduction targets. We also see that our multi-criteria decision analysis identifies decarbonization outcomes that would not have been identified as optimal under a single objective, which highlights the importance of trade-off analyses to understand decarbonization outcomes more holistically.

Land is a big issue in population dense country like India to implement large scale PV plant, whereas Grid-tied PV system is more economic than off- grid system in long run. The solar energy mission of the country will be success- ful if more and more small-scale rooftop plant will be developed. To address this issue and to find out different aspects of small-scale rooftop grid-tied PV plants, a 1kWp rooftop grid-tied PV plant is developed and different aspects of the plant on changed climate condition are studied. The study on the plant performance revealed that panel efficiency, inverter efficiency and overall system efficiency are 12.55%, 94.94% and 11.86% respectively. Array Yield, Reference Yield and final Yield of the plant are found to be 4.74,5.002 and 4.45 respectively. Also, authors analyzed capture loss, system loss and performance ratio are found to be 0.262,0.29 and 0.89 respectively. Reduction of the overall plant efficiency due to dust accumulation over the panels with changed climate condition is 0.6% for lower radiation levels and 1.6% for higher radiation levels after 4 consecutive non-cleaning days in Kolkata. Overall efficiency drops to 6.45% from 12.545% for continuous 60 non- cleaning days. From the environmental point of view the plant generates around 1149.75 kWh of electricity and fed to the grid which in turn reduces around 0.9 tons of CO2 to mix with the atmosphere annually. Apart from that the system has been compared with the simulation study in PV sol soft- ware and the production forecast, panel temperature and performance ratio has been carried out for annual basis. The payback period of the plant is evaluated as 11 years which is far less than the total life span of the plant which is 25 years. So, the results from the study sound positive for small scale grid-tied rooftop plants.

At the current stage of economic development, environmental factors have become crucial in improving the energy efficiency of production. This includes environmental protection, controlling harmful emissions from fuel combustion, energy produced per unit of CO2 released, and managing industrial waste. These indicators, although may seem like restrictions, actually stimulate the implementation of measures to improve energy conservation. Developing an energy strategy for an enterprise is a complex process that requires considering several factors and reviewing them periodically in connection with new technological advancements and competitor initiatives. Without such a strategy, a company cannot create a clear and precise program to improve energy efficiency, which is essential to be a competitive production today. However, it is worth noting that developing an energy efficiency program for a production complex is particularly challenging. It is because optimizing the energy efficiency of individual components alone cannot ensure the overall energy efficiency of the complex as it is a complex socioeconomic system. To maintain competitiveness, the enterprise should reduce its costs, which can be achieved through energy efficiency and energy-saving programs based on a cost leadership strategy. This strategy involves reducing product prices by reducing costs (including energy costs) to attract more consumers, resulting in increased profit volumes. Alternatively, the enterprise can reduce costs (including energy) without reducing product prices while maintaining market share, resulting in increased profit from the sale of each unit of production. A cost reduction strategy to improve energy efficiency and save energy should consider the existence of such costs in almost all parts of the company's value chain, with the scale of production being the most important.

Microalgae are an excellent carbon concentrators with substantial lipid content. However, biomass production vis-à-vis lipid hyperaccumulation is a major constraint in the biofuel economy. In this regard, Dunaliella salina, an oleaginous, wall less microalga, was grown in graded concentration of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). There was a significant increase in biomass (1.57-fold), photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm = 0.72), and chlorophyll a content in 0.25 mg/L IAA supplemented cultures over the control (stage I). However, supplementation of IAA under nitrogen deprivation (stage II) led to a significant rise in the lipid content (47 % DCW), carbohydrate (18.37 %) and simultaneous reduction in the oxidative status (MDA, H2O2, O2·−, OH·) over the control. Further, 0.25 mg/L IAA supplemented cultures under nitrogen starvation were undertaken for biomass and lipid characterization. Nile red based flow cytometric analysis revealed an apparent increase in the neutral lipid fluorescence, also validated by 1H- NMR based lipidome, revealing the presence of triacylglycerol (TAG, 4.12–4.31 ppm). FTIR spectra revealed the increased absorbance at 2926 cm−1, 1740 cm−1 and 1025 cm−1, validating the increased carbohydrate and lipid, while biomass pyrolysis showed 81.42 % decomposition in the active pyrolytic zone as recorded by the TGA/DTG analysis. Interestingly, elemental analysis (CHNS) of the biomass showed an increased carbon and hydrogen %, HHV (19.94 MJ kg−1), H/C ratio (1.78), and CO2 fixation rate. Thus, the present study opens new avenues for the economic feasibility of bioenergy/biofuel production from microalgal biomass at commercial scale.

The paper aims to clarify the regulation mechanism of sulfur migration and transformation in a low water-binder ratio system incorporating phosphogypsum aggregate (LWC-PG). Firstly, the combination of S-containing adhesive material and phosphate gypsum aggregate can reduce the migration of sulfate ions (SO42-) in the phosphate gypsum aggregate. The reaction mechanism and macro and micro properties of LWC-PG are characterized by universal testing machine, low field nuclear magnetic field, isothermal calorimeter, XRD diffractometer, scanning electron microscope and nano-indentation. The results show that the calcium sulfoaluminate cementitious system (CSA) is compatible with PG. The results show that CSA is compatible with PG, and the 28d strength of 80% phosphogypsum is 83.4MPa, which can maintain the required strength for high-performance concrete. Secondly, the sulfides in PG react with C4A6S in CSA, resulting in the formation of ettringite that coats the surface of the C-S-H gel, thereby retarding the hydration rate of the slurry. However, due to the presence of phosphate gypsum aggregate, the reaction continues, enhancing the hydration of sulfate cement. Moreover, the interfacial transition zone between the PG and matrix exhibits a strong bond and shows no significant signs of deterioration. Lastly, when using 80% phosphogypsum aggregate instead of natural sand and gravel to produce 100 m3 of concrete, 42 t of phosphogypsum aggregate can be used, which reduces the consumption of natural sand and gravel by 61.4 t, decreases energy consumption by 3070 MJ, reduces CO2 emissions by 178.06 kg, SO2 emissions by 0.37 kg, NOX emissions by 0.25 kg, and dust emissions by 0.087 kg. Life cycle evaluation demonstrates that the production of LWC-PG is associated with low carbon emissions and environmental friendliness, which significantly reduces environmental burden. This is of significant research importance for solid waste management and energy-saving and carbon reduction efforts.

The emission factor method (Tier 1) recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is commonly used to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock and poultry farms. However, the estimation accuracy may vary due to practical differences in manure management across China. The objectives of this study were to estimate the direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from dairy manure management between 1990 and 2021 in China and characterize its spatial and temporal variations following IPCC guideline Tier 2. The N2O emission factor (EF) of dairy cow manure management systems was determined at the national level and regional level as well. The results showed that the national cumulative N2O emission of manure management from 1990 to 2021 was 113.1million tons of CO2 equivalent, ranging from 90.3 to 135.9 million tons with an uncertainty of ±20.2%. The annual EF was 0.021 kg N2O-N (kg N)−1 for total emissions, while it was 0.014 kg N2O-N (kg N)−1 for direct emissions. The proportions of N2O emissions in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central and Southern China, Southwest China and Northwest China were 32.3%, 18.6%, 11.4%, 5.8%, 6.1% and 25.8%, respectively. In addition, N2O emissions varied among farms in different scales. The respective proportions of total N2O emissions from small-scale and large-scale farms were 64.8% and 35.2% in the past three decades. With the improvement in farm management and milk production efficiency, the N2O emissions per unit mass of milk decreased from 0.77 × 10−3 kg to 0.48 × 10−3 kg in 1990–2021. This study may provide important insights into compiling a GHG emission inventory and developing GHG emission reduction strategies for the dairy farming system in China.

Boosting solutions such as turbochargers are one of the popular technologies in the development of IC engines. Turbochargers date back to their usage on aircraft engines in the early nineteenth century and started usage in heavy-duty Caterpillar engines in 1954. Later they were introduced in passenger car applications in the early 1960s and became more popular after the 1990s due to the usage of high-power density engines in passenger cars. Popular technologies in engine air management systems such as variable valve timing (VVT), supercharging, turbocharging and intercooling have significantly improved engine power-to-weight and power-to-displacement ratios. Turbocharging internal combustion engine is widely recognized as one of the best and most cost-effective technologies for the enhanced benefits in power density, low-end torque, fuel consumption (CO2 emissions), transient performance etc. Basis the benefits of fuel efficiency from turbocharging, it is considered as one of the key technologies to adopt for CAFE standards (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) with downsized engines. Globally turbocharging has gained popularity and higher penetration year on year in diesel, gasoline, and bi-fuel /Natural gas engine types. The boosting system has been undergoing upgradation with various add-on features to meet performance and emission needs. The introduction of emission norms like RDE (Real Driving Emission) drives engines to optimise for a reduction in scavenging, maintain λ = 1 in full operations and usage of the gas particulate filter to meet the Particulate number (PN) limit. In gasoline engines, there is a need to incorporate advanced combustion technologies like Miller/Atkinson and Low-Pressure Exhaust Gas Recirculation (LPEGR), with lean burn combustion for improved fuel economy. In this chapter, the benefits and challenges of the turbocharger boosting system and its integration into the gasoline engine are described. Additionally, the simpler ways of modelling the engine air management system to help the selection of the right boosting solutions are described.

Solar-based home PV systems are the most amazing eco-friendly energy innovations in the world, which are not only climate-friendly but also cost-effective solutions. The tropical environment of Malaysia makes it difficult to adopt photovoltaic (PV) systems because of the protracted rainy monsoon season, which makes PV systems useless without backup batteries. Large quantities of lithium-ion battery (LIB) trash are being produced by the electric vehicle (EV) sector. A total of 75% of the highest capacity levels have been discarded. By 2035, it is predicted that the wasted LIBs held as a result of expensive recycling and difficult material separation would carry up to 1200 GWh. An economical and sustainable option is offered by our study, which prototypes a replicated LIB pack that is incorporated into a PV home system. This study investigates the transformational power of second-life electric vehicle batteries (SLEVBs) when incorporated into home photovoltaic (PV) systems. The concept entails reusing existing electric vehicle batteries for stationary applications, offering a unique approach to extending the life of these batteries while meeting the growing need for sustainable domestic energy storage. The study looks at the technological feasibility, economic viability, and environmental effect of introducing SLEVBs into household PV systems, giving vital insight into their role in revolutionizing energy storage techniques and promoting sustainability. In comparison to the Lead–Acid Battery (LAB) system, the SLEVB system has a cheaper total cost of ownership, with savings of 12.62% compared with new LABs. A CO2 emission reduction of at least 20% is achieved by using the SLEVB system compared with LABs. Electricity can be provided in houses in rural areas where there is no electricity. As a result, the security and superiority of the life of rural residents will improve. It is anticipated that the suggested strategy will lower EV pricing, enabling EV adoption for M40 and B40 groups. Consequently, the Malaysian and worldwide EV business will remain viable.

Biocrusts are common living covers found across drylands worldwide, and their photosynthesis substantially contributes to carbon input in these ecosystems. However, direct monitoring of biocrusts' photosynthetic carbon fixation is challenging due to their scattered distribution, dark pigments, and lower CO2 exchange rate. Current studies have limited monitoring frequency and the results are difficult to extend to a broader spatial scale. Greenness typically functions as an indicator of both vegetation cover and plant photosynthesis. Monitoring biocrust greenness is expected to be able to provide insights into their environmental responses and estimate carbon fixation rates, particularly for moss biocrusts. Here, we monitored greenness, soil moisture and temperature, and gross primary productivity (GPP) of moss biocrusts, as well as climatic factors over two years in the northern China's Loess Plateau. The results indicated that moss biocrust greenness was highly sensitive to changing environmental conditions and exhibited significant temporal variability. Moss biocrust greenness exhibited a notably higher value in wet season (0.384) than in dry season (0.259). According to these greenness values, we proposed moss biocrust activity and classified it into high (>0.403), medium (0.334–0.403), low (0.271–0.333), and dormancy (<0.270). Soil moisture, relative humidity, and wind speed were the three main determinates of moss biocrust greenness. Higher soil moisture and relative humidity were linked to increased greenness, whereas elevated wind speed led to a reduction. In dry seasons, soil moisture contributed 23.4 % to the variation in moss biocrust greenness, while in wet seasons relative humidity contributed 16.1 %. A significant and positive correlation between moss biocrust greenness and GPP was found, and annual GPP prediction based on greenness using machine learning performed well. Our study highlights the significance of moss biocrust greenness and their potential as indicators for moss biocrust photosynthetic carbon fixation rates and possibly other ecological functions in drylands.

Abstract Fractured reservoir simulation is important and applicable to understand many processes related to subsurface geo-energy recovery and storage, such as shale gas/oil, enhanced geothermal systems, and CO2 sequestration in basaltic rocks. However, such simulations are often computationally expensive to capture the high contrast of permeability and pore volume between matrix and fracture. Therefore, a reduced order model (ROM) can be extremely beneficial for fractured reservoir simulation to reduce computational costs for iterative history-matching and reservoir optimization workflows. In this study, we propose a novel ROM that flexibly honors fracture representations, namely DiagNet. In DiagNet, we generate the coarse matrix nodes based on the reservoir outlines, and add extra diagonal connections between non-neighboring matrix nodes if intersecting fractures traverse them, which avoids the inclusion of additional fracture nodes. Since dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can facilitate the model parameterization, we adopt PCA to generate quality priors for sampling of the matrix transmissibility and pore volume arrays. Further, the DiagNet models are then calibrated to the well observation data (such as well flow rates and bottom-hole pressures), and a gradient-based optimization method is implemented in a general automatic-differentiable simulator framework to tune the model parameters (e.g., matrix/fracture transmissibilities, pore volumes, and well indices). Our results show that we can perform robust calibration of DiagNet based on the synthetic well observation data from a fine-scale reference simulation model. We have found that it is necessary to incorporate the dominant flow physics (i.e., water breakthrough) from the observation data to improve the training convergence and the prediction accuracy for DiagNet. Further, PCA for parameterization improves the convergence rate of model calibration, as compared to random initialization. Interpretation of the calibrated transmissibility field from DiagNet aligns with high connectivity regions from the fine-scale reference model. As a result, the new DiagNet is interpretable in terms of reservoir connectivity or geology and thus can be used for reservoir history-matching using observation data from the field and the further optimization.

In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the capacity to generate energy faces significant hurdles. Despite efforts to integrate renewable energy sources and natural gas power plants into the energy portfolio, the desired reduction in environmental impact and alleviation of energy poverty remain elusive. Hence, exploring a spectrum of hybrid technologies, encompassing storage and hydrogen-based solutions, is imperative to optimize energy production while mitigating harmful emissions. To exemplify this necessity, the 216 MW Kribi gas power plant in Cameroon is the case study. The primary aim is to investigate cutting-edge emissions and energy schemes within the SSA. This paper assessed the minimum complaint load technique and four power-to-fuel options from technical, financial, and environmental perspectives to assess the viability of a natural gas fuel system powered with hydrogen in a hybrid mode. The system generates hydrogen by using water electrolysis, with photovoltaic electricity and gas power plant. This research also assesses process efficiency, storage capacity, annual costs, carbon avoided costs, and production prices for various fuels. Results showed that the LCOE from a photovoltaic solar plant is 0.19$/kWh, with the Power-to-Hydrogen process (76.2% efficiency) being the most efficient, followed by the ammonia and urea processes. The study gives a detailed examination of the hybrid hydrogen natural gas fuel system. According to the annual cost breakdown, the primary costs are associated with the acquisition of electrical energy and electrolyser CAPEX and OPEX, which account for 95% of total costs. Urea is the cheapest mass fuel. However, it costs more in terms of energy. Hydrogen is the most cost-effective source of energy. In terms of energy storage and energy density by volume, the methane resulted as the most suitable solution, while the ammonia resulted as the best H2 storage medium in terms of kg of H2 per m3 of storage (108 kgH2/m3). By substituting the fuel system with 15% H2, the environmental effects are reduced by 1622 tons per year, while carbon capture technology gathered 16,664 tons of CO2 for methanation and urea operations, yielding a total carbon averted cost of 21 $/ton.

Tar-rich coal contains more hydrogen-rich structures such as aliphatic side chains and bridge bonds, which is a good raw material for coal to oil. In-situ underground pyrolysis of tar-rich coal has significant advantages such as environmental friendliness and high safety factor; it is an efficient coal utilization technology. Due to the influence of geological structure and other factors in the formation process, underground coal seam was often heterogeneous, generally accompanied by coal gangue interlayers. Due to the coal gangue being relatively dense and has poor thermal conductivity, it is also rich in metal oxides, it would inevitably affect the pyrolysis characteristics and product distribution during pyrolysis process of heterogeneous tar-rich coal seam. The pyrolysis characteristics of heterogeneous tar-rich coal seam with different positions and layers of coal gangue interlayer were investigated by the thermogravimetric analyzer, and related kinetic parameters were obtained by the distributed activation energy model (DAEM). Based on the fixed bed tube furnace reactor, the pyrolysis experiments of heterogeneous tar-rich coal seam with different positions and layers of coal gangue interlayer were also carried out, and the pyrolysis products were characterized and analyzed. The thermogravimetric results showed that in the pyrolysis process of heterogeneous tar-rich coal seam, the initial pyrolysis temperature and the temperature corresponding to maximum weight loss rate shifted to the higher temperature range, and the pyrolysis characteristic index decreased significantly. Under the same conditions, the corresponding pyrolysis characteristic indexes of the upper coal gangue interlayer and 4 layers of coal gangue interlayer were lower, which were 11.69 (10-8⋅%⋅min-1⋅°C-3) and 11.65 (10-8⋅%⋅min-1⋅°C-3), respectively. Compared with homogeneous tar-rich coal seam, pyrolysis activation energies of heterogeneous coal seam generally showed the decreasing trend. Under the conditions of the upper part containing coal gangue interlayer and the upper-and-lower parts containing coal gangue interlayer, the pyrolysis activation energies were higher due to the hindrance of the cover layer of coal gangue to the volatile release, which were 555.88 kJ·mol-1 and 546.66 kJ·mol-1 respectively. The results of fixed bed pyrolysis experiments showed that compared with homogeneous tar-rich coal seam, the tar yield obtained was reduced, the degree of tar lightening was significantly improved, and the proportion of lighter tar was up to 70.00 wt.%. The contents of aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds in tar increased, the contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds decreased significantly, and the maximum reductions were nearly 4.50 wt.% and 6.50 wt.%, respectively. The gas yield increased, the proportions of H2 and CO2 in the gas increased, and the proportions of CO and CH4 decreased to varying degrees. The tar yields were lower under the conditions of upper gangue and 4 layers gangue, which were 6.53 wt.% and 5.81 wt.%, respectively, and the degrees of tar lightening were also more significant. From the relationship between pyrolysis characteristic parameters and tar properties of heterogeneous tar-rich coal seam pyrolysis, it was found that the existence of coal gangue interlayer was not conducive to the tar production, but it could promote the lightening of tar and improve the tar quality.
