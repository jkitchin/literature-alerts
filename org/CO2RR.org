<p>Inorganic, organic, and hybrid two-dimensional (2D) materials are being developed for ever-expanding numbers of applications, though energy and catalysis remain the main drivers of their development. We present overviews of bottom-up and top-down synthetic strategies of such materials and examine manufacturing scalability issues. Mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties and their modulation are highlighted because they are fundamental to the above-mentioned drivers. The burgeoning importance of heterostructures in such materials, particularly for catalysis and electrode design and function is stressed. Detailed attention is given to applications of 2D materials to the electrocatalysis reactions: oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. Water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction by photocatalysis are also examined. A perspective of expected advances in the expansion of applications and types of 2D materials, with a focus on heterostructure development, is presented in the conclusion.</p>

Despite great efforts that have been made, photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction still faces enormous challenges due to the sluggish kinetics or disadvantageous thermodynamics. Herein, cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs) were loaded onto carbon, oxygen-doped boron nitride (BN) and encapsulated by titanium carbide (Ti3C2, MXene) layers to construct a ternary composite. The uniform distribution of CdS QDs and the tight interfacial interaction among the three components could be achieved by adjusting the loading amounts of CdS QDs and MXene. The ternary 100MX/CQ/BN sample gave a productive rate of 2.45 and 0.44 μmol g-1 h−1 for carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4), respectively. This CO yield is 1.93 and 6.13 times higher than that of CdS QDs/BN and BN counterparts. The photocatalytic durability of the ternary composite is significantly improved compared with CdS QDs/BN because MXene can protect CdS from photocorrosion. The characterization results demonstrate that the excellent CO2 adsorption and activation capabilities of BN, the visible light absorption of CdS QDs, the good conductivity of MXene and the well-matched energy band alignment jointly promote the photocatalytic performance of the ternary catalyst.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is sensitive to the microenvironment surrounding catalytic active sites. Although the impact of changing electrolyte composition on CO2 reduction kinetics in aqueous electrolytes has been studied intensively, less is known about the influence of the electrochemical environment in non-aqueous solvents. Here, we present data demonstrating that organic alkyl ammonium cations influence catalytic performance in non-aqueous media and describe a physical model that rationalizes these observations. Using results from a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational techniques, we argue that the interfacial electric field present at the catalyst surface is sensitive to the molecular identity of the organic cation in the aprotic electrolyte. This is true irrespective of solvent, electrolyte ionic strength, or the supporting electrolyte counter anion. Our results suggest that changes in the interfacial field can be attributed to differences in the cation-electrode distance. Changes in the electric field strength are consequential to CO2R to CO as they modify the energetics of the kinetically relevant CO2 activation step.

Abstract Precisely designing asymmetrical structure is an efficient strategy to optimize the performance of metallic catalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Herein, a transient high-density current induced by pulsed discharge is used to rapidly construct graphene aerogel (GAs) supported asymmetric Cu cluster catalysts. Cu atoms decomposed by CuCl 2 are converged on graphene surfaces in GAs together with oxygen originating from the intense current and instantaneous high temperature. The atomic and electronic structures of Cu nanoclusters exhibit asymmetric distribution due to lattice distortion and O-doping in Cu crystals. Typically, in CO 2 reduction reactions, the selectivity and activity of ethanol are related to the asymmetric structure and strong interfacial interaction of Cu-O/C moieties, exhibiting an ideal Faradaic efficiency (ethanol 75.3% and C 2+ products 90.5%) at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Meanwhile, the benefit of the strong interaction between Cu nanoclusters and GA supports, the catalyst exhibits long-term stability. In situ XAFS reveals that the Cu 4 -Cu/C 2 O 1 interaction displays the effective active sites in CO 2 RR. The pathways of corresponding products and the reaction mechanism on Cu 4 -Cu/C 2 O 1 moieties are revealed through the in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the calculation of density functional theory. This work gives a new solution to solve the challenge for balancing the activity and stability of asymmetric-structure catalysts toward energy conversion reactions.

The membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs) electrolyzers are the most attractive systems for the electrolytic conversion of CO2 into commodity chemicals and fuels at commercially relevant current densities. Suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is vital to the highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, little attention has been paid to the HER. Herein, polybenzimidazole (PBI) Janus membranes with significant hydrophobic/hydrophilic asymmetric surface wettability were constructed for regulating the HER in CO2RR. The HER was modulated by adjusting the microstructure and surface hydrophobicity of the membrane as well as the CO2 feeding method. The p-PBI-HCF MEA showed a significant suppression of HER and a 6-fold improvement in CO selectivity over p-PBI MEA. The p-PBI-HCF exhibited superior CO2RR performance in MEA compared to commercial membranes (FAA-3-50 and Nafion115). At 2.0–3.0 V, the CO Faraday efficiency (FECO) of the p-PBI-HCF MEA electrolyzer remained above 92%. The optimal energy efficiency range was between 2.0 and 2.4 V when the FECO was close to 100%. The p-PBI-HCF provided 92% FECO and a current density of 225 mA cm−2 at 3 V. This work provides guidelines for the development of viable PBI membranes and MEAs for CO2RR.

Converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemicals such as fossil resources via photocatalysis requires the development of advanced materials. Herein, we coupled zirconium-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) containing porphyrin and Cu-porphyrin with anatase TiO2. The effect of the porphyrin metalation proportion was also investigated. Notably, while the use of free-base porphyrin as the organic linker resulted in the development of PCN-224, the presence of Cu-porphyrin provided mixed-phase MOF structures containing both PCN-224 and PCN-222. MOF/TiO2 composites bearing partial (50%) metalated porphyrin were proven more active and selective towards the production of CH4, at ambient conditions, in the gas phase and using water vapors without the use of hole scavengers. The optimized composite bearing 15 wt.% of the partial metalated MOF was three times more active than pure TiO2 towards CH4 production. This study provides insights on the effect of precise materials engineering at a molecular level on the development of advanced MOF-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.
