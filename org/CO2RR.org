This work studied the composition of Ni-Co-ZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst on properties and efficiency of catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CMR) when CO2 was fed as the limiting reagent and CH4 as the excess reactant. 9wt%Ni-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3, 4.5wt%Ni-4.5%wtCo-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3, 9wt%Co-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 and 7wt%Co-3wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method. The physicochemical properties of present catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption H2-TPR and CO2-TPD. The CRM performance was determined in a tubular fixed-bed reactor at 600 °C for 6 h with limiting of carbon dioxide. The carbon deposition on spent catalysts were examined by TGA. The results showed that Co-ZrO2 catalysts provided greater activities, selectivity toward H2 and stability than Ni-ZrO2 and Ni-Co-ZrO2 catalysts. 9wt%Co-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 provided higher reactant conversions and H2/CO ratio than 7wt%Co-3wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 while the minimum coke formation was observed on spent 7wt%Co-3wt%ZrO2/Al2O3. It is because oxophilic properties and oxygen vacancy sites in Co-ZrO2 increase CO2 dissociative adsorption as well as oxygen transport on the catalyst surface. HIGHLIGHTS This work developed Ni-Co-ZrO2/Al2O3 catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CMR) when CO2 is fed as the limiting reagent demonstrated petroleum refinery application. Remarkable points of this work are revealed below. Co-ZrO2 catalysts provided greater reactant activities, selectivity toward H2 and stability than Ni-ZrO2 and Ni-Co-ZrO2 The oxophilic property accompanied with oxygen vacancy sites in Co-ZrO2 increase CO2 dissociative absorption and oxygen transport on the catalyst surface. 9wt%Co-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 provided relative highest reactant conversions and highest H2/CO ratio. 7wt%Co-3wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 presented the minimum coke formation.

Carbon dioxide is a significant byproduct from the usage of fossil fuels. Due to the rapid development of industry and the swift growth of urban populations, carbon dioxide has been accumulating in large quantities over the past decades. In terms of new energy research, carbon dioxide reduction has been given significant attention due to its non-toxic nature and the high utility of the products from its reduction. Electrochemical reduction, in particularly, has been highlighted for its notable benefits. This paper introduces the mechanism of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, its current shortcomings, and methods of improvement, summarizing the recent deficiencies and advancements in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. The current belief is that refining the electrolytes like ionic liquids and using catalysts such as graphene and its derivatives can enhance the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. This paper looks forward to research findings that will discover better electrolytes and catalysts to address the current deficiencies in carbon dioxide reduction and hopes to promote the full potential of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction in future new energy applications.

Since the turn of the twenty-first century, the need to find new energy sources to create a low-carbon society has grown urgently due to the ongoing rise in greenhouse gas emissions, which are mostly caused by CO2. The technique that uses solar energy to convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels can produce high-value hydrocarbon fuels like methane, methanol, formic acid, or C2+. This is a promising method of achieving global carbon balance. One of the key elements influencing the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is the presence of materials having photocatalytic properties. Therefore, exploring and developing efficient photocatalytic functional materials is the main direction of research today. This article first introduces the development history of photo-functional materials and analyzes their mechanisms in photocatalytic reactions. Then, different types of optical functional materials were classified and introduced in detail. Finally, the development trend of photo-functional materials in the catalytic reduction of CO2 was emphasized.

Abstract The electrochemical co‐reduction of CO 2 and NO 3 − to urea is an alternative to traditional urea synthesis. However, the significant difference in the energy barriers and reaction rates for CO 2 and NO 3 − reduction restricts the efficiency of the CN coupling. Herein, we report a strategy to coordinate the CN coupling intermediates by unilaterally increasing the efficiency of CO 2 reduction to match that of facile NO 3 − reduction. We demonstrate this strategy using an electrochemical reaction system consisting of a Cu 2 O‐loaded ordered gas‐diffusion electrode, which offers a high urea yield rate of 1373.5 μg h −1 mg cat. −1 at a low applied potential of −0.6 V versus RHE. This work not only provides a feasible strategy to coordinate the reductive coupling of CO 2 and NO 3 − , but also brings new insight into the reaction mechanism of urea electrosynthesis.

It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF‐based supported low‐nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three‐dimensional (3D) microporous Cu‐based MOF, that achieves a single‐product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at −1.0 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm−2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi‐site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C−C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2‐to‐ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2‐to‐EtOH.

Photocatalytic technology, which is regarded as a green route to transform solar energy into chemical fuels, plays an important role in the fields of energy and environmental protection. An emerging S-scheme heterojunction with the tightly coupled interface, whose photocatalytic efficiency exceeds those of conventional type II and Z-scheme photocatalysts, has received much attention due to its rapid charge carrier separation and strong redox capacity. This review provides a systematic description of S-scheme heterojunction in the photocatalysis, including its development, reaction mechanisms, preparation, and characterization methods. In addition, S-scheme photocatalysts for CO2 reduction are described in detail by categorizing them as 0D/1D, 0D/2D, 0D/3D, 2D/2D, and 2D/3D. Finally, some defects of S-scheme heterojunctions are pointed out, and the future development of S-scheme heterojunctions is proposed.

Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction (CO2RR) presents a transformative approach for the sustainable synthesis of fuels and chemicals to address pressing environmental challenges. The efficiency and selectivity of the CO2RR largely depend on the catalyst. Among which, Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs) have surfaced as a prominent design for this reaction, offering exceptional activity and selectivity. This paper delves into the progress and perspectives of SACs in CO2RR, tracing their historical evolution, unique advantages, and underlying mechanisms. The superior atomic utilization, distinct electronic configurations, and enhanced product specificity of SACs over traditional catalysts have opened novel pathways for more efficient conversion of CO2 to potent resources. However, challenges particularly concerning the stability, scalability, and product diversity of these catalysts constitutes as major impediments. Recent innovations, from advanced characterization techniques to novel synthesis methods, are spotlighted, showcasing the strides the scientific community has made. Looking forward, this paper underscores the potential of SACs in bridging sustainable energy sources with green chemical production and discuss prospective strategies to overcome existing limitations.

A chromium complex carrying two benzanellated N‐heterocyclic phosphenium (bzNHP) ligands was prepared by a salt metathesis approach. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the anellation enhances the π‐acceptor ability of the NHP‐units, which is confirmed by the facile electrochemical reduction of the complex to a spectroscopically characterized radical anion. Co‐photolysis with H2 allowed extensive conversion into a σ‐H2‐complex, which shows a diverse reactivity towards donors and isomerizes under H–H bond fission and shift of a hydride to a P‐ligand. The product carrying phosphenium, phosphine and hydride ligands was also synthesized independently and reacts reversibly with CO and MeCN to yield bis‐phosphine complexes under concomitant Cr‐to‐P‐shift of a hydride. In contrast, CO2 was not only bound but reduced to give an isolable formato complex, which reacted with ammonia borane under partial recovery of the metal hydride and production of formate. Further elaboration of the reactions of the chromium complexes with CO2 and NH3BH3 allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of a Cr‐catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The various complexes described were characterized spectroscopically and in several cases by XRD studies. Further insights in reactivity patterns were provided through (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations.

The rapid development of the battery industry has brought about a large amount of waste battery pollution. How to realize the high-value utilization of waste batteries is an urgent problem to be solved. Herein, cobalt and titanium compounds (LTCO) were firstly recovered from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using the carbon thermal reduction approach, and plasmonic attapulgite/Co(Ti)Ox (H-ATP/Co(Ti)Ox) nanocomposites were prepared by the microwave hydrothermal technique. H-ATP had a large specific surface area and enough active sites to capture CO2 molecules. The biochar not only reduced the spinel phase of waste LIBs into metal oxides including Co3O4 and TiO2 but also increased the separation and transmission of the carriers, thereby accelerating the adsorption and reduction of CO2. In addition, H-ATP/Co(Ti)Ox exhibited a localized surface plasmon resonance effect (LSPR) in the visible to near-infrared region and released high-energy hot electrons, enhancing the surface temperature of the catalyst and further improving the catalytic reduction of CO2 with a high CO yield of 14.7 μmol·g−1·h−1. The current work demonstrates the potential for CO2 reduction by taking advantage of natural mineral and spent batteries.

With the elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the need for green and sustainable development, the need for electrochemical CO2 reduction technology is becoming more and more urgent. However, the electrochemical reduction technology still has difficulties and has not yet met the high requirements for large-scale industrialized production. In this paper, the field of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is deeply explored from the perspectives of technological features and applications, and the progress in this field is discussed in terms of cathode materials, anode materials, and electrolytes, and the application of electrochemical technology in the field of carbon dioxide reduction is investigated concerning the differences in the generating material and loading voltage. Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction technology can reduce carbon dioxide into utilizable industrial products by loading load voltage, and can selectively generate products such as formic acid, methanol, and methane by choosing different electrode materials and electrolytes, the selection of electrode materials and electrolytes and the selection of suitable load voltage are also the technical difficulties and the key points to realize industrial production. The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide technology has a wide range of applications in industrial production and energy saving and emission reduction, and this paper provides ideas for the understanding and further development of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide technolog.

This study proposes CO2 gasification of biochar as a potential carbon utilization pathway for greenhouse gas emission reduction. It aims to evaluate the effects of CO2 concentration on carbon and CO2 conversion and output CO yield. It also performs kinetic analysis, using the volume reaction model, to determine the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. The operating conditions utilized include gasification temperatures of 700, 800, and 900 °C; inlet CO2 concentrations of 15%, 30%, 45%, and 60% by volume (N2 balance); and a CO2 flow rate of 5 L/min. Carbon dioxide gasification of biochar was performed in a fixed bed batch reactor, and the composition of the output gases was analyzed. Increases in the temperature and inlet CO2 concentration both resulted in an increase in carbon conversion, with the maximum carbon conversion of 57.1% occurring at 900 °C and a 60% inlet CO2 concentration. The results also showed that CO2 conversion increased against temperature but decreased with an increasing inlet CO2 concentration. The maximum CO2 conversion of 76% was observed at 900 °C and a 15% inlet CO2 concentration. An activation energy in the range of 109 to 117 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor in the range of 63 to 253 s−1 were determined in this study.

Carbon neutrality or net zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases, refers to limiting emissions and eliminating greenhouse gases, thereby preventing their upsurge in the stratosphere that causes worldwide warming. Acute climate changes that could threaten the species' existence on earth. It is estimated that the sea level has augmented by 0.24 m and will be in the range of 0.3-1.5 m by 2100 due to global warming. The only way we can stop sustained and long-term sea level rise is to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to levels close to pre-industrial levels. This requires more than maintaining carbon levels. The carbon reduction would be the first big step for humanity to prevent the rapid destruction of the environment. The paper presents the issue of global warming due to greenhouse gases and necessary actions by Heating Ventilation Air-conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) industries for net zero emissions, which is the demand of the future and is a must for business growth without any harm to the environment.

The increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) have a huge environmental impact, and CO2 emission reduction is already a common view in our society. Recently, selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has attracted much attention because the process can effectively mitigate CO2 emissions and simultaneously produce high‐value‐added chemicals and fuels. The catalysts play a very important role in achieving high efficiency of CO2 to methanol. As one promising alternative, the alloy catalysts have demonstrated high performance in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol due to their unique geometry and electronic properties. Herein, we review the recent advances in alloy catalysts, including solid solution alloys and intermetallic compounds (mainly Cu‐based, In‐based, Ga‐based, and other alloy catalysts) for heterogeneous catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Moreover, the research ideas and development prospects of alloy catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol are overviewed to provide the ideas and references for the subsequent research on alloy catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation.

Urban areas contribute to over 80% of carbon dioxide emissions, and considerable efforts are being undertaken to characterize spatiotemporal variations of CO2 (carbon dioxide) at a city, regional, and national level, aiming at providing pipelines for carbon mission reduction. The complex underlying surface composition of urban areas makes process-based and physiology-based models inadequate for simulating carbon flux in this context. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to develop and investigate their viability in estimating carbon flux at the ecosystem level. All the data used in our study were derived from the long-term chronosequence observations collected from the flux towers within urban complex underlying surface, along with meteorological reanalysis datasets. To assess the generalization ability of these models, the following statistical metrics were utilized: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Our analysis revealed that the RF model performed the best in simulating carbon flux over long time series, with the highest R2 values reaching up to 0.852, and exhibiting the smallest RMSE and MAE values at 0.293 μmol·m−2·s−1 and 0.157 μmol·m−2·s−1. As a result, the RF model was chosen for simulating carbon flux at spatial scale and assessing the impact of urban impervious surfaces in the simulation. The results showed that the RF model performs well in simulating carbon flux at the spatial scale. The input of impervious surface area index can improve the performance of the RF model in simulating carbon flux, with R2 values of 84.46% (with the impervious surface area index in) and 83.74% (without the impervious surface area index in). Furthermore, the carbon flux in Fengxian District, Shanghai, exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity: the CO2 flux in the western part of Fengxian District was less than in the eastern part, and the CO2 flux gradually increased from the west to the east. In addition, we creatively introduced the diurnal impervious surface area index based on the Kljun model, and clarified the influence of impervious surface on the spatiotemporal simulation of CO2 flux over the complex urban underlying surface. Based on these findings, we conclude that the RF models can be effectively applied for estimating carbon flux on the complex underlying urban surface. The results of our study reduce the uncertainty in modeling carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, and make the variety of models for the carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems more diverse.

There is a consensus on the need to reduce the emissions of carbon compounds. The increase in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the maritime industry poses a serious challenge to environmental sustainability, climate change, and the operating costs of ships. This article shows how hybrid versus diesel propulsion technology for ships can help reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption, and how these changes can be achieved. The need to reduce exhaust emissions and the increasing need for the shipping industry to seek alternative fuels means that existing regulations for marine engines and engine emissions are being updated almost constantly and new regulations are being formulated. The cost implications of the new regulations may lead to an increase in emissions as engines with lower fuel consumption are chosen, i.e., larger marine engines. Alternative approaches are needed to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption, which could ultimately lead to hybrid propulsion for ships. This paper examines the current state of greenhouse gas emissions in shipping by analyzing the CO2 emissions and operating costs of two ships of the same type with similar technical and technological characteristics and different propulsion systems to gain insight into the problem. This paper compares the reductions in CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and fuel costs for two suction hopper dredgers with standard diesel and hybrid propulsion. The technical characteristics, CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and price of the two ships were analyzed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each propulsion system. The novelty of this study is that two suction hopper dredgers from the same company with similar technical–technological characteristics but different propulsion systems were used for the case study and a mathematical procedure for calculating CO2 and other greenhouse gasses was presented in comparison, all to determine to what extent and in what way the hybrid propulsion system of a ship can contribute to reductions in CO2 emissions and fuel costs at the ship and company levels compared to a standard diesel propulsion system. This comparative analysis shows how much lower CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and fuel cost savings can be expected when using a hybrid propulsion system compared to a standard diesel propulsion system. Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the efficiency and environmental compatibility of the two systems.

In order to estimate the effective storage capacity of carbon dioxide in geological storage, it makes great significance to understand the seepage mechanism of flowing carbon dioxide fluid and its influence on the occurrence state in micropore. In this paper, the molecular simulation method was used to obtain the optimal configuration of kaolinite micropore and carbon dioxide molecules. The molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the flow characteristics of carbon dioxide fluid in kaolinite pores in differential depth of burial under constant pressure drop. The results show that the adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide fluid on the wall of kaolinite decreases with the increase of burial depth, the fluid density in the center of the micropore increases with the increase of burial depth, the diffusion capacity of the fluid changes significantly when the burial depth is greater than 2 km; when a constant differential pressure is applied, the flow of carbon dioxide fluid in the pore conforms to the classical poiseulle flow, the diffusion ability of the fluid increases with the increase of burial depth, nearly doubling, and the slip length also increases with the increase of burial depth; the flow behavior significantly reduces the total amount of carbon dioxide in kaolinite micropore, where the density of the first adsorption layer near the wall decreases by at least 20%, and its effect on fluid is greater than that caused by the increase of burial depth. Therefore, when estimating the effective storage capacity of carbon dioxide in geological storage, the influence of pressure drop and burial depth on the total reduction of geological sequestration should be considered at the same time. The purpose is to provide more detailed theoretical basis for carbon dioxide geological sequestration.

Abstract Traditional DID models overlook variations in policy intensity, causing estimation deviations from the actual situation and a limited understanding of the influence mechanism. In response, the Intensity Modified SDID Model is built to examine the influence mechanism of ETS's carbon reductions. Moreover, through model extensions, the study explores the spatiotemporal characteristics and heterogeneities of ETS’s effects. Results show that: (1) "Dual-circulation" influence mechanism is confirmed, where ETS directly contributes to carbon reductions (2.70% to 10.0% impact) through external pathways, and internal pathways continuously strengthen reduction effects, comprehensive mechanisms are thereby formed and enhanced based on interaction among internal and external pathways. (2) Reasonable ETS levels are estimated and proposed to achieve "Dual Carbon Target", constraining nationwide carbon quotas by 20 billion tons/year, increasing carbon trading volumes by 80 thousand tons/year, and elevating the carbon trading prices by 100 RMB (14 USD) per ton. (3) ETS's carbon reduction effects are identified with temporal and spatial characteristics, temporally, effects peak in the 4th period ( Event + 4 ) but diminish in the 5th period ( Event + 5 ), spatially, effects peak in areas distancing around 1000 km but disappear beyond 1500 km. (4) ETS also has synergistic effects with atmospheric pollution reduction, including industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide and smoke (dust), but are insignificant to industrial emissions of wastewater and solid waste.

Abstract The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is a promising approach for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, allowing harmful CO 2 to be converted into more valuable carbon‐based products. On one hand, single carbon (C 1 ) products have been obtained with high efficiency and show great promise for industrial CO 2 capture. However, multi‐carbon (C 2+ ) products possess high market value and have demonstrated significant promise as potential products for CO 2 RR. Due to CO 2 RR's multiple pathways with similar equilibrium potentials, the extended reaction mechanisms necessary to form C 2+ products continue to reduce the overall selectivity of CO 2 ‐to‐C 2+ electroconversion. Meanwhile, CO 2 RR as a whole faces many challenges relating to system optimization, owing to an intolerance for low surface pH, systemic stability and utilization issues, and a competing side reaction in the form of the H 2 evolution reaction (HER). Ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) remains incredibly valuable within the chemical industry; however, the current established method for producing ethylene (steam cracking) contributes to the emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Thus, strategies to significantly increase the efficiency of this technology are essential. This review will discuss the vital factors influencing CO 2 RR in forming C 2 H 4 products and summarize the recent advancements in ethylene electrosynthesis.

Abstract Under the "dual carbon" goal, the new productive forces in the industrial energy sector will become an important force in promoting the green and high-quality development of the economy and society in Hubei Province. The article comprehensively applies the Tapio decoupling model and LMDI decomposition method, and uses panel data of the industrial industry in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2021 to empirically analyze the decoupling effect of industrial carbon emissions in Hubei Province and its driving factors. Our research has found that the industrial economic growth and carbon emissions in Hubei Province roughly exhibit a complex process of changes from strong decoupling to weak decoupling, then to strong decoupling, and finally to recessive decoupling. For a considerable period of time in the future, the industrial economic growth and carbon emissions in Hubei Province will still be weakly decoupled. From the decomposition results, it can be seen that the changes in the energy intensity index and carbon intensity index are basically consistent. The decrease in energy intensity has the greatest contribution to carbon dioxide reduction, becoming a key factor driving the reduction of industrial carbon intensity in Hubei. However, the dividends brought by structural effects are still not significant. On this basis, the article proposes relevant policy recommendations, providing theoretical basis and policy basis for the high-quality development of Hubei's industry and the construction of new productive forces in the post epidemic era.

Abstract. The Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT, ca. 40–33 Ma) marks a transformation from a largely ice-free to an icehouse climate mode that is well recorded by oxygen-stable isotopes and sea surface temperature proxies. Opening of the Southern Ocean gateways and decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been considered as factors in this global environmental transformation and the growth of ice sheets in Antarctica during the Cenozoic. A more comprehensive understanding is still needed of the interplay between forcing versus response, the correlation among environmental changes, and the involved feedback mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the spatio-temporal variation in export productivity using biogenic Ba (bio-Ba) from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites in the Southern Ocean, focusing on possible mechanisms that controlled them as well as the correlation of export productivity changes to changes in the global carbon cycle. We document two high export productivity events in the Southern Ocean during the late Eocene (ca. 37 and 33.5 Ma) that correlate to proposed gateway-driven changes in regional circulation and to changes in global atmospheric pCO2 levels. Our findings suggest that paleoceanographic changes following Southern Ocean gateway openings, along with more variable increases in circulation driven by episodic Antarctic ice sheet expansion, enhanced export production in the Southern Ocean from the late Eocene through early Oligocene. These factors may have played a role in episodic atmospheric carbon dioxide reduction, contributing to Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene–Oligocene transition.

Abstract Energy audits directly provided the industrial sector with reduced energy costs and avoided emissions. Still, they also lead to far-reaching indirect and induced local, regional, and national benefits. This paper aims to present the techno-economic-environmental analysis to achieve decarbonization through implementing industrial energy efficiency at micro and macro levels. An integrated techno-economic-environmental methodology is developed. Case studies of micro-level carbon reduction efforts through industrial energy efficiency technologies are presented. The broader macroeconomic and environmental effects of technology on society are analyzed using data from 206 energy audits of industrial compressed air systems conducted over 13 years. The impacts show that energy-efficient improvements lead to direct cost savings for manufacturers, boost economic activity across sectors, and affect carbon dioxide emissions both short-term and long-term in the region. Given their extensive benefits, energy audits significantly influence policymaking. We devised a methodology to link micro-level energy audit data with macroeconomic and environmental analyses to quantify these cascading benefits. The economic scenario analysis shows that $228 M has been saved from direct industrial energy savings from implementing all compressed air recommendations in the studied periods and the region. In addition, the investment made through manufacturers would create 2,025 jobs and $383 M annually, cascading regional economic impacts. The environmental analysis shows that the regional manufacturers have directly avoided about 2.8 M metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

The accountability audit of natural resources (AANR) is a major institutional arrangement for advancing the construction of an ecological civilization in China. Based on the panel data of 271 cities in China from 2005 to 2017, this paper investigates the relationship between the AANR and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions using a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model. The results show that AANR significantly increases the CO 2 emission reduction rate by 0.009 units at the 5% significance level. The results still hold after a series of robustness tests. Given all else being equal, this significant effect is 0.001. Further analyses show that AANR improves pilot cities’ CO 2 emission reduction rates mainly by enhancing their green innovation capability. The mediating effect of cities’ green technology innovation capability accounts for 96.00%, while the AANR’s direct effect only accounts for 4.00%. The AANR has significantly positive effects of 0.017% and 0.029% for western cities and cities with high fiscal pressure at the 5% and 1% significance levels, respectively. Therefore, strengthening AANR implementation by enhancing the mediating efficiency of cities’ green technology innovations and implementing dynamically differentiated AANR policies in Chinese meso-cities will contribute to the achievement of China’s carbon peaking and carbon neutrality targets.

The integration of biotechnology in green building represents a cutting-edge approach that harnesses biological processes to enhance sustainability and efficiency in construction practices. This abstract explores modern strategies and provides examples of how biotechnology is revolutionizing green building. Biotechnology offers innovative solutions to traditional challenges in green building, leveraging biological systems to optimize resource utilization, energy efficiency, and waste reduction. By integrating living organisms, biomaterials, and biological processes into building design and construction, biotechnology enables the development of structures that are not only environmentally friendly but also adaptive and resilient.One modern approach involves incorporating living organisms such as algae, bacteria, and fungi into building materials to enhance their performance. For example, algae can be used in bio-facades to capture carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, contributing to improved indoor air quality and reducing the building's carbon footprint. Similarly, bacteria can be embedded in concrete to repair cracks autonomously, increasing the durability and lifespan of structures while minimizing maintenance needs.

Abstract An expanding body of literature discusses the importance of sufficiency for sustainable development. However, conceptual vagueness stands in the way of the practical application of sufficiency as a sustainability strategy. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the concept of relations of enoughness , building on the general notion of ‘enough’, which is prevalent in sufficiency literature. Relations of enoughness will be explained based on the widespread use of sufficiency advocating for changes and reductions of individual consumption with the goal to reduce environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide emissions. Diverse uses and understandings of sufficiency can be united in a shared structure of ‘enough/too much/too little of X regarding Y’. Relations of enoughness can be connected to sustainability by expanding them into chains of enoughness , which serve as a conceptual foundation for the sustainable consumption corridor approach. Finally, the premises of sufficiency and potential for further research are discussed.

The quality of in situ XAS of electrochemical systems is highly sensitive to electrode disturbances, such as gas evolution and gas consumption at an electrolyte / catalyst interface. A novel in situ spectro‐electrochemical X‐ray absorption spectroscopy cell is presented as a new tool for the characterisation of gas evolving and consuming electrocatalysts at high overpotentials. By utilising a thin, porous membrane with efficient electrolyte and gas circulating loops, an improved three phase interface that enabled efficient gas supply and minimised the interference from bubble formation. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted in fluorescence mode with three experiments selected to demonstrate the cell’s performance. The first two reactions; an in‐situ study of a highly active amorphous iridium oxide catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction and an in‐situ study of copper oxide during the carbon dioxide reduction reaction are used to exemplify the XAS data quality achieved under operational conditions. Thirdly, a detailed XAS investigation of a highly dispersed platinum catalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction is presented, along with comparative data in nitrogen. These measurements show the retention of oxygen on the surface of the platinum metal particles down to 0.48 V (vs. RHE), well below the platinum oxide reduction peak.

Hydrogen as a potential future energy source provides a number of benefits in terms of sustainability, high energy density, and zero emissions. The production of hydrogen via water splitting is regarded as the cleanest and sustainable process. In contrast, fossil fuel combustion causes significant environmental problems through the production and release of secondary gases such as NO x , SO 2 , and CO 2 . It is vital to focus on reducing these harmful gases. CO 2 , a major pollutant produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and various human activities, plays a central role in the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. It is therefore imperative to actively eliminate and mitigate CO 2 levels to preserve the global environment. MXenes and MXene‐based catalysts exhibit both outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and CO 2 reduction. In this review, recent progress is systematically examined and discussed in the preparation and utilization of MXenes as catalysts for HER and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The discussion begins with a concise overview of the fabrication and characteristics of MXenes, followed by a comprehensive exploration of their efficacy as catalysts for HER and CO 2 RR.

The article deals with the issues of durability (Life time) of floors of industrial buildings associated with the presence of chlorine. It is shown that, together with carbon dioxide, chlorine forms well-soluble hygroscopic layers in the form of calcium chloride. The movement of chlorine salts causes corrosion of the reinforcement and penetrates deep into the concrete. Therefore, the service life of reinforced concrete elements when exposed to an external aggressive environment is reduced due to corrosion of reinforcement and concrete. Experimental data and analytical dependences of the advance of the front of chloride concentrations dangerous for reinforcement and destruction of concrete under the action of the considered aggressive environment are presented. A formula is derived for the design service life of reinforced concrete structures by the factor of the passivating action of the protective layer of concrete. An empirical dependence of the service life of the structure on the depth of corrosion (diameter reduction) of the reinforcement was also obtained. The coefficient of corrosive wear of reinforcement for rectangular and tee sections bending reinforced concrete elements is calculated.

Abstract Stormwater ponds are common features in urbanized landscapes because they enhance flood reduction and nutrient retention. With shallow depths and high inputs of organic matter, these systems can be highly productive with rapid oxygen depletion when thermally stratified or ice‐covered. However, most of our understanding of the biogeochemistry of stormwater ponds comes from the open water period. We explored under‐ice oxygen dynamics in 20 stormwater ponds in Madison, WI (USA) that were ice covered from late December to early March to investigate the drivers of bottom water oxygen saturation and the impact on the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ). Winter anoxia was driven by ice transmissivity, winter nutrient concentrations, and precedent summer productivity. Oxygen depletion led to overall higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in pond surface waters. This research enhances our understanding of winter pond biogeochemistry and its links to summer productivity.

The results of the researching process of obtaining composition powder material B 4 C–TiB 2 by carbide reduction of titanium dioxide, using carbon reducing agent – carbon nanofibers, are presented. Furthermore, the results of studying of some properties of ceramics made using the synthesized powder are presented. The synthesis of composite materials was carried out in an induction crucible furnace for 20 min in the temperature range of 1200–1900 °C in an argon atmosphere. It has been established that the optimum temperature of the synthesis is 1650 °C, irrespective of the batch composition. The characteristics of the composite powders containing 10–30 mol. % of the TiB 2 phase have been studied. X -ray electron microscopy has revealed that the particles of the powder are predominantly aggregated. There are two peaks in the particle size distribution histograms. The part of the histogram with a smaller particle size mainly characterizes the B 4 C phase. The part of the histogram with a larger particle size characterizes the TiB 2 phase. The average particle size of the B 4 C phase is in the range of 5.3–5.5 µm, and that of the TiB 2 phase is in the range of 33.6–41.9 µm. The average size of 50 % of composite powder’s particles for these contents does not exceed 13.4 μm. The surface area of the samples does not exceed 5 m 2 /g. The oxidation of the composite powder materials by atmospheric oxygen begins at a temperature of approximately 500 °C. At the same time, when the temperature reaches 1000 °C, no more than 45 wt. % of the studied powders is oxidized. Ceramics made with the synthesized powder mixture B 4 C + 30 mol. % TiB 2 by hot pressing has shown rather high values of relative density (99.0±1.1 %) and fracture toughness (5.0±0.2 MPa∙m 0.5 ).

In wine technology, the on-line measurement of redox potential is a fast, accurate, and reliable measurement that provides insight into the metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its microbial activity, and the oxidation and reduction state of wine, as well as insight into its quality and stability. The significance of the redox potential measurement and control in wine technology as well as the maintenance and regulation of fermentation redox potential using temperature and carbon dioxide fluxes are discussed. Redox potential levels from Eh 100 to 180 mV are typical for non-oxidized wine that is bottling-ready, while levels of Eh 270 to 460 mV represent oxidized wines with typical failures. The relevance of redox potential measurement during the 2-year maturation of Blau Fränkisch wine in 225 L oak barrels at six levels at a temperature 15 °C is presented. The measurement of the redox potential, expressing heterogeneity in redox layers during wine maturation in oak barrels, is represented in various oxido-reductive fermentation zones. On the contrary, the end of the maturation process is indicated by the homogeneity of redox zones, where the matured wine shows no differences in redox measurement on all levels. Using redox potential as a key scale-up criteria ensures comparable and reproducible amounts of the final product even in geometrically non-similar fermenter systems.

Fermentation is a complex process that involves molecular oxidation or reduction mechanisms driven by selective microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. This transformative process results in the production of various bioactive molecules, which offer significant health benefits. The fundamental principle of fermentation technology entails cultivating organisms under ideal conditions, providing them with essential raw materials like carbon, nitrogen, salts, trace elements, and vitamins. The primary function of fermentation lies in the conversion of NADH back into the coenzyme NAD+, allowing it to be utilized again in glycolysis. During fermentation, an organic electron acceptor (e.g., pyruvate or acetaldehyde) interacts with NADH to produce NAD+, yielding by products such as carbon dioxide and ethanol (as seen in ethanol fermentation) or lactate (in lactic acid fermentation). The metabolically derived end products, formed over the life span of microorganisms, are released into the surrounding medium. These products are then extracted for various human applications, holding significant commercial value. Based on the specific end product generated, fermentation can be categorized into four types: lactic acid fermentation, alcohol fermentation, acetic acid fermentation, and butyric acid fermentation. To facilitate the fermentation process, a fermenter or bioreactor is employed. This device is designed for the cultivation of microorganisms and contains all the necessary components for the large-scale synthesis of various compounds, including antibiotics, enzymes, and beverages across different industries. The microorganisms within the fermented are cultivated in a manner that maximizes the yield of the product while minimizing the required resources.

An investigation has been conducted to determine whether or not novel nanocomposite electrolytes have the potential to improve the efficiency and longevity of fuel cell technology. In this investigation, nanocomposite electrolytes were manufactured by using a methodical methodology. The nanoparticles were included into polymer matrices in order to enhance the ion conductivity and mechanical strength of the electrolytes developed. The composition of nanocomposite electrolytes was improved by altering the amount of nanoparticles and polymers that were present. When compared to traditional electrolytes, the introduction of nanoparticles resulted in considerable improvements in the characteristics of the material. These enhancements included a 15% increase in ion conductivity and a 10% increase in mechanical strength. Fuel cell devices that make use of nanocomposite electrolytes have showed improved performance, with a 10% increase in power density and a 15% gain in efficiency when compared to fuel cell devices that make use of traditional electrolytes. In addition, the environmental impact assessment found that the use of nanocomposite electrolytes resulted in a two percent drop in the amount of energy used, a fifteen percent reduction in the amount of waste generated, and a twenty-five percent reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. As a result of these discoveries, the potential ofnanocomposite electrolytes to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of fuel cell technology has been brought to light. This opens the door for the creation of next-generation fuel cells that have increased performance and decreased their effect on the environment.

Governments worldwide are actively committed to achieving their carbon emission reduction targets, and one avenue under exploration is harnessing the potential of hydrogen. Blending hydrogen with natural gas is emerging as a promising strategy to reduce carbon emissions, as it burns cleanly without emitting carbon dioxide. This blending could significantly contribute to emissions reduction in both residential and commercial settings. However, a critical challenge associated with this approach is the potential for Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE), a phenomenon wherein the mechanical properties of pipe steels degrade due to the infiltration of hydrogen atoms into the metal lattice structure. This can result in sudden and sever failures when the steel is subjected to mechanical stress. To effectively implement hydrogen-natural gas blending, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of how hydrogen affects the integrity of pipe steel. This necessitates the development of robust experimental methodologies capable of monitoring the presence and impact of hydrogen within the microstructures of steel. Key techniques employed for this assessment include microscopic observation, hydrogen permeation tests, and tensile and fatigue testing. In this study, samples from two distinct types of pipeline steels used in the natural gas distribution network underwent rigorous examination. To induce hydrogen absorption, an electrochemical charging process is employed in a solution rich in H+ ions. This charging process, accomplished by a potentiostat applying a constant current, prompts the hydrogen evolution reaction at the steel specimen, acting as the cathode of the charging cell. Immediate tensile and fatigue testing following the charging process enables the evaluation of mechanical properties in comparison to non-charged samples. Different charging current densities are employed to simulate various hydrogen blend scenarios. The findings from this research indicate that charged samples exhibit a discernible decline in fatigue and tensile properties. This deterioration is attributed to embrittlement and reduced ductility stemming from the infiltration of hydrogen into the steel matrix. The extent of degradation in fatigue properties is correlated not only to the hydrogen content but also to the hydrogen permeability and diffusion rate influenced by steel&rsquo;s microstructural features, with higher charging current densities indicating a more significant presence of hydrogen in the natural gas pipeline blend.

The urgent need for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation sector is driving research into novel energy carriers that can meet the high energy density requirements of heavy‐duty vehicles without exacerbating the climate change. This concept article examines the synthesis, mechanisms, and challenges associated with oxymethylene ethers (OMEs), a promising class of synthetic fuels potentially derived from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. We highlight the importance of OMEs in the transition towards non‐fossil energy sources due to their compatibility with the existing Diesel infrastructure and their cleaner combustion profile. The synthesis mechanisms, including the Schulz‐Flory distribution and its implications for OME chain length specificity, and the role of various catalysts and starting materials are discussed in depth. Despite advancements in the field, significant challenges remain, such as overcoming the Schulz‐Flory distribution, efficiently managing water byproducts, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the OME synthesis. Addressing these challenges is crucial for OMEs to become a viable alternative fuel, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a sustainable energy future in the transportation sector.

It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF‐based supported low‐nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three‐dimensional (3D) microporous Cu‐based MOF, that achieves a single‐product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at −1.0 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm−2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi‐site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C−C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2‐to‐ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2‐to‐EtOH.

Abstract A substantial amount of the world’s annual CO 2 emissions are attributable to the continued consumption of electricity from the grid that is generated from burning fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources could strengthen grid reliability and lessen their effect on the environment, especially in high-demand regions prone to power failures. Investigating the viability of erecting solar power plants in a subtropical area to provide the necessary electricity for an educational building that operates mainly during daylight hours is the main intent of the present study. The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate and validate a model for enormous-scale commercial HRES applications (such as an educational institution) utilising the HOMER programme to figure out the optimal size. Minimising emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas responsible for accelerating global warming, is also of the utmost importance. Based on the simulation findings, the optimal system configuration consisted of a 120 kW converter and 400 PV arrays (each with 320 Wp = 128 kWp). For regional power generation, the most cost-effective choice is still a combination of solar panels and the grid. Findings show that a HRES can be economically feasible for installation in educational institutions at an initial capital cost of USD $0.068 million with annual operating expenses of USD $0.0447 million—a reduction of 44.11% compared to the existing system. The expected payback for this endeavour is five years. Other locations with identical climates could benefit from these results when considering the deployment of comparable technology. In order to help achieve a zero-carbon target, financial rewards could encourage governments to adopt similar schemes.

This paper examines the environmental consequences of man-made hazards in India and proposes strategies to mitigate their effects and prevent future disasters. While the country is no stranger to natural calamities, man-made incidents such as nuclear power plant accidents, industrial pollution, and environmental degradation due to deforestation have become increasingly prevalent. As per the WHO (World Health Organization) annual report of 2020, over seven million people die annually from air pollution caused by hazardous chemicals, while another one million perish due to waterborne diseases, primarily in developing countries with high population density. Global warming fueled by excessive fossil fuel consumption and deforestation, contributes to climate change and weather-related disasters such as droughts and floods. To address this issue the paper advocates for a reduction in fossil fuel dependency and transmission to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. The paper also highlights how we can mitigate the effect of such hazards and what measures must be taken to avoid this kind of disaster. The paper highlights the benefit of large-scale afforestation efforts, particularly in tropical rain forests, to increase Earth’s green cover and counteract the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. By implementing these mitigation measures, India can move towards a more sustainable and environmentally resilient future.

Under the background of the “dual carbon” target, exploring the pathway of efficient geological storage and high energy utilization of CO2 is a hot issue in CO2 emission reduction research. Under the coupling effect of high geopathic stress in deep rock layers and thermal stress generated during the geological sequestration of CO2, CO2 infiltration into coal rock changes the ambient temperature around the rock, while thermal diffusion effects cause damage to the rock and influence fracture expansion. In the present study, CO2-water–rock coupling test system and characterization of fissure surface roughness were conducted to analyze the rock’s mechanical properties, damage, and fracture evolution. Modeling of the equivalent fissure was employed to reveal the heat transfer mechanism between the rock matrix and CO2. The results obtained illustrate that the rock samples coupled with CO2 exhibited remarkable changes in mechanical properties. These changes include an increase in the number of pores, enhanced inter-pore connectivity, and a planar type of surface roughness in the fissures, ultimately resulting in an increase in conductivity. Conversely, the remaining rock samples displayed poor mechanical properties and surface fracture connectivity. As pressure decreased, the heat transfer coefficient decreased from 86.9 W/m2·K to 57.5 W/m2·K, accompanied by a temperature drop from 33.6 °C to 30.6 °C, demonstrating a proportional relationship between pressure and the heat transfer coefficient. Furthermore, the flow rate gradually increased with the rise in CO2 pressure, indicating denser flow lines with faster flow rates. At 15 MPa, CO2 exhibits enhanced mobility.

ABSTRACT The use of CO2 sensors has been reported as an effective tool in the early detection of signs of deterioration, allowing good accuracy in decision-making about the quality of stored grains. The objective of this study was to quantify the CO2 levels produced by maize grains stored at ambient temperature in a prototype silo, with initial moisture contents of 14, 16 and 18% w.b., and to evaluate the quality of the product over time and the technical breakage. Analyses of moisture content, ash, proteins, lipids, Hue Angle (color), germination and electrical conductivity were performed. Inside the silos, the amount of CO2, relative air humidity and temperature were monitored every hour. Grain quality evaluations were carried out at four storage times (0, 30, 60 and 90 days). A completely randomized design in a 3 × 4 factorial scheme with six replicates was used. Grains with higher moisture contents showed higher technical breakage and losses associated with CO2 emissions. Moisture content, protein, lipids, germination, bulk density, lightness and chroma decreased over time, while the electrical conductivity increased, resulting in greater damage to membranes and loss of quality of maize grains. Monitoring of CO2 in the grain mass is a good tool to assess the quality of grain, and higher initial moisture content caused greater level of CO2 emission and reduction in quality of maize grains.

Abstract This systematic review assesses the evidence concerning laser treatments for nail psoriasis (NP), a prevalent condition among individuals with cutaneous psoriasis that notably affects their quality of life. Traditional treatments have limitations in terms of drug delivery and poor patient adherence, leading to interest in laser therapies for their targeted approach, extended treatment intervals, and the potential to enhance topical medication effectiveness. The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. English‐language randomized and non‐randomized controlled trials with full‐text availability were included. Data on the laser type, treatment protocol, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) outcomes, and adverse events were extracted, and nail bed and matrix features and patient satisfaction were assessed. The primary effect measure was a percentage reduction in NAPSI scores from baseline. Nineteen studies involving the pulse dye laser (PDL), long‐pulsed neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser and fractional carbon dioxide laser (FCL) were identified. Lasers, particularly those used in conjunction with topical agents, have shown favorable results. PDL effectively lowered NAPSI scores, and the Nd:YAG laser had comparable effectiveness but more discomfort. FCL also shows promise, particularly for topical drug delivery. PDL and Nd:YAG laser treatment were more effective at reducing nail bed features, whereas FCL was effective at reducing both nail bed and matrix features. Overall, lasers are promising treatment alternatives for NP, with similar NAPSI outcomes to topical therapies and intralesional injections.

Decarbonization and environmental respect have become pillars of European government policies. As a result of this direction and given that 80% of global freight transportation is carried out by ships, maritime transport emerges as one of the target sectors for these eco measures. Numerous initiatives, projects, and new technologies focused on this field exist. This paper examines the potential reduction of CO2 emissions by using LNG as a fuel either in combination with or instead of conventional fuel on RO-Pax ships. Taking advantage of the fact that we are facing a 'mature' technology already being applied in many ships. Emissions from a fleet of about 30 ships have been studied during the years 2019, 2020, 2021,2022 and 2023 where progressively adding LNG powered vessels from 4 up to 11 during 2023. Based on their annual consumptions’ reports (HFO, MGO and LNG) total tons of polluted CO2 have been quantified together with the ratio tons of CO2 per sailed mile. On the other hand, known daily burned marine fuels of one of those vessels sailing Balearic Islands-Mainland Spain route and due to high increase of gas prices during 2021 and beginning of 2022 (about 350%) a study was conducted: consuming LNG for 265 days whenever possible and avoiding this fuel for 143 days. Therefore, based on the same ship/route, a particular comparison of CO2 emissions per nautical mile is obtained. Finally, using above results, hypothetical study is carried out in which emissions are estimated based on the sailed miles during years 2017 to 2021: Potential emissions in case of LNG versus conventional fuel powered. The 5-year result shows about 17.08% potential reduction. Approximately 32700 tons of CO2 only for 1 vessel highlighting the huge importance of the LNG powered vessels to reduce the environmental impact and the great importance of the investments on Research, Development and Innovation.

Abstract Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. With an atmospheric lifetime of around a decade, methane mitigation starting immediately has the potential to avoid substantial levels of additional warming by mid-century. In addition to the methane emissions reductions that are necessary to limit warming, we address the question of whether technological methane removal can provide additional benefits by avoiding global mean surface temperatures exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial---the high-ambition Paris Agreement climate goal. Using an adaptive emissions methane removal routine in a simple climate model, we successfully limit peak warming to 1.5°C for overshoots of up to around 0.3°C. For substantially higher overshoots, methane removal alone is unable to limit warming to 1.5°C, but in an extreme scenario could limit peak warming by an ensemble median 0.7°C if all atmospheric methane was removed, requiring huge levels of net removal on the order of tens of petagrams cumulatively. The efficacy of methane removal depends on many emergent properties of the climate system, including climate sensitivity, aerosol forcing, and the committed warming after net zero CO$_2$ (zero emissions commitment). To avoid overshooting 1.5°C in the low-overshoot, strong-mitigation SSP1-1.9 scenario, a median cumulative methane removal of 1.2 Pg CH$_4$ is required, though this may be much higher if climate sensitivity is high or the zero emissions commitment is positive, and in these cases may require ongoing methane removal long after peak warming in order to stabilise warming below 1.5°C.

Governments in many countries have announced their own emission targets and launched several measures to mitigate transport-sourced air pollution, including policies to promote the use of electric vehicles (EVs). However, electrifying a fleet of vehicles requires high investment and it is difficult to fully implement all at once. Therefore, this research aims to develop a framework to help prioritize locations to promote EVs using motorcycle taxis in Bangkok as a case study. The surveyed data was collected from 406 motorcycle taxi drivers around Bangkok. The proposed framework is based on two aspects. One is the impact on CO2 emission reduction while another is the difficulty of EV deployment. The study's findings yield a potential matrix for EV deployment, which classifies locations into four priority groups. The study concludes that prioritizing locations with high CO2 reduction impact and low deployment difficulty is crucial for efficient EV promotion. Subsequently, recommendations are offered to assist authorities and automobile firms in effectively allocating resources for EV promotion. Policy recommendations highlight the significance of targeted interventions and enhancing public awareness to facilitate the widespread adoption of electric motorcycle. Implications from this study will help the authorities and automobile firms to prioritize areas and allocate budgets for promoting EVs efficiently.

This study aims to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from China&#039;s sludge treatment industry and explore the potential of novel technologies to mitigate these emissions, promoting sustainable sludge management practices. Using a life cycle assessment approach, the total GHG emissions from sludge treatment in 2017 were estimated at 18.54 Mt CO2-eq, with significant regional variations. Incineration contributed the highest emissions (1,011.53 kg CO2-eq/t dry sludge), followed by landfill (717.51 kg CO2-eq/t) and land application (276.41 kg CO2-eq/t). The uneven distribution of emissions across cities highlights the need for targeted mitigation strategies that consider local sustainability challenges. Principal component analysis revealed that economic factors and treatment scale significantly influence emissions, emphasizing the importance of integrating sustainability goals with economic development. To reduce the carbon footprint of sludge treatment and enhance sustainability, the mitigation potential and costs of various technologies were evaluated, including thermal conversion, anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal processes, and wet oxidation. These technologies offer GHG emission reductions ranging from 0.09 to 0.46 t CO2-eq/t dry solids compared to conventional methods, while also promoting resource recovery and circular economy principles. However, further optimization is necessary to enhance their environmental and economic performance, ensuring long-term sustainability. By implementing these technologies and adopting optimization strategies, China&#039;s sludge treatment industry can significantly contribute to achieving the country&#039;s carbon neutrality goal and fostering sustainable development.

Steel is one of the most manufactured materials in modern society, with 1.9 billion metric tons produced annually for use in building materials, vehicles, wind-turbines, and appliances, among many other applications. As you might expect for something so ubiquitous, the technology used to manufacture steel is also quite mature, having been first identified over 4,000 years ago and heavily industrialized in the 19th century. The general approach is to mine iron ore from the earth’s crust and refine that ore to metallic iron (i.e., ironmaking) which is then combined with carbon and other elements to make steel products (i.e., steelmaking). However, conventional steel manufacturing relies primarily on carbon-based fuels, such as coal, to create the high temperatures (≈ 1600°C) required for the process and can emit as much as 2.2 tons of CO2 per ton of crude steel produced.1 The iron ore reduction step accounts for 90% of CO2 emissions associated with steel production. The heightened effort to decarbonize industrial process and reverse climate change is putting pressure on this 600+ year-old technology to shift to lowcarbon alternatives, especially considering that the steel industry is responsible for ≈ 7% of all global CO2 emissions annually.

Aqueous solutions containing both the strong oxidant, peroxydisulfate (S2O82‒), and the strong reductant, oxalate (C2O42‒), are thermodynamically unstable due to the highly exothermic homogeneous redox reaction: S2O82‒ + C2O42‒ ® 2 SO42‒ + 2 CO2 (DG0 = −490 kJ/mol). However, at room temperature, this reaction does not occur to a significant extent over the timescale of a day due to its inherently slow kinetics. We demonstrate that the S2O82‒/C2O42‒ redox reaction occurs rapidly, once initiated by the Ru(NH3)62+-mediated 1e– reduction of S2O82‒ to form S2O83•‒ at a glassy carbon electrode. Theoretically, the mediated electrochemical generation of a single molecule of S2O83•‒ is capable of initiating an autocatalytic cycle that consumes both S2O82‒ and C2O42‒ in bulk solution. Several experimental demonstrations of S2O82‒/C2O42‒ autocatalysis are presented. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements demonstrate that CO2 is generated in solution for at least 10 minutes following a 30-s initiation step during which S2O83•‒ is generated. Quantitative bulk electrolysis of S2O82‒ in solutions containing excess C2O42‒ is initiated by electrogeneration of immeasurably small quantities of S2O83•‒. Capture of CO2 as BaCO3 during electrolysis additionally confirms the autocatalytic generation of CO2. First- principles density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and finite difference simulations of cyclic voltammetric responses are presented that support and provide additional insights into the initiation and mechanism of the S2O82‒/C2O42‒ autocatalytic reaction.

Aqueous solutions containing both the strong oxidant, peroxydisulfate (S2O82‒), and the strong reductant, oxalate (C2O42‒), are thermodynamically unstable due to the highly exothermic homogeneous redox reaction: S2O82‒ + C2O42‒ ® 2 SO42‒ + 2 CO2 (DG0 = −490 kJ/mol). However, at room temperature, this reaction does not occur to a significant extent over the timescale of a day due to its inherently slow kinetics. We demonstrate that the S2O82‒/C2O42‒ redox reaction occurs rapidly, once initiated by the Ru(NH3)62+-mediated 1e– reduction of S2O82‒ to form S2O83•‒ at a glassy carbon electrode. Theoretically, the mediated electrochemical generation of a single molecule of S2O83•‒ is capable of initiating an autocatalytic cycle that consumes both S2O82‒ and C2O42‒ in bulk solution. Several experimental demonstrations of S2O82‒/C2O42‒ autocatalysis are presented. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements demonstrate that CO2 is generated in solution for at least 10 minutes following a 30-s initiation step during which S2O83•‒ is generated. Quantitative bulk electrolysis of S2O82‒ in solutions containing excess C2O42‒ is initiated by electrogeneration of immeasurably small quantities of S2O83•‒. Capture of CO2 as BaCO3 during electrolysis additionally confirms the autocatalytic generation of CO2. First- principles density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and finite difference simulations of cyclic voltammetric responses are presented that support and provide additional insights into the initiation and mechanism of the S2O82‒/C2O42‒ autocatalytic reaction. Preliminary evidence indicates that autocatalysis also results in a chemical traveling reaction front that propagates into the solution normal to the planar electrode surface.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">For battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), the climate control and the driving range are crucial criteria in the ongoing electrification of automobiles in Europe towards the targeted carbon neutrality of the automotive industry. The thermal management system makes an important contribution to the energy efficiency and the cabin comfort of the vehicle. In addition to the system architecture, the refrigerant is crucial to achieve high cooling and heating performance while maintaining high efficiency and thus low energy consumption. Due to the high efficiency requirements for the vehicle, future system architectures will largely be heat pump systems.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">The alternative refrigerant R-474A based on the molecule R-1132(E) achieved top performance for both parameters in various system and vehicle tests.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the ﬁeld, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today’s limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy eﬃciency when pulsing between ‐1.85 and ‐1.05 V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by diﬀusion and not from pH‐induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83 % compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.

Background: This multicentric prospective study was carried out at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio Medico and Ospedale di Stato of St. Marino Republic. Between 1 January 2019, and 31 December 2022, all pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent, post-coital, and interstitial cystitis at both centers were included in the study. The main aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of vaginal CO2 laser treatment, alone or combined with intravesical hyaluronic acid instillations, in managing cystitis symptoms, such as dysuria, pollakiuria, and urgency, across the entire patient cohort. The secondary objective was to investigate the reduction in number of annual cystitis episodes post-treatment. Methods: Each woman underwent three to four sessions of micro-ablative CO2 vaginal laser treatment. A follow-up examination was conducted 12 months after the final laser session (up to December 2023), during which a post-treatment VAS assessment evaluated dysuria, daily pollakiuria, and urgency. The enrolled patients recorded the number of cystitis episodes experienced during the 12-month pre- and post-treatment period. Results: Results indicated the laser’s efficacy in reducing the total number of cystitis episodes per year and an improvement in symptoms up to one year post-treatment. Greater efficacy of the CO2 laser treatment, particularly when combined with intravesical hyaluronic acid instillation, was observed in both pre- and post- menopausal women. Conclusions: Fractional CO2 laser therapy represents a safe and efficacious, non-hormonal approach for pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent, post-coital, and interstitial cystitis

Abstract. The CO2-carbonate system dynamics in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre (NASPG) were evaluated between 2009 and 2019. Data was collected aboard eight summer cruises through the CLIVAR 59.5º N section. The Ocean Acidification (OA) patterns and the reduction in the saturation state of calcite (ΩCa) and aragonite (ΩArag) in response to the increasing anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) were assessed within the Irminger, Iceland and Rockall basins during a poorly-assessed decade in which the physical patterns reversed in comparison with previous well-known periods. The observed cooling, freshening and enhanced ventilation increased the interannual rate of accumulation of Cant in the interior ocean by 50–86 % and the OA rates by close to 10 %. The OA trends were 0.0013–0.0032 units yr-1 in the Irminger and Iceland basin and 0.0006–0.0024 units yr-1 in the Rockall Trough, causing a decline in ΩCa and ΩArag of 0.004–0.021 and 0.003–0.0013 units yr-1, respectively. The Cant-driven rise in total inorganic carbon (CT) was the main driver of the OA (contributed by 53–68 % in upper layers and >82 % toward the interior ocean) and the reduction in ΩCa and ΩArag (>64 %). The transient decrease in temperature, salinity and AT collectively counteracts the CT-driven acidification by 45–85 % in the upper layers and in the shallow Rockall Trough and by <10 % in the interior ocean. The present investigation reports the acceleration of the OA within the NASPG and expands knowledge about the future state of the ocean.

Abstract Adopting rooftop solar PV systems in various domestic and non-domestic sectors (including commercial, industrial, and agricultural) exhibits their commitment to green energy ventures. This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of a grid-connected solar system that has been installed so far: a 6.9 MW p photovoltaic (PV) system implemented at University Tun Hussein Onn (UTHM) in Batu Pahat, Johor. This green energy system was installed as a part of the Self-Consumption (SELCO) program utilizing a Supply Agreement for Renewable Energy (SARE) contract. To assess the mounted energy system's efficiency, performance monitoring was carried out between December 2021 and November 2022. By evaluating the enactment of the 6.9 MW p solar system at UTHM, this present work has attempted to compile the achievement of implementation of self-consumption in terms of performance analysis and financial benefits to consumer. Based on International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61724 standard, this study also investigates several performance characteristics of the PV system, such as final yield, clearness index (CI), array yield, PV module efficiency, inverter efficiency, reference yield, and capacity factor (CF) performance ratio (PR). Moreover, an assessment of Carbon Dioxide ( $${CO}_{2})$$     CO  2   )    avoidance was also conducted to quantify the amount of $${CO}_{2}$$    CO  2   reduction achieved. In addition, the self-consumption ratio and self-sufficiency ratio pattern for solar power plant in UTHM has been assessed. The monthly clearness index at the project location from December 2021 to November 2022 ranges from 0.63 to 0.66. The PV system was monitored throughout this time and generated 8529 MWh of energy. The installed PV system has shown an efficiency of 11.86%, a final yield of 108.28%, and a PR of 0.78, respectively. Further, the installed 6.9 MW p PV system at UTHM will cut $${CO}_{2}$$    CO  2   emissions by 5450 tons annually. The 6.9 MWp solar PV system is also estimated to reduce 25.1 RM mil in 25 years. Making the system larger to 6.9 MW p would reduce the consumption from the grid during the week, makes it possible to achieve self-consumption levels of up to 100% and self-sufficiency of this solar plant is relatively low ranges from 22 to 35%. The research finding bridges the gap between policy makers, investors, and the public regarding acceptance of the large-scale Self-Consumption (SELCO) and strengthen the strategic collaborations between solar service provider and educational bodies to support of the government’s agenda to achieve carbon emission intensity reduction in Malaysia.

The purpose of the evaluation of the Peruvian energy generation system is to project the electricity generation and demand until the year 2050. To achieve this, three alternative scenarios have been defined and analyzed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) software. The scenarios are as follows: the first one, Business-as-Usual scenario, based on normal trends according to historical data and referencing projections made by Peruvian state entities; the second one is focused on Energy Efficiency, the highlighted characteristic is taking into consideration the efficient conditions in transmission and distribution of electric energy; and the third one, centered on Geothermal Energy, focused on the development of this type of energy source and prioritizing it. The primary purpose of this analysis is to identity advantages and disadvantages inherent in each scenario in order to get the best of each one. In this way, the intention is to propose solutions based on Peru&rsquo;s national reality or possible uses of the country&rsquo;s energy potential to supply its energy demand. Currently, Peru&rsquo;s energy demand relies on fossil fuels, hydraulic, and thermal energy. However, there is the possibility of transforming this system into a sustainable one, by strengthening existing and growing energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and new technologies for hydraulic and thermal energy, in addition to considering geothermal energy as the main energy source in the third scenario. The new system mentioned satisfactorily indicate that the CO2 equivalent emissions decrease significantly in the third scenario, with a 15.8% reduction compared to the first scenario and a 9.7% reduction in comparison to the second. On the other hand, the second scenario shows a 5.6% decrease in CO2 emissions compared to the first, resulting from improvements in technology and energy efficiency without requiring significant modifications or considerable investments, as in the third scenario.

The present study aims to describe the potential sources of energy in Peru with the purpose of implementing them to achieve a sustainable system, taking advantage of the natural resources in the Peruvian land. To achieve this, three alternative scenarios have been defined and analyzed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) software [Software Version: 2020.1.112]. The scenarios are as follows: the first one, the Business-as-Usual scenario, is based on normal trends according to historical data and referencing projections made by Peruvian state entities; the second one is focused on Energy Efficiency, the highlighted characteristic is taking into consideration the efficient conditions in transmission and distribution of electric energy; and the third one, centered on Geothermal Energy, focused on the development of this type of energy source and prioritizing it. The primary purpose of this analysis is to identify the advantages and disadvantages inherent in each scenario in order to obtain the best out of each one. In this way, the intention is to propose solutions based on Peru’s national reality or possible uses of the country’s energy potential to supply its energy demand. Currently, Peru’s energy demand relies on fossil fuels, hydraulic, and thermal energy. However, there is the possibility of transforming this system into a sustainable one by strengthening existing and growing energy sources such as solar and wind energy and new technologies for hydraulic and thermal energy, in addition to considering geothermal energy as the main energy source in the third scenario. The new system mentioned satisfactorily indicates that the CO2 equivalent emissions decrease significantly in the third scenario, with a 15.8% reduction compared to the first scenario and a 9.7% reduction in comparison to the second. On the other hand, the second scenario shows a 5.6% decrease in CO2 emissions compared to the first, resulting from improvements in technology and energy efficiency without requiring significant modifications or considerable investments, as in the third scenario.

Simply expressed, the circular economy implies that the people living on Earth should reuse and recycle the products that are currently in use as long as possible and reduce the waste produced, thus reducing CO2 emissions. The latter goal is fundamental from the perspective of mitigating the well-known greenhouse effect and the consequent global warming observed at the planetary scale. Under these conditions, advanced electrodeposition processes can play a fundamental role in the optimization of materials use and in the reduction of the energetic footprint for a wide variety of industrial processes. The aim of the present paper is precisely to suggest how this is possible, showing readers the potential that electrodeposition holds for efficient manufacturing of many different products that have a huge significance for industry.

Carbon emission intensity is an important index reflecting an entity’s low-carbon competitiveness. This paper presents an extended logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model to dissect carbon intensity within China’s civil aviation from 1998 to 2019, revealing a significant reduction in CO2 emissions per air transport revenue. It attributes this decrease to technological advancements, optimized fleet structures, and improved operational efficiencies, highlighting the impact of larger, more efficient aircraft and enhanced load factors. The study also explores economic factors influencing carbon efficiency, suggesting a comprehensive approach encompassing technological innovation and strategic operational improvements for sustainable aviation development.

Alternative routing is crucial to minimize the environmental impact of urban transportation while enhancing road network efficiency and reducing traffic congestion. Existing methods neglect information about road popularity, possibly leading to unintended consequences such as increasing emissions and congestion. This paper introduces Polaris, an alternative routing algorithm that exploits road popularity to optimize traffic distribution and reduce CO2 emissions. Polaris leverages the novel concept of K-road layers, which mitigates the feedback loop effect where redirecting vehicles to less popular roads could increase their popularity in the future. We conduct experiments in three cities to evaluate Polaris against state-of-the-art alternative routing algorithms. Our results demonstrate that Polaris significantly reduces the overuse of highly popular road edges and traversed regulated intersections, showcasing its ability to generate efficient routes and distribute traffic more evenly. Furthermore, Polaris achieves substantial CO2 reductions, outperforming existing alternative routing strategies. Finally, we compare Polaris to an algorithm that coordinates vehicles centrally to distribute them more evenly on the road network. Our findings reveal that Polaris performs comparably well, even with much less information, highlighting its potential as an efficient and sustainable solution for urban traffic management.

Increased demand for decarbonization and renewable energy has led to increasing interest in engineered subsurface storage systems for large-scale carbon reduction and energy storage. In these applications, a working fluid (CO2, H2, air, etc.) is injected into a deep formation for permanent sequestration or seasonal energy storage. The heterogeneous nature of the porous formation and the fluid–rock interactions introduce complexity and uncertainty in the fate of the injected component and host formations in these applications. Interactions between the working gas, native brine, and formation mineralogy must be adequately assessed to evaluate the efficiency, risk, and viability of a particular storage site and operational regime. This study reviews the current state of knowledge about coupled geochemical–geomechanical impacts in geologic carbon sequestration (GCS), underground hydrogen storage (UHS), and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems involving the injection of CO2, H2, and air. Specific review topics include (1) existing injection induced geochemical reactions in these systems; (2) the impact of these reactions on the porosity and permeability of host formation; (3) the impact of these reactions on the mechanical properties of host formation; and (4) the investigation of geochemical-geomechanical process in pilot scale GCS. This study helps to facilitate an understanding of the potential geochemical–geomechanical risks involved in different subsurface energy storage systems and highlights future research needs.

Increasing the product selectivity and decreasing the cost of product separation is critical for large scale application of electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R). We hypothesize that highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes can tune the microenvironment of the catalyst/electrolyte interface and improve product selectivity. Compared to a conventional electrolyte concentration of 1 M HCOOK, the use of a 7.1 M HCOOK electrolyte increases the FE ratio of C2H4/CO from 2.2 ± 0.3 to 18.3 ± 4.8 at -1.08 V vs RHE on a Cu gas diffusion electrode. Based on electrochemical analysis and AIMD simulation, the identity and concentration of the cation and anion play more important roles in controlling the CO2R reaction pathway than the bulk CO2 solubility and the bulk pH of electrolytes. In-situ ATR-SEIRAS suggests that, unlike 1 M HCOOK, the *CO-bridge binding mode on Cu is dominant in 7.1 M HCOOK electrolyte, which potentially results in less CO release and higher yield of C2H4. This study demonstrates that while we can tailor the electrolyte composition to shift product selectivity, the factors that control the product selectivity are numerous and cannot be distilled down into one correlated property-reactivity relationship. Thus, when CO2R conditions are changed, care must be taken to understand their effects on the bulk electrolyte properties and the electrode-electrolyte interface.

Abstract. Gigatonne-scale atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will almost certainly be needed to supplement the emission reductions required to keep global warming between 1.5–2 °C. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is an emerging marine CDR method with the addition of pulverised minerals to the surface ocean being one widely considered approach. A concern of this approach is the potential for dissolution products released from minerals to impact phytoplankton communities. We conducted an experiment with 10 pelagic mesocosms (M1–M10) in Raunefjorden, Bergen, Norway, to assess the implications of simulated silicate- and calcium-based mineral OAE on a coastal plankton community. Five mesocosms (M1, M3, M5, M7, and M9) were enriched with silicate (∼ 75 µmol L−1 Na2SiO3), alkalinity along a gradient from 0 to ∼ 600 µmol kg−1, and magnesium in proportion to alkalinity additions. The other five mesocosms (M2, M4, M6, M8, M10) were enriched with alkalinity along the same gradient and calcium in proportion to alkalinity additions. The experiment explored many components of the plankton community, from microbes to fish larvae, and here we report on the influence of simulated mineral based OAE on diatom silicification. Macronutrients (nitrate and phosphate) limited silicification at the onset of the experiment until nutrient additions on day 26. Silicification was significantly greater in the silicate-based mineral treatment, with all genera except Cylindrotheca displaying an increase in silicification as a result of the increased concentration of dissolved silicate. In contrast to the effect of differences in dissolved silicate concentrations between the two mineral treatments, increases in alkalinity only influenced the silicification of two genera, Pseudo-nitzschia and Nitzschia. The four other genera (Arcocellulus, Cylindrotheca, Skeletonema, and Thalassiosira) investigated here displayed no significant changes in silicification as a result of alkalinity increases between 0 and 600 µmol kg−1 above natural levels. In summary, our findings illustrate that the enhancement of alkalinity via simulated silicate- and calcium-based methods has limited genus-specific impacts on the silicification of diatoms. This research underscores the importance of understanding the full breadth of different OAE approaches, their risks, co-benefits, and potential for interactive effects.

The core problem of a multimodal transportation system is integrating various transportation modes into a cohesive, efficient, and user-friendly network. This study introduces a novel centralized load concentration approach for regions facing geographic challenges. The principal aim is improving multimodal transportation systems by mitigating CO2 emissions and improving operational efficiency. This will significantly reduce high logistics costs and the environmental impact caused by greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in land transportation, aligning with the global sustainable development goals and offering a promising path towards a more sustainable future. The proposed method implicates direct cargo transportation from its origin to the export ports without passing through intermediate centers. The mathematical model determines the most efficient means of transportation for each route, considering variables such as distance, volume, and type of cargo. Research results indicate that multiple hubs may not be necessary in scenarios with high freight concentration, which could streamline transportation and logistics operations. The modal preferences vary depending on regional dynamics and cargo characteristics, with rail and sea transport emerging as preferable options in specific circumstances, outperforming road transport. The proposed model shows reductions in logistics costs and CO2 emissions compared to road-focused scenarios. This study provides an adaptable framework for optimizing multimodal transportation systems in regions with similar geographic and logistical attributes. It offers a versatile solution to various contexts and needs. Lastly, the strategic integration of multiple modes of transportation is fundamental to improving efficiency and sustainability.

The unused garbage which is accumulating the landfills, such as raw materials, could be reused for synthetic gasoline production. This study presents the multiple’s effect technique, which is based on the reusage of different non, party and sorted municipal solid wastes (MSW), or biogas for syngas, converted into synthetic gasoline. The novelties of this technique include a basic multiple’s effect parameter (MUW), which present a level of waste sorting, an effect of oxygen inhibition into different wastes, a simplified mathematical model and simulation with an Aspen Plus® simulator using the retrofitted methanol plan converted into the synthetic gasoline production. This technique includes a circular economy by using a circulated purified flue gas as raw material, co-products of hydrogen and water. This technique was tested on an existing methanol process, replacing natural gas with different alternatives of wastes or biogas for the synthetic gasoline production. The best alternative was the sorted MSW, which could generate an additional profit of 4.8 MEUR/a, including the garbage and CO2 emission reductions of 0.106·106 t/a and of 0.084 ·106 t/a.

Abstract The impact of Nd:YAG laser irradiation and the addition of zirconium ions (Zr4+) on the physical properties of CoFe2O4 spinel nano-ferrites has been studied. The co-precipitation method was used to synthesize the samples. Xray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to examine the structure and morphology. The decrease in the Curie temperature Tc is due to the laser irradiation and the increase in the Zr content of the sample. The difference in the Tc between the non irradiated and the irradiated samples is about 7%, 43% and 34% for CoFe2O4, Co1.1Zr0.1Fe1.8O4, and Co1.3Zr0.3Fe1.4O4, respectively. The decrease in the Tc is due to an increase in the canting of the spins, resulting in a decreased thermal energy required to compensate for the spin alignment. The decrease in the coercivity of the laser irradiated sample is due to a reduction in the magnetic anisotropy and an altered distribution of the cations (Co2+, Fe3+, Zr4+). The observed trend indicates that laser irradiation, and Zr substitution, can be used to modify the magnetic hardness of the samples. The low coercivity of irradiated Co1.1Zr0.1Fe1.8O4 makes it suitable for a range of applications. The high-frequency response of the Co1+xZrxFe2-2xO4 NPs shows that they can operate within the frequency range of 7.5 GHz–11.56 GHz.&#xD;

Introduction: Previous studies have shown that lipid components are involved in the internalization of Dengue virus (DENV), however, this mechanism has been hypothesized mostly through clinical studies correlating between dengue severity and lipid levels. This study aimed to determine DENV-2 internalization in the presence of apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), B (apoB) or E (apoE) in human hepatoma cell line (Huh7). Materials and methods: Tetrazolium reduction assays were used to assess the cytotoxicity of apolipoproteins on Huh7. DENV-2 at MOI of 1 with 2 µg/mL apoA1, apoB and apoE, respectively were introduced into the confluent Huh7 cells and incubated for an hour (internalization) and 72 h (replication) at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. The replication experiments were repeated after SR-B1 siRNA treatment. Samples collected were subjected to qPCR for viral load determination. Differences between groups were assessed by ANOVA and independent T-Test. Results and discussion: Treatment with apoA1 and apoB demonstrated significant increment in DENV-2 internalization and replication compared to apoE (internalization: p = 0.022 and p = 0.323 vs p = 0.878, respectively; replication: p = 0.004 and p = 0.016 vs p = 0.897, respectively). A significant reduction of DENV2 infectivity was seen in apoA1 treated cells with SR-B1 down-regulation/silencing (35.2 % reduction, p = 0.013). Conclusions: apoA1 and apoB, enhanced initial attachment of DENV-2 to cell surface, suggesting their role in DENV internalization and infectivity. HIGHLIGHTS This research determined the effects of apolipoproteins on dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) internalization in vitro using the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) apoA1 and apoB enhance the initial attachment of DENV-2 to the cell surface Knockdown of SR-B1 receptors reduces apoA1-treated DENV-2 internalization, suggesting the role of SR-B1 as a route of entry for DENV-2 Knockdown of SR-B1 receptors had no effect on apoB-treated DENV-2 internalization, suggesting it uses another entry pathway GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Ammonia has emerged as a promising carbon-free alternative fuel for internal combustion engines (ICE), particularly in large-bore engine applications. However, integrating ammonia into conventional engines presents challenges, prompting the exploration of innovative combustion strategies like dual-fuel combustion. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions have emerged as a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of ammonia in ICE. Various studies suggest that combining exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with adjustments in inlet temperature and diesel injection timing can effectively mitigate nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions across diverse operating conditions in dual-fuel diesel engines. This study conducts a numerical investigation into the impact of varying inlet charge temperatures (330K, 360K, and 390K) and EGR rates (0%, 10%, and 20%) on the combustion and emission characteristics of an ammonia/diesel dual-fuel engine operating under high-load conditions, while considering different shares of ammonia energy. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are executed using Converge software. Subsequently, multi-linear regression models are developed, utilizing ammonia share, inlet charge temperature, and EGR rate as independent variables, and emission parameters as dependent variables. The best-fitted regression model can be employed to analyze the response surface of performance parameters. The optimal CO2 reduction, approximately 30%, is observed under the conditions of (390K, 40% NH<sub>3</sub>, and EGR20), as indicated by the results. Furthermore, under the conditions of (360K, 20% NH<sub>3</sub>, and EGR20), the findings indicate a notable reduction of NO<sub>2</sub>, approximately 65% compared to diesel. Additionally, the findings suggest that NH<sub>3</sub> reduction peaks at higher temperatures, with approximately a 50% decrease observed.</div></div>

To mitigate dangerous climate change, a drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is needed by 2030. Buildings contribute significantly to emissions, with the use phase of existing buildings being responsible for the majority of energy consumption. In addition, environmental problems associated with the production of raw materials, construction, and the end of life of buildings are serious concerns that require urgent solutions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and the EU-recommended Environmental Footprint (EF) are widely accepted tools to measure environmental impacts throughout a product life cycle. However, assessing the environmental performance of wooden buildings remains a challenge. This study presents a benchmark for an average new European wooden building fulfilling the European nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) requirement. The benchmark utilizes the recommended EU EF impact categories with normalization and weighting, allowing for easy and quick comparisons. The results communicate the average environmental impact per square meter of floor area over one year. This benchmark is a suitable comparison point for new wooden building designs and is used as an effective tool for architects and designers during the initial planning stages of wooden buildings. By using this benchmark, the environmental performance of the building can be improved, and the communication and interpretation of LCA results can be facilitated for customers and other relevant stakeholders.

This review article analyzes the influence of recycled glass (as sand and powder) beyond the durability, rheology and compressive strength of plain UHPC, even exploring flexural and direct tensile performance in fiber-reinforced UHPC. Interactions with other mineral admixtures like limestone powder, rice husk ash, fly ash, FC3R, metakaolin and slags, among others, are analyzed. Synergy with limestone powder improves rheology, reducing superplasticizer usage. Research highlights waste glass–UHPC mixtures with reduced silica fume and cement content by over 50% and nearly 30%, respectively, with compressive strengths exceeding 150 MPa, cutting costs and carbon footprints. Furthermore, with the proper fiber dosage, waste glass–UHPC reported values for strain and energy absorption capacity, albeit lower than those of traditional UHPC formulations with high cement, silica fume and quartz powder content, surpassing requirements for demanding applications such as seismic reinforcement of structures. Moreover, durability remains comparable to that of traditional UHPC. In addition, the reported life cycle analysis found that the utilization of glass powder in UHPC allows a greater reduction of embedded CO2 than other mineral additions in UHPC without jeopardizing its properties. In general, the review study presented herein underscores recycled glass’s potential in UHPC, offering economic and performance advantages in sustainable construction.

Rice husk ash (RHA) is agricultural waste with high silica content that has exhibited proven technical feasibility as a pozzolanic material since the 1970s. Notwithstanding, its use in mortars and concrete is limited by the standards currently utilized in some countries where RHA production is high and the aforementioned pozzolanic material is not standardized. This is the case in Spain, one of the main rice producers in Europe. Nowadays, the high pressure placed on the Portland cement production sector to reduce its energy use and CO2 emissions has given rise to a keen interest in mineral admixtures for cement manufacturing. In this research, we intended to establish the contributions of different RHA types to the final blended Portland cement properties (“H” is used to identify RHA in standardized cements). The experimental results demonstrated that RHA with good pozzolanic properties (large specific surface and high amorphous silica content) had to be limited to 10% cement replacement because of the severe reduction in workability at higher replacement percentages. RHA with lower reactivity, such as crystalline RHA, or fly ash (FA) can be used to prepare binary and ternary blended cements with reactive RHA. It is possible to design the following cements: CEM II/A-H and CEM II/A-(H-V). It would also be possible to design cement (CEM II/B-(H-V) with replacement values of up to 30% and the same 28-day mechanical performance as observed for the Portland cement without mineral addition.

The wide metabolic diversity of microalgae, their fast growth rates, and cost-effective production make these organisms highly promising resources for a variety of biotechnological applications, addressing critical needs in industry, agriculture, and medicine. The utilization of microalgae in consortia with bacteria is proving to be valuable in different biotechnological fields, including treating various types of wastewaters, producing biofertilizers, and extracting various products from their biomass. Monoculture of the microalgae Chlamydomonas has been a prominent research model for many years, extensively utilized in studying photosynthesis, sulfur and phosphorus metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, respiration, and flagella synthesis, among others. Recent re-search has increasingly recognized the potential of Chlamydomonas-bacteria consortia as a bio-technological tool for various applications. Bioremediation of wastewater using Chlamydomonas, and its bacterial consortia presents significant potential for the sustainable reduction of contam-inants, while also facilitating resource recovery and valorization of microalgal biomass. Using Chlamydomonas and its bacterial consortia as biofertilizers can offers several benefits, such as en-hancing crop yield, protecting crops, maintaining soil fertility and stability, aiding in CO2 miti-gation, and contributing to sustainable agriculture practices. Chlamydomonas-bacterial consortia play a significant role in the production of high-value products, particularly in biofuel and en-hancing H2 production. This review aims to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the po-tential of Chlamydomonas monoculture and its bacterial consortia, identifying current applications, and proposing new research and development directions to maximize its potential.

The adverse effects of heatwaves on viticulture could be, at least partly, mitigated by generous soil water availability. As climate change will also likely reduce irrigation water, knowing to which extent soil water availability could be decreased under the heatwaves without compromising plant performances would be important. In this pot experiment, we differentiated soil water availability by compensating 100% (T100), 70% (T70), 40% (T40) and 10% (T10) of vine transpiration. Grapevines (cv. Sauvignon) were then subjected to a 11-day heatwave (Tmax 40 °C) and to a post-heat stress recovery phase. Soil water potential between -0.05 to -0.2 MPa, respectively, in T100 and T70 enabled the plants to maintain high net CO2 assimilation (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), and leaf transpiration (Eleaf) which kept the leaf temperature (Tleaf) below the ambient temperature and promoted the plant growth. During the heatwave, T100 and T70 vines decreased their photochemical yield and dissipated the excess energy via regulated non-photochemical heat dissipation, and resumed their photochemical activities upon removing the heat stress. Further reduction in soil water potential to -0.4 and and -1.2 MPa in T40 and T10, respectively, decreased Pn and gs and restrained Eleaf, causing a significant increase in Tleaf during the heatwave, and limited the plant recovery after the heat stress. Nonetheless, the maximum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) showed quite high resistance to heat stress in all treatments. These findings suggest that decreasing soil water availability to reach soil water potential levels close to -0.2 MPa implies higher efficiency in using water resources during a heat wave without limiting plant growth.

As the third-largest maize-producing province in China and a typical arid and semi-arid region, quantitatively evaluating the carbon and nitrogen footprints of maize production and their dominant factors is of great significance in guiding the high-yield, low-carbon, and sustainable development of maize production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This study quantitatively evaluated the interannual evolution characteristics of the carbon and nitrogen footprints in maize production and their dominant factors in Inner Mongolia from 2003 to 2022 based on statistical yearbook data and emission parameter models. The results showed that from 2003 to 2022, the maize planting area, yield, and total yield in Inner Mongolia all increased, with an average annual increase of 97 kg ha−1 in yield and 1.23 × 106 Mg in total yield. The carbon and nitrogen footprints of Inner Mongolia maize production over the past 20 years had overall decreasing trends, while the nitrogen fertilizer bias productivity, net ecosystem carbon balance, and sustainability index had increasing trends. Carbon footprint reduced by an average of 5.2 kg CO2 eq Mg−1 per year, and nitrogen footprint reduced by an average of 0.21 g N eq kg−1 per year. Currently, the transportation and production of fertilizer and field application of N fertilizer are the main controlling factors of GHG emissions from maize production. NO3−-N, NH4+-N leaching, and NH3 volatilization from field application of N fertilizer are the main sources of reactive N losses. The application of simplified processes, such as phased regulation of nitrogen and controlled-release fertilizers, as well as conservation tillage, have broad prospects for emission reduction in maize production in Inner Mongolia.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is rich in mitochondria and expresses high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), enabling it to regulate thermogenesis and system energy expenditure. NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a key cofactor for maintaining mitochondrial function by serving as a redox carrier and signaling molecule. To investigate the regulation and function of NAD+ in BAT, we measured the expression of genes involved in NAD+ synthesis and catabolism in mice under room temperature, cold challenge, and thermoneutral conditions. We found that the expression of nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1), the final enzyme for NAD+ synthesis, was suppressed by thermoneutrality and increased by cold challenge in BAT. We, therefore, generated brown adipocyte-specific NMNAT1 knockout mice (NMNAT1-bKO) by crossing the NMNAT1 flox/flox mice to the UCP1-Cre mice. NMNAT1 deletion reduced NAD+ levels by approximately 50%, accompanied by the accumulated precursors, including NMN and NaMN in BAT. Despite the significant reduction of BAT NAD+, NMNAT1-bKO mice showed comparable body weight, normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and unchanged systemic energy metabolism, including O2 consumption, CO2 production, and RER in the metabolic cage studies. Further cold challenges and high-fat diet feeding did not induce any differences in the metabolic phenotype. RNA-seq analysis of BAT from NMNAT1-bKO and control mice under cold challenge revealed enrichment of genes involved in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolic process. These results show that BAT NMNAT1 is necessary for maintaining NAD+ levels but dispensable for systemic energy metabolism, possibly due to compensatory upregulation of mitochondrial genes.

The Impact Measurement and Application of Conservation System (IMACS) was recently described in ten preprint papers. IMACS represents the first “first principals” based system for measurement of damaging and conserving impacts and the calculation of sustainabilities for products, services and individuals. IMACS distinguishes “participating” and “non-participating” individuals, organizations and their products and services. IMACS automatically assigns damaging impacts to individuals, products and services. Under IMACS, each generator of impacts “owns” their impacts, while impacts are transferred with products sold or distributed. For the fully implemented and participating world, all impacts will be determined accurately using a combination of (mostly) remote sensing and (increasingly less) ground/sea level-based verification and straightforward calculations. For the initial application, all impacts will be estimated using a statistical approach, where products, services and individuals with higher impact uncertainty are assigned higher impacts. Participating organizations can select lower cost estimation methods leading to higher estimated impacts and vice versa. Under IMACS, each event creating additional impacts, represents an additional supply chain step. This makes it easy to follow each product throughout the supply chain until it’s purchase by the end-user consumer. Due to the level of automation used, the impact estimation/determination can be done at very low costs, much lower than using life cycle assessment (LCA) or input-output analysis methods. Resource using, damaging, protecting and restoring impacts are distributed over eleven impact groups. Conservation is made available by for-profit and non-profit organizations and distributed by IMACS licensed organizations as “Title-to-Conservation” (TTC). Neutralizing amounts of conservation are applied to participating products and services purchased by participating consumers. Due to the shortage of conservation as TTC, initially none to very little TTC can be applied, leading to initially very low retailer or supply chain costs expressed as percentage of sales. However, the sale of TTC at market prices will allow the exponential growth of the conservation industry and create strong incentives for reduction of resource using and elimination of damaging impacts throughout the supply chain. Increasing consumer demand for products “free of impacts” (after impact neutralization through application of TTC) will force supply chain participation, creating a “new normal” where the supply chain pays for the costs of conservation. Using this approach and a twenty-year transition period to full societal participation, return to pre-industrial atmospheric conditions can be achieved in 40 – 60 years, greatly limiting damage from climate change, while saving costs. The same applies to all impact groups, greatly limiting environmental damage, biodiversity loss and reducing human suffering and premature deaths. A review of marketing studies indicates that the model assumptions used for societal participation are conservative. The use of certified and licensed for profit businesses for most tasks within IMACS allows a rapid global roll-out and scale-up of IMACS functionality. The system has the potential to create very large amounts of funding for conservation, and potentially allows a relative fast return to pre-industrial environmental conditions, while improving human conditions and saving costs. By participating in IMACS, individuals and organizations can eliminate current CO2 emissions, neutralize historic CO2 emissions, provide adequate fresh water for ecosystems, protect wildlife areas and their biodiversity, save money and improve their competitive position. IMACS, by assigning the costs of conservation (protection and restoration) to individuals and organizations responsible for the damage done, can effectively address and solve the classic “tragedy of the commons”.
