We report a bifunctional metal–organic layer (MOL) as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CO under visible light irradiation with a turnover number of 6990 in 24 h and a CO selectivity of 99%. The fully accessible and modifiable Hf12 secondary building units and the coordinating porphyrin linkers of the MOL allow for the integration of both Ru photosensitizers and catalytic Fe-porphyrin sites into one single platform. The close distance (∼11 Å) between the Ru photosensitizer and the catalytic center leads to enhanced electron transfer and promotes photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This strategy leads to an increase of the CO2-to-CO turnover number for the bifunctional MOL catalyst over a combination of a homogeneous Ru photosensitizer and an Fe-porphyrin complex. The mechanism of MOL-catalyzed CO2 photoreduction was also studied by photophysical and electrochemical experiments.

Electric vehicle is a solution to reduce global warming, carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, and environmental impact and achieve sustainable development goals. The Thai government planned that 30% of new vehicles produced in Thailand in 2030 would be zero-emission vehicles. With various government support, the number of EVs is expected to increase in the next few years abruptly. With an increased use of EVs, it is expected that the CO2 emission will be reduced. This study develops a system dynamics (SD) model utilizing an SD modelling approach to predict the number of EVs and examine the reduction of CO2 emissions from EVs in the use phase. It focuses on dynamic relationships between variables and is associated with the time-dependent behaviour of controlled systems. The simulation results show a CO2 emission reduction of 15.37 million tonnes in 2030. With continuous promotion of EVs, the amount of CO2 emission reduction is expected to be 37.29 million tonnes in 2036. The sensitivity analysis results reveal that by changing the driving distance from the minimum to maximum distances, only the magnitude of the model changes, while the model behaviour remains the same. This confirms the validity of the developed SD model. It is found that by maximizing the driving distance by 33%, the CO2 emission is further reduced by almost 50%. Moreover, when the government support period is changed to four years, the CO2 emission reduction becomes 19.73 million tonnes, reaching the government target of a 30% reduction in 2030. The Thai government may use the study results to plan for supporting policies to enhance the demand for EVs and achieve the SDGs in the long term. Different policies may be tested to select suitable policies for implementation. Countries with similar EV market statuses may adjust the study results to suit their implementation.

Abstract A large amount of concrete contaminated by 14CO2 will be discharged from decommissioning of aged nuclear power plants. Rubbing, which separates cements from concrete debris, would be one of manners which allows to reduce volume of the waste if most of the 14C presents in the cement inside the concrete. We confirmed that the 14CO2 adsorbs on the cements more than aggregates by a factor of approximately 2 orders. Rubbing was carried out to obtain the mass balance and decontamination factor using simulated concrete debris which was not contaminated by the 14CO2. The cements and fine aggregates were separated from the debris as fines by rubbing using a Los Angeles testing machine. Steel balls with different size and different amount were used to proceed rubbing more. In addition, production rates of the fines were investigated in the debris that the heat treatment was carried out or not. Residues in a mill of the Los Angeles testing machine were washed to remove deposits remained on the surface. We concluded that the volume reduction can be effectively achieved by rubbing the debris that applied the heat treatment using more steel balls with larger size. DF was not improved by washing the surface residues. However, washing can resolve the concerns regarding radiation protection due to scattering of fines contaminated with the 14CO2 in treatment of the residues after rubbing.

Abstract Objective and Scope In alignment with the Petroleum Development Oman's PDO commitment to achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, with an interim target of a 50% reduction by 2030, the Company has initiated the "Decarbonation Road Map" aimed at positioning Oman as a leader in clean energy development and GHG emissions reduction. One of the key initiatives contributing to the global goal of reducing GHG emissions is the deployment of Mobile Sewage Treatment Plants (MSTPs) at for camp sites, replacing conventional soak away and septic tanks. Methods, Procedures, Process This project involves the implementation of standalone/mobile STP units, effectively addressing issues related to sewage management, reducing CO2 emissions, minimizing road exposure, and eliminating the need for sewage trucking. Furthermore, in alignment with PDO's dedication to sustainability, the Company has actively participated in the National Initiative for Plantation of 10 million Trees, utilizing Treated Sewage Effluent (TSE) to plant approximately 3,800 trees per location (totaling 95,000 trees across 25 locations). Results, Observations, Conclusions The implementation of this initiative is anticipated to yield numerous benefits, including but not limited to: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE): The Company's primary focus is on eliminating potential risks associated with traffic exposure and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Through the comprehensive initiative, the objective is to eliminate instances of non-compliance related to road incidents, sewage overflow, harm to animals and birds due to sewage discharge, as well as violations of pollution standards for isolating underground aquifers. Additionally, efforts will enhance welfare provisions for crews, reinforcing the Company's commitment to their well-being. Furthermore, emphasis on the Company's commitment towards environmental biodiversity.Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Reduction: The initiative places strong emphasis on minimizing CO2 emissions, specifically targeting greenhouse gases. By eliminating vacuum trucks and implementing plantation coverage, a substantial reduction of approximately 97,525 CO2 metric tons per year in CO2 emissions is anticipated. This reduction aligns with the Company's commitment towards environmental sustainability and proactive approach to mitigating climate change impacts.Cost Optimization: In addition to environmental benefits, the initiative offers significant cost advantages. The projected cost reduction is estimated $5.5 million/year as a result of eliminating the need for vacuum trucks, optimizing sewage system construction, operation and maintenance, and avoiding non-productive time during site restoration. Adopting such optimized processes and implementing efficient solutions will result in a streamlined operation, minimizing unnecessary expenses, and enhancing overall cost-effectiveness. Novel/Additive Information Replacing septic and soak away tanks with Mobile STPs shall directly reduce the carbon footprint by address environmental challenges such as sewage overflow, CO2 emissions, and pollution associated with transportation exposure. The initiative not only resolves sewage overflow issues but also contributes to CO2 emission reduction by eliminating sewage trucking and minimizing road exposure, thus reducing the carbon footprint. Moreover, replacing outdated sewage systems mitigates the risk of soil and water contamination, preserving local ecosystems and safeguarding nearby water sources.

Abstract In order to develop a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction with high power efficiency, we prepared molecular crystals with two types of metal phthalocyanine. Charge transfer complexes with acceptor were selected as the molecular crystal system to reduce the electrical resistance. Various bimetallic phthalocyanine systems consisting of cobalt phthalocyanine and another metal phthalocyanine were obtained as highly conductive separated stacked charge transfer complexes with iodine as an acceptor. The obtained catalysts for CO2 reduction were evaluated using gas diffusion electrodes. The catalysts containing the bimetallic phthalocyanine system of cobalt and copper phthalocyanines showed higher CO2 reduction current and higher CO production, indicating that the CO2 reduction on cobalt phthalocyanine is enhanced by the H2 formation reaction on copper phthalocyanine.

Recently, atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) have been widely applied in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), achieving exciting activity and selectivity and revealing structure‐performance correlation. However, at present, the efficiency of CO2RR is still unsatisfactory and cannot meet the requirements of practical applications. One of the main reasons is the difficulty in CO2 activation due to the chemical inertness of CO2. Constructing symmetry‐breaking active sites is regarded as an effective strategy to promote CO2 activation by modulating electronic and geometric structure of CO2 molecule. In addition, in the subsequent CO2RR process, asymmetric charge distributed sites can break the charge balance in adjacent adsorbed C1 intermediates and suppress electrostatic repulsion between dipoles, benefiting for C‐C coupling to generate C2+ products. Although compared to single atoms, metal nanoparticles, and inorganic materials the research on the construction of asymmetric catalytic sites in metal NCs is in a newly‐developing stage, the precision, adjustability and diversity of metal NCs structure provide many possibilities to build asymmetric sites. This review summarizes several strategies of construction asymmetric charge distribution in metal NCs for boosting CO2RR, concludes the mechanism investigation paradigm of NCs‐based catalysts, and proposes the challenges and opportunities of NCs catalysis.

We present a methodology for modelling gas diffusion electrodes with Cu-based catalysts. The applicability of the Butler Volmer equation (B-Ve) based on Tafel analysis is limited to single electron transfer reactions which are not typical of CO2 reduction reactions on Cu catalysts. We developed a method that involves linking the nanoscale effects encapsulated in a detailed calibrated microkinetic model (MKM) on Cu(100) electrodes to a mass transport model (MTM) on a low surface area, flooded agglomerate electrode. The MKM carries richer kinetic information of most reaction pathways described in contemporary literature for Cu(100). Polynomial equations are used to bridge kinetic and transport models without the need for excessive complexity. Our results show that using regression modelling, the microkinetic information at the microscopic level of the catalyst can be successfully linked with the macroscopic electrode models. We observe how mass transport parameters such as CO2 concentration, pH, and applied voltage, interacts with microkinetic information of the catalyst, influencing the reaction pathways and current densities of key products methane, ethylene, ethanol, and hydrogen. Although the model explores the medium to high voltage regimes, the methodology can address the oversimplification of CO2 reduction (CO2RR) kinetics and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for observed multiple kinetic regimes if comprehensive microkinetic models are integrated. It also serves as a foundational work for further experimental endeavours for the development of comprehensive microkinetic models. The holistic approach carried out in this work allows for the optimization of both reaction rates and mass transport, paving the way for rational optimisation of electrode designs and their scaling towards commercialization.

Abstract The performance of electrocatalysts is shaped not solely by the inherent structures of active sites but also by factors like the charge accumulation on the electrode surface and the electric double-layer (EDL) structure formed at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. At present, accurately modeling the electrochemical reactions occurring at EDL is a great challenge, mainly because the dynamic chemical change cannot be adequately captured by the commonly used static configurations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations face difficulty sampling across both time and space scales. Here, utilizing Ni-N-C/G catalysis CO2 reduction to CO as a framework to examine, we explored the catalytic process affected by EDL and accumulated electron on electrode under operando conditions by integrating grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) calculations with classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The findings suggest that the negative charge accumulating on the cathode material plays a crucial role in facilitating the adsorption and activation of CO2. Additionally, incorporating two intermediates, *COO + OH- and *CO + OH-, can significantly enhance the accuracy of the free energy profile. Moreover, the EDL can not only enhance the adsorption of CO2 and promote the cleavage of the C-OH (in the *COOH intermediate) but also inhibit the desorption of CO to some extent. Compared to the promotional effect induced by cations coordinating with intermediates, the primary promoting factor lies in the electric field (EF around 85%) distributed around the intermediates. With the inclusion of the EDL correction, our calculations align well with experimental observations, showing that for the CO2 reduction to CO on the Ni-N-C site, as the applied potential becomes increasingly negative, the rate-determining step shifts from *COOH formation to CO desorption at -0.60 VRHE. Our work not only explains a long-standing puzzle for an important catalyst but also highlights the crucial roles of EDL effects, which provide guidance on investigating electrochemical reactions without compromising the complexity of the electrode environment.

The protonation of CO is recognized as the rate-determining step in the generation of C1 products during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on Cu surfaces. Despite its importance, the detailed mechanism and the precise proton source for this elementary step remain elusive and are under intense debate. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been used to investigate such a mechanism. However, semi-local functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level face significant challenges in accurately describing adsorbate-metal interactions and surface stability. In this work, we employed the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), a method based on many-body perturbation theory, to overcome these limitations. We coupled the RPA framework with the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation to model solvation effects and incorporated a surface charging method to account for the influence of the electrochemical potential. Our study reveals that, in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, adsorbed water at the surface acts as the proton source for the reduction of *CO to *COH over a wide range of potentials via the Grotthuss mechanism. At highly negative potentials, solvent water becomes the primary proton donor, with multiple competing mechanisms observed. In contrast, DFT-GGA functionals not only significantly underestimate the reaction barriers for *COH formation but also consistently predict solvent water as the proton source across all the potentials of interest. Additionally, RPA offers distinct insights into H2O adsorption and highlights the significant range of reducing potential within which surface *OH can exist, which is crucial for accurate CO2RR modeling. These potential-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic data illustrate a pronounced divergence between the mechanistic insights offered by RPA and those derived from DFT-GGA functionals. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on proton transfer in CO2RR and establish a framework for future theoretical studies of electrochemical processes.

Abstract Precise forecasting of Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) curves is crucial for the effective and safe exploitation of reservoirs influenced by CO2 flooding. On a macroscopic level, the GOR curve typically exhibits a rapid rise, while on a microscopic level, it shows significant fluctuations. These characteristics make it challenging for conventional prediction methods to capture these dynamics, resulting in notable deficiencies in existing univariate models in terms of rapid response to changes and anomaly detection. To address the challenges in predicting GOR curves, this study employs impulse response functions and cross-correlation functions to identify the lagged correlation between water cut and GOR curves. Based on these findings, a prediction strategy incorporating water cut constraints is proposed. This approach utilizes a multi-input Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to balance the long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in GOR. The model is trained on well production data from 26 production wells in a CO2 pilot area in Northeast China, capturing monthly production indicators to improve prediction accuracy and enhance early warning capabilities for CO2 breakthrough events. The research results indicate that incorporating water cut as a constraint variable significantly improved the accuracy of GOR curve predictions, particularly enabling predictions 60 days in advance in multi-step forecasting. The model's mean absolute error (MAE) decreased from 260.60 to 172.89, and the root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 522.87 to 382.15, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the model's prediction accuracy and performance. Incorporating water cut as a constraint variable into the deep learning prediction strategy significantly improves GOR curve trend accuracy and sensitivity to fluctuations. This provides engineers with an early warning tool for CO2 breakthrough events, reducing uncertainty and risk in CO2 injection. Additionally, introducing lagged correlation variables enhances the model's ability to capture complex interactions in time series data, offering valuable insights and methodological references for future productivity prediction research.

Africa's abundant natural resources and renewable energy potential offer long-term prosperity, but the continent is still challenged with several hurdles in exploiting these resources efficiently. This study examines the prospect for sustainable growth in Africa about the impacts of renewable energy, biocapacity, government policies, research and development (R&D), and population growth on CO2 emissions. By employing multiple advanced regression modeling techniques such as Dynamic Common Correlated Effects (DCCE), Common Correlated Effects Generalized (CCEG), and Bootstrap Quantile Regression (BSQR), the study analyzed the correlations between these variables using data from 19 African countries, spanning from 2000 to 2020. While the results showed renewable energy and bio-capacity to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in all countries, government policies and R&D expenditure show differentiated effects on CO2 emission across countries. Additionally, population growth was found to be a critical factor in exacerbating CO2 emissions in Africa. Observing the lack of connection between government policy and the taping of green potentials in Africa, the findings highlight the need for targeted government policies that can promote renewable energy infrastructure, protection of biocapacity through sustainable land use practices, and increased support of R&D on green technologies.

In this study, we designed and prepared polyoxometalate@metal‐organic framework (POM@MOF) composite catalysts through the anchoring of a sandwich POM [(PW9O34)2Co4(H2O)2]10− (shortened as P2W18Co4) to the hexagonal channel of the PCN–222 (metal‐free) or PCN–222(M) (M=Fe, Co) frameworks. The composite materials were applied to the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 reaction (CO2RR) to analyse the effect of incorporating P2W18Co4 on catalytic activity. The P2W18Co4@PCN–222 composite exhibited enhanced activity across a wide potential range (–0.60~ –0.85 V vs. RHE) and an optimal FECO of 72% at –0.75 V vs. RHE, which was more than double that of PCN–222 (FECO= 33%). The current density surpassed that of the PCN–222 precursors by over sixteen times at the same potential. In contrast, the P2W18Co4@PCN–222(M) composite demonstrated decreased current density, minimal enhancement in CO2RR activity, and a competing HER behaviour. Density functional theory calculations were conducted on simplified models of P2W18Co4@H2–TCPP and P2W18Co4@M–TCPP to elucidate the divergent catalytic performances. The findings revealed that while both configurations exhibited the same rate‐limiting step (formation of the *COOH intermediate), a significantly reduced reaction barrier was only observed in the P2W18Co4@H2–TCPP setup, explaining its substantial activity improvement.

Abstract While drilling the 12″ section, a water bearing formation is encountered prior to reaching the target gas reservoir formation. This formation is sporadically-charged across the field requiring a KMW up to 21 ppg. This poses major well integrity challenges as it becomes critical to avoid losses in the resulting narrow mud window and ensuring proper cement placement. Inability to predict the mud window makes it impossible to define the drilling strategy to implement. To understand the drilling challenges, in-depth offset wells analysis was performed. Based on mud weights required to drill across the reference formation, the heat-map for historical KMW was created based on confirmed well control events. It was difficult to predict formation-flow potential. Field geomechanics studies was then carried out to correlate the mapping done earlier. Once possibility of encountering abnormally pressured formation is flagged, in order prevent drilling risks such as loss circulation and poor cementing placement, proactive measures such as: Improved influx monitoring, drilling/cementing fluids optimization, liner-and-tieback system implementation, Managed Pressure Drilling/Cementing, optimized casing design were put in place. The integrated approach led to quick influx detection, proper definition of mud window, i.e. Pore Pressure and Fracture Gradient together, helped to prevent the losses, design of fit-for-purpose bridging strategy to ensure full drilling fluid column at all time while avoiding the cost associated with fluid losses. Drilling the section with Managed Pressure Drilling system (MPD) and low mud weight led to achievement of high ROP leading to substantial time saving. The Liner string was run and Managed Pressure Cementing (MPC) was implemented to manage the equivalent circulating density (ECD), avoid losses and ensure good zonal isolation. Overall non-productive time was reduced by 40% as compared to the offset wells in the area. Integrated drilling approach delivers great gains when there is good understanding of the well integrity challenges and solutions are tailored to solve identified problems.

Abstract Petroleum Development Oman PDO has set an ambitious target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In alignment with this goal, this paper showcases how high performance can be achieved while reducing the carbon footprint of well construction. Petroleum Development Oman PDO achieves high performance through a series of continuous improvement initiatives, known as the "Well Staircase." These initiatives encompass well design optimization, the adoption of new technologies, operational efficiency enhancements, and cementing design optimization. A comprehensive value creation workshop, involving all stakeholders, was conducted to consolidate these initiatives. Furthermore, this workshop quantified the planned cost savings and time reductions. To operationalize Petroleum Development Oman PDO's net-zero emissions aspiration, a new dimension was introduced to these key initiatives - a reduction in Carbon Dioxide CO2 emissions. Illustrative examples of these initiatives include slimming the well design in the A-field, resulting in an 11% reduction in costs per well, a saving of 9.8 days, and a decrease in CO2 emissions by 245 tonnes. Replacing Motorized Reamers MSRs yielded a 1% reduction in well costs and a 0.4-tonne reduction in CO2 emissions due to transportation. The optimized slurry formulation led to a 15-tonne reduction in CO2 emissions per well. The elimination of round trips by employing a risk-assessed hole condition approach resulted in a cost saving of 1.6% per well, a time saving of 2.5 days, and a reduction in CO2 emissions by 62 tonnes. This innovative approach demonstrates how high performance can be achieved while simultaneously decarbonizing well construction, providing valuable insights and practical strategies for the industry's journey toward a sustainable future.

The direct utilization of carbon dioxide as an ideal one-carbon source in value-added chemical synthesis has garnered significant attention from the standpoint of global sustainability. In this regard, the photo/electrochemical reduction of CO2 into useful fuels and chemical feedstocks could offer a great promise for the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. However, challenges in product selectivity continue to limit the practical application of these systems. A robust and general method for the conversion of CO2 to the polarity-reversed carbon dioxide radical anion, a C1 synthon, is critical for the successful valorization of CO2 to selective carboxylation reactions. We demonstrate herein a hydride and hydrogen atom transfer synergy driven general catalytic platform involving CO2•– for highly selective anti-Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes via triple photoredox, hydride, and hydrogen atom transfer catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the synergistic operation of the triple catalytic cycle ensures a low-steady-state concentration of CO2•– in the reaction medium. This method using a renewable light energy source is mild, robust, selective, and capable of accommodating a wide range of activated and unactivated alkenes. The highly selective nature of the transformation has been revealed through the synthesis of hydrocarboxylic acids from the substrates bearing a hydrogen atom available for intramolecular 1,n-HAT process as well as diastereoselective synthesis. This technology represents a general strategy for the merger of in situ formate generation with a synergistic photoredox and HAA catalytic cycle to provide CO2•– for selective chemical transformations.

This research aimed to analyze blue carbon potential and mangrove ecosystem management in promoting climate change mitigation in Indonesia. The collected data included mangrove area data obtained through the Indonesian National Ecosystem Monitoring System (SIMONTANA). This research calculated the carbon stock using the global average of mangrove carbon stock. The results showed that the total blue carbon stored in mangrove ecosystems reached 3,267.87 Megaton Carbon (MtC). Papua and Kalimantan regions contributed the most significant potential, with 1,707.22 MtC and 608.17 MtC, respectively. The absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 11,982.21 MtCO2e. The most significant CO2 gas emissions absorption was observed in the Papua region, amounting to 6,259.80 MtCO2e, followed by Sumatra with 2,118.59 MtCO2e. This high potential value correlated with mangrove ecosystem management policies, such as conservation, restoration, and blue carbon monetization. Mangrove management for climate change mitigation was carried out through national and international cooperation to achieve the 26% to 40% emission reduction target. The existing management model of mangrove ecosystems focused on improving ecological sustainability with less orientation on improving community welfare. Implementing blue carbon monetization at the district level by involving the community as the owners or managers of the mangrove ecosystems is crucial.

As the world's leading carbon emitter, China has a profound impact on global climate change. Based on data from 2000 to 2023, this paper constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system to evaluate the progress of China's "dual carbon" goal. Using entropy-weight TOPSIS method to determine the weight of each index, we found that the installed capacity of solar power generation and sales of new energy vehicles have the most significant impact on carbon emission. Since 2012, China's overall carbon emission score has continued to rise, highlighting the importance of emission reduction measures. In order to predict CO2 emission from 2024 to 2030, the GM(1,1) grey prediction model and BP neural network regression model are used in this paper. Although the relative error of the GM(1,1) model is only 1.769%, its single-variable prediction limits its persuasibility. Therefore, this paper adjusted the index system and built a BP neural network regression model, which successfully predicted the carbon dioxide emission from 2000 to 2030, with a model fitting degree of more than 0.9. The results show that the index evaluation system and prediction model can provide an effective assessment of China's carbon emission status and provide a scientific basis for the formulation of emission reduction policies.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore carbon emission reduction of electric vehicles from the perspective of electricity consumption. Design/methodology/approach Electric vehicles (EVs) consume large amounts of electricity, thereby generating large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, so there is an urgent need to consider whether EVs have greater potential for reducing carbon emissions than other modes of transport. In this paper, the carbon emission reduction potential (CERP) coefficients of EVs are examined under three different scenarios from an interprovincial electricity trading perspective. Scenario analysis was used to quantify the CERP of EVs in 18 provinces in China. Findings The results show the following: (1) The higher the proportion of general-fuel vehicles in all transportation, the higher the CERP of EVs. (2) Interprovincial power trading affects the proportion of coal power consumed in a province, and the higher the proportion of clean power in the purchased power, the lower the proportion of coal power consumed in that province. (3) The proportion of coal power in the electricity consumption of a province is correlated negatively with the CERP of EVs in that province. Originality/value This paper quantifies the CERP of EVs compared with other modes of transport and gives provinces a more intuitive understanding of the CERP of EVs. Furthermore, we derive the carbon emission shift out of each province via the electricity trading paths among provinces, analyzing the impacts of the variability between different provinces on EV carbon emissions.

To limit the impacts of climate change, the carbon dioxide CO2 emissions (CE) correlated with the energy sector must be decreased. Reduction of CE will have a positive effect on the atmosphere by avoiding the adverse impact of global warming. To attain an eco-environment, the initial energy resource needs to move from traditional fossil fuels to unpolluted renewable energy (RE). Thus, enhancing the utilization of RE actively decreases air pollution and adds secure sustainable energy allocation to ensure future energy needs. Integrating sources of RE not only drops CE but also decreases fuel consumption, leading to significant economic savings. This paper presents the transition of global energy that will have a largely positive impact on the growth and future stability of economies with cost-effective and more sustainable all over the world. Significant reductions can be accomplished by using applicable policies and technologies. In the context of current discussions about climate change and the reduction of CE, this paper critically analyses some policies, technologies, and commonly discussed solutions. Technologies like digital twin (DT), transfer learning (TL), Edge Computing (EC), Distributed Computing (DC), and some other technologies with their work for the reduction of CE are discussed thoroughly in this paper. The given techniques in this survey paper present the best optimal solutions for CE reduction.

Climate change has become a pressing concern for humanity in the contemporary era. Scientists believe that the acceleration of global warming and climate change is directly linked to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This has become a challenge for many developing countries. The construction industry is one of the sectors that significantly contributed to heightened carbon emissions into the environment. Road construction involves various activities and processes that release substantial amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Addressing these issues are crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change and fostering sustainable development. The development of road infrastructure generates CO2 emissions across various stages. Notably, the construction stage is responsible for a significant portion of these emissions. Despite this, research efforts in Sri Lanka have primarily focused on reducing CO2 emissions in building construction projects, with limited attention to strategies specifically targeting road construction projects. The construction phase of road development has thus far been overlooked in terms of CO2 emission reduction strategies. Consequently, this study seeks to raise awareness among academics, professionals, and practitioners involved in road development projects about the factors influencing CO2 emissions during the road construction phase. The objectives of this study are to examine the factors affecting CO2 emissions during road construction development, identify the activities and processes contributing to CO2 emissions during the construction phase of road projects, explore existing sustainable strategies used in road construction to mitigate CO2 emissions, and assess their applicability to the Sri Lankan Road construction sector. A systematic literature review was conducted to achieve these objectives, selecting the fifty-six most relevant past research studies.

Durasi pemaparan meliputi interval waktu 2 jam, 4 jam, 6 jam, 12 jam, dan 24 jam. Pengukuran kadar CO2 di udara dilakukan sebelum dan setelah pemaparan Sansevieria trifasciata menggunakan peralatan pengukuran yang sesuai. Hasil pengukuran kemudian dianalisis secara deskriptif dan analitis.Hasil: Menunjukkan adanya penurunan signifikan kadar CO2 setelah Sansevieria trifasciata terpapar selama 24 jam, dengan penurunan sebesar 32% dari kadar awal. Durasi paparan 6 jam dan 12 jam menunjukkan penurunan masing-masing sekitar 15% dan 22%. Durasi paparan 2 jam dan 4 jam menunjukkan penurunan yang kurang signifikan yaitu masing-masing 4% dan 8%.Simpulan: Tanaman lidah mertua (Sansevieria trifasciata) dapat digunakan sebagai solusi alami dalam mengurangi polusi karbon dioksida serta meningkatkan kualitas udara dalam ruang tertutup. ABSTRACTThe Effect Of Exposure Duration Of Sansevieria trifasciata On Reducing Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Content In Indoor EnvironmentsBackground: Indoor air quality has a significant impact on human health, ecosystems, and climate, often being worse than outdoor air due to limited ventilation and high occupancy levels. High concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) indoors can cause health issues such as espiratory and cardiovascular problems, and increase the risk of cancer. This study aims to explore the impact of the duration of exposure to these plants on CO2 reduction and humidity regulation indoors, with the hope that the results will provide useful information for utilizing plants as a natural solution to improve indoor air quality and comfort.Method: This type of research is a quasi-experiment involving the exposure of Sansevieria trifasciata in a controlled environment with periodically monitored CO2 levels. The exposure durations include intervals of 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours. CO2 levels in the air are measured before and after the exposure of Sansevieria trifasciata using appropriate measurement equipment. The measurement results are then analyzed descriptively and analytically.Result: The text shows a significant decrease in the CO2 levels after the snake plant was exposed for 24 hours, with a decrease of 32% from the initial levels. Exposure durations of 6 hours and 12 hours showed decreases of approximately 15% and 22% respectively. Exposure durations of 2 hours and 4 hours showed less significant decreases of 4% and 8% respectively.Conclusion: Sansevieria trifasciata can be used as a natural solution to reduce carbon dioxide pollution and improve air quality in enclosed spaces.

Abstract Objectives/Scope Reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is crucial for mitigating climate change. CO2 Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is considered one of the most promising options for carbon reduction. It involves the injection of CO2 into the structural reservoirs in deep, permeable geologic formations. The effectiveness of CCS relies heavily on the geological and petrophysical properties of the storage reservoir. It has been studied that some percentage of injected supercritical CO2 is securely trapped underground via two major trapping mechanisms: physical trapping, and geochemical trapping. Physical trapping mechanisms include structural (hydrostratigraphic) trapping, residual (capillary) trapping, and sorption trapping. The physical trapping is relatively fixed for a given storage reservoir due to its geological parameters. The geochemical trapping mechanism occurs through solubility trapping and mineral trapping. It is very well known that solubility trapping includes slow diffusion in the aqueous phase and convective processes. In the case of mineral trapping, the process is over a much longer period, and it is one of the slowest mechanisms. Methods, Procedures, and Process This study employed a novel approach to enhance CO2 sequestration rates by injecting CO2 and brine produced from the same reservoir simultaneously. The solubility trapping occurs because of the dissolution of CO2 in the brine, leading to dense CO2-saturated brine. The main rate-limiting step in solubility trapping is the CO2 migration in brine which happens through diffusion and is very well known to be a slow process. To address this, the study proposed enhancing the mixing between injected CO2 and brine during the injection phase while maintaining reservoir pressure. Results, Observations, Conclusions Utilizing a systematic numerical model, the study identified an optimal approach involving a combination of CO2 and brine injection with brine production based on reservoir pressure transients. This strategy significantly enhanced CO2 injection rates, leading to a potential increase in CO2 sequestration capacity throughout the injection and storage campaign. Thus, with this innovative approach and with the use of existing CCS reservoir and existing facilities we achieved 10% to 30% more CO2 sequestration capacity through enhanced solubility trapping as well as some increment in mineral trapping. Novel/Additive Information A novel approach was employed to enhance CO2 sequestration rates by injecting CO2 and brine produced from the same reservoir simultaneously. This simulation exercise provides guidelines on enhanced reservoir management to increase CO2 sequestration rates and therefore volumes in a reservoir by managing the production and disposal of water. These novel guidelines enable operators to increase the economic value and ROI (Return on Investment) on such CSS projects.

Abstract As the world aims to mitigate the climate-changing effects of global warming, intergovernmental regulatory bodies increasingly focus on greenhouse-gas emission reduction by implementing environmental policies to phase down fossil-fuel utilization and develop sustainable energy sources as part of global energy transition efforts. While various greenhouse gasses are emitted from a wide range of natural and artificial sources, human-produced carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary driver of climate change as it accounts for approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions (Olivier et al, 2020). Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from the atmosphere have led to significant advancements in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, which aim to inject CO2 in underground storage wells with non-permeable formations capable of safe and permanent downhole containment. Furthermore, CCS is widely regarded as one of the most effective ways to mitigate climate change as recent studies estimate it could reduce CO2 emissions by 20% before the year 2050 (Elkatatny, 2021). The planning and execution of a comprehensive CCS well integrity strategy is considerably more complex than conventional well integrity practices commonly found in the oil and gas industry. The hydration of supercritical CO2 leads to multiple carbonation reactions producing elevated concentrations of carbonic acid (H2CO3), which can severely degrade a cement barrier in radial direction and cause longitudinal cement defects. Concurrently, cyclic pressure and temperature fluctuations during long-term CO2 injection can compromise casing-to-cement bond, causing a potential leak path through micro annuli. These factors may lead to gas migration and subsequent Sustained Annular Pressure (SAP) buildup on surface, increasing the risk of direct CO2 leakage into the atmosphere. An innovative CO2 Elastomeric Cement Integrity Sleeve (C-ECIS) has been developed specifically for the purpose of SAP prevention and well integrity optimization in CO2 storage wells. Distinctly different to a swellable packer, the C-ECIS was designed as a slip-on seal for external installation onto downhole tubulars. It is comprised of a novel swellable elastomer which utilizes CO2 as the primary swelling fluid medium for its volumetric expansion. It permanently swells and seals a casing-to-cement microannular flow path immediately upon direct exposure to gas migration within the casing-to-cement microannulus. The C-ECIS is a unique technological innovation with the potential to transform the industry's current approach to CCS well integrity planning due to its simplicity and reliability. This publication provides an in-depth overview of the technology, its qualification process, and current field implementation status.

Abstract The implementation of a novel technology that reduced Portland cement content by up to 70% was pumped in a complex 9 5/8-in. casing section of an offshore well, which resulted in a significant reduction to carbon footprint. As the oil and gas industry faces the challenges of decarbonization, one of the focus areas that remains is carbon emissions generated by the cement industry. The innovative and tailored system described in this study is designed to deliver high performance at a lower density than conventional systems for improved barrier dependability. Proven laboratory results show that the system enables higher compressive strength at a lower density, increases ductility, and reduces permeability and corrosion resistance. The main engineering and operational advantage of this system is its capability for deployment without the requirement for specialized or additional equipment, which provides an operationally efficient and sustainable barrier. The primary challenge cementing this section was to reduce the equivalent circulating density (ECD) caused by the elevated risk of losses predicted by offset wells. This required the use of a specialized low-density slurry system with durable mechanical properties. Another challenge was to lower carbon emissions associated with large slurry volumes because conventional high-Portland content cement systems do not align with sustainability goals. Modern technology was applied, and the well was successfully delivered with all achieved objectives. This case demonstrated that sustainable technology is not only efficient to reduce carbon footprint, but also to successfully achieve zonal isolation without downgrading the final cement quality compared to conventional cement systems. Cement production accounts for approximately 8% of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually (Abdelaal et al.). The benefits of the application of this innovative technology in future wells are discussed, which can help reduce carbon footprint while slurry performance to achieve the zonal isolation.

Abstract The energy industry has been taking transformative actions to achieve sustainable growth. Specifically, hydraulic fracturing and associated activities are known to be emissions intensive. The objective here is to develop a digital tool that enables quick, efficient, error-free carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions footprint assessments for various job types. The workflows implemented in the tool cover different phases in the intervention and stimulation life cycle of a well. The application's architecture is composed of generic modular assessments, such as resource utilization, site execution, and post-job activities. The user experience focuses on simple domain workflows in which complex processes are embedded to automate the corresponding emissions calculations. Detailed emissions factors for different fuel types are utilized from US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data. The engine first identifies the baseline fuel consumption related to product transportation, equipment mobilization and demobilization, execution at wellsite, and related well cleanup or flaring. The baseline uses historical consumption data, but it goes through a calibration loop based on real-time consumption data tracking. With the emissions factors and fuel efficiency, the second step of the engine is to calculate the CO2 emissions related to the fuel quantity and type. The tool incorporates eight different fuel types and multiple publicly available gas compositions from various basins. The application organically integrates with expansive master data systems such as fluid, proppant, and equipment databases. Moreover, users can seamlessly import design details in one click from other stimulation and intervention design software. Multiple workflows can then be generated to sensitize fluid volume, proppant mass, job type, fuel type, technologies, digital innovations, etc. The current interface captures detailed workflows for conventional and unconventional operations in land and offshore environments. It also supports utilization of an electric fleet. With this digital solution, we are well positioned to (1) accelerate the decarbonizing initiative and (2) position new technology portfolios to transition to cleaner operations. Current implementation showed the impact of technologies such as channel fracturing, retarded acid systems, degradable chemistry, and various predictive models and is positioned to enable smart strategies by integrating sustainability assessment and metrics to drive business growth. Real cases from some geographies show enablement of 20 to 30% emissions reduction. This novel effort is now extended to collaborate with engineering and supply chain teams for real-time measurements, post-job actual emissions calibration, and embodied carbon of material to measure accurately the path to net zero.

Abstract This paper presents a comprehensive review of building lifecycle carbon emissions (CEBL) and reduction approaches, analyzing over 300 recent publications and engaging in in-depth discussion of more than 100 key studies. The review systematically examines CO 2 emissions across all stages of a building's lifecycle, from material production and transportation to construction, operation, demolition, and material recycling. While existing research highlights the significance of operational energy efficiency, this review reveals critical research gaps in quantifying transportation emissions, accounting for on-site equipment emissions during construction, and addressing the unique characteristics of non-residential buildings. Furthermore, the paper underscores the urgent need for improved construction waste management practices, especially in developing countries where landfilling remains prevalent. For the building carbon reduction approaches, promising building carbon emission reduction approaches include leveraging carbon dioxide sinks, implementing integrated energy systems, integrating building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), and enacting effective policy interventions are separately discussed. By revealing data and theoretical limitations within current research, this review calls for more integrated and context-specific approaches to CEBL assessment, paving the way for a more sustainable built environment.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">With all the environmental concern of diesel fuelled vehicle, it is a challenge to phase out them completely specifically from Heavy duty application. Most pragmatic solution lies in solutions which improves the fuel economy and reduce the carbon emission of existing diesel fuelled vehicle fleet and retain the economic feasibility offered by present diesel fuelled vehicle fleets. With implementation of Bharat Stage IV (BS VI) emission norms across country from April 2020, supply of BS VI complaint diesel fuel started and BS VI complaint vehicles with upgraded engine technologies and after treatment devices started to come which made present vehicle fleets heterogeneous with substantive number of BS IV vehicle. Beside improvement of engine technologies, existing BS IV vehicle fleet performance can be enhanced through improved fuel and lubricants solutions. The present research work is a step towards improving the fuel economy of existing BS IV diesel vehicles through the intervention of differentiated diesel fuel and dedicated state of the art lubricants combinations.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">Developed through modification &amp; up-gradation of BS VI diesel fuel, Differentiated Diesel fuel is having excellent injector cleaning properties, improved combustion, low soot formation etc which intern improve the combustion result in fuel economy improvement and reduce carbon emissions. Further, efforts were made to comprehensively review the lubricant requirement of vehicle. Green combo lubricants have been designed &amp; developed with state-of-the-art lubricants combination comprising engine oil, transmission oil and axle oil which reduce the friction from engine and drivelines and results in further fuel economy benefit. To evaluate the actual fuel economy improvement and emission reduction credentials, comprehensive field trials of Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo lubricants were undertaken in fleet of heavy-duty diesel buses deputed at state transport. State transport was selected due to availability of BS IV complaint diesel fuelled buses of varied vintage from 50,000 km to 200,000 km and nearby vicinity to have better field trial supervision. Field trials were designed in such a way that combined effect of Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo Lubricants and then effect of Green Combo lubricants alone can be evaluated. Fleet of buses were charged with Green Combo lubricants after proper flushing and put new engine oil filter. After charging the Green Combo lubricants, buses were fuelled with Differentiated Diesel and sent to their routine routes for actual running for evaluating the combined effect of differentiated diesel and Green Combo lubricants for initial field trials and buses covered in the range of 25,000 km to 40,000 km each. Afterwards, field trial buses were fuelled with normal BS VI diesel and completed the field trials for evaluation the effect of Green Combo lubricants only. Used engine oil samples and idle emissions through portable emission measurement system as per field trial protocol were taken during the field trials.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">120,000 km field trials were successfully completed, and it demonstrated that Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo Lubricant together improved the fuel economy by 8% - 9% and emission reduction in Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Total Hydrocarbon (THC) are 4.5%, 10%, 4% and 5 % respectively. Green Combo lubricants alone improved the fuel economy by 4% - 5%. Used engine oil analysis confirmed the satisfactory performance of Green Combo lubricants during field trials. Based on theoretical assessment of implementation of this combination together at throughout state transport leads to saving of ~ 350 Kilolitre's (KL) Diesel annually and thus ~ 925 Tonne CO<sub>2</sub> annually which shows the immense potential of saving the precious diesel fuel and reduced the carbon emission.</div></div>

Abstract The feasibility of utilizing induction flow levitation technique for synthesizing catalysts aimed at facilitating methanol production was explored in this study. Two distinct types of catalysts were prepared on a silicon dioxide substrate through mechanochemical synthesis utilizing copper and zinc oxide nanopowders: Cu/SiO2 and Cu/ZnO/SiO2. Subsequently, comprehensive characterization of the resulting nanoparticles and catalytic systems was conducted employing a suite of physicochemical techniques. Additionally, the purity assessment of the resultant nanoparticles was accomplished utilizing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The investigation of catalytic activity was carried out within a continuous-flow reactor, wherein methanol emerged as the predominant reaction product. Over the course of the experiment, a reduction in operating pressure was achieved while upholding elevated methanol productivity and ensuring a notable carbon dioxide conversion rate. Experimental analyses conducted on the pilot plant demonstrated that the catalyst incorporating zinc oxide showcased superior efficiency, attributed to its heightened CO2 and H2 sorption capabilities, consistent with the results of thermoprogrammed desorption. As by-products of the reaction, carbon monoxide, ethanol, methyl formate, dimethyl ether, propanol, isobutyl, and isopropanol were detected.

As urban areas continue to emerge as significant contributors to global carbon emissions, the classification of urban street trees has gained increasing importance in carbon sequestration research. By precisely identifying and categorizing different tree species, the carbon absorption capabilities of urban vegetation can be evaluated more accurately. This understanding is essential for addressing the growing environmental challenges posed by carbon emissions, as urban trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and mitigating the effects of climate change. In this study, a Feature Distillation Based on Diffusion Model (FDBD) framework was proposed, utilizing state-of-the-art image classification technology to enhance the accuracy of urban tree species identification. The framework utilized knowledge distillation, a process where a smaller, more efficient “student” model is trained to mimic the performance of a larger, more complex “teacher” model, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining high accuracy. The model’s effectiveness has been validated through combination experiments with a selected backbone model, achieving promising results. This approach not only enhances the understanding of urban trees’ carbon sequestration potential but also provides crucial insights for policymakers. By facilitating precise tree classification, it empowers urban planners to implement more informed and targeted strategies for carbon reduction, ultimately promoting more sustainable urban environments.

Recently, lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li-NRR) in nonaqueous electrolytes has proven to be an environmentally sustainable and feasible route for ammonia electrosynthesis, revealing tremendous economic and social advantages over the industrial Haber-Bosch process which consumes enormous fossil fuels and generates massive carbon dioxide emissions, and direct electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) which suffers from sluggish kinetics and poor faradaic efficiencies. However, reaction mechanisms of Li-NRR and the role of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer in activating N2 remain unclear, impeding its further development. Here, using electronic structure theory, we propose a nitridation-coupled reduction mechanism and a nitrogen cycling reduction mechanism on lithium and lithium nitride surfaces, which are major components of SEI in experimental characterization. Our work reveals divergent pathways in Li- NRR from conventional direct electrocatalytic NRR, highlights the role of surface reconstruction in improving reactivity, and sheds light on enhancing efficiency of ammonia electrosynthesis.

Municipal solid waste is one of the most significant sources of gas emissions. In a context of renewable energy production and greenhouse gas emission reduction, we focus on the amount of biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in a controlled landfill environment. We present a mathematical model describing this process from a microbiological and biochemical point of view, including the dynamics of the methane and carbon dioxide produced. A qualitative analysis of the dynamic system shows the existence of an infinite number of non-hyperbolic equilibria inducing an attractor that has been identified. Through numerical tests, we explore how the non-connectivity of the attractor resulting from the choice of growth functions can entirely transform the performance of the process, and highlight critical initial stock values that influence the amount of biogas produced.

Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of carbonyl-containing compounds provides a sustainable approach to upgrading biomass-derived feedstocks with reduced energy requirements. However, PEC reduction has primarily focused on hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction reactions, limited by the availability of stable photocathode materials. In this study, we demonstrate the extended PEC performance of defect-engineered CuFe2O4 films, achieving over 18 hours of stable benzaldehyde reduction to benzyl alcohol. Modulating CuFe2O4 conductivity from n-type to p-type through controlled annealing conditions enhanced its hole concentration, achieving a cathodic photocurrent density of 1.5 mA/cm2 at 0.5 V vs. RHE. Using 1,4-benzoquinone as a redox mediator in a mixed acetonitrile/water electrolyte, the PEC system produced benzyl alcohol at a rate of 2.57 μmol/h with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.3% at 0.50 V vs. Ag/AgNO₃. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) revealed that oxygen-rich annealing conditions improved charge transport and surface catalytic activity, resulting in a threefold increase in benzyl alcohol production rate. This PEC approach lowered the required applied potential by ~1 V compared to traditional electrocatalysis methods, offering a more energy-efficient route for carbonyl reduction. These findings underscore the potential of CuFe₂O₄ as a viable photocathode material for sustainable organic transformations under mild reaction conditions.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technology is an emergent field with the potential for substantial CO2 emissions reduction, enabling low-carbon utilization of fossil fuels. It is widely regarded as a critical technology for combating global climate change and controlling greenhouse gas emissions. According to recent studies, China has identified CCUS as a key emissions reduction technology in climate change response and carbon neutrality objectives. Within this framework, supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) transport pipelines are an essential means for efficient and safe transportation of CO2. Corrosion protection of pipelines enhances the efficiency and safety of CCUS technology and supports broader implementation and application. This paper reviews the current research on corrosion protection for SC-CO2 transport pipelines, discusses effect factors, compares various corrosion protection strategies, and analyzes the challenges in corrosion protection of SC-CO2 transport pipelines. It concludes with a perspective on future research and development directions in this field. This paper is dedicated to providing new research strategies for pipeline corrosion protection in CCUS technology in the future, and providing technical support for pipeline corrosion protection in CCUS industrial applications.

Energy metabolism at the emergence of life has been the topic of intense theoretical and experimental study. Alkaline hydrothermal vents (AHVs) may have facilitated energy-transfer and carbon-fixation at life’s emergence, via a primordial chemiosmotic mechanism. Specifically, pH separation across vent walls could have been the forerunner to pH separation across microbial membranes, with electron-conductive inorganic barriers containing [Ni-]FeS minerals mimicking the active sites of metalloenzymes in potentially ancient biological reductive acetyl-CoA Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, reverse Krebs and other metabolic pathways. We previously demonstrated pH gradient dependent reduction of CO2 to formate by H2 in AHV interface conditions. Here, we address the same problem of CO2 reduction, however using a macroscale reactor that allowed us to use minerals synthesized via protocols analogous to the alkaline vent mount formation. This reactor also allowed us to probe more variables, and explore longer experimentation time-frames. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the effect of the different aspects of the gradientrich hydrothermal-vent interface on the observed CO2 electrochemical reduction- such as different minerals, temperature gradients, as well as the flow of electrons under passive vs. induced currents and potentials. Using experimental simulations and electrochemistry techniques, We detected two key steps of the WL pathway (CO2 to formic acid, and the formation acetic acid) as well as reactions in the reverse Krebs cycle (fumarate to succinate). Both Ni in the mineral, and temperature as a property, were shown to affect the formation of formate. Extremely small currents were enough to efficiently carry out CO2 reduction. This work develops benchmarks to electrochemically explore the model of protometabolisms in the vent-ocean interface and opens to future analyses on the catalytic or electrocatalytic properties of Fe-[Ni-]S minerals as precursors of metalloenzymes.

By passively dissipating thermal emission into the ultracold deep space, radiative cooling (RC) is an environment-friendly means for gaining cooling capacity, paving a bright future for global energy saving and carbon dioxide reduction. However, assessing the global RC capacity at the day-to-annual scale remains challenging as the RC capacity significantly depends on geographic and environmental conditions. To our knowledge, no analysis of global RC capacity has been reported. Herein, we show the distribution of RC capacity on Earth by establishing a precise assessment model for evaluating the performance of a radiative cooler. Our assessment is comprehensively validated against experimental data and extended to elucidate the capacity of representative broadband and selective cooler. We also categorize the global RC capacity into five representative regions based on the year-round cooling power. Our assessment can inform trade-offs between design and practical application for the RC systems, alongside promoting RC-based technologies to tackle worldwide energy and environment challenges.

Abstract Injecting CO2 into geological formations has become an important process for carbon sequestration to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels and mitigate climate change. Therefore, understanding the impact of CO2 injection on rock mechanical properties is essential for assessing the integrity and safety of storage sites. This study employs nanoindentation to measure variations in rock mechanical properties caused by CO2 injection. Nanoindentation provides localized measurements of hardness and elastic modulus. Results indicate significant alterations of more than 95% reduction in Young's modulus of the carbonate rock samples post-CO2 injection, with implications for the long-term stability of sequestration sites. This research contributes to the development of more accurate models for predicting the mechanical performance of CO2-injected carbonate rocks, ultimately enhancing the safety and efficacy of carbon sequestration and enhanced oil recovery using CO2 efforts.

Abstract The LNG industry stands at the cusp of a transformation driven by the climate imperative. Focusing on an innovative low emission industrial hub in Northern Australia, this paper shows how CO2 emissions can be reduced in a world-class LNG asset by strategic master planning, colocation of industrial facilities and taking a marginal cost approach to assessment, screening, and implementation of existing and new decarbonisation technologies. We propose: A new breed of electrified LNG processing facilities that could deliver a ~90% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent intensity with sufficient renewable firmed imported power – given that gas Driven emissions constitute ~78%-93% of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent emissions on a sample of current practice LNG facilities. Leveraging partnerships in upstream renewable power, hydrogen supply and enabled downstream carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, we outline how we can de-risk assets from economic and regulatory uncertainty by providing alternative pathways to sustaining emissions reduction. A strategic methodology to screen and implement ‘avoid and mitigate’ options first, focusing on those opportunities the offer the most cost-effective emissions reduction opportunities. Phase 1 – Establish a Baseline Emissions Profile: At a conceptual level, estimate all emissions sources from energy usage to fugitive to flaring emissions in line with the relevant carbon accounting standards. Understand the largest emissions sources and their drivers.Phase 2: Identify & Prioritise Emission Reduction Opportunities: Apply existing and innovative technologies to uncover opportunities for GHG emission reductions. Identify the GHG reduction potential and the lifecycle costs of implementation of such opportunities.Phase 3: Select Initiatives and Develop Emissions Reduction Roadmap: Plot all emissions reduction opportunities on a Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) that clearly shows the lowest to highest marginal abatement costs for each opportunity. Understand non-cost risks of each opportunity which may be technology readiness or third-party risks and then select the opportunities for more detailed assessment that align to your businesses strategic GHG reductions roadmap and risk appetite. A deeper analysis into an industrial Precinct Case study in Northern Australia (Middle Arm) and how key attributes are comparable with Gulf countries.

This paper aims to use photovoltaics as a case study of a green building in Jordan to provide electric power, boost the power provided by the national grid, and enhance energy policies to reduce CO2 emissions. The photovoltaic PV panels are used to provide nearly 7.4 kW of electricity power for the lighting. The study uses Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Screen (RETScreen) computer software to achieve this aim. Three different aspects were subjected to the analysis: Firstly, the proposed case power system; secondly, emission analysis; and finally, financial analysis. The worksheet of the analysis of emission reduction is used to estimate the emission of CO2 in the proposed project. The study findings reveal that the GHG emission factor in tCO2/MWh equals 0.924, while the net annual GHG emission reduction in tCO2 is 8,367.4, which is equivalent to the consumption of 19,459 barrels of crude oil.

Abstract Kuwait reported has 89 million metric tons of CO2 emissions as per the 2020 world report published by United Nation (UN). The oil and gas sector significantly contributes to the country's economic growth while simultaneously serving as a major source of CO2 emissions. The country's national oil company has established an objective to reduce CO2 emissions in alignment with national goals. To achieve this, advancements in technology that can both minimize CO2 emissions and enhance productivity are essential. In Kuwait, the operator employed ultradeep azimuthal resistivity (UDAR) technology within a carbonate reservoir that has a production history spanning over 57 years. The primary objective of utilizing UDAR 3D reservoir mapping was to reduce unnecessary operations, such as the drilling of a pilot hole, which would otherwise consume additional energy. By eliminating these superfluous activities, the initiative aims to contribute to the minimization of carbon emissions through decreased energy consumption. The elimination of the pilot hole and the cement operation saved approximately 10 operational days per well. The rig energy saving from reduced fuel consumption amounted to approximately 230 metric tons CO2 / well. This reduction of the CO2 emissions through 3D reservoir mapping, established a new milestone and supported the nation’s goal of achieving full carbon neutrality by 2050.

Sediment dredging and aeration are used as important technical measures to remediate internal loading of sediment in polluted rivers. However, previous studies have overlooked the impact of dredging and aeration on Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission. We established three aeration rate(six different aeration intervals), one dredging treatment to investigate the effect of aeration and dredging on pollutant removals and CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions. The results indicated the pollutants and GHGs at 2.4, 3.4, 4.4 L min−1 aeration rates reached collaborative emission reduction after more than 3 h or within 1.5 h. Meanwhile, the GHGs fluxes after aeration decreased with the increasing aeration rate, with the mean CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes of 69.74, 0.16, 7.53 mg m−2 h−1 and 33.64, 0.09, 4.17 mg m−2 h−1 before and after aeration, respectively. With respect to dredging, the pollutants and N2O reached synergic effects between reduction of pollution and carbon emissions after 1 h dredging. Specifically, the CO2 and CH4 emissions after dredging was lower than those of before dredging, but the N2O emissions was higher than those of before dredging. In addition, our analysis revealed that the dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), available potassium (AK) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4+-N) in the sediment influenced GHGs fluxes at the water-air interface in the aeration. Our study indicated moderate aeration and dredging can achieve the synergistic effect in reducing pollution and carbon emissions.

Abstract Rock wetting characteristics directly affect the storage size, security, and fluid flow behavior in Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS). This study evaluates the impact of temperature variations on the wetting behavior of the UAE carbonate reservoirs in UHS environments and its implications for carbonates' structural and residual trapping capacities. A molecular-level discussion on the impact of temperature variation on UAE carbonates' wetting behavior during UHS implementation is presented for the first time. To obtain molecular insights into the storage process, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on carbonate/brine/H2+ cushion gas systems. A calcite substrate was used as a representative of the carbonate surface, and CO2 was selected as a cushion gas. Then, the wettability of calcite/brine/H2+CO2 was evaluated at a fixed pressure of 50 MPa, a temperature range of 323 to 388 K, and a fixed salt concentration of 15 wt. %, mirroring the typical reservoir conditions found in the UAE. We report that, at low temperature (323 K), the presence of CO2 in the gas stream (i.e., H2+CO2 mixture) leads to a reduction in the hydrophilicity of calcite due to the higher intermolecular van der Waals attraction found between the calcite and CO2 molecules, leading to CO2 aggregation at the calcite surface. With increasing temperature, the calcite-CO2 interactions diminish, and the calcite surface becomes perfectly water-wet. It can be concluded that due to the higher interactions between calcite-CO2 compared to calcite-H2 interactions, the utilization of CO2 as a cushion gas enhances the carbonate's ability to trap H2 gas by filling the smaller pores with brine and dissolved CO2 molecules while leaving the larger pores available for injected hydrogen. Additionally, introducing CO2 before injecting H2 reduces the amount of hydrogen that can be residually trapped, resulting in an enhanced H2 recovery process.

Abstract This article takes the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression cycle system as the research object, and analyzes different control methods such as speed control (including compressor speed regulation and turbine speed regulation), volume control (including changing compressor inlet pressure and compressor inlet temperature), and throttling control under established thermodynamic parameters. Based on the characteristics of the cycle and the characteristics of a single control method, a control strategy combining multiple control methods with different load intervals and mobility requirements is proposed. The research results indicate that speed control has the highest efficiency under partial load conditions among various methods, followed by volume control and throttling control. There are depth limits for load reduction in a single control method, and compressor surge and outlet pressure over pressure may occur in different load ranges. Based on the characteristics of different load intervals and regulation methods, we propose a combination control strategy scheme. When 0% FP ≤ load level &lt; 20% FP, a combined control scheme of throttling control and bypass control is adopted; When 20% FP ≤ load level &lt; 90% FP, the most efficient speed control scheme is adopted, which adopts speed gear adjustment to avoid frequent equipment actions. When 90% FP ≤ load level ≤ 100% FP, volume control is adopted.

Abstract The rapid advancement of digital technologies in China, America, India, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Indonesia, Germany, Iran, South Korea, and Russia presents both significant opportunities and challenges for achieving sustainable development, particularly in balancing economic growth with environmental conservation. This study rigorously assesses the impact of digital government initiatives on sustainable innovations and emission reduction policies from 2002 to 2022, focusing on their ability to balance ecological and economic influences. By employing a sophisticated model that integrates second‐generation tests to confirm cross‐sectional dependence and gradient variation, this research ensures the precision of its findings. The analysis reveals that digitalization, clean energy adoption, and the utilization of these countries' abundant natural resources over this two‐decade period have contributed substantially to reducing their ecological footprints. However, the study also identifies structural discontinuities in the linear trends and intercepts due to the integration of these technologies. By incorporating variables such as e‐commerce, income from natural resources, economic growth, conservation‐friendly technologies, sustainable energy sources, and carbon dioxide emissions, the model provides a comprehensive evaluation. The results highlight a consistent decline in ecological impact driven by technological and economic advancements. The policy implications are clear: to sustain and enhance these positive trends, governments must continue to promote digitalization and innovation while carefully managing the integration of new technologies to prevent potential disruptions.

Background: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that often results in atrophic scarring, impacting physical appearance and mental health. This study aims to evaluating the potential effect of combining punch elevation with fractional CO2 laser resurfacing versus laser treatment alone for moderate to severe atrophic acne scars. Patients and Methods: A split-face comparative study involved 20 adults aged 18 to 55 with moderate to severe atrophic acne scars. One side received punch elevation followed by fractional CO2 laser resurfacing, while the other side received fractional CO2 laser treatment alone. Clinical assessments included Goodman and Baron’s grading scale and patient satisfaction ratings. Histopathological evaluations analyzed fibroblast activity, epidermal thickness, and collagen composition. Results: The combined treatment significantly improved scar severity, with a mean reduction of 44.40% compared to 18.89% for the laser-only group (p < 0.001). Histopathological analysis showed increases in fibroblast activity (5.87% to 19.14%, p < 0.003) and epidermal thickness (635.65 µm to 1497.35 µm, p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was higher for the combined approach (6.80 ± 1.2) versus laser-only treatment (5.65 ± 1.3, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Combining punch elevation technique with fractional CO2 laser resurfacing enhances treatment outcomes for atrophic acne scars,,,

Single-atom catalysts are promising for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion but face challenges in controllable syntheses. Herein, a facile selenic acid etching-assisted strategy has been developed to fabricate a hybrid metal-semimetal dual single-atom catalyst for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. This strategy enables the simultaneous generation of monodisperse active sites and hierarchical morphologies with hollow nanostructures. The as-obtained catalyst with Fe–Se dual single-atom sites supported by porous nitrogen-doped carbon (FeSe-NC) shows exceptional catalytic activity and CO selectivity, delivering a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of >97% with industrially comparable jCO, superior to the Fe single-atom catalyst. Moreover, the FeSe-NC-based rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery delivers a high power density (2.01 mW cm–2) and outstanding FECO (>90%), as well as excellent cycling stability. Experimental results together with theoretical calculations reveal that the etching-induced defects and the Se-modulated Fe centers with asymmetrical polarized charge distributions synergistically facilitate the key intermediate *CO desorption and thus accelerate the CO2-to-CO conversion.

One of the significant challenges faced by the oil and gas industry is the reduction of the carbon footprint associated with drilling operations. This paper presents a case study on the implementation of a selective flocculation process to optimize the consumption of PER-FLEX fluid, a high-performance water-based mud (WBM), during drilling operations. Conducted in a Colombian oil field, this study demonstrates how the adjustment of polymer concentration and injection rates in the flocculation process can reduce the need for fluid dilution, thereby decreasing water and chemical consumption, waste production, and CO2 equivalent (CO2 eq.) emissions. The findings highlight the effectiveness of selective flocculation in enhancing drilling fluid performance and contributing to sustainability goals.

Abstract The rapid and uncontrolled urbanization of cities in developing countries has engendered a plethora of urban mobility issues, including traffic congestion, accidents, and air pollution. To address these challenges, contemporary urban mobility trends are incorporating innovative technologies and sustainable governance practices. This article investigates how urban managers can leverage the opportunities presented by cost‐effective technologies and the management of urban data to enhance urban mobility in developing countries. Within this discourse, an RSU‐based approach is proposed that employs motorbike taxis for inter‐vehicular communication, given their status as the most widely used form of public transportation. This approach substantially diminishes investment costs and reinforces the sustainability of urban mobility. Through the implementation of this solution, a noteworthy reduction is anticipated in the emission of gases such as CO2, and NOx, known contributors to climate change and various respiratory diseases. To validate the efficacy of the proposed solution, four distinct scenarios are scrutinized in a case study centered on the city of Douala in Cameroon, utilizing tools such as OMNET++, SUMO, Veins, and INET. The proposed framework offers significant benefits in terms of environmental sustainability and operational efficiency. It enables a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 15% reduction in NOx emissions, an 11% drop in fuel consumption, and a 15% reduction in waiting time in traffic jams. The envisaged solution aims to aid urban managers in their decision‐making processes, specifically in advancing sustainable urban mobility. Through the adoption of this approach, cities in developing countries can mitigate challenges associated with urban mobility and enhance the overall well‐being of their residents.

The overuse of fossil fuels has resulted in massive CO2 emissions, causing global environmental problems. Renewable energy-driven electrocatalysis, which can convert CO2 into fuels and chemicals, is considered an emerging technology for carbon resource recycling. Cu-based catalysts sputtered on hydrophobic carbon paper and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane were comparatively investigated, while the effect of the thickness of the Cu sputtering layer on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance was investigated. Additionally, the effect of substrate properties on the distribution and morphology of sputtered Cu metal was investigated by SEM and XRD. With carbon paper as the substrate, the highest FEC2+ achieved was 70% at 200 mA/cm2, while the maximum value of FEC2+ on the Cu/PTFE electrode was realized with a Cu thickness of 400 nm (72%). Additionally, the PTFE substrate demonstrated a better inhibiting effect on HER, with a lower FEH2 and high FEC2+ over different applied current densities.

Abstract Demonstrating the integrity of Plugged and Abandoned (P&A'd) legacy wells during CO2 storage projects is a crucial requirement for regulators, stakeholders, and operators. The corrosive nature of CO2 may affect the integrity of such wells, jeopardising the long-term containment of the CO2. This study illustrates the new capabilities, tailored for CO2 storage applications, of a modelling framework (Johnson et al, 2021a&b) that provides a quantitative, risk-based assessment of the long-term integrity of legacy P&A'd wells. The following three new modelling modules are added to this integrated framework to account for the key concerns due to the presence of CO2 in the system: The cement-CO2 geochemistry "add-on" module evaluates the phenomenon of cement's self-sealing/self-degradation behaviour. Carbonated water reacts with cement minerals; some of which are initially dissolved followed by a possible precipitation process that is controlled by the fluid's flow rate/residence time in the cement defects such so microannuli. The self-sealing mechanism can reduce the microannuli's width, potentially stopping CO2 leakage, while self-degradation has the opposite effect. The geomechanical "add-on" module quantifies changes in the size of defects within the well P&A system when the pressure/stress changes during the CO2 storage process. Pressure/Stress variations change the radius of the casing and the size of the adjacent microannuli, altering the leakage rates within the legacy well system. The elastic/plastic stress behaviour of cement can potentially contribute to increasing risks. The CO2/casing corrosion "add-on" module estimates the rate of casing corrosion and subsequent reduction in casing thickness over time based on experimental data. Excessive corrosion can lead to casing breach. These processes increase the size of defective leakage paths and increase the leakage risk from the legacy well. On completion, the modelling framework will be capable of being an integral part of the risk-assessment process when (a) selecting between possible CCUS projects and (b) supporting operators, regulators and other stakeholders in their decision-making process when analysing CCUS proposals.

Abstract Reservoir modelling tools have played a significant role in designing the subsurface fluid injection, such as CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However, these models are computationally expensive; they require extensive geological and engineering data that often are not available in the early phase of carbon utilization and storage projects. This work presents the development of fast predictive models and optimization methodologies to quickly evaluate the CO2 EOR and storage operations in mature oil fields. Considerable experience with CO2 EOR and storage has been gained by the petroleum industry. In particular, the Weyburn-Midale project (Canada) is a comprehensive case to show how an oil reservoir could securely store CO2. Employing the Weyburn-Midale project, we developed, trained and tested several types of proxy models in multiple scenarios to assess the performance of the miscible CO2 flood in recovering residual oil, increasing the ultimate oil recovery factor while maximizing the permanent CO2 storage. The history matching of the Weyburn-Midale CO2 EOR model involved 216 well histories (producers and injectors) from 1964 to 2006 using a compositional reservoir simulator. The predominant exploitation scheme was based on an inverted nine-spot pattern waterflooding, water alternating CO2, and consequently CO2 injection. Two simulation data sets were employed at different periods of 1956 through 2006, and 2007 through 2025. Among several proxy models, an artificial neural network (ANN) model proved to accurately estimate features of interest, namely fluid production (oil, water, gas), fluid injection (water, CO2) and the amount of CO2 stored in the reservoir. Additionally, an autoregressive exogenous input (ARX) model was implemented to predict the future outputs in response to a future input. Inspection of the relative estimation error and the model fitness score showed that the proxy model was capable of rapidly reproducing the trend in the validation set satisfactorily. Lastly, we evaluated the transfer of learning from a proxy model, trained to the Weyburn-Midale field (Canada), to assess the performance of CO2 EOR in another mature oil reservoir in Europe (Romania). The application of proxy models under geological and operation uncertainties offers huge reduction in computational time and engineering data requirements. The results from the Weyburn-Midale case study deliver critical insights into the analysis of many process factors and modeling techniques intended to assess the economic limits and long-term performance of CO2 EOR and storage in mature oil fields.

Intermediate to high load operation in dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) techniques is restricted due to uncontrolled combustion that causes engine knocking. Dual fuel strategies with advanced pilot injection and near-top dead center (TDC) main injection timings are reported to enhance combustion control, albeit with increased soot emissions, reduction of thermal efficiency, and emergence of an intricate trade-off between total hydrocarbon (THC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) emissions. In order to address these conflicting issues, an intermediate engine load, corresponding to 6 bar gross indicated mean effective pressure at 1500 and 2200 rev/min engine speeds was investigated in this work. The main objectives of this work are (1) to obtain combination of control parameters to achieve near-zero engine-out NO x and soot emissions and high thermal efficiency while minimizing THC and CO emissions; (2) to understand the effectiveness of diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) for the oxidation and reduction of exhaust gas species in the dual fuel mode; and (3) to understand the oxidation characteristics of the soot generated from the dual fuel mode. Optimum dual fuel low temperature combustion strategies, in terms of diesel injection timings, quantity and exhaust gas recirculation levels, were identified using the statistical multi response signal to noise (MRSN) ratio method in which NO x , soot and indicated efficiency were response variables. The performance of commercial DOCs, with different precious metal (Pt and/or Pd) loadings, were also studied at optimum dual fuel strategies for gasoline-diesel dual fuel operations. High DOC outlet temperatures (>∼340°C), due to the exotherm generated by the oxidation of high concentrations of THC and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from dual fuel operations, resulted in greater than 90% THC conversion efficiency. The exotherm decreased the nitric oxide (NO) oxidation whereas the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) reduction reactions were favored over the DOC in the dual fuel mode at the intermediate load operating condition. Thermogravimetric analysis of the soot showed higher activation energy (177.2 kJ/mol), formed at the dual fuel optimum condition, relative to the activation energy (162.7 kJ/mol) of the soot formed in conventional diesel combustion (CDC).

Objective: The objective of this technological article is to present a practical tool for calculating CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption applied in a small road freight transport company. Theoretical Framework: There are 4 methods available in the literature for calculating CO2 emissions produced during cargo transport, which stand out for their applicability: (1) GHG Procol; (2) MNT; (3) DEFRA; and (4) GLEC. The authors (Leonardi & Baumgartner, 2004; Lewis et al., 2016) have methodologies for calculating emissions from freight transport, which currently present significant variability in the approaches and databases recommended. The main methodologies in this area are based on two main foundations: (1) fuel-based methodologies; (2) activity-based methodologies. Method: The calculation methodology used is based on fuel consumption (bottom-up), which considered the characteristics of the target fleet, the number of vehicles and their technological phase, the actual intensity of fleet use in operation, and real fuel consumption. Results and Discussion: From this initial information, it was possible to obtain the volume of CO2 emissions specific to the fleet, considering vehicles using regular diesel and biodiesel (S10). The results indicated a fleet CO2 emission of 1,643 tons per year with the use of biodiesel (S10), representing a 10.5% reduction compared to the total CO2 emission from regular diesel. Research Implications: The practical and theoretical implications of this research are discussed, providing insights into how the results can be applied or influence practices in the field of [insert field of study]. These implications could encompass [list impacted areas or sectors]. Originality/Value: This technological article contributes to the presentation of a review of CO2 emission calculation models available in the literature and the selection of a methodology for easy application for small and medium-sized road freight transport companies.

This work aims to create a robust causal regression model that can accurately measure the influence of many variables on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in ASEAN nations from 1971 to 2017. The study aims to identify the main factors contributing to emissions and provide valuable information for implementing effective reduction methods. This is important because balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability in the fast- changing ASEAN area is crucial. The research used the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method to examine the individual contributions of various causes to changes in CO2 emissions over time. In addition, a model called ARIMAX (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables) is created to anticipate CO2 emissions and determine essential factors that influence them. The dependent variable is total GHG emissions measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent, while independent variables include GDP, energy intensity, carbon intensity, and population growth. The study discovered that GDP, with varied degrees of impact, is the primary catalyst for CO2 emissions in ASEAN nations. The energy intensity is projected to decline, indicating increases in efficiency, while the influence of population growth is forecast to be positive but less substantial compared to economic reasons. The research is anticipated to uncover disparities in the decrease of carbon intensity and the efficacy of policies across ASEAN nations, with more advanced economies demonstrating more resilient systems. These results provide significant knowledge for governments and companies, aiding in creating focused efforts to reduce emissions and improve carbon accounting standards across the ASEAN region.

Integrating green supply chain strategies and circular economy (CE) practices holds substantial potential for promoting environmental sustainability and reducing CO2 emissions. This study investigates the synergy between green supply chain practices, circular economy, and economic growth (RGDP) impacts on carbon emissions in 13 selected European Union (EU) countries, using a comprehensive panel dataset from 2000 to 2022. We employ both linear and nonlinear panel ARDL models, along with causality tests, to examine how CO2 emissions respond to changes in green supply chain management (GSCM), real GDP (RGDP), and various recycling practices, including bio-waste, municipal waste, and packaging waste. Our findings reveal that GSCM practices significantly reduce carbon emissions in the long run, while economic growth (RGDP) and municipal waste generation correlate positively with increased CO2 emissions. Interestingly, the nonlinear ARDL model highlights that only recycling packaging waste (RWP) exhibits a positive long-run effect on reducing emissions. Additionally, the method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) analysis indicates that the impact of GSCM is more pronounced at higher quantiles of CO2 emissions, whereas the effect of RGDP on emissions remains inconsistent. These results underscore the crucial need to adopt and enhance green supply chain practices within a circular economy framework to achieve substantial carbon emission reductions, holding significant implications for carbon emissions policies in the selected EU countries.

Abstract The rising CO2 emissions resulting from the development of high CO2 contaminated gas fields in Malaysia necessitate the identification of appropriate, secure, and capacious reservoirs for CO2 storage. Large-scale saline aquifers have emerged as promising solutions for establishing a storage hub equipped with extensive onshore injection facilities. Nevertheless, the development of a large-scale saline aquifer as a CO2 storage hub offshore Malaysia presents numerous intrinsic challenges. The current study focusses on identifying and evaluating the associated risks and uncertainties and formulating a mitigation strategy for the development of a large-scale storage hub within synrift sediments of a rift graben off the coast of peninsular Malaysia (PM). When establishing a large-scale CO2 storage hub, it's crucial to prioritize two key elements: containment integrity and storage capacity. However, these components carry inherent risks that demand careful management throughout the storage development process. Containment integrity entails risks related to reservoir and overburden formations, structural features, and well integrity within the storage reservoirs. Conversely, storage capacity can be influenced by factors like reservoir continuity, aquifer size and strength, caprock strength, and injectivity. The storage site was analyzed for its containment and capacity through extensive 3D data interpretation for generation of structural maps, mapping of major and minor faults, and attribute extraction, trap & seal analysis, faults & wells integrity analysis, 1D caprock integrity analysis, and effective storage capacity estimation through dynamic simulation. Dynamic simulation results of maximum storage capacity help deciding plausible mitigation plans, such as seismic data acquisition, appraisal well drilling, and coring, have been suggested to tackle these risks. However, quantifying the precise value added by these plans in terms of risk reduction presents a challenge. The workflow for this study to be used as the guideline for any future saline aquifer storage development plan feasibility study.

Given the growing demand for efficient catalysts in sustainable energy applications, this study investigates the structural characterization and catalytic activity of CuAgAu trimetallic aerogels synthesized via a sol-gel method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a porous network structure with uniformly dispersed trimetallic nanoparticles averaging 5-10 nm in size, which indicates a successful synthesis and nanostructure formation. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a face-centered cubic structure, with distinct diffraction peaks observed at positions corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Cu, Ag, and Au, respectively. These structural features are critical for understanding the crystalline nature and stability of the aerogels. The catalytic activity of CuAgAu aerogels for CO2 reduction was evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry, which showed notable enhancements in current densities at various applied potentials relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode. These findings indicate the aerogels’ effectiveness as catalysts for CO2 conversion. Furthermore, Faradaic efficiency measurements revealed a high selectivity in the conversion of CO2 to CO, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency of 85%, which suggests that the aerogels’ capability to efficiently utilize electrons in producing CO, as a valuable precursor in renewable energy and chemical synthesis applications. The combination of structural integrity, catalytic performance, and high selectivity positions CuAgAu aerogels as promising approach for sustainable energy technologies.

To provide new insights into the integrated management of carbon and heat for sustainable urban development, this study systematically investigates the complex relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentrations and land surface temperature (LST). Utilizing OCO-2 and OCO-3 satellite observations, combined with meteorological conditions, air pollutants, and spatial characteristics, a high-resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) monthly CO2 column concentration (XCO2) dataset for China spanning 2015 to 2022 was generated using the Random Forest algorithm. The study focuses on urban agglomerations, conducting centroid migration and coupling analyses of XCO2 and LST to elucidate their spatiotemporal distribution patterns and evolution. Results reveal significant seasonal variations in XCO2, which has exhibited a gradual increase over the years. The spatiotemporal distributions of XCO2 and LST in urban agglomerations show a high degree of consistency, with centroids either converging or following similar movement trajectories. Additionally, the degree of coupling and coordination between XCO2 and LST has improved annually, indicating a closer interrelationship. These findings enhance our understanding of climate system dynamics and provide essential scientific evidence and decision-making support for addressing climate change. By clarifying the connection between atmospheric CO2 and LST, this study contributes to the development of more effective strategies for carbon reduction and urban heat island mitigation, thereby advancing cities towards greener, lower-carbon, and more sustainable development pathways.

Abstract Polymer-enhanced CO2 foam (PEF) is an emerging technology for gas mobility control and CO2 storage in geologic formations to mitigate anthropogenic emissions. The foam generated by surfactants alone is prone to film rupture and low endurance, particularly in Middle Eastern carbonates under harsh conditions of high temperature and salinity. Adding polymer to a surfactant solution can enhance foam stability, increase viscosity, and resist liquid drainage. This study presents a systematic polymer-stabilized foam formulation design and optimization. The work particularly focuses on developing foam formulations while incorporating polymer in surfactant formulation to enhance the foaming performance. Anionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, associative polymers, and an ATBS-based polymer were tested under high salinity brine (up to 167 kppm) and high temperature (up to 120°C) conditions. The Design of Experiment (DOE) approach was used to formulate the composition of the PEF formulation toward achieving maximum bulk foam stability. The obtained optimized formulation was verified experimentally for its bulk foam properties and further tested in coreflooding experiments using a carbonate outcrop to assess mobility reduction factor (MRF) and CO2 storage potential. The results showed that selected surfactants, polymers, and combinations were stable at a high temperature of 120°C and a high salinity of 167 kppm; further tests were conducted at 95°C and 105 kppm salinity. The bulk foam stability results indicated that using a combination of surfactants and polymers significantly improved foam stability expressed by the foam’s half-life. To understand the impact of each component, the data was analyzed using various mixture regression models, and the cubic model fitted well with the foam half-life response. Binary-surfactant foam formulations performed better than using a single surfactant system. However, the ternary foam formulation of surfactants with polymer showed a strong interaction and a significant synergistic effect. The optimized polymer-enhanced foam formulation consists of 6201 ppm C-5, 3500 ppm SB, and 183.2 ppm SAV-10 polymer as high as 132 minutes at 95°C and atmospheric pressure. Additionally, the study revealed that polymer addition played a crucial role in enhancing foam longevity. Increasing the polymer concentration to adequate levels helps reduce foam coalescence due to high viscous resistance and strong foam films. Polymer concentration lower than the optimized levels renders foam less stable and weak. On the other hand, a higher concentration than the optimum results in faster foam collapse due to the fast liquid drainage. The coreflooding results showed that the optimized PEF formulation performed exceptionally well in reducing CO2 mobility and enhancing CO2 storage capacity under high-salinity (105 kppm), high-temperature (95°C), and high-pressure (1500 psi) conditions. The optimized PEF formulation generated strong foam in porous media; the mobility reduction factor (MRF) was recorded 50.2, showing higher foam viscosity than gas and brine during the injection. Furthermore, foam flooding with the optimized PEF resulted in a higher CO2 storage capacity of 77.1% compared to 14.8% for gas injection. Previous studies utilized random formulation methods to improve foaming performance by incorporating polymer as a foam stabilizer, neglecting to optimize foam stability requirements. This study is one of the few systematic works to design, optimize, and test the best-performing PEF formulation that can withstand harsh Middle Eastern reservoir conditions, providing in-depth mobility control and ensuring long-term CO2 sequestration.

Leading services companies and specialty software firms alike have launched various tools and digital suites to assist carbon capture and storage (CCS) project operators with everything from ideal siting of facilities and pipelines to the efficient operations and around-the-clock monitoring of those facilities. CCS holds the promise of big business if industry can efficiently and economically operate at scale the slate of planned facilities. Oil and gas companies have been making investments in the space with aims to become leaders in a segment—ironic since the petroleum business is also one of the emitters of CO2 into the atmosphere. Last month, supermajor ExxonMobil executed the largest offshore CO2 storage lease in the US with the Texas General Land Office. The 271,000-plus-acre site complements the onshore CO2 storage portfolio ExxonMobil is developing and further solidifies the US Gulf Coast as a CCS leader, according to the operator. In an October 2024 report, the US Department of Energy (DOE) issued a draft strategy for carbon management technologies through 2030, stating that carbon capture and direct air capture are “essential” to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The report says CCS projects will grow dramatically over the next decade and beyond, adding that 18 CCS facilities are operating now in the US. DOE’s near-term CCS strategy through 2030 incorporates focusing research, development, demonstration, and deployment funding on priority use cases; building out CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure where it likely will be needed most in the future; supporting the implementation of effective and evidence-driven policies and regulations related to carbon management at other federal agencies; engaging communities and workers to ensure projects deliver benefits and mitigate potential risks to public health and the environment; and supporting climate diplomacy efforts to accelerate the adoption of carbon management at scale globally in a way that aligns with the Paris Agreement. “DOE is funding a variety of technologies to assist in decarbonization in the industrial and power sectors,” the report explained. “These approaches include carbon management as well as electrification, fuel switching, materials substitution, efficiency, and other emissions-reductions measures. In parallel, DOE is working to envision and develop transformative emissions reductions approaches that will create new options in the long term.” The US government has been an active participant in making funding available for the advancement of CCS technologies. In 2024 alone, almost $3.5 billion was made available between two separate programs—CCS large-scale pilot projects ($937 million) and CCS demonstration projects ($2.5 billion)—as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In June 2023, ceremonial shovels were plunged into the dirt in Ector County, Texas, to mark the start of construction for the largest direct air capture facility in the world, designed to capture 500,000 metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year. Occidental subsidiary OnePointFive’s $1-billion Stratos project is located on a 65-acre site made up of a network of air contactors, pellet reactors, a centrifuge, and a calciner—all known components that operate in other industries.

Non-stationary systems are found throughout the world, from climate patterns under the influence of variation in carbon dioxide concentration to brain dynamics driven by ascending neuromodulation. Accordingly, there is a need for methods to analyze non-stationary processes, and yet, most time-series analysis methods that are used in practice on important problems across science and industry make the simplifying assumption of stationarity. One important problem in the analysis of non-stationary systems is the problem class that we refer to as parameter inference from a non-stationary unknown process (PINUP). Given an observed time series, this involves inferring the parameters that drive non-stationarity of the time series, without requiring knowledge or inference of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Here, we review and unify a diverse literature of algorithms for PINUP. We formulate the problem and categorize the various algorithmic contributions into those based on (1) dimension reduction, (2) statistical time-series features, (3) prediction error, (4) phase-space partitioning, (5) recurrence plots, and (6) Bayesian inference. This synthesis will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and will enable systematic comparisons of different methods. We also demonstrate that the most common systems that existing methods are tested on—notably, the non-stationary Lorenz process and logistic map—are surprisingly easy to perform well on using simple statistical features like windowed mean and variance, undermining the practice of using good performance on these systems as evidence of algorithmic performance. We then identify more challenging problems that many existing methods perform poorly on and which can be used to drive methodological advances in the field. Our results unify disjoint scientific contributions to analyzing the non-stationary systems and suggest new directions for progress on the PINUP problem and the broader study of non-stationary phenomena.

Catalytic COx (CO and CO2) hydrogenation to valued chemicals is one of the promising approaches to address challenges in energy, environment, and climate change. H2O is an inevitable side product in these reactions, where its existence and effect are often ignored. In fact, H2O significantly influences the catalytic active centers, reaction mechanism, and catalytic performance, preventing us from a definitive and deep understanding on the structure-performance relationship of the authentic catalysts. It is necessary, although challenging, to clarify its effect and provide practical strategies to tune the concentration and distribution of H2O to optimize its influence. In this review, we focus on how H2O in COx hydrogenation induces the structural evolution of catalysts and assists in the catalytic processes, as well as efforts to understand the underlying mechanism. We summarize and discuss some representative tuning strategies for realizing the rapid removal or local enrichment of H2O around the catalysts, along with brief techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. These fundamental understandings and strategies are further extended to the reactions of CO and CO2 reduction under an external field (light, electricity, and plasma). We also present suggestions and prospects for deciphering and controlling the effect of H2O in practical applications.

Abstract The objective of this paper is to present and compare two concepts to decarbonize Oil&Gas production facilities, particularly remote deep-offshore assets. The two offshore power barges concepts, called PGU (Power Generation Unit) are either based on low-carbon fuels or on local Capture & Storage to supply low carbon power & enable offshore facilities electrification. One of the main challenges of the Net Zero ambition for the Oil&Gas industry (scope 1 and scope 2) is the reduction of GHG emissions related to the fuel gas consumption for power generation (&gt;70% of the CO2 emissions), particularly for offshore remote sites where Power from Shore is not feasible. Centralized floating Power Generation Units (PGU) can be connected to existing platforms and/or FPSOs to supply low carbon electricity. Either with an offshore PGU fed with low carbon fuels (green or blue ammonia). The PGU include all the functions to store, treat & convert ammonia into a blend of hydrogen and ammonia. Either with an offshore PGU with carbon capture and injection into a local CO2 storage (CCS). The PGU includes a compact backpressure combined cycle, a post combustion solvent based (MEA), a capture package designed for 95% CO2 removal. Some units are directly integrated in the structure of the hull to optimize weight & space. 325 MWe of net electrical power are generated. This low carbon power is exported from the PGU to existing offshore facilities equipped with single cycle gas turbines (&lt;40% efficiency, 500 gCO2/kWh). This decarbonized power is exported through subsea electrical cables. The two concepts are compared in term of technical feasibility, maturity, GHG reduction and costs. A Life cycle analysis was performed to evaluate the environmental impact. These low carbon power generation solutions (30 gCO2/kWh) enable to stop gas turbines on site. The two concepts result in similar floaters dimensions and Capex, with a higher Opex for the carbon free fuel due to fuel cost. The offshore CCS concept is seen as a shorter-term solution, applicable in the current decade, main challenge being the availability of an adequate CO2 storage to ensure a sustainable local reinjection. R&D focus on technology innovations to reduce costs. As an alternative, the offshore NH3 PGU concept is a longer-term solution for hard to abate sites, where CO2 reservoir availability can be an issue. A Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) shows that ammonia chain shall be green or fully sequestrated. R&D is driven by the need for new technologies, fully fuel flexible Gas Turbines to address multiple low carbon fuels scenarios. These developments shall be started now to enable this concept when the low carbon fuel market will be ready. The novelty relies on the development and comparison of offshore power barges concepts delivering a minimum of 325MWe, either based on low-carbon fuels (ammonia) or CCS to power & decarbonize existing assets.

In Latin America, the energy crisis has worsened due to the dependence on energy services and fossil fuel imports from highly industrialized countries at prices established by the international market; this is particularly relevant to the construction industry, which presents a significant deficit in optimal energy consumption. Hence, some governments have established public policies to maximize the efficiency of these services and, at the same time, minimize the carbon footprint. In this research study, we reviewed the public policies, strategies, and incentives for energy efficiency (EE) implementation in the residential sector established by the Mexican government. A scoping review methodology was chosen and implemented in the following steps: 1. Research inquiry identification. 2. Determination of the relevant literature and studies. 3. The literature selection. 4. Data graphing. 5. Results collection, overview, and submission. In this systematic review, we identified five mandatory standards (NOM-008-ENER-2001, NOM-009-ENER-2014, NOM-018-ENER-2011, NOM-020-ENER-2011, and NOM-024-ENER-2012), six optional standards, four strategies (Green Mortgage, Integral Sustainable Improvement in Existing Housing, ECOCASA, and NAMA), and three kinds of incentives (green bonds, credit and interest rates (Green Mortgage, FIDE, and Ecocasa), and taxes (Income Tax Reduction)). As a result of the implementation of the above, as of December 2020, NAMA financed 5106 developers of 38 projects in 15 states; contributed to a reduction of 126,779 tons of CO2; and aided 19,913 people. From 2013 to December 2023, EcoCasa subsidized 71,440 households for a total of 224 projects in 25 states; contributed to a reduction of 2.6 million tons of CO2; aided 285,760 Mexicans; and issued EcoCasa certificates for 3,473,556 m2. The results of the EE indicators in residential buildings showed an increase in the housing unit number as well as an increase in household appliances, with those based on power consumption prevailing. The residential sector ranks third in power consumption in Mexico, consuming an estimated 790 pj, of which 76% corresponds to thermal energy and 24% to electric power. Among countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Mexico has achieved an Energy Transition Index of 62%.

This year’s primary selections for the Drilling and Completion Fluids Technology Focus reflect now-well-established industrywide emphases on machine learning (ML), automation, and the achievement of successful drilling of CO2 storage wells. Enhanced methods of modeling and monitoring allow time and cost savings while surpassing safety goals and furthering efforts to optimize CO2 storage. Paper OTC 35433 discusses a study centered on accurate gel-strength estimation. The authors leverage ML techniques, particularly the use of artificial neural networks, to develop predictive models for forecasting the gel strength of synthetic oil-based mud systems at both 10-second and 10-minute intervals, surpassing the precision and speed of techniques based on traditional rotational viscometers. In a similar vein, paper SPE 216322 seeks to bypass traditional manual methods of monitoring drilling fluids, its authors describing a novel online system that measures 10 key parameters continuously. They write that the system has been field-trialed across 200 wells with results that highlight the system’s reliability, with continuous operation for over 125 days. Finally, paper SPE 217711 involves evaluating the effects of an influx of CO2 into drilling fluids, a key task in the drilling of CO2 storage wells. Concentrating on oil-based drilling fluid, the presented study describes the development and integration of models for properties of drilling-fluid/CO2 mixtures into an existing software suite. Recommended-reading papers include an investigation of the use of microwave power in recovering oil from contaminated drill cuttings, reduction of the carbon footprint of drilling fluids, and sedimentation behavior of particles in fibrous sweep fluids. As always, the long-sighted ambition of such research, and the skill applied in its pursuit, reflects the commitment to excellence embodied by the authors of technical papers presented at SPE conferences.

International agreements and national policies on environmental sustainability are changing the outlook for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) globally. These changes are highlighted by both monetary and intellectual commitments by oil companies around the world. Saudi Aramco has pledged $1.5 billion toward sustainable technology. In practice, members of Aramco’s EXPEC Advanced Research Center have collaborated with King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals to develop sustainable surfactants for use in high-temperature, high-pressure, and high-salinity carbonate reservoirs. They used no or only green solvents to produce soluble, stable surfactants with the potential for biodegradability. In Colombia, Ecopetrol is committed to reducing CO2 emission by 25% by 2030. As part of its efforts, it has been optimizing polymer injection in Chichimene, a heavy-oil field. By estimating life cycle greenhouse-gas emissions and energy consumption, it was able to show that polymer injection and its associated carbon intensity reduction could prevent the emission of 3,200 tons CO2 equivalent. To comply with the UK’s North Sea Transition Deal, which mandates a 50% reduction in offshore oil and gas emissions by 2030, Ithaca Energy and Energy Research Norway is using life-cycle assessment to guide more efficient heavy-oil recovery. By using low-dose polymer injection, instead of alternatives such as thermal EOR, it was able to increase exergy while also reducing CO2 emissions by 35%. In these studies, we already see the effect of the energy transition as companies turn away from traditionally effective but environmentally burdensome EOR methods such as steam injection and new polymers that show equal, if not greater, effectiveness with a reduced environmental cost. As we move forward with further regulation and innovation, it will be interesting to see how emerging technological developments in polymers, nanofluids, and even artificial intelligence can help producers meet both the economic and environmental criteria to maintain profitable fields.

Illuminated giant cells of Characeae comprise alternating areas with H+ pump activity and zones with high conductivity for H+/OH–, which create counter-directed H+ flows between the medium and the cytoplasm. In areas where H+ enters the cell, the pH on the surface (pHo) increases to pH 10, while the cytoplasmic pH (pHc) decreases. The lack of the permeant substrate of photosynthesis (CO2) and the acidic pHc shift in the region of external alkaline zones redirect electron transport in chloroplasts from CO2-dependent (assimilatory) pathway to O2 reduction. This electron transport route is associated with an increase in thylakoid membrane ΔpH and an enhanced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll excitations, which underlies strict coordination between nonuniform distributions of pHo and photosynthetic activity in resting cells. When the action potential (AP) is generated, the longitudinal pH profile is temporarily smoothed out, while the heterogeneity of the distribution of NPQ and PSII photochemical activity (YII) sharply increases. The damping of the pHo profile is due to the suppression of the H+ pump and passive H+ conductance under the influence of an almost 100-fold increase in the cytoplasmic of Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]c) during AP. The increase in [Ca2+]c stimulates photoreduction of O2 in chloroplasts under external alkaline zones and, at the same time, arrests the cytoplasmic streaming, which causes the accumulation of excess amounts of H2O2 in the cytoplasm in areas of intense production of this metabolite, with a weak effect on areas of CO2 assimilation. These changes enhance the nonuniform distribution of cell photosynthesis and account for the long-term oscillations of chlorophyll fluorescence Fm' and the quantum efficiency of linear electron flow in microscopic cell areas after the AP generation.

Abstract Efficient forecasting involves generating accurate and reliable predictions while minimizing the use of resources, such as time, training data, and computational power. This study investigates the potential of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) combined with transfer learning (FNO+TL) for forecasting the spatiotemporal evolution of pressure and CO2 saturation in a large, heterogeneous geological carbon-storage aquifer. The enhanced FNO models, trained on the SACROC geological model, achieved high accuracy, with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.046 MPa for pressure and 0.011 for saturation in large aquifer models. Transfer learning (TL) further enabled the adaptation of a trained FNO model to diverse operational conditions with minimal new training data. The adapted models achieved pressure prediction MAEs of 0.27 MPa, 0.51 MPa, and 0.59 MPa, and saturation prediction MAEs of 0.05, 0.056, and 0.14, under varying injection rates, schedules, and injector locations, respectively. Additionally, the FNO models generalized successfully to a geologically distinct site at the Illinois Basin - Decatur Project (IBDP), which had significantly different carbon storage operations. The models achieved prediction MAEs of 4.5 psia for pressure and 0.11 for saturation, with reductions of 87% and 80% in training data requirements, respectively. Furthermore, the FNO+TL models significantly reduced computational costs. The study concludes that integrating transfer learning with Fourier Neural Operators provides an efficient and scalable approach for CO2 storage forecasting.

Deeply understanding how local microstrain environment around diatomic sites influences their electronic state and adsorption is crucial for improving electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) reaction; however, precise engineering of the atomic microstrain environment is challenging. Herein, we fabricate Ag-CdTMT electrocatalysts with AgN2S2–CdN2S2 diatomic sites by anchoring Ag to the nodes of CdTMT (TMT = 2,4,6-trimercaptotriazine anion) coordination polymers. The Ag-CdTMT catalysts achieve approximately 100% Faradaic efficiency for CO reduction with an industrial level current density (∼200 mA cm–2 in H-cell). The embedded Ag atoms induce the formation of Ag–Cd diatomic sites with local microstrain, stretching Cd–N/S bonds, and reinforcing electron localization at Cd sites. The microstrain engineering and adjacent Ag atoms synergistically reduced Cd 4d–C 2p antibonding orbital occupancy for intensifying *COOH adsorption as the rate-determining step. This study provides novel insights into customizing the electronic structure of diatomic sites through strain engineering.

Global warming is a pressing issue. NASA has predicted that 15 Southeast Asian islands will be submerged by 2100, as a result of a 0.77 cm increase in global sea levels from 2022 to 2023. Global temperatures were 1.48°C higher than pre-industrial levels in 2023. Indonesia must increase the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. By 2030, energy consumption will rise by 3% and power demand by 8.5%, with fossil fuels meeting two-thirds of demand and CO2 emissions rising 35%. This study evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of a 60 MW Indonesian Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) geothermal power plant using carbon credits. Indonesia’s geothermal potential is 40% of global resources, but high upfront costs, insufficient regulatory support, and technical obstacles limit development. Flexible and efficient ORC geothermal power generation provides steady baseload power for low to medium-temperature resources. This study applies RETScreen software for techno-economic analysis, sensitivity, and risk assessment to analyze project feasibility under multiple scenarios. Initial costs, operation and maintenance expenditures, energy generation, and GHG reductions are analyzed in detail. Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) were calculated for four scenarios: minimal incentives, increased carbon credit incentives, extended project lifespan with tax benefits, and optimized scenarios with high carbon credit prices. With a pre-tax equity IRR of 20.7% and an NPV of $97.52 million, the project is commercially viable at $2/ton CO2 in Indonesia. Raising the carbon credit price to $18/ton CO2 boosts IRR to 26.1% and NPV to $142.74 million. An equity payback period of 2.9 years and decreased LCOE is achieved by extending the project lifespan to 30 years and using a carbon credit price of $46/ton CO2. These data show how carbon price affects geothermal investment profitability. Optimizing geothermal exploration and adopting innovative technologies can cut expenses and speed up progress. Inspired by the Philippines and Kenya, government incentives, tax cuts, and faster approvals can make geothermal projects financially viable, helping Indonesia reach its 2060 zero carbon emissions objective.

Abstract. Under the Paris Agreement, signatory nations aim to keep global warming well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and preferably below 1.5 °C. This implicitly requires achieving net-zero or net-negative greenhouse gas emissions to ensure long-term global temperature stabilisation or reduction. Despite this requirement, there have been few analyses of stabilised climates, and there is a lack of model experiments to address our need for understanding the implications of the Paris Agreement. Here, we describe a new set of experiments using the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator Earth system model (ACCESS-ESM-1.5) that enables the analysis of climate evolution under net-zero emissions, and we present initial results. Seven 1000-year-long simulations were run with global temperatures stabilising at levels in line with the Paris Agreement and at a range of higher global warming levels (GWLs). We provide an overview of the experimental design and use these simulations to demonstrate the consequences of delayed attainment of global net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. We show that there are substantial differences between transient and stabilising climate states and differences in stabilisation between GWLs. As the climate stabilises under net-zero emissions, we identify significant and robust changes in temperature and precipitation patterns including continued Southern Ocean warming and changes in regional precipitation trends. Changes under net-zero emissions differ greatly between regions, including contrasting trajectories of sea ice extent between the Arctic and Antarctic. We also examine the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and find evidence of reduced amplitude and frequency of ENSO events under climate stabilisation relative to projections under transient warming. An analysis at specific GWLs shows that significant regional changes continue for centuries after emission cessation and that these changes are stronger at higher GWLs. Our findings suggest substantial long-term climate changes are possible even under net-zero emission pathways. These simulations are available for use in the community and will hopefully motivate further experiments and analyses based on other Earth system models.

Abstract A stream of 2 up to 4 Million Standard Cubic Feet Per Day (MMSCFD) sweet gas used to be burnt and flared on site as a waste of energy causing more than 27,000 pounds per hour (lb/hr.) of CO2 emissions and wasting a power of 5.5 Mega Watt (MW), on the other hand site compressors and generators required a source of power, accordingly a new flared gas recovery skid with a capacity of 4 MMSCFD is installed on site for providing power to Compressors and Gas Generators, cutting the CO2 emissions, put an end to the bleeding running cost of flaring.

Background Different usage scenarios and design guidelines were considered when planning a factory building and its ventilation system. Accordingly, it often makes sense to analyze the actual operating conditions again during subsequent operations in order to optimally adapt the air supply to the respective conditions in terms of demand-responsive ventilation. The aim is to ensure good indoor air quality and thermal comfort while significantly reducing energy consumption. Methods For this purpose, in addition to the sensors in the building management system, approximately 120 wireless sensors were installed in the occupied areas to measure the air temperature, operating temperature, humidity, and CO2. In this way the spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, humidity, and CO2 in the hall were visualized and evaluated to reduce the volume flows of the ventilation systems. The recorded data and findings were used to optimize ventilation systems by gaining a deeper understanding of indoor air flow. Results As part of the investigation, a considerable reduction in the air volume flows and thus the required energy consumption of the air handling units was achieved while maintaining the same thermal comfort. It was shown that the temperature field and indoor air quality were not negatively affected by the change in the air volume flow over a wide range. Conclusions This was made possible by the well-designed ventilation system, which achieves a low-pulse, slightly stratified indoor airflow, and a structural envelope with very good thermal insulation.

Abstract This paper presents the implementation and performance evaluation of a mobile solar-hybrid power system deployed by an onshore oil & gas operator in the UAE. The system uses an ultra-mobile, containerized solar solution to power mobile accommodation camps, traditionally powered by conventional diesel generators. Since November 2023, the operator has been using this system to power a mobile rig camp in a prolific field southwest of Abu Dhabi. The system comprises two 75 kWp solar containers (including inverters), a control panel (energy management system and data logger), and two diesel generators (one prime and one standby), with capacities varying according to load requirements over the operation duration. The energy management system, developed in-house by the provider, maximizes solar utilization, and ensures efficient operation of all energy sources. The system has provided substantial benefits over its nine-month operation, primarily reducing CO2 emissions by 47% compared to diesel-only generators. This equates to approximately 262 tons of CO2 or around 100,000 liters of diesel saved. The containerized design enables rapid transport and installation, with mobilization times of under four hours. The hybrid system also lowers fuel consumption and maintenance costs, improving the economic viability of running the mobile rig camp. Real-time monitoring is crucial to the system's safe and efficient operation, providing high reliability and uptime without requiring excessive onsite personnel. Compared to the previous diesel generator setup, the hybrid system's reliability is a significant advantage, eliminating frequent shutdowns caused by manual generator switchovers. Overall, the deployment of the ultra-mobile containerized solar-diesel hybrid power system has been successful, demonstrating significant CO2 emissions reduction and improved operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The lessons learned from this project highlight the importance of sustainable energy solutions for off-grid applications in the oil and gas sector.

Abstract This case study describes the workflow implemented to model and assess the CO2 site storage integrity, using coupled thermal dynamic-geomechanics modeling of supercritical CO2 in the study field and its impact on the reservoir, caprock, fault deformation, and eventual failure. The One-way coupled fluid-flow geomechanics simulation examines the impact of reservoir re-pressurization and thermal cooling in the caprock deformation, reservoir integrity and fault stability, associated to physical phenomena such as Joule-Thomson expansion, heat diffusion, and undrained deformation processes. The reservoir model was augmented by adding the overburden, sideburden and underburden to not only impose the boundary conditions but also for capturing the impact of the thermal changes in the caprock. The simulation is conducted by bringing the pressure and temperature changes into the geomechanics simulation to compute rock deformation and eventual failure. Rock yielding was assessed in all the materials to determine critical zones and pressure thresholds that should be avoided during CO2 injection. The dynamic simulation and well modeling showed a large temperature reduction at the bottomhole due to CO2 expansion effects (Joule-Thomson). These effects were reduced as the reservoir repressurized. A correlation of bottomhole pressure and temperature with reservoir pressure was developed to capture the impact of changing temperature over time with reservoir re-pressurization. The coupling of these dynamic changes over time with geomechanics demonstrated that caprock integrity was not compromised, but certain locations posed more risk than others. The fault integrity showed locations with potential for reactivation, depending on the fault type and maximum injection pressures. These limits should be considered during the injection plan. In general, thermal effects play the most critical role in the risk of rock failure and fault reactivation, and this risk is enhanced by reservoir re-pressurization (playing a secondary role), especially in proximity to the injection wells. Both shear and tensile failures are mainly influenced by severe cooling around the injectors. This cooling generally extends 3-4 cells around the wellbore (150-200m), sometimes even extending &gt;400m. The simulation shows the Nahr Umr Formation caprock is competent enough, only slightly affected by thermal effects when exposed to the main injection borehole with a very low risk of hydrofracturing. In general, injection pressures for all the injection scenarios fall below the fracturing pressure across the reservoir; nonetheless, the fracturing pressure might be reduced drastically due to the severe cooling around some injector wells, which tends to reduce the stresses and create tensile failure. The study demonstrated that the potential integrity problems can be mitigated by using an adequate injection strategy, selecting injection and monitoring wells, staging the injection rates, and limiting the cooling effects around the injectors. A coupled fluid-flow geomechanics simulation must be standard practice to study the complex physical phenomena involved in CO2 injection properly, especially in heavily depleted reservoirs containing compositional fluids and scenarios containing injection mixes (CO2 and H2S) The coupled injection allowed the simulation of complex phenomena, including the Joule-Thomson effect in the reservoir, the heat transfer in the caprock (diffusion), and the undrained deformation process in the caprock.

Abstract Significant energy is consumed for the transportation and pumping of crude oil from processing facilities to terminals through long distance piping networks. This paper emphasizes on the technologies advancements and strategic initiative of drag reducing agents deployment at ADNOC Onshore asset that reduced the frictional losses of the network and thus saved more than 1.4 MM USD in terms of power tariff, enhanced facility availability and abatement of more than 16000 M ton CO2 / Year. Major energy consumer in Oil and Gas facilities is export pumping system, where stabilized crude oil is pumped to shipping terminals. High energy consumption in the export pipeline system is caused by significant pressure losses due to turbulent flows caused by the trajectory and long length of network. Suitable selection is very essential, to ensure the energy efficiency and compatibility of the chemical. Therefore, very stringent evaluation criteria DRAs adopted includes. Compatibility with the piping material to avoid any potential chemical reaction, thus integrity of network.Effectiveness in reducing the drag and improvement in pressure drop.Stability of the DRA under the extreme operating conditions.Operability concerns.Cost-effectiveness and rate of return. Environmental and safety considerations, such as the toxicity and biodegradability of the DRA. For the better understanding of drag reduction mechanism in crude oil pipelines and optimum dosage selection of chemical, various published literature and several technology providers were consulted. Based on the evaluation criteria, pilot was conceived at the major asset in Adnoc Onshore for one year. Pilot deployment of Drag reducing agent has shown significant energy saving. DRA dosage of 2 mg/L in the export crude oil network has reduced back pressure up to 5 bar from the network and thus enabled Asset to stop one export pump while maintaining the sustainable oil production rate. This strategic initiative for energy efficiency enhancement and decarbonization has resulted in OPEX reduction of more than 1.4 MM USD / year in terms of power tariff and GHG abatement of 16000 m Tons CO2 / Year, along with 30% enhancing the availability of facilities. This paper presents the recent innovations of DRAs deployment for crude oil export system and also summaries the viability of chemicals utilization for friction reduction and provides stringent selection criteria that ensures optimum dosage to ensure net positive return on investment. This paper also sheds light on the operational constraints encountered during the deployment and design consideration during the design of new facilities.

During the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) on copper catalysts, linear-bonded CO (*COL) is commonly regarded as the key intermediate for the CO-CO coupling step, which leads to the formation of multicarbon products. In this work, we unveil the significant role of bridge-bonded *CO (*COB) as an active species. By combining in situ Raman spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we show that adsorbed *OH domains displace *COL to *COB. The electroreduction of a 12CO+13CO2 cofeed demonstrates that *COB distinctly favors the production of acetate and 1-propanol, while *COL favors ethylene and ethanol formation. This work enhances our understanding of the mechanistic intricacies of eCO(2)RR and suggests new directions for designing operational conditions by modifying the competitive adsorption of surface species, thereby steering the reaction toward specific multicarbon products.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Combustion in conventional and advanced diesel engines is an intricate process that encompasses interaction among fuel injection, fuel-air mixing, combustion, heat transfer, and engine geometry. Manipulation of fuel injection strategies has been recognized as a promising approach for optimizing diesel engine combustion. Although numerous studies have investigated this topic, the underlying physics behind flame interactions from multiple fuel injections, spray-flame-wall interaction and their effects on reaction zones, and NO<sub>x</sub>/soot emissions are still not well understood. To this end, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study is performed to investigate the effects of pilot and post injections on in-cylinder combustion process and emissions (NO<sub>x</sub> and soot) formation in a heavy-duty (HD) diesel engine. A full-sector CFD model of the HD engine employing detailed chemistry is validated against experimental data for in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion phasing, and engine-out NO<sub>x</sub>/soot and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions at five load points. The validated CFD model is further leveraged to gain insights into the complex pilot-main and main-post injection interactions at low load (20%) and mid load (60%) conditions, respectively. The 20% load point consists of four fuel injections (two pilots, one main and one post injection), whereas 60% load point has three injections (one pilot, one main and one post). It is observed that pilot injections significantly alter the main flame structure by shifting reaction zones contributing to heat release from combined rich premixed + non-premixed + lean premixed zones to primarily non-premixed zones. Presence of pilot injection decreases NO<sub>x</sub> concentration (while shifting the contribution of NO<sub>2</sub> towards NO<sub>x</sub> from 50% to 14%) and increases soot concentration. The local consumption of oxygen and less time available for main fuel-air mixing due to reduction in ignition delay (ID) caused by the pilot injection are the major reasons behind increase in soot. The investigation on post injection reveals that although post injection increases soot formation, it also increases soot oxidation, with soot oxidation dominating soot formation. This results in an overall reduction in soot emissions. Hydroxyl (OH) radicals play an important role in enhancing the soot oxidation rate. Furthermore, as the post start-of-injection (SOI) timing is retarded, both soot formation and oxidation decrease, with an overall increase in net soot emissions.</div></div>

This study examines the correlation between environmental innovation (EI), energy efficiency (EE), institutional quality (IQ), and environmental sustainability (ES) in the Southeast Asian economy from 1980 to 2019. The analysis employs both symmetric and asymmetric frameworks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The preliminary evaluation employing SHT, CSDT, and PURT indicates that the research variables demonstrate heterogeneity properties, cross-sectional dependence, and stationarity following the first difference. Moreover, the cointegration test results confirm a sustained relationship between the variables being explained and the explanatory variables in the long term. Utilizing the CS-ARDL methodology for symmetric analysis, this study reveals a positive and statistically significant correlation between the explanatory variables and environmental sustainability. This proposition posits that promoting EI, EE, and IQ can contribute to attaining the overarching objective of environmental protection. The study investigates long-term and short-run asymmetric relationships utilizing the standard Wald test, presenting definitive evidence. The presence of asymmetric coefficients reveals that positive and negative shocks in EI, EE, and IQ negatively influence environmental sustainability indicators, specifically CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. This statement suggests that the implementation of environmentally-focused innovation, the integration of clean energy, and the establishment of effective governance have the potential to bolster environmental quality through the reduction of CO2 emissions and the enhancement of ecological conditions. Regarding directional causality, the feedback hypothesis explores the causal connection between EE, IQ, and ES. The study’s findings offer valuable insights for formulating policies that will effectively guide future development endeavors in the region. In conclusion, this research highlights the importance of fostering environmental innovation, promoting energy efficiency, and enhancing institutional quality as essential measures for achieving environmental sustainability in the Southeast Asian economy.

Comprehensive Summary Tuning electrolyte properties is a widely recognized strategy to enhance activity and selectivity in electrocatalysis, drawing increasing attention in this domain. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies, debates persist about how various electrolyte components influence electrocatalytic reactions. We offer a concise review focusing on current discussions, especially the contentious roles of cations. This article further examines how different factors affect the interfacial solvent structure, particularly the hydrogen‐bonding network, and delves into the microscopic kinetics of electron and proton‐coupled electron transfer. We also discuss the overarching influence of solvents from a kinetic modeling perspective, aiming to develop a robust correlation between electrolyte structure and reactivity. Lastly, we summarize ongoing research challenges and suggest potential directions for future studies on electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis. Key Scientists In 1956, Marcus theory was developed to describe the mechanism of outer‐sphere electron transfer (OS‐ET). In 1992, Nocera et al. directly measured proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) kinetics for the first time, and their subsequent research in 1995 investigated the effects of proton motion on electron transfer (ET) kinetics. In 1999 and 2000, Hammes‐schiffer et al. developed the multistate continuum theory for multiple charge reactions and deduced the rate expressions for nonadiabatic PCET reactions in solution, laying the theoretical foundation for the analysis of PCET kinetics in electrochemical processes. In 2006, Saveant et al. verified the concerted proton and electron transfer (CPET) mechanism in the oxidation of phenols coupled with intramolecular amine‐driven proton transfer (PT). Their subsequent work in 2008 reported the pH‐dependent pathways of electrochemical oxidation of phenols. Electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis have gained emphasis in recent years. In 2009, Markovic's pioneering work proposed non‐covalent interactions between hydrated alkaline cations and adsorbed OH species in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). In 2011, Markovic et al. significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline solution by improving water dissociation, which was assumed to dominate the sluggish HER kinetics in such media. In comparation, Yan et al. applied hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory in 2015 to explain the pH‐dependent HER/HOR activity. Cations play a significant role in regulating the selectivity and activity of carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR). In 2016 and 2017, Karen Chan et al. introduced the electric field generated by solvated cations to explain the cation effects on electrochemical CO2RR. Conversely, in 2021, Koper et al. suggested that short‐range electrostatic interactions between partially desolvated metal cations and CO 2 stabilized CO 2 and promoted CO 2 RR. Recent researches have combined the exploration of the electrical double layer (EDL) structure with theoretical analysis of PCET kinetics. In 2019, Huang et al. developed a microscopic Hamiltonian model to quantitatively understand the sluggish hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. In 2021, two meticulous studies from Shao‐Horn's group analyzed the effects of cations on reorganization energy and the impacts of hydrogen bonds between proton donors and acceptors on proton tunneling kinetics, respectively. Electrolyte effects on proton transport process were researched in recent years. In 2022, Hu et al. and Chen et al. proposed that the cation‐induced electric field distribution and pH‐dependent hydrogen bonding network connectivity played essential roles in proton transport, separately.

Abstract This paper introduces a state-of-the-art tool known as SETPACE© (Structured Energy Trending and Performance Assessment for Combustion Engine) which has the capability to validate authenticity of fuel gas flow meter reading, improving fuel gas accounting; quantify fuel efficiency (thermal efficiency) degradation by comparing theoretical vs actual fuel consumption for individual machines based on current operating parameters; quantify fuel gas reduction from various improvement opportunities and generate near-to-real fuel gas forecast. PETRONAS Upstream Energy Efficiency (EE) journey, which began in 2021, aims to reduce energy consumption without affecting production, thereby increasing gas sales and decreasing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. By 2023, SETPACE© had been widely implemented across all domestic assets in Malaysia. More than 90% of fuel gas (energy) within these assets is consumed for gas compression and power generation. The assessment of over 170 turbomachines across more than 80 oil and gas facilities has revealed that approximately 18% fuel gas reduction from year 2023 conventional forecast is discovered through accounting and forecasting improvement. Baseline results show gas turbines’ fuel efficiency estimate ranging from 4% to 32%. Fuel inefficiency in machinery typically stems from two (2) main factors: performance degradation and low operating loads. Machines with significant deviations in fuel efficiency often consume more fuel than necessary due to deteriorated performance. Addressing this through performance restoration, typically as part of routine planned maintenance, can reduce fuel gas consumption. This approach is particularly viable if the cost is offset by fuel gas savings, with an estimated maximum reduction of 11% from the actual fuel gas reported in 2023. Gas Turbine Generators (GTGs), designed for redundancy and to manage upstream uncertainties, may operate at low loads, leading to inefficient fuel use. While this operational philosophy ensures reliability, it results in higher fuel consumption. Optimizing GTG train operations is estimated to achieve an additional 5% reduction in fuel gas consumption. Furthermore, energy demand optimization and partial electrification is estimated to contribute an additional 11% reduction in fuel gas usage. Decarbonizing combustion through Energy Efficiency (EE) measures is anticipated to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 0.8 to 1.4 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year and recover energy, resulting in an estimated annual savings of USD 20 to 35 million.

The significant climate change the planet has faced in recent decades has prompted global leaders, policymakers, business leaders, environmentalists, academics, and scientists from around the world to unite their efforts since 1987 around sustainable development. This development not only promotes economic sustainability but also environmental, social, and corporate sustainability, where clean production, responsible consumption, and sustainable infrastructures prevail. In this context, the present article aims to propose a development framework for sustainability in food sector SMEs, which includes Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies as key elements to reduce CO2 emissions and improve operational efficiency. The methodology includes a comparative analysis of strategies implemented between 2019 and 2023, supported by quantitative data showing a 20% reduction in operating costs, a 10% increase in market share, and a 25% increase in productivity for companies that adopted clean technologies. This study offers a significant contribution to the field of corporate sustainability, providing a model that is adaptable and applicable across different regions, enhancing innovation and business resilience in a global context that requires collective efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals.

Strategies that can introduce catalytic auxiliary into electrocatalysts to boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are meaningful in exploring hybrid electrocatalytic systems. Here, a series of hybrid elelctrocatalysts (Cu NCs@MOF‐545‐M, M = Fe, Co and Ni) have been prepared by assembly Cu NCs with MOF‐545‐M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) and successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. In the obtained MOF‐545‐M (M = Fe, Co and Ni), the integration of Cu NCs with MOF‐545‐M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) can create a hybrid electrocatalytic system that enhances the charge transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF‐545‐Co achieves high FECO (100%), CO generation rate (10.9 mol m‐2 h‐1) and energy efficiency (69%), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF‐545‐Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FECO by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.

This study successfully developed a foam copper (CF)-based CoMnOx@Co3O4/CF composite catalyst, achieving efficient thermal catalytic oxidation of paraxylene through multifactor optimization of synthesis conditions. At a Co:Mn molar ratio of 2:1 and a calcination temperature of 450 °C, the catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, with a T90 temperature as low as 246 °C, significantly lower than that of catalysts synthesized under other conditions. Additionally, BET, XPS, Raman, EPR, and H2-TPR test results indicate that the catalyst possesses a high specific surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, a distribution of multivalent Co and Mn species, and a lower hydrogen reduction temperature, all of which contribute to the high catalytic activity of CoMnOx@Co3O4/CF. Furthermore, in situ DRIFTS confirmed that the oxidation of paraxylene on CoMnOx@Co3O4/CF follows the Mars–Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. The proposed reaction pathway begins with the oxidation of the methyl group on paraxylene, followed by the opening of the benzene ring and further oxidation to CO2 and H2O. The innovative structural design and excellent catalytic performance of this catalyst provide new insights and solutions for the industrial treatment of VOCs.

Keloids and hypertrophic scars pose significant challenges in clinical management due to their propensity for recurrence and their impact on patient’s quality of life. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of various treatment modalities for these scars, with an emphasis on clinical outcomes, symptom alleviation, and recurrence rates. A comprehensive literature search identified studies published between 2014 and 2024, encompassing randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Results indicate that advanced therapies, such as botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), exhibit superior outcomes compared to traditional treatments, including triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), particularly concerning scar appearance and safety profiles. Furthermore, combination therapies, such as intralesional cryotherapy and CO2 fractional laser with intense pulsed light (IPL), demonstrated promising results in enhancing scar reduction and patient satisfaction. This review underscores the necessity of personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patient requirements, taking into account factors such as scar characteristics and skin types. Future research should concentrate on optimizing treatment regimens to maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects, thereby ensuring long-term success in the management of keloids and hypertrophic scars.

Introduction: The ongoing process of global warming, driven by the escalating concentration of greenhouse gases generated by human activities, especially in urban areas, significantly impacts public health. Local authorities play an important role in health promotion and disease prevention, and some aim to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. There is a consistent action underway to reach this goal, hence the need for mapping and implementing effective strategies and regulations. Materials and Methods: This study includes the analysis of policy guidelines adopted by the city of Bologna, consulted in March and April 2024. Bologna is one of the 100 cities committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030, 20 years ahead of the EU target. To identify the strategies adopted to mitigate climate change, the following methodology was used: (i) the systematic mapping of sources and spatial planning documents; (ii) the extrapolation of goals, measures, and target indicators; and (iii) the development of an overall matrix. Results: The main findings of the study and their connection to public health pertain to the identification of key macro-areas contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, while reducing the impact of climate change on health: (1) built environment and renewable energy sources, (2) transport and mobility, (3) energy, (4) green areas and land use, and (5) citizen support. Within these five macro-areas, 14 goals have been identified, to which a total of 36 measures correspond, and, finally, a target indicator is determined, mainly with respect to the reduction of tons of CO2 equivalent per year. Conclusions: In order to protect public health, it is evident that buildings and urban activities should not produce carbon emissions throughout their lifecycle. This paper presents a method to evaluate municipal policies regarding dual-impact solutions that address both environmental protection through sustainability strategies and public health, in compliance with the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach.

Abstract Global warming is setting the whole world in a real challenge to select between, global economy and industry growth or environment protection. A commitment was set forth via COP organization requesting all countries to show progress and quantify decarbonization efforts. As opportunities always arise through difficulties and challenges, oil and gas industries in UAE found a series of innovative approaches where we can sustain our growth while meeting the decarbonization target. As drilling Rigs are representing one of the main diesel consumptions in oil field and hence Co2 emission, series of initiatives driven to pilot fit for purpose application to substitute diesel driven generator(s). Any initiative that leads to diesel consumption reduction will represent a building block toward the objective. However, most of them have been short to meet the decarbonization target set by UAE leadership (25% reduction by 2030). Solar energy and power storage batteries are on top of the pilots conducted but with limitations. Solar power generation requires a fixed setup / assets where nature of land rig is mobile however its very efficient and robust for fixed central camps. Power storing batteries are still limited to provide required range of energy to operate rigs independently or even partially. Dual fuel (Diesel and natural gas), biofuel and Hydrogen been on radar screen and assessed as well in this paper. Quick and low hanging fruit initiative where this case study about is to screen the existing power grid in our mature fields, quantify the spinning power per each power line and map the drilling location for the upcoming business plan hence evaluate the feasibility to connect rig directly to those power lines utilizing available spare power per each power line providing no future infrastructure or production facility is planned for this spare power.

This computational study advances a theoretical framework for practical, electrochemical fuel generation displaying exponential product yields and product formation rates as functions of time. Exponential reaction scaling is simulated through an autocatalytic cycle that emulates the process of DNA replication facilitated by the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, an initial buildup of formate into a two-carbon chain through CO2 carboxylation forms oxalate. A subsequent, two-electron reduction yields glyoxylate, with base-mediated hydrolysis driving C-C bond fission of glyoxylate into two molecules of formate. These products are then recycled back to serve as reactants. This recursive process chemistry displays 2^n stoichiometries with respect to formate growth in the limit of ideal reaction selectivity. Each step of the proposed fuel cycle shows direct analogy to the steps of DNA annealing, nucleotide polymerization and hybridized strand fission that are responsible for the exponential product yields observed in PCR-mediated DNA synthesis. As a consequence of this replication behavior, rapid rates of fuel production are accessible even when the individual rate constants for the cycle's constituent processes are slow. Significant focus is placed on practical routes for realizing each of the three steps comprising this model case of formate replication, particularly the challenge of formate carboxylation and the corresponding energy demands and power constraints of the overall process.

Brain damage due to ischemic stroke and accompanying obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) negatively affect the current and long-term results of treatment. The key pathophysiological factors of the negative impact of OSAS are the numerous episodes of systemic and cerebral hypoxemia, hypercapnia, inducing variability of glycemia, blood pressure, and heart rate. The objective: to analyze the dynamics of changes in ventilation, oxygenation, the variability of blood glucose, cerebral oximetry, and the level of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in the blood on the background of the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP therapy) in patients with ischemic stroke and concomitant OSAS. Materials and methods. Two groups of 30 persons each were formed from 60 patients with ischemic stroke and OSAS. Patients of the I group have received basic stroke treatment. For patients of the II group the basic scheme of therapy was supplemented with CPAP. To monitor the effectiveness of CPAP therapy we used “SomnoChek micro” (Weinmann, Germany), “Masimo Root” (Masimo, USA), the Guardian™ Connect System glucose monitoring system (Medtronic, Ireland), capnometry with the “Prizm 7S” monitor (Heaco Ltd., South Korea). Results. The leading indicator of the severity of OSAS – apnea/hypopnea index before the start of treatment in patients of the I group was 51.21±9.87/h and 51.38±9.93/h in patients of the II group, at the end of the 7th day of treatment – 46.73±9.65/h and 5.54±0.96/h, respectively, at the end of the 14th day – 39.95±9.92/h and 5.28±1.02/h, respectively. The initial average level of carbon dioxide in patients of the I and II groups was 42.30±4.12 mm Hg and 42.80±3.91 mm Hg, respectively, at the end of the 7th day – 41.07±2.92 mm Hg and 37.57±1.67 mm Hg, respectively, and on the 14th day – 38.87±2.41 mm Hg and 36.23±1.57 mm Hg, respectively. The initial average values of cerebral oximetry in patients of the I and II groups were 49.27±4.98% and 50.60±5.40%, respectively, after 3 days of treatment – 50.13±6.61% and 56.87±5 .39%, respectively, at the end of the 7th day – 57.03±7.01% and 67.64±3.02%, respectively. The initial median values of the NSE level in patients of the I and II groups were 31.17 [28.54–38.41] ng/ml and 32.65 [28.71–43.65] ng/ml, respectively, on the 7th day treatment – 26.44 [24.15–33.44] ng/ml and 19.47 [17.46–21.15] ng/ml, respectively, on the 14th day – 24.09 [22.36–28.48] ng/ml and 14.28 [12.49–16.22] ng/ml, respectively. The coefficient of variation of glucose was 17.1% [15.4–18.9] in patients of the I group and 16.2% [14.6–18.1] in the patients of the II group, on the 3rd day – 16.25 [ 14.5–17.8]% and 11.9 [9.5–13.5]%, respectively, on the 5th day – 16.0 [14.2–17.2]% and 7.95 [6.6–9.5]%, respectively, and on the 7th day of treatment – 15.3 [13.5–17.2]% and 8.5 [7.5–8.9]%, respectively. Conclusions. The use of CPAP therapy in patients with stroke and concomitant OSAS have provided positive dynamics, restoration of adequate ventilation and oxygenation, normalization of the cerebral oximetry index, reduction of NSE level and glucose variability.

Abstract Polymer flood is a mature technology where it has been applied in several fields in the past decade in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) whether in full field scale or pilot/trial scale and at different development concepts (vertical and horizontal polymer injection concepts). However, managing such opportunities to develop them at commercial scale competitively is still deemed to be a challenge especially in a dark brown field from Urban Plan, interface/stakeholders/risk management, contracting strategy and execution prospectives. For the field of subject in this paper, full field polymer development plan and concept selection was endorsed with the concept of developing the polymer project utilizing the existing wells stock drilled during the infill waterflooding phase. Polymer flood is scheduled to be on-stream in 2026 injecting polymer in 2 phases with over 100 polymer injectors in total. The field is a mature dark brown field in South of Oman with waterflood history of over 16 years. Due to the congested nature of the field, it was difficult to define a cost-effective polymer development concept for the entire field. More challenges were faced managing several complexities i.e technology maturation, resources constraint & continuity, contracting strategy endorsement and managing different stakeholders integrating all interface aspects. However, with continuous persistence and innovation, the project has managed to mature total volume of ~ 6% increment with remarkable unit cost reduction (&gt; 50%). Furthermore, additional opportunities were identified to reduce the Unit Technical Cost (UTC) further by 4–5 units cost toward execute phase mainly more efficient polymer facility and chemical costs through competitive contracting strategy and introduction of Category management (CM) approach with further scope optimizations. In terms of Green House Gases (GHG) reduction, the project has demonstrated CO2 reduction in the field to more than 50% compared to Field Infill Waterflood development. This is due to the polymer nature of reducing the water cut in the field and thus reducing the energy required for produced water handling at the surface. This paper will demonstrate the key Front End Development Management challenges, project risks/opportunities, stakeholders and interface management along with key steps made to efficiently manage validate/de-risk the proposed concepts before the full field implementation driven by Decision Quality (DQ) exercise. Moreover, it will demonstrate the capital efficiency journey to improve project competitiveness through an integrated subsurface and surface efforts along with optimized contracting strategy.

Individual road mobility comes with two major challenges: greenhouse gas emissions related to global warming and chemical pollution. For the pollution reduction in the spark ignition engine vehicle, the standard and reliable aftertreatment technology is the three-way catalytic converter (TWC). However, the TWC starts to convert once an optimal temperature, usually known as the light-off temperature, is reached. There are many methods to reduce the warm-up period of the TWC, among which is using a burner. The initial question underlying this study was to see if the use of a relatively straightforward extra-combustion device mounted upstream the TWC, without complex elements, was able to serve the purpose of reducing the light-off time. Consequently, an original burner was designed and investigated numerically via the CFD method and experimentally via measurements of the temperature evolution within a TWC, along with the emissions specific to the burner’s operation. The main findings of this study are: (1) the CFD-based examination is a good way to decide on how to achieve the so-called fit-for-purpose internal aerodynamics of the burner (i.e., to obtain a homogeneous mixture) and (2) to reach the light-off temperature, conventionally taken as 500 K, the burner was operated for 5.2 s, i.e., 3.6 g of gasoline injected, 2.7 g of CO2 and 1.351 g of CO, respectively, emitted. Moreover, this study identified measures for improving the burner’s design as well as an enhanced procedure for the burner’s operating control both aiming to produce a cleaner combustion during the TWC pre-heating.

A proton exchange membrane electrolyzer can effectively utilize the electricity generated by intermittent solar power. Different methods of generating electricity may have different efficiencies and hydrogen production rates. Two coupled systems, namely, PV/T- and CPV/T-coupling PEMEC, respectively, are presented and compared in this study. A maximum power point tracking algorithm for the photovoltaic system is employed, and simulations are conducted based on the solar irradiation intensity and ambient temperature of a specific location on a particular day. The simulation results indicate that the hydrogen production is relatively high between 11:00 and 16:00, with a peak between 12:00 and 13:00. The maximum hydrogen production rate is 99.11 g/s and 29.02 g/s for the CPV/T-PEM and PV/T-PEM systems. The maximum energy efficiency of hydrogen production in CPV/T-PEM and PV/T-PEM systems is 66.7% and 70.6%. Under conditions of high solar irradiation intensity and ambient temperature, the system demonstrates higher total efficiency and greater hydrogen production. The CPV/T-PEM system achieves a maximum hydrogen production rate of 2240.41 kg/d, with a standard coal saving rate of 15.5 tons/day and a CO2 reduction rate of 38.0 tons/day. Compared to the PV/T-PEM system, the CPV/T-PEM system exhibits a higher hydrogen production rate. These findings provide valuable insights into the engineering application of photovoltaic/thermal-coupled hydrogen production technology and contribute to the advancement of this field.

The paper presents experimental studies on the effect of co-combustion of aviation kerosene with hydrogen in the GTM400 turbojet engine on the change in the carbon footprint generated by the engine in relation to its standard operation without hydrogen in the fuel. This research is in line with current research and development trends carried out in the EU, linking them to the issues of the European Green Deal, the Fit for 55 directive and current environmental trends in aviation and energy. The main objective of the research was to check the effect of hydrogen co-combustion in a turbojet engine on the change of the carbon footprint, while a secondary objective was to verify the impact of higher exhaust gas temperatures generated by the new, high-calorific fuel on the secondary generation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), especially in the thermal mechanism, as an undesirable effect. The research shows that the co-combustion of hydrogen with aviation kerosene in a turbojet engine reduces the carbon footprint (reduction of CO2 maximum of 15% and CO emissions maximum of 24%), but also increases the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) maximum of 58%, including those generated in the thermal mechanism (significant increase in the temperature of exhaust gases), moreover, the increase in nitrogen oxide emissions is proportional to the amount of co-combusted hydrogen, which is directly related to the stoichiometry of the combustion process. The main conclusion of the research is that technologies for the combustion or co-combustion of hydrogen in turbojet engines require further research and development, mainly on the side of the use of excess exhaust gas temperature generated during combustion and methods of reducing secondary nitrogen oxides.

Abstract The marine industry, responsible for over 80% of global merchandise transport, significantly impacts environmental sustainability through greenhouse gas (GHG) and sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) targets a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, necessitating cleaner technologies and low-carbon fuels. The IMO's MARPOL Annex VI regulations also mandate a global sulfur cap of 0.5% for marine fuels. Compliance options include low sulfur fuels or scrubbers, with over 5,000 vessels using scrubbers by 2023. Compliance poses challenges for refiners and shippers. On-ship scrubbing of exhaust SOx and CO2 offers an economical solution. Yet, existing ship scrubbers face drawbacks: towering size, weight, and poor efficiency. Enter HP-HiGAS, an innovative technology by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), India, tailored for exhaust gas scrubbing. Utilizing a Rotating Packed Bed (RPB) with high surface area packing, HP-HiGAS leverages centrifugal forces to vastly enhance gas absorption and mass transfer rate. Successfully implemented at HPCL's Visakh Refinery, HP-HiGAS has demonstrated practical viability in removing H2S from refinery fuel gas. The technology's compact design and superior performance make it suitable for marine applications, offering a robust solution for decarbonizing and desulfurizing marine exhaust gases. By enabling the maritime sector to meet stringent environmental regulations, HP-HiGAS plays a crucial role in reducing the industry's environmental footprint and supporting global sustainability efforts.

Abstract Lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) is one type of Gen-IV nuclear reactor with great development potential. The supercritical CO2 (sCO2) Brayton cycle power generation system has the advantages of compact equipment, high efficiency, and great flexibility. Its cycle characteristics are highly consistent with the application requirements of high efficiency, flexibility, and safety of LFR, and it is regarded as the ideal power cycle of LFR. As one of the difficulties of LFR-sCO2 cycle power system, the study on dynamic characteristics and the control strategies of the whole system is relatively scarce. This work takes a MW-scale LFR-sCO2 system as the research object. The dynamic model and the simulation program were established, and the dynamic characteristics of the system were studied. The results show that the increase in rotational speed can quickly raise the mass flow rate and net power, and the surge margin of the compressor also increases significantly, but the net efficiency decreases. The reduction in flow rate or temperature of lead-bismuth eutectic can effectively reduce the heat load of IHX and net power of the system, but the heat power change rate of the system is much faster with the change of mass flow rate. The variation trends of the key parameters with the mass flow rate and temperature of circulating cooling water are basically similar. The split ratio has a significant impact on the compressor surge margin (SMmc and SMrc). With a 5% increase in α, SMmc decreases from 59.89% to 55.87%, while SMrc increases from 46.61% to 56.23%. To avoid the occurrence of compressor surge, it is necessary to pay attention to the change of surge margin caused by the change of α during the variable load operation of the system.

Abstract Integrating power from renewable energy sources (RES) into existing gas processing facilities to reduce their electricity and fuel consumption plays a crucial role in decarbonising the industry. However, the volatile nature and seasonal intensity fluctuations of RES introduce significant uncertainties when designing or optimising process facilities for technological and cost effectiveness to achieve the highest possible fuel and CO2 emission reduction. Detailed models and simulations based on historical weather and operational data supported by traditional engineering approaches and tools are required for this multidisciplinary iterative optimisation. With the initial project goal to create a technology blueprint for decarbonisation initiatives in the gas processing industry, a comprehensive case study focusing on the integration of an innovative solar thermal technology into the gas processing facility of the Nawara gas field in Tunisia was conducted. The study's novel core technology is an inflatable concentrating solar thermal collector of proprietary design that is made of recyclable plastics suitable for sunbelt conditions. The primary objective was to demonstrate the engineering approach required for its optimal integration into the facility's existing process heat supply system, consisting of a single gas-fired heater and multiple consumers at various temperature levels, to reduce overall fuel consumption and increase economic viability. Thermodynamic models of the solar thermal farm and its integration into the process heat cycle were developed for performing time series calculations based on hourly resolved historical heat demand and solar radiation data to investigate optimal system tie-in, sizing, and operation. Additionally, design-relevant parameters like media temperatures and volume flows were determined to assist a projected basic engineering phase. As the study showed, the substitution of heat from the natural gas-powered heater with energy from a solar thermal source is highly dependent on the design of the collector farm, its tie-in point, and the operational flexibility of the existing process heat supply system. During the evaluation of the various scenarios with different equipment sizes and integration approaches, fuel savings between 13 and 29% were attainable even without the implementation of a thermal energy storage unit for operation during nighttime. A follow-up risk assessment based on the study's results provided crucial insights into the operational aspects of the integration of the considered solar thermal technology, enabling significant risk reduction potential for the future development of respective assets. The case study is the first to examine the integration of solar thermal energy into a gas processing facility and is also the first commercial demonstration of the inflatable solar thermal collector technology at megawatt-scale.

Introduction: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a critical procedure in gastroenterology, typically performed under sedation with the administration of supplemental oxygen. Nasal High Flow (NHF) is a newer method of oxygen administration combined with sedation for oxygen delivery. This meta-analysis was designed to identify the effects of NHF during ERCP. Method: Three major online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were searched on July 30, 2024. The search was not limited by publication language and focused on randomized controlled trials that compared the use of NHF with usual care in patients undergoing ERCP. Results: A total of 198 studies were identified after searching the three databases. Finally, five studies, encompassing a total of 581 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed that using NHF was associated with a significantly lower incidence of hypoxemia than usual care. The odds ratio was 0.29 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.14–0.60, p < 0.001, I² = 21%). The NHF group showed a higher minimum SpO2 value during the procedure, with a 2.55% increase in the mean difference (95% CI: 0.96, 4.13, p = 0.002; I² = 57%). Compared to the usual care group, the NHF group demonstrated a reduction in CO2 partial pressure level at the end of the procedure, with a mean difference of 1.83 mmHg (95% CI: -3.25, -0.42, p = 0.01; I² = 0%). The duration of ERCP showed no statistically significant difference between the usual care group and the NHF group, with a mean difference of 0.7 minutes (95% CI: -0.14, 1.53, p = 0.1; I² = 0%). Conclusion: NHF effectively reduces the incidence of hypoxemia, supporting its consideration as the preferred method of oxygen delivery during ERCP, particularly for patients at higher risk of respiratory complications.

Abstract This paper presents a case study of the first installation of an on-demand activated Remote Actuated Shoe (RAS) in offshore extended-reach wells. The Middle East operator faced challenges related to potential differential sticking while running lower completions in high overbalance conditions. To mitigate this risk, the liners were equipped with isolation-valve Inflow Control Devices (IVICD) and a system at the toe of the liner to allow circulation from the shoe. However, conventional ball drop-activated shoe valves proved unreliable and time-consuming, often leading to expensive interventions to close the liner shoe. In collaboration with the operator, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) designed a fit-for-purpose RAS tailored to offshore applications. The RAS was programmed to close after measuring 400 psi above hydrostatic pressure for 45 minutes, providing an on-demand solution for immediate closing of the liner shoe after reaching total depth (TD). A ported bullnose with choke functionality was also designed to create the pressure increase during circulation to signal the RAS to close once at depth. Upon reaching TD with the lower completions, the wells were circulated for the prescribed 45 minutes before seeing the indication that the shoe had shut, and the completion was successfully set as per plans. The successful installation of the on-demand RAS resulted in significant cost savings, with $1 million saved in potential intervention costs and a reduction of 120 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions per well. Two offshore wells have been completed successfully so far using the on-demand RAS, leading to its adoption as the standard liner shoe for the operator's offshore extended-reach wells in these fields. This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the on-demand RAS in mitigating risks associated with high overbalance conditions, differential sticking, and operational challenges during the installation of lower completions in offshore extended-reach wells. The findings highlight the potential for significant cost savings and environmental benefits through the adoption of innovative intervention less technology in oil and gas operations.

_ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 218231, How Polymer Flooding Reduces CO2 Emissions and Energy Consumption at the Captain Field: An Exergy-Return-on-Exergy-Investment Case Study,” by Tormod Skauge, SPE, and Arne Skauge, SPE, Energy Research Norway, and Nancy Lugo, Ithaca Energy UK, et al. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ Insights into the energy efficiency and environmental performance of the extraction of heavy oil from the Captain field in the UK sector of the North Sea are gained using life-cycle assessment (LCA), which incorporates the concept of exergy-return-on-exergy-investment (ERoEI). The LCA allows for separation of the process into material and work streams, assessing the effect of each separately. In the complete paper, the authors compare waterflooding (WF) to polymer flooding (PF) as primary extraction strategies. Introduction The Captain field is approximately 145 km northeast of Aberdeen, Scotland. The reservoirs lie at shallow depths of approximately 900 m true vertical depth with correspondingly low temperatures of 31°C and low pressures of 87 bar. A primary challenge is the relatively viscous oil of 40–140 cp. The field was initially developed with long horizontal wells and downhole pumps. Viscous oil implies mobility challenges, however, and water injection could lead to unstable displacement, early water breakthrough, and possible coning issues. After a successful pilot PF at Captain during 2010–2017, a staged enhanced oil recovery (EOR) development approach was adopted in 2016 aiming to extend the pilot polymer-solution-injection scheme to the full field through a phased development. Following the pilot study, the Captain EOR project was split into Stage 1 and Stage 2. The first stage involved drilling of five producers and two EOR injectors by 2022. The second stage included some brownfield modifications across the three Captain installations (two installations and a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel) and a significant expansion in the subsea area. The complete paper concentrates on the expansion in the subsea areas, Areas B and C. The methodology of the study, including the development of simulation cases, LCA, exergy analysis, system boundaries, material and work streams, and CO2 emissions, is detailed in the complete paper. Production Profiles The Stage 2 EOR development evaluates PF for Areas B and C. The baseline is WF with fully produced water reinjection. WF was scheduled to begin in January 2024 and to end in December 2099. The PF case also was slated to begin in January 2024 and to end in 2035 and 2034 for Area B and Area C, respectively. The field is operated on pressure maintenance, and the voidage replacement ratio is kept close to 1.0. This means that the PF injects more liquid than the WF case during the first 5 years of injection when the oil production is higher for PF. After polymer injection ends, the PF case injects less liquid than the WF case. In Area B, water cut is high from the start for the WF case. Because of the high mobility of the water, it fingers through the oil. In contrast, when polymer is injected, the water cut falls to approximately 80% and does not reach the starting value of 94.1% before 7 years, more than 2.5 years after having stopped the polymer injection in this area. The low water cut is the result of production of a large oil bank generated by the improved sweep and mobility reduction of the injected polymer.

Abstract This paper demonstrates the real time challenges encountered during full-scale deployment of Produced Water Re-Injection in ADNOC Onshore's largest Oil Producing Field. The paper will illustrate the comprehensive detailing of substantial deployment milestones right from the selection, definition, evaluation, successful pilot demonstration and eventually to a full-scale produced water re-injection deployment of 100,000 Barrel/day. This paper also covers the design & operations related key challenges encountered during the execution and states how challenges were tackled and converted to opportunities and waste stream was converted to a enabler for reservoir pressure support thus enhanced operational sustainability by eliminating the need of 2.5 MW/hr of electrical power and 18000 Metric Ton of CO2 / Year. Following challenges were encountered during the course of 100% PWRI deployment: Uncertainties in production profiles.Facilities Bottlenecking.Fluctuation in composition.Presence of schmoo.SIMOPS and Construction in brown field without compromising the integrity and sustainable production rates. The detailed selection process of various treatments options i.e. selection of reservoir and operating philosophy of full-scale deployment was executed in three stages: Sub-surface evaluation to benchmark the required produced water outlet specifications, to maintain sustained produced water reinjection without impacting the fracture growth.Modifications of Surface Installations and technological screening to ascertain the required produced water specification, along with the facilities hookup requirements, plot plans and piping network to handle the current volumes of produced water as well as predicted productions profiles to cater future requirements due to maturity of Field and Gas lift phase - II.Troubleshooting of uncertainties encountered, Identification of opportunities and realization in OPEX optimization, reduction in downtime and sustainability implications.The potential of produced water re-injection under the matrix and fractured injection conditions was evaluated. Following the quantification of reservoir rock mechanical properties, determination of stresses in the different formations and physical measurements from the core flood tests, predictive runs and sensitivities collection were utilized to finalize the mode of re-injection to be fractured injection. Facility was than designed and PWRI network was established to cater the current produced water volumes at central processing facility as wells as future foreseen till 2030, to ensure re-injection into the reservoir for reservoir pressure support. Shallow Aquifer water previously the premier source of reservoir pressure support was replaced in phased manner with Produced water volumes of up to 100,000 BWPD, which was being dumped in the disposal wells. 05 Electrical submersible pumps stopped with the change of source, resulting in saving of 1.6 MM USD in terms of power tariff and 18000 Metric Ton eq. CO2 / Year, facilitating ADNOC in decarbonization of operations, meeting sustainable operations mandates and concerning shallow aquifer reservoirs. This paper demonstrates the novel methods of addressing the challenges and uncertainties encountered during the full-scale deployment of Produced water for re-injection. It reflects how this operational philosophy can reduce the aquifer water consumption, increase the oil recovery factor, Decarbonize the Operations and slashes the operational costs. The paper will provide an insight about managing uncertainties, design bottlenecking and harnessing new technologies from the concept to full scale implementation covering all major phases e.g. Concept, PoC, Pilot Demonstration, Business Case Study, detailed engineering, on ground execution, realization fiscal benefits in terms of CAPEX, OPEX and value addition towards the ESG realization. The paper will highlight the lessons learned and the best practices for future replication by other Oil and Gas Producers.

Abstract Field X is the largest oil field in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), with the most wells and the highest production. It is also a very mature field, with many old wells and aging facilities. This means that it is important to manage the field carefully to maintain production and prevent decline. In 2020, Field X's performance was below industry standards. The subsurface unscheduled deferment was on the rise (reaching 3.7% of total field potential in 2020), the artificial lift failure index was high (28%), the number of closed-in wells (CIW) with potential was high (9.1%), and the oil gain from optimization activities was low (3.1%). To improve performance, the team embarked on a journey towards WRFM Excellence. They used a Gap to Potential (GtP) benchmarking approach to identify and address performance gaps. The team successfully executed their strategy, and Field X's WRM performance is now best-in-class. This was achieved through effective collaboration between different departments, agile work processes, the use of technology, automation, and visual management. Between 2020 and 2023, there has been a dramatic improvement in Field X's performance. For example, the subsurface unscheduled deferment rate has decreased from 3.7% to 2.1%, and some fields have achieved ZERO unscheduled subsurface deferment. The artificial lift failure index has also dropped from 28% to 18%, and the CIW stock has dropped from 9.1% to 4.6%. The oil gain from Optimization has even doubled, from 3.1% to 7.2%. In addition to these performance improvements, the successful deployment of the GPT approach also had a positive impact on Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE), as all projects were executed safely with zero lost time injuries. Furthermore, the conversion of 40 wells from beam pump to Long Stork Unites LSU resulted in a 40% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Overall, the results of the GPT approach in Field X are very impressive. The team was able to achieve significant improvements in performance, HSE, and sustainability. This is a great example of how the GPT approach can be used to improve the performance of oil and gas fields. This paper reports on the successful implementation of the Field X Gap-to-Potential (GPT) approach, resulting in best-in-class performance.

Abstract Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is dedicated to implementing sustainable practices through digitalization of oil and gas operation, with a current focus on reducing hydrocarbon emissions. Corporate goal is to minimize emissions from Gas lift (GL) wells, ensuring environmental responsibility while maintaining production efficiency. To achieve production targets while preventing unnecessary flaring, high (Gas Oil Ratio) GOR wells are closed or partially choked by Operation engineers manually but being vigilant hasn't proven to give optimum results. This paper details the successful implementation of autonomous flare control at a single station utilizing a well management system (WMS). Following the effective execution of the Flare Limit Control project within the WMS, a comprehensive change management strategy was deployed. Operations engineers were empowered to configure, update, and remove wells from the automated flare control scope within the WMS. Autonomous well control was achieved through continuous flare monitoring in the WMS. High Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) wells were closed when the flare limit was exceeded, and the last closed wells were automatically reopened once the flare was reduced. Through meticulous analysis, significant improvements were noted in reducing hydrocarbon emissions, saving on deferment and huge time saving following the project's implementation. The total yearly benefit is estimated to be around 185,000 USD from increased wells' uptime and time saving from one station. An additional 0.08% cost saving is estimated from additional CAPEX to reduce CO2 emissions as per PDO corporate target. Following improvements have contributed to value estimation from automated flare control: 8% more uptime from wells which are part of flare control logic.4% engineers' time saving33% of flare reduction The Flare control HMI (Human Machine Interface) screen offers Operation engineers a user-friendly interface, equipped with essential and informative details. The interface empowers them to effectively control flare automatically, ensuring not only minimal emissions but also reducing deferment and time saving. The implementation of new technologies has supported in overcoming operational challenges and efficiently managing the flare. An autonomous and intelligent logic has been introduced for controlling flare in real-time taking a bold step in digital transformation journey of PDO.

Abstract In general exploration & appraisal of new reservoirs involves flaring operations. Well testing operation of sour wells by flaring or flowing through existing pipeline networks with limitations is always considered highly challenging in the brownfield. Ultra-sour appraisal well testing operation considered to be complex in nature and may be resulted serious concern due to toxic gasses and their immediate effects. The wells are in congested developed fields and special consideration regarding social risk analysis and mitigation to be considered for operations. Apart from social risk there could be flow assurance issues due to scale deposition in the surface network during testing. Therefore, it is required to test the facilities to handle high H2S reservoir and blending with the low H2S content stream. To appraise the ultra-sour reservoir, extensive HAZOP (Hazard and Operability study) reviews and a blending study were carried out in-house. Multiple blending scenarios were developed real-time to ensure that H2S & CO2 remained within facilities limit. Below is the stepwise approach followed to achieve all objectives in line with our sustainability targets. Initial blending estimates based on Compositions and remote manifold stations (RMS's) / compression stations (Cs's) profiles. Proposed sour gas blending ratios are calculated in such a way so that the net effect of H2S at the compressor station common suction header (post mixing) will remain within limit, any increment shall be managed through negotiating production from less sour wells. Afterwards developing the baseline for the project, a detailed technical discussion was carried out with the downstream team. In this regard, the facility integrity team confirmed the integrity and adequacy of existing gas surface facilities & compressors. A detailed HAZOP review was conducted on the temporary well testing set-up along with the flowline. All recommendations were closed out prior to operations commencement. As a study outcome operation, frequent sampling was recommended at compressor stations and remote manifolds. Detailed Social risk studies and social risk management were also part of project and all control were implemented prior to kick off the project. Multiple wells were successfully appraised along with the significant reduction of GHG emissions. Moreover, the appraisal wells were generating revenues as they were producing through the facilities. All objectives were in-line with our vision of 100x decarbonization, unconventional gas & preserving the ecosystem. This paper will elaborate on the integrated & excellent collaboration between upstream and downstream teams for inline testing of ultra-sour well without flaring considering the operational, Safety, and subsurface aspects. There are two important aspects of the case study. First Wells were commissioned and produced through facilities without any flaring operations which complimented the sustainability mandate. It created new venues for sour reservoir development and steps closer to gas self-sufficiency.

Abstract As technology develops rapidly, petroleum industry needs to utilize these to develop operational models to limit personnel travelling to high HS&E risk rigsite area to relatively safe controlled remote operation centers. Traditional manning is not effective anymore. CO2 emissions has reached alarming levels leading to global warming. This paper describes one innovative operating model which encompasses multi-skilled field crew, remote operations using digital and technology enablers. Detailed description focused on different case studies. An Integrated Multiservice model was developed. Step one was an in-depth risk assessment of the project. Next prepared RACI matrix for all personal involved in project either at rigsite or office. All tasks traditionally performed by service company engineer were analyzed, then identified which tasks need physical presence of engineer at the rigsite and which tasks can be performed remotely from remote operations center. Depending on location of crew - rigsite or remote center specific competency development plan was prepared. This led to forming Multiskilled service company crew at the rigsite- Field Professional (FPRO) who could now perform all physical tasks across all operations which reduced additional resources needed to travel during change in operations. It led to relocating set of skilled engineers at the remote operations center to execute the non-physical tasks. Field escalation process was developed to streamline the process and avoid communication barriers. Statement of requirement for connectivity to rig infrastructure for communication were defined. To test the robustness of the model it was implemented across different geographies (North Sea, Middle East and Latin America). Tested over different environments (onshore and offshore). Implementation on each project was successful. Lesson learnt from each project was shared across other projects improving overall service delivery. Successful transition of up to 50% tasks from rigsite to remote center was possible. POB reduction up to 67% was achieved in one case. Ability for one offshore customer to do SIMOPS (Simultaneous Operations) on old platform with POB issues was huge cost saving. North Sea customers experiencing frequent bad weather conditions benefitted from avoiding rig shutdown waiting on service company crew as operations were managed through remote center. FPRO were supported by Drilling contractor personal and remote professionals operating from remote center. One team mindset is the secret for the model's success. All 3 stakeholders (Operating company, Drilling Contractor & Service company) worked together with a common purpose. Operators are now requesting to further optimize this model to gain more value. The next stage would cross train drilling contractor personal. Utilizing automation software in Drilling, fluid monitoring and cementing would drive further standardization and alignment with overall project objectives. This model is a stepping change in how operations will take place in future.

Abstract This paper examines the impact of satellites in orbit, in relation to methane emissions and net-zero goals. Leveraging insights from global mappers and point source satellites, it elucidates the valuable information obtained and its significance in the O&G industry. Furthermore, this paper highlights the pioneering efforts of GHGSat in this field, its expansion into CO2 monitoring, along with advancements in quantification, detection threshold, spatial resolution, and the enhancements of its next generation aircraft sensor capabilities. This manuscript presents insights and data obtained from emissions monitoring satellites, with a focus on their role in mitigating emissions, understanding trends, and solving pertinent industry challenges. Utilizing a sophisticated data analytics Esri-based Arc-GIS platform, SPECTRA, GHGSat generates metrics that provide valuable insights into emissions monitoring. Key techniques employed include wide-area coverage, tip and cueing mechanisms, automation, and innovative processing capabilities to optimize observations and generated plumes. Additionally, statistical data and the distribution of global O&G emissions, with specific attention to case studies from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This presentation will reveal the critical importance of frequency of observations in the efficacy of emissions monitoring efforts, emphasizing the need for consistent and timely data collection. For example, GHGSat monitored 300% more observations in 2023 and more than 183MTCO2e emissions, 2.3 times increase in Oil and Gas detections, in comparison to 2022. This is attributable to its growing constellation and high spatial resolution of 25m, and detection threshold of 100 kg/hr. The insights provided by emissions monitoring satellites are instrumental in informing mitigation strategies, understanding emissions trends, and addressing industry challenges. Moreover, the involvement of satellite companies and advancements in satellite technology have significantly enhanced GHGSat's ability to monitor and address emissions in the O&G industry. Regulatory compliance and International Frameworks for emission monitoring will also be discussed, and how source level measurements fit into the various scopes. GHGSat's top-down approach and its incorporation of its evergreening aircraft sensor solutions and developments for higher resolution (of less than 1m) and lower detection thresholds (down to 5 kg/hr) will be reviewed. This study underscores the invaluable contributions of emissions monitoring satellites in advancing sustainability efforts and shaping the future of the O&G industry towards a greener and more sustainable trajectory. GHGSat, a pioneering force in this space, has notably launched 12 satellites between 2016 and 2023, with a significant influx occurring in 2023, and plans to deploy five more satellites starting in 2025. By harnessing the capabilities of satellite and aircraft sensor technologies for onshore and offshore monitoring, the Oil and Gas industry stands poised to make informed decisions, drive sustainable practices, and contribute to global efforts towards emissions reduction and environmental stewardship.

Abstract Stuck pipe events are a major challenge for oil and gas operators; they can occur during drilling, completion, or abandonment operations, and can put the whole well at risk. They are also one of the main sources of non-productive time, as recovering from such event is usually a lengthy process and tend to disturb the entire operation. In the North Sea, weather is unpredictable and logistics has been known to be challenging, leading to rigs shutting down while waiting on personnel and equipment, further delaying the return to normal. Utilizing wireline remote operations has had a massive impact on how fast the operations can be completed. It has saved days of waiting on weather, equipment, and personnel. Expert wireline engineers in the Remote Operations Center are available 24/7 and the required equipment, such as Mechanical Pipe Cutter and Downhole Electric Cutting Tool, are usually available at the rig site. A unique work model combining multiskilled personnel on offshore rigs along with remote professionals onshore is used, paired with digital technologies available in the market. Statement of requirement for connectivity and rig infrastructure for communication was defined. Detailed risk assessment was conducted in planning stage. RACI matrix involving all tasks at rig site or remote center were clearly defined. Escalation process was developed to have clear communication guidelines. This model was tested on multiple jobs with great success. The first ever fully remote operation using the Mechanical Pipe Cutter service in the North Sea was successful. In total, 5 cuts were completed remotely; the first 2 cuts were successful but didn’t result in being able to pull the pipe, due to damaged control lines downhole. After consulting with the operator, 3 more cuts were performed and the pipe was successfully pulled and laid down at surface. A tractor was used for conveyance, leading to integrating teams and prevented sending additional personal offshore. Post job data delivery to customer was done quicker, as remote engineers focused on data processing and delivery while the offshore personnel worked on rigging down tools and returning the well to customer. With over 60 jobs done successfully to date, our customers have saved huge costs. 25% reduction in personal on board was achieved leading to almost 2.5 ton of CO2 emissions saved. This was a first worldwide, as this service had never been run fully remote anywhere else. More logging units are getting upgraded with fiber connectivity to support future operations, and wellsite supervisors have been trained on this innovative approach. Strong horizontal knowledge transfer between rigs crews is possible by having 24/7 central support onshore. This paper will explain in detail the holistic approach in terms of technology development, multiskilled personnel and remote logging applications.

Abstract This paper presents the dynamic selection of plant operational modes based on the results of Process Simulation Software Application. This Solution takes multivariable inputs for all the process feed parameters, dynamically determines the optimum operating conditions and advice the control room operator about oil producers well selections for specific trains and manifolds based on the water handling capabilities of trains. This also provides decision output for the selection of operating mode of the processing trains between dry and wet modes. Gas Oil Separation Plants (GOSP) play a pivotal role in the oil and gas industry by optimizing operational efficiency through dynamic operational modes. These plants are designed to manage the separation of gas and water from oil, ensuring that the crude oil meets export specifications while minimizing energy consumption and carbon emissions. GOSP plants have inherent challenges of scattered oil producer wells. Production from the wells is comingled with oil gathering manifold and transfer lines to the central station, where it is further processed and separated into stabilized crude and associated gas and water. The implementation of dynamic selection has resulted in a significant benefit for the plant operations. By segregating the high water cut and low water cut wells, the model has reduced the load on the water treatment facilities. The model has enabled the plant to operate more efficiently and reliably, while saving energy and minimizing carbon emissions. The model has also enhanced the operator awareness and decision-making capabilities, as well as the safety and environmental performance of the plant. This methodology adopted were based on the following steps: Collecting data from all oil-producing wells.Separating the wells with a high water cut, identifying those with over 15% water content.Allocating wells with a high water cut to the wet trains and directing those with a low water cut to the dry train.Implementing cyclic operations of the trains between wet and dry to prevent stagnation and the need for mothballing.Monitoring all critical parameters and maintaining export crude specifications. The dynamic selection of wells based on water cut is a novel and innovative approach to optimize the performance of the Central Degassing Station. It not only ensures the quality of the export crude, but also enhances the efficiency and reliability of the equipment and reduces the environmental impact. The following are the annual benefits achieved by this dynamic selection: Optimizing the operation of the feed pump (not required during dry mode of operation)3808 Metric tons of Co2 reduction4000BWPD of freshwater conservation1MM$ Opex reduction. These advantages highlight the significance of using data-driven and agile approaches to solve intricate operational problems. Choosing wells dynamically is a superior method that can adopt and expand to other GOSP plants, reflecting the firm's dedication to outstanding and sustainable practices in oil and gas production.

Abstract This work presents a review of the exploitation schemes applied and envisioned for the next 25 years in the Exploitation Plan for the Zuata Principal Field, located in the Junín Block of "La Faja Petrolífera del Orinoco (FPO)", Venezuela. The relevance of Improved/Enhanced Oil Recovery (IOR/EOR) methods to increase the production/recovery factor of the area is highlighted, with recoverable reserves of 4,392 MMSTB and a current primary recovery factor of approximately 3.5% after more than 25 years of exploitation. In terms of field-scale IOR/EOR, the implementation of two main IOR projects is highlighted: Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) and Downhole Electrical Heating (DEH) through an electro-resistive heating cable, executed between 2010-2018; as well as the visualization of the application of Chemical EOR (CEOR) methods (e.g., surfactants and polymers) in areas of the reservoir where the implementation of thermal methods is not feasible. The comprehensive methodology of the CSS Project included well pre-selection, numerical reservoir simulation, infrastructure analysis, area prioritization, economic considerations, and implementation. Similarly, the DEH Project focus on selecting prospective wells based on criteria adapted to the study area, economic premises, and field implementation of the technology. Finally, for evaluating CEOR methods (surfactants and polymers), a first phase involved pilot area selection, fluid sampling, and laboratory testing. This will serve as the basis for the pilot field test feasibility evaluation phase. The findings of this study indicate that 19 CSS activities were carried out during the 2013-2018 period, with cumulative injection volumes ranging from 7,500 to 10,000 tons/cycle. Production increases of up to 365% were observed, with thermal effect durations ranging from 12 to 16 months. The effectiveness of the CSS method was evaluated using two operational indicators: "Incremental Np" and "Steam to Oil Ratio (SOR)", both of which yielded favorable results. Furthermore, between 2010 and 2018, DEH systems were installed in 23 wells, which is considered a technological substitute as a pre-CSS scheme or in cases where CSS processes are not technically feasible. Incremental productions of 20% to 60% were achieved, with operating powers of up to 55 kW. Regarding the application of CEOR methods, the injection of polymers and surfactant-polymers could potentially increase hydrocarbon recovery in the area (up to 90% at the laboratory scale for the SP case) with a lower environmental impact compared to thermal methods, specifically in terms of water consumption (for steam generation) and acid gas emissions (e.g., CO2 and H2S). Depending on the type of chemical used, recovery mechanisms such as mobility control, interfacial tension reduction, ions exchange (low salinity of injected water), and/or changes in wettability could impact hydrocarbon recovery. This novel study provides an exhaustive compilation of the experiences and best operational practices derived from the field applications of the main IOR/EOR projects executed in the Zuata Principal Field, allowing solid conclusions to be drawn about the oil-exploitation potential of the area. The optimization and/or application of new schemes in the implemented methods are also envisioned. Additionally, several outstanding studies concerning other IOR/EOR methods applicable to the area, such as Chemicals, Hybrids (e.g., thermo-chemicals), are listed, supporting their continuation.

Abstract Implementing industrial scale technology and easily adoptable solutions in the field of Virtual Reality has been challenging for the energy industry. Designing and developing a solution to unlock the capability of engineers virtually meeting each other in 1:1 scale digital plant and executing a high-fidelity design review to make sure the design meets specified requirements and address any potential issues before release is the goal of this new technology development project. This project is a cross functional team effort including experts from plant design, project engineering, installation & service engineering, quality, cyber security, enterprise architect and enterprise CAD systems. Well detailed Technology development roadmap and technology adoptability strategy was prepared defining the success criteria and validation of value proposition. The solution developed is a four-step process; 1) Data preparation 2) Data publish to server 3) Design review execution 4) Report generation. During data preparation phase project engineer will gather inputs for design review like 3D model, checklist, documents, team list and project information. This data is published to a cloud-based server using a web portal and CAD plugins without any data loss. Project engineer will then set up a 3D design review meeting and invite required attendees using the same solution. With this solution engineers located globally can join the virtual meeting with just one click using virtual reality headset and all participants can access the data published depending on access granted to them. The participants can virtually meet and discuss through representation of their avatars in real time and can perform the plant design review in 1:1 scale with high quality 3D visualization. Participants in the meeting can collaboratively simulate installation and maintenance sequence, check accessibility, measure dimensions and capture comments if any to make changes to design. The solution will automatically generate the report out and list of actions from the review. More than 150 engineers from about 10 industrial energy companies had the opportunity to test and use this solution. Many functionalities providing immersive user experience for industrial use cases were explored pushing the limits of VR. It was observed that we can reduce 50% of cost of quality related to field modifications. Further we can reduce 50% engineering 3D model rework by early identification of clashes in the model. This solution can also lead to 30% reduction in travel costs by adopting virtual meeting instead of physical meeting, eventually reducing CO2. It was concluded that design review performed in a virtual immersive environment, significantly improved the ability to ensure a flawless design that meets all the requirements and significantly improve the ability to communicate the design intent. As the organizations are moving towards more digital product and plant design, 3D models enriched with process, material, design information interlinked with various product life cycle management systems, makes use of virtual simulation tools inevitable. Further data captured from real operation of the plant can be used to optimize and improve various key elements by integrating with these 3D models moving to the real digital twin.

Abstract A new energy landscape has unlocked relevant opportunities, operators are more focused on energy efficiency to tackle emissions reduction and satisfy global Climate Change initiatives driven by the Paris Agreement. The future of the oil and gas industry depends on its ability to manage its carbon footprint, not only in scopes 1 and 2- but also in scope 3 emissions which require actions, oversight and shall bring changes to the overall value chain in different sectors and countries given the new ESG requirements and other relevant regulations. The logistics & services (L&S) sector involves operations along the entire oil & gas value chain-onshore, offshore, shipping & marine services. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of scope 3 and determine its magnitude as L&S advances in its sustainability journeys and include scope 3 in its future commitment. Given the complex nature of the oil and gas operations, a model was built to estimate carbon emissions in the shipping & logistics segments associated with maritime transportation and logistics practices. Scope 3 emissions ~ 75-80% of lifecycle emissions connected with the end-users. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the scope 3 emissions are not only significant but also increasing at an alarming rate- expected by up to 250% by 2050. The proposed methodology used is based on mixed methods, concerning literature review, benchmarking the L&S world-leaders, interviews with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and a quantitative model to define the magnitude of this scope in the sector's ecosystem. Accurate quantification of CO2 emissions equivalents along the hydrocarbon value chain is an important step to address the company's Sustainable Development Strategy and build a carbon-free future for new generations to come. The scope of every business unit was established to cover all scope 3, whereby 15 sub-categories were also established as a framework. The model outputs allow users to analyze the system's carbon intensity, raise alarms, and identify potential energy efficiency efforts and governance framework to be incorporated into the company's business plan and annual budget to reduce emissions based on their magnitude and climate impacts. Reporting scope 3 emissions across the supply chain, from production to consumption is a novel initiative, that aligns with International Oil Companies (IOCs)’ best practices and L&S global leaders in the market in addition to forthcoming regulatory obligations. Reducing emissions requires collaboration, an effective governance framework, and clear commitment among the company, regulators (e.g., IMO), and government. The UAE sustainability plans, and IMO stricter regulations are incentivizing the sector to meet ambitious goals by 2050. The global energy sector is shifting towards a more sustainable, environmentally friendly production and consumption of all energy sources, where scope 3 estimation represents an important step ahead. This common objective guides efforts at the sector level to become a decarbonization role model and hub in the region and promote more collaboration across its hydrocarbon value chain.

Обзор посвящен глобальной экологической проблеме современности - снижению парниковых газов в атмосфере. Значительная его доля депонируется в почвах. Обсуждаются меры, способствующие секвестрации углерода при землепользовании, поскольку почвы и леса, наряду с мировым океаном, являются основными хранителями СО2. Внимание уделено типам землепользования (целина, пашня, пастбищные, лесные земли). Приведен материал по обработкам земель: нулевой, стандартный с оставлением растительных остатков и без них; с применением биоугля, микроводорослей. Рассмотрен сравнительный анализ с использованием биомаркеров на пастбище со смешанным травостоем, пашне с рапсом, в почве под ивой с целью определения микроорганизмов, ассимилирующих углерод ризоотложений различных растений. Встречаются работы, доказывающие важность гидролизуемых липидов в лесах, составляющих, в отличие от фенола лигнинов, высокую долю в накоплении почвенного органического углерода (SOC). Они возрастают с уменьшением pH почвы, увеличением реактивного железа и алюминия и увеличением окисления лигнина. SOC выше в илистых и глинистых фракциях, чем в песчаных, защищая SOC в их агрегатах. Отсюда для определения стабилизации его в большинстве почв предлагается использовать в качестве ключевого элемента мелкодисперсную минеральную фракцию. Карбонаты играют важную роль в секвестрации углерода, на его долю приходится примерно 40 % углерода, хранящегося в почвах мира. Они являются основным компонентом накопления углерода в засушливых регионах. Внимание обращено к коренному улучшению пастбищ, инверсионной обработке (FIT). Приведен материал методического характера, где используются дистанционные методы (ДЗ), обнаруживающие SOC. В качестве прогноза используются предикторы ДЗ - как ближний инфракрасный, так и коротковолновый инфракрасный диапазон, с дополнительными фенологическими наблюдениями. Использование отраженной коротковолновой радиации в верхней атмосфере, большой потенциал смягчения климата оказали большое влияние на культивирование покровной культуры с высоким альбедо и недостатком хлорофилла. The review is devoted to the current environmental problem - a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. A significant proportion of carbon is known to be deposited in the soil cover. Measures are being discussed in a many countries to promote carbon sequestration depending on the land use, because soils and forests, along with the world’s oceans, are the main stores of CO2. Different land use issues (virgin lands, arable land, pasture and forest lands) are covered in connection with the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Data on the land cultivation: zero; standard with and without plant residues; using biochar; microalgae are given. A comparative analysis using biomarkers on a pasture with mixed herbage, arable land with rapeseed, soil under willow have been considered in order to determine microorganisms assimilating carbon from rhizosphere deposits of various plants. Some sources evident the hydrolysable lipids constitute a high share of the soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation in forests, in contrast to phenols of lignin. The former substances are actively accumulated with the decreasing of soil pH, increasing of reactive iron, aluminum, and lignin oxidation. SOC is higher in a silt and clay fractions as compared to the sandy ones due to it absorbance in aggregates. Hence, it was proposed to use the finely dispersed mineral fraction as a key element to determine carbon stabilization in most soils. Carbonates play an important role in carbon sequestration, accounting for approximately 40 % of carbon stored in the world soils. They are the main component of carbon storage in arid regions. Attention to the radical improvement of pastures is given - inversion treatment (FIT). The methodical issues to detect SOC by remote distance (RD) technique are given. Reflected shortwave radiation in the upper atmosphere (TOA) practice has shown a great potential for climate mitigation through the cultivation of a cover crop with high albedo and a lack of chlorophyll.

Abstract Phase alteration is a physical phenomenon that constantly takes place in reservoirs, during production or injection, due to the regional change in fluids’ pressures or temperatures. The transformation of phases also occurs frequently in enhanced oil recovery (cold solvent injection, CO2 injection, etc.) or thermal enhanced oil recovery (steam injection, solvent-thermal application) at which injected fluids condense gradually throughout the matrix owing to heat loss or an increase in pressure. Achieving an accurate prediction of phase change in the porous media is important for attaining trustful forecasting of hydrocarbon recoveries, retrieval of the injected solvents, vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations, and modelling of two-phase envelopes. Generally, the capillary effect has an impact on the properties of fluids when medium sizes are tight enough to affect the molecules and empower pore-molecule interactions. One of the fluid properties influenced by high capillary pressures is the phase-change. When pore sizes become tighter than 100 nanometers, vaporization and condensation temperatures/pressures of confined fluids tend to shift from bulk measurements. Understanding the nature of physical state alteration (liquid-to-gas or vice versa) has attracted the attention of researchers because of its enormous importance in pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) calculations and reservoir simulation. In petroleum industries, cubic equation-of-state (EoS) models are used to predict the phase behavior of hydrocarbons in the reservoirs. One of the major limitations of the commonly used cubic EoS (Peng-Robinson EoS and Soave Redlich-Kwong EoS) is that they do not consider the confinement effect on the phase-alteration behavior of fluids. Such a drawback causes these cubic models to be inaccurate in modelling two-phase envelopes of rock fluids in extended tight reservoirs (shales, tight sands) or even in permeable rocks (sands under thermal injection). This paper experimentally investigates the phase-change behavior of hydrocarbons in various categories of the porous system. The experimental journey was initiated by studying the boiling behavior of single-component hydrocarbon liquids in silica-glass Hele-Shaw cells which is represented as simple capillary spaces with different sizes. Shifted boiling temperatures were observed in the glass cells, due to the confinement effect. As a next step, the vaporization of hydrocarbons was analyzed in homogeneous and heterogeneous silicate-glass microfluidic chips. Early vaporizations of solvents were observed in the micromodels, as a result of capillary effects in the porous systems. The analysis was shifted forward to focus on the phase-change behavior of hydrocarbons in real reservoir rocks. Owing to the existence of nanopores, the vaporization of tested liquids took place in the rocks at temperatures lower than normal boiling points and calculated boiling temperatures by the Thomson equation. Such reductions were also observed in the permeable rocks although the volume percentages of extended confined pores (&lt; 100 nanometers) were less than 5%. The second set of experiments paid attention to measuring the vaporization temperature of single-component and multicomponent hydrocarbon liquids in different rocks at various pressures. The pure-component solvents were representing the injected solvents in cold solvent injection or as additives to steam, and the multicomponent solvents were representing non-complex light oil. The experimental results were, then, compared with the normal boiling points and calculated phase-change temperatures by the original version of the Peng-Robinson EoS. Noticeable deviations of measured vaporization temperatures of liquid solvents from the bulk and computed values were observed. As the medium gets smaller, interior pore surfaces begin to have influences on boiling temperatures of hydrocarbons, due to the pore-molecule interactions. Studying the condensation of propane in various reservoir rocks under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions was also a part of the investigation. The vaporization of propane was inspected in different rocks at various temperatures. The experimental observations were then compared with the bulk vaporization pressures and computed saturation pressures by the Peng-Robinson EoS and Kelvin equation. The recorded vapor pressures, in the rocks, were 7% lower than the bulk values and calculated vapor pressures by the Kelvin equation. Meanwhile, the propane vapor pressures, in the rocks, were 15% (on average) lower than the pressures modelled by the Peng-Robinson EoS.
