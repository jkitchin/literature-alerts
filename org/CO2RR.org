Value-added conversion of CO2 using solar energy is a sustainable strategy to address the energy crisis and environmental issues simultaneously. In this work, Cu–CuO/NC catalysts were successfully prepared by a sol-gel method, and the effects of Cu doping ratio and heat treatment temperature on the catalyst properties were investigated. The experimental results revealed that 7%CNC-600 °C has the best photocatalytic reduction performance of CO2 to CH3OH within 8h, 812μmol/gcat. The catalysts were also analyzed using techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, CO2-TPD, PL, etc. The superior catalytic activity mainly benefits from the electron capture properties of the metal and its synergistic effect with nitrogen-doped carbon, resulting in a significantly improved catalyst optical property, enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity, and improved separation efficiency of photoexcited charges. Furthermore, the combined DRS and VB-XPS results elucidate the photocatalytic reaction mechanism. This study could provide potential strategies for environmental purification and energy conversion.

A ruthenium trinuclear polyazine complex was synthesized and subsequently immobilized throughcomplexation to a graphene oxide support containing phenanthroline ligands (GO-phen). The developedphotocatalyst was used for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol, using a 20 watt white coldLED flood light, in a dimethyl formamide–water mixture containing triethylamine as a reductivequencher. After 48 h illumination, the yield of methanol was found to be 3977.57 5.60 mmol gcat 1.The developed photocatalyst exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than graphene oxide, whichprovided a yield of 2201.40 8.76 mmol gcat 1. After the reaction, the catalyst was easily recovered andreused for four subsequent runs without a significant loss of catalytic activity and no leaching of themetal/ligand was detected during the reaction.

Hexamolybdenum (Mo6) cluster-based compounds namely Cs2Mo6Bri8Bra6and(TBA)2Mo6Bri8Bra6 (TBA = tetrabutylammonium) were immobilized on graphene oxide (GO)nanosheets by taking advantage of the high lability of the apical bromide ions withoxygen-functionalities of GO nanosheets. The loading of Mo6 clusters on GO nanosheetswas probed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and elementalmapping analyses. The developed GO-Cs2Mo6Bri8Brax and GO-(TBA)2Mo6Bri8Braxcomposites were then used as heterogeneous photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 undervisible light irradiation. After 24 h visible light illumination, the yield of methanol wasfound to be 1644 and 1294 lmol g 1 cat for GO-Cs2Mo6Bri8Brax and GO-(TBA)2Mo6Bri8Brax,respectively. The quantum yields of methanol by using GO-Cs2Mo6Bri8Brax andGO-(TBA)2Mo6Bri8Brax as catalysts with reference to Mo6 cluster units presented in 0.1 gamount of catalyst were found to be 0.015 and 0.011, respectively. The role of immobilizedMo6 clusters-based compounds on GO nanosheets is discussed to understand thephotocatalytic mechanism of CO2 reduction into methanol.

The synergy of pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions has been perceived as a crucial mechanism and central target for fulfilling green economic and social development in China. With the combination of the coupled coordination degree model (CCDM) and spatial autocorrelation analysis, we explored the spatio-temporal trends of coupling coordination degree (CCD) between pollution and carbon reductions in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) between 2011 and 2019, and the spatial Durbin model (SDM) was used to study the driving mechanisms behind CCD. The results demonstrate the coupling coordination degree demonstrated a staged upward trend with a heterogeneity of spatial distribution trend of "High-East, Low-West". Furthermore, the prominent spatial autocorrelation has led to the emergence of radiation effect of synergistic management in some central cities. The SDM indicated that the CCD are greatly influenced by multifarious social-economic factors such as opening-up level, population size, energy intensity, economic development, and technological advancement to varying degree. However, there was substantial discrepancy among the spatial spillover effects of contributory factors on CCD amongst cities of various synergistic categories. Based on regional disparities in synergy levels, this study proposes corresponding policy implications, including fostering cooperative governance, enhancing policy innovation, and promoting technological progress.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen-containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO2 and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO2 and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO3- and CO2 reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO2 and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO2 electrocatalyst derived from MIL-125-NH2, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO2 reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO2, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37 mmol･g-1･h-1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88% at -0.9 V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO2 level of 15%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in-situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.

Cobalt complexes have previously been reported to exhibit high faradaic efficiency in reducing CO2 to CO. Herein, we synthesized capsule-like cobalt–polypyridine diamine complexes [Co(L1)](BF4)2 (1) and [Co(L2) (CH3CN)](BF4)2 (2) as catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. Under catalytic conditions, complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence or absence of CH3OH as a proton source. Experimental and computational studies revealed that complexes 1 and 2 undergo two consecutive reversible one-electron reductions on the cobalt core, followed by the addition of CO2 to form a metallocarboxylate intermediate [CoII(L)–CO22−]0. This crucial reaction intermediate, which governs the catalytic cycle, was successfully detected using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). In situ Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) analysis showed that methanol can enhance the rate of carbon–oxygen bond cleavage of the metallocarboxylate intermediate. DFT studies on [CoII(L)–CO22−]0 have suggested that the doubly reduced species attacks CO2 on the C atom through the dz2 orbital, while the interaction with CO2 is further stabilized by the π interaction between the metal dxz or dxz orbital with p orbitals on the O atoms. Further reductions generate a metal carbonyl intermediate [CoI(L)–CO]+, which ultimately releases CO.

Active sites of molybdenum and tungsten enzymes, particularly mononuclear tungsten formate dehydrogenase (FDH) have been theoretically investigated towards their interaction with CO2. Obvious π interaction has been found between the 2e reduced metallodithiole moiety and the molecular CO2. This weak π bonding is predicated both at gas phase, noted as -6.0 kcal/mol and aqueous solvation level, -3.6 kcal/mol. Such interaction is not only limited to CO2, but also to the CO2 reduced product, i.e. formate, in the form of anion- π interaction, noted as -6.8 kcal/mol and -4.1 kcal/mol respectively in gas and aqueous solvation model. The Bailar twisted angles from 60o to 0o, governing structure preference of tungsten dithiolene from octahedron to triangle prism in their restricted structures, has been explored to evaluate such π in-terrelations with CO2 and formate. An octahedral structure with 3 kcal/mol energy lower is preferred over the triangle prismatic when such interactions are concerned.

Amorphous materials hold significant promise for enhancing electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) performance, but their intricate structures present challenges in understanding their behaviour. We present a computational investigation combining machine learning force fields and DFT calculations to explore amorphous copper (Cu) as a potential catalyst for the CO2R to C1 and C2 products. Our study reveals that amorphous Cu surfaces, compared to crystalline counterparts, offer a wider range of coordination sites, leading to a multitude of active centres for CO2 adsorption. Notably, some investigated surfaces spontaneously activate CO2, demonstrating their potential for efficient conversion. Furthermore, the intermediates of the CO2R on these surfaces exhibit enhanced stability, translating to lower overpotentials and improved selectivity. This work paves the way for further research and development in using amorphous Cu-based catalysts for sustainable CO2 conversion technologies, offering significant potential for mitigating climate change.

Cu-based materials have gathered significant attention as efficient electrocatalysts for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) to ethylene. CuO electrode was coated with Polyvinyl dichloride (PVDC) to finely tune its surface hydrophobicity, thereby effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while promoting CO2 conversion to ethylene. PVDC modification on modulating proton transfer and enhancing the stability of the electrocatalysts was investigated systematically by varying the coating material, coating amount, and coating order. The CuO-PVDC electrode with a 50 μg/cm2 PVDC coating demonstrated an optimal level of hydrophobicity where the water contact angle (WCA) increased from 94.8 ° to 122 °) and led to highly efficient production of ethylene (FEethylene increased from 32.2% to 41.4%) at a low potential of -0.89 V vs. RHE, while effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution. Comparative tests and calculations revealed that PVDC modification balances proton transfer and CO2 availability. Hence, PVDC regulates the degree of reduction in CuO, leading to an increased proportion of Cu ions on the surface of the CuO-PVDC electrode, which facilitates the C-C coupling process exhibiting long-lasting hydrophobic properties without sacrificing conductivity, which is a promising strategy for mitigating the environmental impact of CO2 and their efficient conversion to produce valuable chemicals.

Producing Cn products through electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is of great significance in addressing the global warming crisis. Organic-inorganic hybrid catalysts, characterized by precise and controllable active sites and metal-ligand synergistic interactions, can enhance the reaction activity and stability of Cu-based catalysts. Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT), a novel flexible aromatic Cu3 metal-organic π-cluster (Cu3-π cluster) was constructed, consisting of triple-atom active centers and pentalyne ligands. During the catalytic CO2RR process, the adsorption of H can promote the activation of CO2, this converts the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) into promoting CO2RR. Enhanced aromaticity of its cluster core is credited with stabilizing the coadsorption of H and CO2 (H*+CO2*), consequently lowering the reaction free energy of the CO2 activation process. Research has shown that Cu3-π cluster have high catalytic activity for electrocatalytic CO2 generation of C2H4. Considering the solvation effect, the limit potential of this reaction is -0.60 V. Furthermore, the reaction free energies suggest that the Cu3-π cluster is more inclined to yield C2H4(g) products via COCO* coupling. Moreover, the high CO coverage at the triple-atom active centers not only makes it more challenging for this cluster to adsorb H, but also reduces the energy barrier of the COCO* coupling reaction.In the entire reaction pathway of C2H4(g), there exhibits dynamic self-adaptive behavior in the bond lengths and bond angles of the three Cu atoms in the cluster core, leading to fluctuations in aromaticity. The flexibility and aromaticity changes in this structure enable the Cu3-π cluster to better stabilize intermediates. This work provides theoretical guidance for the application of metal-organic π-clusters, accelerates the screening of catalysts for CO2RR, and provides powerful theoretical guidance for the structure-activity relationships between aromaticity and catalytic activity.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO(2)RR) has emerged as a prospective and appealing strategy to realize carbon neutrality for manufacturing sustainable chemical products. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and stable devices has been demonstrated as effective approach to enhancing the conversion efficiency of CO(2)RR. In order to rationally design electrocatalysts and devices, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic structure evolution within catalysts and micro‐environment change around electrode interface, particularly under operation conditions, is indispensable. Synchrotron radiation has been recognized as a versatile characterization platform, garnering widespread attention owing to its high brightness, elevated flux, excellent directivity, strong polarization and exceptional stability. This review systematically introduces the applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR. By virtue of in situ/operando synchrotron analytical techniques, we also summarize relevant dynamic evolution processes from electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal lattice and devices, spanning scales from the angstrom to the micrometer. The merits and limitations of diverse synchrotron characterization techniques are summarized, and their applicable scenarios in CO(2)RR are further presented. On the basis of the state‐of‐the‐art fourth‐generation synchrotron facilities, a perspective for further deeper understanding of the CO(2)RR process using synchrotron analytical techniques is proposed.

A copper(II) complex grafted to nitrogen-doped graphene (GrN700–CuC) was synthesized and thendemonstrated as an efficient photocatalyst for CO2 reduction into methanol under visible light irradiationusing a DMF/water mixture. The chemical and microstructural features of GrN700–CuC nanosheets werestudied by FTIR, XPS, XRD and HRTEM analyses. Owing to its truly heterogeneous nature, GrN700–CuCcould be easily recovered after the photocatalytic reaction and showed efficient recyclability forsubsequent runs

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to multicarbon products has been widely recognized for Cu-based catalysts. However, the structural changes in Cu-based catalysts during the eCO2RR pose challenges to achieving an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship, thereby limiting catalyst development. Herein, we employ constant-potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu-N-C single-atom catalysts into clusters under eCO2RR conditions. Systematic constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu-(CO)x moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO2RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu2+ concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C2 products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu-based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C2 products during the eCO2RR.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems harness light absorption to initiate chemical reactions, while electrochemical reactions facilitate the conversion of reactants into desired products, ensuring more efficient and sustainable energy conversion in PECs. Central to optimizing the performance of PECs was the pivotal role played by interface engineering. This intricate process involved manipulating material interfaces at the atomic or nanoscale to enhance charge transfer, improve catalytic activity, and address limitations associated with bulk materials. The careful tuning of factors such as band gap, surface energy, crystallinity, defect characteristics, and structural attributes through interface engineering led to superior catalytic efficiency. Specifically, interface engineering significantly enhanced the efficiency of semiconductor-based PECs. Engineers strategically designed heterojunctions and manipulated catalyst surface properties to optimize the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers, minimizing recombination losses and improving performance overall. In this review, we categorized our discussion into five sections focusing on PECs and interface engineering, providing valuable insights into recent research trends. Overall, the synergy between PECs and interface engineering holds tremendous promise for advancing renewable energy technologies and addressing environmental challenges by offering innovative solutions for sustainable energy conversion and storage.

Cu-based electrodes have been at the forefront of research on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 for several decades owing to their ability to generate multi-carbon products. Various innovative approaches, including alloying, doping, and surface modification, have been used to develop catalysts with superior selectivity, activity, and durability. Despite these developments, the commercialization of Cu-based electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction remains elusive. This review provides comprehensive insights into catalyst design and discusses methodologies using in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy for the validation of newly designed catalysts, particularly those developed considering the information presented herein.

The exhaust gases in production of burnt clay bricks is responsible for greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission which increase the carbon footprint in the ecosystem. Here, we report carbon emission and thermal performance based evaluation of 8 ft. × 9 ft. × 8 ft. building. The bricks used in building construction are manufactured from fly ash, agro-forestry wastes, construction & demolition wastes (C&D), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) using NaOH as activator in order to provide compressive strength in the range of 3-6 MPa with ambient curing at 30 °C for 28 days. Life cycle analysis (LCA) reveals the total CO2 emission for fly ash and burnt clay bricks estimated to be 43.28 gCO2 and 290 gCO2 per brick, respectively. Considering the current scenario, by replacing 1-2% of brunt clay bricks with agro-forestry waste, C&D waste based fly ash bricks can potentially reduce 0.5-1.5 million tons of CO2 emission annually. The embodied energy calculation shows fly ash based bricks consumes 10-15 times less energy as compared to burnt clay bricks. Thermal paremeters viz., U-value (0.5-1.2 W/m2K), thermal conductivity (0.4-0.5 W/mK) show adequate insulation of agro-forestry waste based fly ash bricks highlighting its importance of thermal comfort, CO2 reduction along with sustainable and eco-friendly construction practices.

Three different heterojunctions, BiOBr/g-C3N4, Bi/g-C3N4, and BiOBr/g-C3N4@Bi modified with carbon vacancies and/or oxygen vacancies, were first synthesized via a facile solvothermal approach by adjusting the ratio of Bi(NO3)3 · 5H2O with ethylene glycol (EG). The as-prepared heterojunctions were characterized by various modern analytical instruments, and their visible-light photocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion was evaluated. Our findings demonstrate that the ternary photocatalyst BiOBr/g-C3N4@Bi exhibits better activity toward visible-light-driven CO2 reduction than pristine g-C3N4 and its binary counterparts without hole scavengers, and its maximum CO yield (7.4 μmol · h−1 · g−1) is approximately four 4 times that of pure g-C3N4. This is attributed to the VO and VC defects, which enhance the photon absorption capacity. On the other hand, the g-C3N4 matrix exhibits strong interfacial interactions with BiOBr and metallic Bi, leading to an increase in the separation efficiency of the photoinduced carriers. In other words, the strong interfacial interactions among g-C3N4, BiOBr and metallic Bi, the vacancy defects VO and VC, and the metallic Bi particles cooperate to significantly improve the separation and transportation of the photoexcited charge carriers, thereby augmenting the CO2 photoreduction activity of the BiOBr/g-C3N4@Bi ternary heterojunction in the absence of a sacrificial agent. This approach based on facile solvothermal treatment has promising potential in fabricating highly efficient photocatalysts suitable for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction.

Abstract Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics in tropical semi-arid reservoirs during a prolonged drought period as well as to test if the trophic state affects the CO2 saturation. Methods This study was performed in four reservoirs located in the tropical semi-arid region in the northeast of Brazil. All samplings were performed between 9 and 12 am using a Van Dorn Bottle. Samples for partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2 ) measurements were taken in the sub-surface as well as samples for total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a. Correlation analysis and linear regression were used to detect relations among the calculated pCO2, water volume and chlorophyll-a. Results The water level reduction due to atypical droughts caused chlorophyll-a concentrations to increase, which in turn, led to CO2 reduction in the water. However, CO2 concentrations were very variable and an alternation between CO2 sub-saturation and super-saturation conditions was observed. This paper showed that water volume and chlorophyll-a were important regulators of CO2 in the water, as well as important carbon balance predictors in the tropical semiarid reservoirs. Conclusions The results of this paper indicate that the eutrophication allied to drastic water level reductions lead to a tendency of autotrophic metabolism of these systems.

The chemical transformations of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) greenhouse gases typically have high energy barriers. Here we present an approach of strategic coupling of CH4 oxidation and CO2 reduction in a switched microbial process governed by redox cycling of iron minerals under temperate conditions. The presence of iron minerals leads to an obvious enhancement of carbon fixation, with the minerals acting as the electron acceptor for CH4 oxidation and the electron donor for CO2 reduction, facilitated by changes in the mineral structure. The electron flow between the two functionally active microbial consortia is tracked through electrochemistry, and the energy metabolism in these consortia is predicted at the genetic level. This study offers a promising strategy for the removal of CH4 and CO2 in the natural environment and proposes an engineering technique for the utilization of major greenhouse gases.

Abstract Digital technology, including advancements in artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and data analytics, has the potential to revolutionize tackling the problem of carbon dioxide emissions and achieving sustainable development. The paper aims at checking the nature of the impact of digital technology development on carbon dioxide reduction for the EU countries in 2013–2020. The study applies the following methods: entropy methods, panel‐corrected standard error, and feasible generalized least squares. The digital technology development index enabled the classification of all the EU countries into two distinct groups: High Digital Technology Development and Moderate/Lower Digital Technology Development. The findings confirm that digital technology development has a significant impact on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. In the first stage, the growth of digital technology causes a faster decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. However, beyond a certain threshold, the further improvement of digital technology results in diminishing marginal benefits of CO2 emissions reduction. Thus, the EU government should catalyze the extension of digital technologies among all sectors and levels. In addition, it requires enhancing digital literacy of the society and local authorities.

ABSTRACT The transportation sector is responsible for a portion of the global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). Scientific studies published on CO2 emissions by passenger transport systems treat basically results involving only the emissions related to fuel consumption of cars and buses. As for subways, usually emissions related to the generation of electrical energy needed to provide the traction force of the trains are considered. No specific or standardized publications on other approaches to calculate emissions for subways were identified. Thus, this study aims to provide a scientific contribution to the general study of CO2 emissions by subways, conceptually defining five approaches of calculations and conducting a comparative analysis of CO2 emissions by cars, buses and subways. The result of this research allowed to quantify the actual contribution of subways on the reduction of total emissions from the transportation sector. In the traction power of trains approach, it was concluded that the subways of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro emit 63.5 times less than cars and 8 times less than buses.

Oxide-derived (OD) metals have been demonstrated as a kind of promising catalyst with superior catalytic activity for carbon dioxide electroreduction. Here we fabricate OD nanoporous silver by a simple, cost-effective electrochemical oxidation–reduction treatment, which enables reducing carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide with a Faradaic efficiency of 87% at −0.8 V vs RHE, significantly higher than that of untreated silver foil under the same conditions. Electron backscattered diffraction analysis reveals that there is a distinct grain refining during the initial CO2 electrochemical reduction from Ag oxide to OD-Ag. Experiment results indicated that the catalytic activity and selectivity are closely linked to the grain boundary and nanoporous structure on the surface, which has also been proven by theoretical calculation. However, after a long catalysis time (12 h), it was found that the surface grain coarsened and the thickness of the nanostructured layer reduced, resulting in the deactivation of the OD-Ag electrode. A dissolution–redeposition mechanism was proposed to govern the degradation of OD-Ag. The catalytic activity can be regenerated again by applying electrochemical oxidation–reduction treatment, which can increase the thickness of the porous layer and electrochemical active surface area significantly.

Green innovation (GI) plays a vital role in mitigating urban carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fostering sustainable development in China. This study examines the impact of GI on CO2 emissions, underscoring its significance for environmental sustainability. The analysis of data from 253 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2020 shows a transition in GI from a "multipoint" sporadic pattern to a "clustered" aggregation, indicative of significant polarization. Concurrently, a converging trend in the CO2 emissions kernel density curve reflects the initial success of carbon reduction initiatives, demonstrating a notable "high in the north and low in the south" spatial disparity. Critically, the findings reveal that GI induces significant spatial spillover effects, reducing CO2 emissions not only locally but also in adjacent areas. The mediation analysis reveals that the level of infrastructure development acts as a masking factor, suggesting that despite infrastructure expansion potentially escalating CO2 emissions, alignment with GI principles steers its environmental impact towards a positive direction. Additionally, informatization's modest mediating role suggests that its enhancement, driven by GI, further mitigates CO2 emissions through improved resource efficiency. These insights highlight the importance of integrating GI into urban policy frameworks, emphasizing its role in environmental management and CO2 emission reduction.

Abstract The energy issue has significant meaning in the context of the pursuit of sustainable development, being an essential condition to find alternative ways to replace the use of fossil fuels. The state of Ceará has potential for the use of renewable energy, especially wind and solar. The objective of this paper is to analyze the contribution of the distributed generation of photovoltaic systems, connected to the grid, which provide the reduction of CO2 emissions in the state of Ceará. Was used installed power information by National Electric Energy Agency (NEEA) and the data of generated energy and the carbon dioxide emissions avoided were estimated from the use of Distributed Generation (DG) by solar photovoltaic source. This research made possible the knowledge of DG from solar photovoltaic source in the Ceará, generating alternatives to subsidize the decision making of incentives, through governmental plans and programs, for the implantation of photovoltaic systems of micro and mini-generation of energy, which contribute to the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases (GG) in the atmosphere.

Abstract Concrete is one of the most widely used materials in the Brazilian construction industry. This widespread use is mainly due to the easiness of implementation and adaptation to various forms. The reduction of the consumption of materials involved in the production of concrete is one way to achieve more sustainable construction. These reductions, if evaluated taking into account also the impacts that the production generates in the environment, are likely to enhance or redirect the conclusions or decisions to be made regarding the quest for greater environmental sustainability. With this objective in mind, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the environmental impacts of the production of concrete were evaluated, considering the extraction and production of materials (binder, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates and steel) used in the northern region of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. One of the conclusions of the study was that lower strength concrete produces lower CO2emissions, and that the influence of transport emissions is significant due to the long distances that most of the raw materials must cover.

Conversion of CO2 to hard carbon is an interesting technology for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Recently, it was shown that CeO2 can selectively catalyze this reaction, but we still lack information regarding the reaction mechanism. Using density functional theory modeling, we explore possible reaction mechanisms that allow for the polymerization of CO2. According to our computations, the reaction is initialized by the adsorption of CO2 in an oxygen vacancy. Owing to the rich defect chemistry of ceria, a large number of suitable sites are available at the surface. C–C bond formation is achieved through an aldol condensation-type mechanism which comprises the electrochemical elimination of water to form a carbene. This carbene then performs a nucleophilic attack on CO2. The reaction mechanism possesses significant similarities to the corresponding reactions in synthetic organic chemistry. Since the mechanism is completely generic, it allows for all relevant steps of the formation of hard carbon like chain growth, chain linkage, and the formation of side chains or aromatic rings. Surprisingly, ceria mainly serves as an anchor for CO2 in an oxygen vacancy, while all other subsequent reaction steps are almost completely independent from the catalyst. These insights are important for the development of novel catalysts for CO2 reduction and may also lead to new reactions for the electrosynthesis of organic molecules.

The transition from conventional soil treatment technology to zero treatment technology contributes to an increase in carbon sequestration (Sorg) in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into the soil and, as a result, a reduction in the adverse effects of the greenhouse effect on the ecological state of the environment. The effectiveness of the application of zero tillage is to a greater or lesser extent due to specific agro-climatic conditions, crop rotation systems, fertilizers and plant protection, soil quality and stability. The influence of zero tillage on the dynamics of sorghum reserves and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O, CH4) in the agro-climatic conditions of crop production (LLC “Orlovka AIC”, Samara region) was investigated. The study was conducted on agrochernozem heavy loam in September–November 2021 in conditions of an abnormally arid growing season and high summer temperatures. On plots with zero tillage, plant residues were received: 268–1720 kg С/ha, 3–66 kg N, 0.2–7.7 kg P and 12–44 kg K/ha. Based on the results obtained, recommendations are proposed for further improving the efficiency of zero tillage technology due, firstly, to reducing its adverse effect on the density of soil composition, and, secondly, taking into account the influence of underlying parent rocks and relief on water erosion of soil and redistribution of granulometric fractions of soil in the agricultural landscape, which will allow using this technology according to principles of adaptive landscape farming.

Carbon sequestration and conservation is one of the important ecosystem functions of the forest. The task of modern science is to explore the possibilities of enhancing this function in order to counter the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Sustainable and climate smart forestry, in particular the use of mineral fertilizers, are an effective way to increase the productivity of forests and enhance their carbon-sequestration capacity. This review aims to summarize the experience of using mineral fertilizers in boreal and temperate forests. It is concluded that fertilization should be selective, and it is most effective in combination with other forest management operations. A significant effect is observed on sites with medium-productivity conditions on sites with with sufficient, but not excessive moisture, at the age of the maximum current increment of biomass or commercial wood (40–70 years for coniferous species). The most common (inexpensive, but effective) are N-fertilizers, but it is necessary to control the content of other nutrients, in particular P, K and B. We have collected and published a database of long-term experiments on the application of mineral fertilizers. Experiments have shown that the absorption of 1 t of CO2-eq. requires from 5.6 to 10.3 kg (on average 7.2) of nitrogen. The results of a fertilizer application project should be compared against the baseline (without fertilizer application), and the difference can be counted in emission reduction units.

For a significant reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, it is assumed that hydrogen (H2) will substitute natural gas in the upcoming years. Therefore, the operational limitations of the existing burner technology must be evaluated when the hydrogen content in the fuel is increased. To investigate the H2-readiness of typical burners, numerical simulations and experimental investigations were carried out in test facilities and in an industrial tunnel kiln system in the brick and tile industry. The results of the examination of the existing conventional burner for natural gas and an additive manufactured dual-fuel burner for natural gas and H2 will be presented. The investigations carried out so far suggest that it is possible to use H2 in addition to natural gas as a fuel gas for tunnel kilns in the brick and tile industry. Ongoing investigations by means of simulations and measurements of the industrial tunnel kiln will provide further insights into this.

Natural gas is considered one of the most appealing fossil fuels in the world's energy supply nowadays, and it is primarily recognized as a clean energy source. However, the removal of pollutants from NG, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), requires complex treatment strategies, significantly influencing its production. Consequently, the appealing properties of ionic liquids (ILs) make them interesting eco-friendly candidates for capturing CO2 from natural gas. In this work, a series of novel functionalized ILs (IL-Br, IL-BF4, and IL-PF6) were synthesized and characterized via a variety of analysis tools, including FT-IR, NMR, and thermal gravimetric analysis. Highly efficient capture of CO2 from natural gas was investigated at ambient temperature and was successfully achieved with the synthesized ILs. IL-PF6 recorded the highest capture CO2 capacity from the natural gas stream, which reached up to 94 % in only 5 min as a retention time. The experimental results revealed that each gram of IL-PF6, IL-BF4, and IL-Br could capture 2.02, 1.23, and 1.18 mmol of CO2, respectively. The used ILs were reused three times without any significant reduction in their capturing performance, which enhances their potential for eco-friendly and cost-saving issues. The CO2 capture efficiency of the used ILs was verified theoretically using the DFT method and Monte Carlo simulations (MCs). The quantum study matches with the experimental results, which confirmed the CO2 capture efficiency in the order of IL-PF6 > IL-BF4 > IL-Br.

The most effective way of managing climate change is through mitigation— anthropogenic intervention to reduce the anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. Mitigation is almost universally measured by emissions reduction of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), and, to a lesser extent, other gases. This entry looks at mitigation efforts, which have mostly taken the form of international treaties, such as the Paris Agreement and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas sources and emissions and enhance greenhouse gas sinks. While the Paris Agreement has fallen short in efforts to prompt nations to reduce emissions, international treaties have been a useful tool in climate policy implementation as they leverage "shame" tactics if nations fail to comply. So far, nation-states, companies, leaders, and individual citizens and consumers have failed to achieve the collective action needed to prioritize mitigation.

ABSTRACT: Empty elliptical vesicles are observed in outcrops of Barremian very fine clayey sandstone to siltstone lacustrine slurry deposits of the Pitanga Member (Maracangalha Formation), exposed in the Maré Island, Southern Recôncavo Basin, Brazil. These sedimentary features have been traditionally interpreted as water escape structures triggered by the diapirism of the underlying shales of the Candeias Formation. This work proposes that vesicles were generated during massive gas hydrate dissociation as a result of tectonic activity in a paleolake system. Tectonic uplift would have triggered both the reduction of the confining pressure as well as an increase in lake bottom temperature, resulting in the instability of gas hydrate and causing intense release of both methane - or carbon dioxide (CO2) - and water. On one hand, this proposal has a strong impact on paleoenvironmental interpretations, giving support to the current hypothesis that rocks related to the Pitanga Member would have been deposited under water columns deep enough for gas hydrate formation and subsequent dissociation. On the other hand, it provides new insights on the genesis of fluid escape structures in sedimentary rocks, both lacustrine and marine, providing a paleobathymetric indicator.

Abstract: The objective of this work was to evaluate the partial replacement of corn grains by soybean hulls, in high-grain diets, and its effect on the feeding behavior and ruminal fermentation parameters of feedlot sheep. Eight rumen-cannulated crossbred sheep were assigned to four treatment groups composed of a control, to fed a diet of 50% corn silage and 50% concentrate, and to three groups fed high-grain diets, as follows: 85% corn (Diet85), 75% corn plus 10% soybean hulls (Diet75), and 65% corn plus 20% soybean hulls (Diet65). High-grain diets reduced rumination time and provided a higher degradation of feed dry matter, a higher-propionic acid concentration, a lower-acetic acid concentration, a lower methane and carbon dioxide gas production, and a lower ruminal pH value. Diet65, with 20% soybean hulls, promoted an increase in the acetic acid proportion, with a reduction in the CO2:CH4 ratio. At the end of in vitro incubation, the pH value was higher for the control diet, and it was lower for Diet85. The inclusion of soybean hulls does not change methane production and dry matter degradation, and it can be used to substitute up to 20% of corn grain in high-grain diets.

In recent years, a number of technologies have emerged to purify biogas into biomethane. This purification entails a reduction in the concentration of polluting gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide to increase the content of methane. In this study, we used a microalgal cultivation technology to treat and purify biogas produced from organic waste from the swine industry to obtain ready-to-use biomethane. For cultivation and purification, two 22.2 m3 open-pond photobioreactors coupled with an absorption-desorption column system were set up in San Juan de los Lagos, Mexico. Several recirculation liquid/biogas ratios (L/G) were tested to obtain the highest removal efficiencies; other parameters, such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and biomass growth, were measured. The most efficient L/Gs were 1.6 and 2.5, resulting in a treated biogas effluent with a composition of 6.8%vol and 6.6%vol in CO2, respectively, and removal efficiencies for H2S up to 98.9%, as well as maintaining O2 contamination values of less than 2%vol. We found that pH greatly determines CO2 removal, more so than L/G, during cultivation because of its participation in the photosynthetic process of microalgae and its ability to vary pH when solubilized due to its acidic nature. DO, and temperature oscillated as expected from the light-dark natural cycles of photosynthesis and the time of day, respectively. Biomass growth varied with CO2 and nutrient feeding as well as reactor harvesting; however, the trend remained primed for growth.

Combustion power plants emit carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a major contributor to climate change. Direct emissions measurement is cost-prohibitive globally, while reporting varies in detail, latency, and granularity. To fill this gap and greatly increase the number of power plants worldwide with independent emissions monitoring, we developed and applied machine learning (ML) models using power plant water vapor plumes as proxy signals to estimate electric power generation and CO2 emissions using Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope imagery. Our ML models estimated power plant activity on each image snapshot, then an aggregation model predicted plant utilization over a 30-day period. Lastly, emission factors specific to region, fuel, and plant technology were used to convert the estimated electricity generation into CO2 emissions. Models were trained with reported hourly electricity generation data in the US, Europe, and Australia and were validated with additional generation and emissions data from the US, Europe, Australia, Türkiye, and India. All results with sufficiently large sample sizes indicate that our models outperformed the baseline approaches. In validating our model results against available generation and emissions reported data, we calculated the root mean square error as 1.75 TWh (236 plants across 17 countries over 4 years) and 2.18 Mt CO2 (207 plants across 17 countries over 4 years), respectively. Ultimately, we applied our ML method to plants that constitute 32% of global power plant CO2 emissions, as estimated by Climate TRACE, averaged over the period 2015–2022. This dataset is the most comprehensive independent and free-of-cost global power plant point-source emissions monitoring system currently known to the authors and is made freely available to the public to support global emissions reduction.

Recent ground-based observations of Venus have detected a single spectral feature consistent with phosphine (PH3) in the middle atmosphere, a gas which has been suggested as a biosignature on rocky planets. The presence of PH3 in the oxidized atmosphere of Venus has not yet been explained by any abiotic process. However, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical research published in previous works demonstrated a photochemical origin of another potential biosignature—the hydride methane—from carbon dioxide over acidic mineral surfaces on Mars. The production of methane includes formation of the HC · O radical. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict an energetically plausible reaction network leading to PH3, involving either HC · O or H· radicals. We suggest that, similarly to the photochemical formation of methane over acidic minerals already discussed for Mars, the origin of PH3 in Venus' atmosphere could be explained by radical chemistry starting with the reaction of ·PO with HC·O, the latter being produced by reduction of CO2 over acidic dust in upper atmospheric layers of Venus by ultraviolet radiation. HPO, H2P·O, and H3P·OH have been identified as key intermediate species in our model pathway for phosphine synthesis.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from U.S. power plants are independently reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Differences between the CAMD and EIA emission tallies show that the amount of CO2 produced by an individual power plant is less certain than might be imagined or desired. These differences are attributed to systematic error and random measurement error. Random error cannot be retroactively corrected, whereas systematic error can be corrected where relevant data are available. Accordingly, this study identified and, where possible, corrected systematic error affecting the CAMD and EIA CO2 emission tallies for 1065 power plants that emitted more than 25,000 tons of CO2 during 2013. The EIA tallies were corrected by accounting for emission factor error, acid-gas sorbent consumption, and combustion of biogenic fuel. The CAMD tallies were likewise corrected by accounting for unreported unit emissions. It was not possible to objectively correct systematic error affecting about 11% of the power plants, and subjective corrections were not attempted. At these plants, the CAMD and EIA emission tallies sometimes differed by more than 20% due to missing unit error, plant identification error, temporal measurement error, or inferred reporting error. Comparisons of the CAMD and EIA emission tallies before and after correction for systematic error show the effectiveness of these corrections. The comparisons also show the persistence of random measurement error. Implications: Understanding the uncertainty of CO2 emission tallies for USA power plants might inform emission inventories, atmospheric flow models or inversions, and emission reduction policies. Knowing the cause and size of measurement errors that contribute to this uncertainty might also help to identify ways to improve the measurement methods and reporting protocols that these CO2 emission tallies are based on.

This study assessed the real-world emissions from two heavy-duty natural gas vehicles certified to the optional 0.02 g/bhp-hr nitrogen oxides (NOx) standard and one diesel vehicle equipped with diesel particulate filter (DPF) to control particulate matter (PM) mass emissions and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to control NOx emissions. Testing was performed on four different routes typical of goods movement in the greater South Coast Air Basin using a mobile emissions laboratory equipped with a constant volume sampling (CVS) system. This study emphasized the characterization of solid particle number (SPN) and total particle number (TPN) emissions, carbonyl compounds, as well as the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Results showed that SPN and TPN emissions were several orders of magnitude higher for the natural gas vehicles compared to those of the DPF-equipped diesel vehicle. Natural gas vehicles under motoring conditions were found to have a strong nucleation mode of ultrafine particles below 23 nm. PM mass chemical speciation of metals and trace elements indicated that the source of PM mass from natural gas vehicles was lubricant oil combustion. The low molecular weight formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein were the predominant aldehydes in the exhaust of all vehicles, with the formaldehyde emissions below the emissions limits for both diesel vehicles and natural gas vehicles. Emissions of CO2 were lower for the natural gas vehicles, as a result of the lower carbon-to-hydrogen (C/H) molar ratio of natural gas compared to diesel fuel. Similarly, the CO2 equivalent emissions for the natural gas vehicles were about 20% lower than those of the diesel vehicle. CH4 emissions were the dominant fraction of total hydrocarbons for the natural gas vehicles, while for the diesel vehicle CH4 concentrations were negligible. N2O emissions were very low for the natural gas vehicles, whereas N2O formation was favored in the SCR-equipped diesel vehicle.

Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to formate is economically beneficial but suffers from poor selectivity and high overpotential. Herein, enriched microcrystalline copper oxide is introduced on the surface of indium-based metal-organic frameworks. Benefiting from the CuO (111) microcrystalline shell and formed catalytic active In-Cu interfaces, the obtained MIL-68(In)/CuO heterostructure display excellent CO2RR to formate with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) as high as 89.7% at low potential of only -0.7 V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Significantly, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell based on MIL-68(In)/CuO exhibit a remarkable current density of 640.3 mA cm-2 at 3.1 V and can be stably operated for 180 h at 2.7 V with a current density of 200 mA cm-2. The ex/in situ electrochemical investigations reveal that the introduction of CuO increases the formation rate of the carbon dioxide reduction intermediate *HCOO- and inhibits the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. This work not only provides an in-depth study of the mechanism of the CO2RR pathways on In/Cu composite catalyst but also offers an effective strategy for the interface design of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction.

If the temperature is changed to 210K and 350K, that is, the value in B7 is changed to 210 and 350, the results would be 16.04% and 29.55% in N19, which is basically the same as the original 15-30%, indicating that the data is well restored according to the figures, and the calculation result of transmittance is correct. 3. There are three Plantwo of which are functions of corresponding wavelengths, and the relatick laws, onship between the two functions is a constant. Transmittance rate is a ratio, and both the numerator and denominator can present the constant outside the sum function for approximate division, so there is no difference between the results of choosing either of the two functions. 4. The restoring process of the figure of “Radiation Transmitted by the Atmosphere” is as follows: a. Grid the picture; b. Obtain the function of the number of grids corresponding to the horizontal coordinates: file:///C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml12784\wps1.png, where n is the number of squares in the horizontal coordinates; c.

Find the 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 ......, 13.9, 14 μm in the wavelength, and check the corresponding number of horizontal coordinate squares n; e. Use the number of squares n in the “Total Absorption and Scattering” to find the corresponding atmospheric absorption rate r for that wavelength; f. Organize the data and list the 1.3 to 14 μm at the step length of 0.1 μm, and list the corresponding absorption rate r; g. Find the atmospheric transmission rate 1-r for wavelengths from 1.3 to 14 μm at the step length of 0.1 μm. Then the calculation would be easier. 5. Main radiation bands of CO2: 2.68-2.8 μm, 4.25-4.45 μm, 13-17 μm. Main radiation bands of H2O: 2.55-2.84 μm, 5.6-7.6 μm, 12-30 μm, all in the “Total Absorption and Scattering” atmospheric absorption range of infrared radiation. The calculation of transmission rate is not affected by the infrared radiation of CO2 and H2O. 6. According to the figure of “Radiation Transmitted by the Atmosphere”, the wavelength range of CO2 absorption of infrared radiation is limited. Although the atmospheric pressure of Hesperus is 96 atmospheres and the concentration of CO2 is 96.5%, CO2 has limited ability to absorb infrared radiation. The high temperatures on the surface of Venus cannot be explained only by the greenhouse effect. When calculating the atmospheric transmission rate of infrared radiation of Hesperus, the effect of carbon dioxide on the spectral absorption can be excluded by removing the 13-14 μm band from the calculation. 7. There is no independent H2CO3 in nature, which is the reason for the assumption that H2O collides with CO2 molecules without additional absorption of infrared radiation.

1. Excel is used to calculate the atmospheric transmission rate of infrared radiation. The worksheet “Earth” is the calculation of the transmission rate on the Earth and the worksheet “Hesperus” is the calculation of the transmission rate on Hesperus.

Although the atmospheric pressure of Hesperus is 96 atmospheres and the concentration of CO2 is 96.5%, CO2 has limited ability to absorb infrared radiation. The high temperatures on the surface of Venus cannot be explained only by the greenhouse effect. When calculating the atmospheric transmission rate of infrared radiation of Hesperus, the effect of carbon dioxide on the spectral absorption can be excluded by removing the 13-14 μm band from the calculation. 7. There is no independent H2CO3 in nature, which is the reason for the assumption that H2O collides with CO2 molecules without additional absorption of infrared radiation.

Emissions reduction and greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere are both necessary to achieve net-zero emissions and limit climate change.1 There is thus a need for improved sorbents for the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process known as direct air capture. In particular, low-cost materials that can be regenerated at low temperatures would overcome the limitations of current technologies. In this work, we introduce a new class of designer sorbent materials known as “charged-sorbents”. These materials are prepared through a battery-like charging process which accumulates ions in the pores of low-cost activated carbons, with the inserted ions then serving as adsorption sites for carbon dioxide adsorption. We use our charging process to accumulate reactive hydroxide ions in the pores of a carbon electrode, and find that the resulting sorbent material can rapidly capture carbon dioxide from ambient air via (bi)carbonate formation. Unlike traditional bulk carbonates, charged-sorbent regeneration can be achieved at low temperatures (90-100 ºC), and the sorbent's conductive nature permits direct Joule heating regeneration2,3 using renewable electricity. Given their highly tailorable pore environments and low cost, we anticipate that charged-sorbents will find numerous potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis, and beyond.

ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of controlled atmosphere storage on quality of native and cultivated yerba mate produced in Arvorezinha (RS) and São Mateus do Sul (PR) after 0, 3, 6 and 12 months of storage under ambient conditions, low oxygen (1.0 kPa) and high carbon dioxide (3.0 kPa) partial pressures. Total chlorophyll concentration reduced over the storage period regardless of the atmosphere condition, form of cultivation and production region. Total carotenoids, regardless of the form and place of cultivation, decreased until three months of storage under 1.0 kPa O2. Although, the O2 reduction to 1.0 kPa maintains greener color and higher chlorophyll concentration after 12 months of storage. High carbon dioxide partial pressures (3.0 kPa) in the storage chamber increases the polyphenol concentration until six months of storage. The raw material originated from São Mateus do Sul (PR) has higher chlorophyll concentration and greener color, resulting in greater storage potential.

In eutrophic lakes, the proliferating algae sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and store it in the form of biomass organic carbon (OC). The high biodegradability of this endogenous OC, however, can generate anaerobic conditions and facilitate methane (CH4) production. This process of sequestered CO2 to higher radiative forcing CH4 has the potential to add CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq) to the atmosphere. This study conducted the first analysis of carbon budgets associated with algae in eutrophic lakes from a life cycle perspective and predicted the impact of future climate warming and nutrient reduction on this effect using machine learning.

Abstract Background Carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere day by day due to diverse sources increasing global warming. Meeting the energy demands of the expanding human population, large-scale carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is produced. Effective reduction of CO 2 emissions from the energy sector and others through optimization is required to reduce global warming. Model: This paper presents a mathematical model that captures the dynamic relationship between carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, human population dynamics, energy use, and the progression of global warming as distinct sections. Real-time data from these sections are utilized to adjust model parameters. Methodology: Firstly, the stability analysis of the proposed model is examined to determine whether solutions remain bounded or converge to specific states on the equilibrium points. Secondly, sensitivity analysis of the model is investigated and determines the behavior of the dynamic system on changes in parameters. Lastly, the optimization technique is applied to the model to reduce global warming by optimizing the level of CO 2 emission from the energy sector. Results Through optimization, results show that global warming is majorly reduced when the CO 2 emission from the energy sector is reduced. Novelty: The thorough analysis and validation of the proposed model offer valuable insights for devising effective strategies to mitigate climate change.

Micronutrient malnutrition is widespread and is linked with diets low in fruit and vegetables. However, during the twentieth century, declines in essential minerals in fruits and vegetables were reported in the UK and elsewhere. A new analysis of long-term trends of the mineral content of fruits and vegetables from three editions of the UK’s Composition of Foods Tables (1940, 1991 and 2019) was undertaken. All elements except P declined in concentrations between 1940 and 2019 – the greatest overall reductions during this 80-year period were Na (52%), Fe (50%), Cu (49%) and Mg (10%); water content increased (1%). There could be many reasons for these reductions, including changes in crop varieties and agronomic factors associated with the industrialisation of agriculture. Increases in carbon dioxide could also play a role. We call for a thorough investigation of these reductions and steps to be taken to address the causes that could contribute to global malnutrition.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Soot and carbon dioxide released from internal combustion engines became the key issues when using fossil fuels. Ammonia and hydrogen having zero-carbon species can reduce carbon-related emissions and enhance the reliance on renewable fuels. A comparative study of ammonia and hydrogen impact on combustion and emission characteristics of iso-octane flame was performed under different combustion conditions. Arrhenius equation, soot surface reactions, and modified kinetic mechanism were used to study the flame growth, soot nucleation, and surface growth rates. The results show that hydrogen increased the temperature about 20.74 K and 59.30 K, whereas ammonia reduced it about 82.17 K and 66.03 K at premixed and counterflow conditions, respectively. The flame speed of iso-octane was increased 43.83 cm/s by hydrogen and decreased 34.36 cm/s by ammonia. A reduction in CH<sub>2</sub>O caused a reduction in CO and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Ammonia impact on CO reduction was stronger than hydrogen under premixed and counterflow flame conditions. In contrast, a higher reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emission was noticed when adding hydrogen instead of ammonia adopting counterflow flame conditions. The diluted fuel reduced the fraction of small-chain hydrocarbon species in iso-octane combustion, resulting in a reduction of the soot precursors, soot particle number density, and soot volume fractions. NO emission decreased in premixed flame and increased in counterflow flame when adding hydrogen. Ammonia enhanced NO emissions, and its impact was greater on counterflow flame rather than premixed combustion. The current study suggested that ammonia dilution in iso-octane should be ≤ 50% because a higher reduction in soot and carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved with a small reduction in burning velocity and increment in NO emission. However, the hydrogen contents &gt; 50% in iso-octane fuel significantly reduced the emission and increased the burning velocity.</div></div>

Summary Carbon dioxide is an abundant carbon resource for chemical and fuel synthesis. Formic acid, vital for hydrogen storage, has numerous applications. Covalent organic frameworks are a unique class of materials composed of interconnected organic building blocks through covalent bonds. They possess porosity and functional groups, making them suitable for creating supported metallic catalysts. In this study, we present a strategy that utilizes covalent organic frameworks with diverse structures and chemical compositions to enhance carbon dioxide hydrogenation to formic acid at low temperatures. This enhancement arises from both high density of single-atom ruthenium sites and their intrinsic activity. Operando X-ray absorption and catalytic tests demonstrate that the concentration of nitrogen functional groups affects the intrinsic single-site ruthenium activity, whereas the impact of oxygen-containing groups is minor. Catalyst stability is attributed to the ability of single atoms to resist reduction to metallic state. This strategy has broad applicability for various covalent organic framework-supported single-atom catalysts.

ABSTRACT Aiming to evaluate different wastewaters in the anaerobic co-digestion (ACoD) of hatchery wastes, a batch test was conducted in bench horizontal digesters. At the end of the process, the potential production of biogas and methane was calculated as well as the chemical composition (macro- and micronutrients) of the effluent and the concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide gas at 60 days. The monitoring of the process included observations of the reduction of the organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, and total (TS) and volatile solids (VS), as well as the variation of pH and electrical conductivity (EC). The results showed that the mixing between the hatchery fresh waste and swine wastewater (T4) and among fresh hatchery waste, water from the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery and swine wastewater (T5) represent significant sources of renewable energy and thereby greater potential for biogas production (192.50 and 205.0 L biogas per kg of VS added to T4 and T5, respectively). The average concentration of methane in the biogas varied from 72 to 77% among the treatments. For all treatments, reductions were observed in TS and VS and increases in pH and EC. It was concluded that the energy recovery from hatchery wastes is favoured by the addition of swine wastewater in the ACoD process.

This data supports the study to assess the impacts of climate change on terrestrial hydrological components and Crop Water Requirement (CWR) over the Chesapeake Bay watershed using a combination of Global Climate Models (GCMs) and a land surface model. To better understand the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle, long-term simulations of multiple earth system models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP Phase 5) are statistically downscaled and bias-corrected using Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) scheme for use as model forcings. Precipitation indices from the twenty MACA-based GCMs are used to identify six best performing models. A mesoscale approach is developed, where CWR is estimated by accounting for the impacts of changing climate conditions and rising carbon dioxide levels. Daily grid-based crop coefficients are derived from evapotranspiration data. The findings indicate an annual increase of 18% in evapotranspiration and an annual decrease of 5% in streamflow for the RCP 8.5 scenario towards the end of the 21st century. A reduction of 13% and 17% in CWR is observed for corn and soybeans, respectively due to wetter antecedent soil moisture conditions resulting from increased total precipitation and rising carbon dioxide levels. This mesoscale approach can be scaled globally to project CWR for use in data-scarce agricultural regions and enabling better management of water resources.

A global warming potential of albedo (GWPA) is proposed, that represents the carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to a 0.01 increase in albedo over 1 m2 of horizontal surface. A survey of prior literature suggests GWPA ≈ −4.2 kgCO2/m2. Taking Los Angeles, CA as a test site for urban global warming mitigation actions, a residential “cool roof” project offers approximately seven times as much radiative forcing benefit from albedo change as from GHG reduction of energy efficiency; and a citywide increase to commercial building roof albedo offers radiative forcing benefit equivalent to the first 6½ years of all commercial sector GHG emission reductions proposed in the City of Los Angeles climate action plan. Discussion explores pathways and challenges to making albedo increases fungible with GHG reductions in GHG markets.

Abstract Electricity occupies a central position in energy strategy, and the low-carbon development of the power industry is an important guarantee for achieving sustainable development and carbon dioxide reduction goals. Orderly carrying out low-carbon technology transformation and innovation in electricity, ultimately achieving the goal of sustainable development of the power industry, has strong practical significance. Therefore, this article conducts a feasibility analysis of using generative adversarial networks to evaluate low-carbon technologies in the sustainable economic development of electricity. Firstly, the background of the theory of technological and economic evaluation was analysed and used as a theoretical basis. Secondly, an adversarial network was generated for the study of low-carbon emissions in the power industry, and an evaluation system for low-carbon technology in the sustainable economic development of electricity was constructed. The study showed that the preliminary economic evaluation index system and comprehensive benefit evaluation model for low-carbon technology transformation projects in electricity established in this article have feasibility and reliability for systematic analysis and evaluation of actual projects.

Abstract Hydroalcoholic extracts prepared by conventional methods (in stirred vessel at 25 °C and 1 bar) and, hydroalcoholic and supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) extracts prepared in fixed bed extractors (60 ºC and 400 bar) were obtained from pitanga leaves (Eugenia uniflora L.) in order to recover phenolic compounds. Hydroalcoholic and ethanolic extracts obtained in fixed bed were further fractionated in four separators by gradual pressure reduction, using scCO2 as an antisolvent. All extracts and fractions were characterized in terms of extraction yield and the presence of total phenolics and flavonoids. Solvents were found to significantly influence the extraction yields and composition. Yields increased as a function of polarity, whereas the hydroalcoholic extractions displayed the highest yields and the highest amounts of extracted phenols and flavonoids.

Abstract This article presents results of the postdoctoral work, where he investigated the evolution of urban agriculture models and their impacts as public policy of sustainability, food security and ecological economy of the "Country - City - State" of Singapore. For, modern urban agriculture deployed in this region of Asia has contributed significantly to reducing local food insecurity, as well as contributing to more sustainable food production practices and significant reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions in supply chain logistics. The methodology used was in bibliographic investigations and field research with high-tech urban farms of agricultural production without the use of land, in order to appreciate the production and consumption of vegetables by Singaporeans in order to calculate an estimated value of the reduction of emissions of (CO₂) caused by the use of modern urban agriculture. The results showed that Singapore is intensive use of urban agriculture with models of vertical farms, indoor farms and farms of property terraces. All models presented technological innovations, high productivity and organically certified food production and with emphasis on sustainability in contributing to the reduction of (CO₂) emissions in nature.

Numerous industrial processes utilise gaseous chemical feedstocks to produce useful chemical products. Atmospheric and other small molecule gases, including anthropogenic waste products (e.g. carbon dioxide), can be viewed as sustainable building blocks to access value-added chemical commodities and materials. While transition metal complexes have been well documented in the reduction and transformation of these substrates, molecular complexes of the terrestrially abundant alkaline earth metals have also demonstrated promise with remarkable reactivity reported towards an array of industrially relevant gases over the past two decades. This review covers low oxidation state and hydrido group 2 complexes and their role in the reduction and transformation of a selection of important gaseous substrates towards value-added chemical products.

The effect of initial total solids (TS) concentration on volatile fatty acid (VFAs) production from food waste under mesophilic conditions (35 °C) was determined. VFAs concentration and composition, biogas production, soluble chemical oxygen demand concentration, TS and volatile solids (VS) reduction, and ammonia nitrogen release were investigated. The VFAs concentrations were 26.10, 39.68, 59.58, and 62.64 g COD/L at TS contents of 40, 70, 100, and 130 g/L, respectively. While the VFAs’ yields ranged from 0.467 to 0.799 g COD/g VSfed, decreased as initial TS increased. The percentage of propionate was not affected by TS concentration, accounting for 30.19–34.86% of the total VFAs, while a higher percentage of butyrate and lower percentage of acetate was achieved at a higher TS concentration. Biogas included mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide and the maximum hydrogen yield of 148.9 ml/g VSfed was obtained at 130 g TS/L. concentration, TS and VS reductions increased as initial TS increased. Considering the above variables, we conclude that initial TS of 100 g/L shall be the most appropriate to VFAs production.

ABSTRACT The central venous minus arterial carbon dioxide pressure to arterial minus central venous oxygen content ratio (Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2) has been proposed as a surrogate for respiratory quotient and an indicator of tissue oxygenation. Some small observational studies have found that a Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 > 1.4 was associated with hyperlactatemia, oxygen supply dependency, and increased mortality. Moreover, Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 has been incorporated into algorithms for tissue oxygenation evaluation and resuscitation. However, the evidence for these recommendations is quite limited and of low quality. The goal of this narrative review was to analyze the methodological bases, the pathophysiologic foundations, and the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the use of Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 as a surrogate for respiratory quotient. Physiologically, the increase in respiratory quotient secondary to critical reductions in oxygen transport is a life-threatening and dramatic event. Nevertheless, this event is easily noticeable and probably does not require further monitoring. Since the beginning of anaerobic metabolism is indicated by the sudden increase in respiratory quotient and the normal range of respiratory quotient is wide, the use of a defined cutoff of 1.4 for Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 is meaningless. Experimental studies have shown that Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 is more dependent on factors that modify the dissociation of carbon dioxide from hemoglobin than on respiratory quotient and that respiratory quotient and Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 may have distinct behaviors. Studies performed in critically ill patients have shown controversial results regarding the ability of Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 to predict outcome, hyperlactatemia, microvascular abnormalities, and oxygen supply dependency. A randomized controlled trial also showed that Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 is useless as a goal of resuscitation. Pcv-aCO2/Ca-cvO2 should be carefully interpreted in critically ill patients.

The effect of initial total solids (TS) concentration on volatile fatty acid (VFAs) production from food waste under mesophilic conditions (35 °C) was determined. VFAs concentration and composition, biogas production, soluble chemical oxygen demand concentration, TS and volatile solids (VS) reduction, and ammonia nitrogen release were investigated. The VFAs concentrations were 26.10, 39.68, 59.58, and 62.64 g COD/L at TS contents of 40, 70, 100, and 130 g/L, respectively. While the VFAs’ yields ranged from 0.467 to 0.799 g COD/g VSfed, decreased as initial TS increased. The percentage of propionate was not affected by TS concentration, accounting for 30.19–34.86% of the total VFAs, while a higher percentage of butyrate and lower percentage of acetate was achieved at a higher TS concentration. Biogas included mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide and the maximum hydrogen yield of 148.9 ml/g VSfed was obtained at 130 g TS/L. concentration, TS and VS reductions increased as initial TS increased. Considering the above variables, we conclude that initial TS of 100 g/L shall be the most appropriate to VFAs production.

Abstract In this work, vapor - liquid (VLE) equilibrium for the binary system carbon dioxide (1) + coumarin (2) at high pressures was measured by a static synthetic method using a variable-volume view cell. Experimental data were obtained in the temperature range of 318 - 338 K and pressures up to 20 MPa. Coumarin molar fraction ranged from 3.0x10-3 to 6.0x10-3. Coumarin melting point reduction at high pressures was observed. The experimental results were modeled using the Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state with van der Waals quadratic mixing rules (vdW - QMRs), providing a good representation of the experimental phase equilibrium data. Critical properties and the acentric factor were estimated using the Constantinou and Gani method, which showed to be satisfactory on the quality of data correlation. Results indicate coumarin solubility increases with increasing phase transition pressure at a given temperature.

Achieving peak carbon dioxide emissions and accelerating decarbonization progress in the power industry is of paramount significance to Henan Province's objective of achieving carbon peak and neutrality. In this study, the Carbon Emission-Energy Integrated Model (iCEM) was employed to conduct scenario studies on the coal reduction and carbon reduction paths under the "dual-carbon" goal of Henan's power industry. The results indicated that, by considering measures such as optimizing the power source structure and technological progress, Henan Province's power industry carbon emissions will reach their peak between 2028-2033, with coal consumption in the power industry continuing to grow during the "14th Five-Year Plan" period. With a peak range between 2027-2031, the peak value increased by 1881, 1592, and 11.48 million tce, respectively, compared with that in 2020. To control coal in Henan Province under the constraint of carbon peak goals, it is proposed to develop clean energy sources such as wind and solar power, use more low-carbon or zero-carbon heat sources, increase the proportion of external electricity supply, and enhance energy-saving transformation in coal-fired power plants. Accelerating the elimination of backward units and energy-saving transformation of existing units, accelerating non-fossil energy development, advanced planning for external electricity supply, improving market mechanisms for the exit of coal-fired power plants and peak regulation, increasing system flexibility, and accelerating external policies to ensure clean energy security are effective paths for controlling coal and reducing carbon emissions in Henan's power industry. Additionally, inland nuclear power layout is one of the crucial paths to alleviate coal control pressure in Henan Province and achieve "dual-carbon" goals during the carbon-neutral stage. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct research on demonstrations in advance. Henan Province is highly dependent on energy from other provinces, and the power supply and demand situation in Henan Province will become increasingly tense in the future. It is necessary to support Henan Province from the State Grid and coordinate the construction of inter-provincial and inter-regional power transmission channels.

Observing system uncertainty experiments (OSUEs) have been recently proposed as a cost-effective way to perform probabilistic assessment of retrievals for NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission. One important component in the OCO-2 retrieval algorithm is a full-physics forward model that describes the mathematical relationship between atmospheric variables such as carbon dioxide and radiances measured by the remote sensing instrument. This complex forward model is computationally expensive but large-scale OSUEs require evaluation of this model numerous times, which makes it infeasible for comprehensive experiments. To tackle this issue, we develop a statistical emulator to facilitate large-scale OSUEs in the OCO-2 mission. Within each distinct spectral band, the emulator represents radiance output at irregular wavelengths as a linear combination of basis functions and random coefficients. These random coefficients are then modeled with nearest-neighbor Gaussian processes with built-in input dimension reduction via active subspace. The proposed emulator reduces dimensionality in both input space and output space, so that fast computation is achieved within a fully Bayesian inference framework. Validation experiments demonstrate that this emulator outperforms other competing statistical methods and a reduced order model that approximates the full-physics forward model.

Based on the integrated model of Super-SBM model, spatial Durbin model (SDM) and Grey neural network model, this paper analyzes the panel data of various provinces in China from multiple angles and dimensions. It was found that there were significant differences in eco-efficiency between organic rice production and conventional rice production. The response of organic rice to climate change, the spatial distribution of ecological and economic benefits and the impact on carbon emission were analyzed. The results showed that organic rice planting not only had higher economic benefits, but also showed a rising trend of ecological benefits and a positive feedback effect. This finding highlights the importance of organic rice farming in reducing carbon emissions. Organic rice farming effectively reduces greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide and methane, by improving soil management and reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides. This has important implications for mitigating climate change and promoting soil health and biodiversity. With the acceleration of urbanization, the increase of organic rice planting area shows the trend of organic rice gradually replacing traditional rice cultivation, further highlighting the potential of organic agriculture in emission reduction, environmental protection and sustainable agricultural production. To this end, it is recommended that the Government implement a diversified support strategy to encourage technological innovation, provide guidance and training, and raise public awareness and demand for organic products. At the same time, private sector participation is stimulated to support the development of organic rice cultivation through a public-private partnership model. Through these measures, further promote organic rice cultivation, achieve the dual goals of economic benefits and environmental benefits, and effectively promote the realization of double carbon emission reduction targets.

Carbon dioxide sequestration via carbonation of steel slags is a promising way of combining two waste products to create value. Understanding the dissolution kinetics of steel slags, which are alkaline and rich in calcium, in acidic media is essential to configure such a process. In this study, we seek to analyse the dissolution mechanism from experimental studies and develop a mathematical model considering the heterogeneous characteristics of slag. We found that the reduction in calcium extraction efficiency with an increase in particle size, which is normally associated with surface passivation or non-uniformity of samples, can be explained by considering the morphological features associated with the distribution of MgO–FeO (RO) phase in the calcium silicate matrix. We present a population balance model and show that the reduction in calcium extraction efficiency in coarse particle fractions is due to increased sporulation of RO phase. The findings in the study suggest that the leaching of metal ions from slag is controlled by proton-promoted surface dissolution reaction, where the dependence of acid concentration follows Langmuir–Hinshelwood adsorption isotherm. The model shows good agreement with a large set of parametric studies and demonstrates the importance of considering morphological features, as we progress towards development of a priori dissolution models for multi-mineral oxides and silicates.

This study quantifies the financial and environmental impacts of a microalgal bioenergy system that attempts to maximize circular flows by recovering and reusing the carbon, nutrients, and water within the system. The system produces microalgal biomass using liquid digestate of an anaerobic digester that processes 45 metric tons of food waste and generates 28.6 m3 of permeate daily in California, and three energy production scenarios from the biomass are considered: producing biodiesel, electricity, and both. In all scenarios, the resulting energy products delivered only modest reductions in environmental impacts as measured by carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The carbon intensities (CIs) of biodiesel from this study were 91.0 gCO2e/MJ and 93.3 gCO2e/MJ, which were lower than 94.71 gCO2e/MJ of conventional petroleum diesel, and the CI of electricity from this study was 70.6 gCO2e/MJ, lower than the average electricity grid CI in California (82.92 gCO2e/MJ). The economic analysis results show that generating electricity alone can be profitable, while biodiesel produced via this system is not cost competitive with conventional diesel due to high capital expenses. Thus, generating electricity in lieu of biodiesel appears to be a better option to maximize the use of waste flows and supply lower-carbon energy.

Abstract Due to the importance of swine production in Brazil, there is a need to understand the environmental impact generated by the construction materials used in the production of rural facilities, especially in the construction of biodigesters, as these facilities play an important role in the sustainability of production systems. Considering the relevance of the volume of concrete used in the construction of biodigesters for the management and treatment of swine waste, this research study sought to evaluate the emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 Eq.) in different concrete mix scenarios. For that purpose, a computational ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) model was developed to predict and analyse CO 2 Eq. emissions during the life cycle of materials adopted in conventional concrete. The results indicate that the proper choice of dosage can lead to a reduction of 31.41% in CO 2 Eq. emissions, for concrete from 30 to 40 MPa. This represents a promising proposal for reducing the environmental impact of the production of concrete constructions, which has the potential to stimulate further research in this area.

Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) will be necessary to fulfil the hundreds of pledges to reach net-zero by 2050. As with any industry, standard methodologies and certification are crucial to guarantee successful and reliable activities. However, buyers and policymakers currently face challenges in evaluating the ecosystem of CDR certification. The issue is not with CDR, nor with individual certifications – some of which may be very robust – but with the lack of transparency in the overall ecosystem. To bring some clarity, we present a snapshot of the CDR certification and standards ecosystem for the year 2021–2022. We find a complex ecosystem with at least 30 standard developing organizations proposing at least 125 standard methodologies for carbon removal from 23 different CDR activities and selling 27 different versions of certification instruments in voluntary and compliance markets. This exercise reveals many more existing standards for nature-based than for engineering-based activities and more diversity from standards serving the voluntary rather than the compliance market. It also highlights a proliferation of standards for the same activity, and a plethora of activities without standards. The process revealed ambiguity on what constitutes carbon removal, with many standards certifying activities that remove CO2 already in the environment as well as activities that avoid or reduce new emissions by sequestering the carbon into reservoirs. This mapping highlights key gaps and potential starting points for reforms to strengthen the CDR certification industry; it also underscores the need for independent oversight. The CDR certification ecosystem is complex and evolving rapidly, raising questions about oversight and quality.Targeted support would be necessary for the timely development of standards for nascent but promising CDR activities, and oversight would be required to ensure the quality of certification.Ensuring a minimum quality would require clarifying the treatment of emission reduction, removal, and avoidance, amongst other concerns.

Cities, where human energy activities and greenhouse gas emissions are concentrated, contribute significantly to alleviating the impacts of global climate change. Utilizing the China Carbon Emissions Accounting Database (CEADs) to provide carbon dioxide emission inventories for urban areas in China at the prefecture level, this study closely examines the historical evolution trajectories of carbon emissions across 247 urban units from 2005 to 2019. The logarithmic cubic function model was employed to simulate these trajectories, evaluating urban emission peaks and classifying the different carbon emission trajectories. Further, the Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression model was employed to explore spatiotemporal traits and essential variables that impact the variations in carbon emissions among four identified trajectory types. Our results showed that Chinese urban carbon emission trajectories can be classified into four categories: a) peaking emissions, b) fluctuating growth, c) continuous growth, and d) passive decline. Specifically, 43 cities, primarily in North China, proactively attained their emission peak post-2010, driven by the reduction in secondary industry and energy intensity. 90 cities, largely industrial hubs in the southeast coast and inland, reached an emission plateau around 2015, exhibiting fluctuating growth due to dependencies on secondary industries. 101 cities, predominantly located in western and central regions, demonstrated a clear upward trend in carbon emissions, propelled by rapid urbanization and heavy industry-oriented economic development. Lastly, 13 cities, typically in the northeastern and southwestern regions, experienced a passive decline in carbon emissions, attributable to resource depletion or economic downturns. It is evident that China's city-level carbon peaking has demonstrated some effectiveness, yet considerable progress is still required.

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have attracted considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts in reactions central to energy conversion and chemical transformation. In contrast to monometallic nanocrystals and metal alloys, SAAs possess unique and intriguing physicochemical properties, positioning them as ideal model systems for studying structure–property relationships. However, the field is still in its early stages. In this Perspective, we first review and summarize rational synthesis methods and advanced characterization techniques for SAA nanoparticle catalysts. We then emphasize the extensive applications of SAAs in a range of electrocatalytic reactions, including fuel cell reactions, water splitting, and carbon dioxide and nitrate reductions. Finally, we provide insights into existing challenges and prospects associated with the controlled synthesis, characterization, and design of SAA catalysts.

ABSTRACT The metabolic peculiarities of felines favor an intoxication. Fifty healthy female cats were divided into five groups: PG (placebo group), G2 (cefazolin), G3 (ceftriaxone), G4 (enrofloxacin) and G5 (ampicillin) were used. The parameters evaluated were: total expired carbon dioxide (ETCO2), oxygen saturation in hemoglobin (SpO2), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), body temperature (BT), systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, mBP and DBP) by invasive method, at T0, 5 (T5), 10 (T10), 15 (T15), 20 (T20), 25 (T25) and 30 (T30) minutes after administration of the treatments. HR presented reduction in G2 compared to PG at all times, except T20, and in G4, T25 and T30 were lower than the T0 values (P<0.05). BT showed increase in the G3 at T0 and T5 and all groups showed reduction in the values of BT relative to T0 (P<0.05). ETCO2 increased in G2 and G5 at all times compared to PG (P<0.05) and there were no differences among the times within each group. It was concluded that ceftriaxone is safer for the prophylactic antimicrobial use in cats, however the other antimicrobials are also indicated, because all the parameters, in all groups, basically did not change over the study and when this occurs it remains in reference interval.

Abstract The reduction of emissions from shipping is necessary to combat climate change. One viable option is to change the fuels utilized. In this study, we investigate the environmental and economic performance of marine diesel oil (MDO), liquified natural gas (LNG), liquified biogas (LBG), and a mixture of LNG and LBG. We study a real case of a roll-on/roll-off passenger ship (RoPax) in Finland. Life cycle thinking is applied to assess the environmental impact, covering emissions from well to propeller (raw material extraction, fuel production, transportation, storage, and combustion), while the economic implications are estimated through future fuel prices and carbon pricing from 2023 to 2050. The carbon pricing covers different carbon tax schemes, namely stated policies scenario (STEPS), sustainable development scenarios (SDS), and net-zero emissions (NZE). STEPS reflects the existing measures and policies under development; SDS pursues to meet the goal of Paris Agreement, while NZE aims to reach net zero. Adopting LNG would improve carbon dioxide emissions, but the overall climate change impact was not significantly lower than MDO. It is also found that the biggest environmental improvement can be obtained by switching to LBG, although future availability can be an issue. The economic assessment shows that LBG has the highest fuel price uncertainties, although its carbon cost will be the lowest. Alternatively, using LNG & LBG mixture can serve as a transition path to contain climate change while dealing with its price uncertainty and availability.

Abstract Background Health care is a significant contributor to climate change. Global pressure for a change towards a more sustainable way of providing dental health care has resulted in the creation of the Green Impact Toolkit, which is comprised of a list of suggested changes that dental practices can make to become more sustainable in a number of categories, such as procurement, waste and water. Aims To compare the effectiveness of changes suggested by the Green Impact Toolkit. Materials and methods A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted using the Ecoinvent database v3.8 and these data were processed using OpenLCA v1.10.3 software. Results The carbon footprint per patient was significantly reduced after the recommendations were implemented. For instance, using water from a rainwater collection tank instead of the mains supply saved 30 g CO2eq (carbon dioxide equivalents) per patient, a 90% reduction in carbon footprint. Discussion This comparative LCA identified some effective changes which can be easily made by a dental practice. Nevertheless, some actions require some initial financial investment and may be difficult to implement in a busy modern dental practice setting. Conclusion The findings from this study can be used to guide dental practices to making choices which are more sustainable and eco-friendly in the future.

In recent years, fossil-based fuels have been used to supply the energy needs of the world. Fossil-based fuels induce accumulation of the atmospheric CO2 which causes global warming. One of CO2 source is flue gas emission from the power plant. The microalgae have been considered excellent biological materials for reduction CO2 with ability to photosynthesis. In this study, air, 10% CO2, 15% CO2 and simulated flue gas (containing 15% CO2) feed were used to observe effect CO2 concentration and flue gas on cell growth and lipid content of Chlorella protothecoides. The highest dry cell weight (1,5 g/L) and lipid content (45%) values were obtained with 15% CO2 feed while the highest growth rate (1,10), biomass productivity (0,125 g/L/day), and lipid weight (0,63 g/g) were observed in 10% CO2 feed. Cultures fed with flue gas did not inhibited C. protothecoides growth and showed similar results with those fed with 15% CO2 gas in terms of growth rate, dry cell weight, biomass productivity and lipid content. These results showed that C. protothecoides has great potential for reducing CO2 emission from flue gas.

Introduction The use of pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and asthma exacerbations necessitating healthcare reviews contribute substantially to the global carbon footprint of healthcare. It is possible that a reduction in carbon footprint could be achieved by switching patients with mild asthma from salbutamol pMDI reliever therapy to inhaled corticosteroid-formoterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) reliever therapy, as recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Methods This post hoc analysis included all 668 adult participants in the Novel START trial, who were randomised 1:1:1 to treatment with: as-needed budesonide-formoterol DPI, as-needed salbutamol pMDI, or maintenance budesonide DPI plus as-needed salbutamol pMDI. The primary outcome was carbon footprint of asthma management, expressed as kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (kgCO 2 e), per person year. Secondary outcomes explored the effect of baseline symptom control and adherence (maintenance budesonide DPI arm only) on carbon footprint. Results As-needed budesonide-formoterol DPI was associated with 95.8% and 93.6% lower carbon footprint compared with as-needed salbutamol pMDI (least squares mean 1.1 versus 26.2 kgCO 2 e; difference −25.0, 95% CI −29.7 to −20.4; p<0.001) and maintenance budesonide DPI plus as-needed salbutamol pMDI (least squares mean 1.1 versus 17.3 kgCO 2 e; difference −16.2, 95% CI −20.9 to −11.6; p<0.001), respectively. There was no statistically significant evidence that treatment differences in carbon footprint depended on baseline symptom control or adherence in the maintenance budesonide DPI arm. Conclusions The as-needed budesonide-formoterol DPI treatment option was associated with a markedly lower carbon footprint than as-needed salbutamol pMDI and maintenance budesonide DPI plus as-needed salbutamol pMDI.

The ongoing climate change is predicted to induce more weather extremes such as frequent drought and high-intensity precipitation events, causing more severe drying-rewetting cycles in soil. However, it remains largely unknown how these changes will affect soil nitrogen (N)-cycling microbes and the emissions of potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Utilizing a field precipitation manipulation in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau, we examined how precipitation reduction (ca. −30%) influenced soil N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in field, and in a complementary lab-incubation with simulated drying-rewetting cycles. Results obtained showed that precipitation reduction stimulated plant root turnover and N-cycling processes, enhancing soil N2O and CO2 emissions in field, particularly after each rainfall event. Also, high-resolution isotopic analyses revealed that field soil N2O emissions primarily originated from nitrification process. The incubation experiment further showed that in field soils under precipitation reduction, drying-rewetting stimulated N mineralization and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in favor of genera Nitrosospira and Nitrosovibrio, increasing nitrification and N2O emissions. These findings suggest that moderate precipitation reduction, accompanied with changes in drying-rewetting cycles under future precipitation scenarios, may enhance N cycling processes and soil N2O emissions in semi-arid ecosystems, feeding positively back to the ongoing climate change.

The ongoing climate change is predicted to induce more weather extremes such as frequent drought and high-intensity precipitation events, causing more severe drying-rewetting cycles in soil. However, it remains largely unknown how these changes will affect soil nitrogen (N)-cycling microbes and the emissions of potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Utilizing a field precipitation manipulation in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau, we examined how precipitation reduction (ca. −30%) influenced soil N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in field, and in a complementary lab-incubation with simulated drying-rewetting cycles. Results obtained showed that precipitation reduction stimulated plant root turnover and N-cycling processes, enhancing soil N2O and CO2 emissions in field, particularly after each rainfall event. Also, high-resolution isotopic analyses revealed that field soil N2O emissions primarily originated from nitrification process. The incubation experiment further showed that in field soils under precipitation reduction, drying-rewetting stimulated N mineralization and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in favor of genera Nitrosospira and Nitrosovibrio, increasing nitrification and N2O emissions. These findings suggest that moderate precipitation reduction, accompanied with changes in drying-rewetting cycles under future precipitation scenarios, may enhance N cycling processes and soil N2O emissions in semi-arid ecosystems, feeding positively back to the ongoing climate change.

International shipping is overwhelmingly reliant on fossil fuels, with annual carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to a country the size of Germany. Actions to reduce its emissions are therefore an important element of global efforts to combat climate change. This article re-assesses the international shipping sector’s initial greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets against the Paris Agreement goals. The analysis is based upon the latest data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International Maritime Organization (IMO) and uses the concept of carbon budgets to evaluate proportionate 1.5°C emissions pathways for the sector. The consequences of the resulting Paris-compliant pathways for shipping’s existing mitigation targets and strategy are discussed. The article concludes that significantly stronger short- and longer-term targets need to be set for the sector to be compatible with the Paris Agreement’s goals: 34% reductions on 2008 emissions levels by 2030, and zero emissions before 2050, compared with the sector’s existing target of a 50% cut in CO2 by 2050. Crucially, strengthening the target by the IMO’s strategy revision date of 2023 is imperative. The long asset lifetimes of ships and shipping infrastructure limit the speed of transition such that a delay of even a few years will dictate an untenable rate of decarbonization and increased risk of pushing the already challenging Paris goals out of reach. Key policy insightsThere is a gap between targets set out in the IMO’s Initial Strategy and what is needed by the shipping sector to be Paris-compliant.Paris-compliant targets require a 34% reduction in emissions by 2030, with zero emissions before 2050. Existing targets imply no absolute reduction in emissions to 2030, and only a 50% reduction by 2050.The longer the delay in setting new targets, the steeper subsequent decarbonization trajectories become. Delay beyond 2023 would necessitate an untenably rapid transition, given long shipping asset lifetimes and global requirements for new land-side infrastructures, increasing the mitigation burden on other sectors.COP26 in November 2021 is an opportunity for the shipping sector to signal its intent to strengthen its targets, and to implement this in its 2023 strategy revision process, at the latest.

CO2 reduction to fuels using solid oxide electrodes is a promising approach due to high faradaic and energy efficiencies. CO2 reducing electrodes (cathodes) form the central challenge in enabling solid oxide technology for CO2 electrolysis. Typical cathodes can comprise of both oxides such as perovskites and metals such as Ni and Fe. Efforts at improving the activity, selectivity and stability of the electrodes continues. Operando methods provide direct access to active sites during the reaction and provide valuable information such as the identity of catalytic material, nature of reaction intermediates, oxidation state of catalytic ions etc. These methods have created a deeper mechanistic understanding, unravelled new performance indicators, and increasingly enabling a deep diagnostic based systematic development of catalysts and processes. This study summarises and analyses data from operando approaches to develop an understanding of CO2 reduction mechanism on certain commonly studied electrodes. In particular, this review discusses CO2 reduction mechanism on electrodes such as Ni-YSZ, CeO2-x and perovskites such as La1-xSrxFeOy. The CO2 reduction on these surfaces essentially progresses on an oxide terminated surface via formation of a three coordinated carbon (carbonate type) intermediate formed at oxygen defect sites. Metal electrodes such as Ni-YSZ were found to oxidize in situ in presence of CO2 and the reaction proceeded via oxide mediated mechanism. In electrodes such as La1-x SrxFeOy, exsolution of metals was essentially found to have no direct impact on CO2 electrolysis. In the context of catalyst coking on CeOx electrodes, new descriptors, such as the number of reduced sites (Ce3+), and the existence of metal carbonyl species "Ce3+ -- CO" have emerged.

To address climate change and achieve high-quality economic development, China began implementing the Comprehensive Demonstration City of Energy Saving and Emission Reduction Fiscal Policy (ESERFP) in 2011. This policy relies on special transfer payments to increase the integration of various energy conservation and emission reduction fiscal policies, thereby accelerating institutional and mechanism innovation, actively promoting economic structure adjustment and development mode transformation, and achieving energy conservation and emission reduction goals in various regions. This study uses a multi-period difference-in-difference (DID) model to estimate the ESERFP's CO2 emission reduction effect and paths. The findings demonstrate the following: (1) The ESERFP has lessened the CO2 emission intensity of the demonstration city and effectively played a role in reducing CO2 emissions. (2) Mechanism analysis demonstrates that the ESERFP has significantly improved the green travel level of residents in pilot cities and can also reduce cities' total energy consumption. Therefore, the ESERFP can effectively suppress CO2 emissions by improving transportation systems and optimizing energy consumption structures. (3) Further analysis shows that the ESERFP can reduce the CO2 emission scale of the demonstration cities and effectively promote the increase of actual per capita gross domestic product in pilot cities, bringing economic dividends and thus achieving a "win-win" situation of environmental protection and economic growth. (4) Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the CO2 emission reduction effect is more significant in non-old industrial-based cities, non-resource-based cities, and urban agglomerations. This study not only evaluates the CO2 reduction effect of the demonstration city but also provides reference significance for the improvement of subsequent environmental regulations. In addition, clarifying the implementation effect of the ESERFP can help alleviate ecological and environmental problems in the process of urban economic development in China and achieve the sustainable development goal of green transformation.

Development of a novel SnS| PTFE| Pt electrode as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate in an aqueous alkaline imidazole medium is reported in this paper. The electrode was prepared through the incorporation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with SnS and modification of the Pt surface by SnS/PTFE. The electrode facilitated a first-order CO2 reduction at −1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) via a diffusion-controlled pathway with a cathodic electron transfer coefficient (α) of 0.22 and two-electron transfer kinetics in two steps, where the first electron transfer step determined the reaction rate. The SnS| PTFE| Pt electrode surface exhibited well-defined cyclic voltammograms (CVs) for CO2 reduction in comparison to GCE, Au, Pd, and graphite-modified electrodes utilizing the same catalyst, indicating superior catalytic efficiency and its conduciveness to kinetic investigations. Such performance indicates that the SnS| PTFE| Pt electrode would be a promising alternative for CO2 reduction in the context of renewable energy generation.

Abstract The process of producing buildings has significant environmental impacts, especially through green house gas (GHG) emissions. In Brazil, mortar coating is still often executed by conventional methods, despite the industry's efforts to rationalize the production process. It is worthwhile to analyse the impacts caused during the application phase, looking for alternatives that can minimize the emissions of polluting gases. In this context, this study aims to evaluate CO2 emissions through the CO2 Emission Life Cycle Assessment (ACVCO2) in two mortar application techniques: projected and conventional. The methodology is based on a case study of a building in Brasília, Brazil, through a simulation of the execution of the two coating techniques analysed. ACVCO2 was restricted to the application phase of the coating. The results indicate that the projected plaster produces a lower percentage of CO2 emissions, 50% lower than the conventional method. Even though energy consumption increased due to equipment operation, the reduction in the losses of the projected application technique was favourable in relation to the reduction of associated emissions, which is an incentive to disseminate streamlined construction techniques.

Abstract Considering the microbial safety of consumption of raw foods (Asian food), this study aimed to explore the inactivation S. aureus in raw salmon by supercritical CO2 treatment (SC-CO2). For this purpose, experimental design methodology was employed as a tool to evaluate the effects of pressure (120-220 bar), the depressurization rate (10 to 100 bar.min–1) and the salmon:CO2 mass relation (1:0.2 to 1:1.0). It was observed that the pressure and the depressurization rate was statistically significant, i.e. the higher the system pressure and depressurization rate, the greater the microbial inactivation. The salmon: CO2 mass relation did not influence the S. aureus inactivation in raw salmon. There was a total reduction in S. aureus with 225 bar, a depressurizing rate of 100 bar.min–1, a salmon: CO2 mass relation of 1:0.6, for 2 hours at 33 °C.

Multiple linkages connect air quality and climate change. Many air pollutant sources also emit carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). The two main contributors to non-attainment of U.S. ambient air quality standards, ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM), interact with radiation, forcing climate change. PM warms by absorbing sunlight (e.g., black carbon) or cools by scattering sunlight (e.g., sulfates) and interacts with clouds; these radiative and microphysical interactions can induce changes in precipitation and regional circulation patterns. Climate change is expected to degrade air quality in many polluted regions by changing air pollution meteorology (ventilation and dilution), precipitation and other removal processes, and by triggering some amplifying responses in atmospheric chemistry and in anthropogenic and natural sources. Together, these processes shape distributions and extreme episodes of O3 and PM. Global modeling indicates that as air pollution programs reduce SO2 to meet health and other air quality goals, near-term warming accelerates due to “unmasking” of warming induced by rising CO2. Air pollutant controls on CH4, a potent GHG and precursor to global O3 levels, and on sources with high black carbon (BC) to organic carbon (OC) ratios could offset near-term warming induced by SO2 emission reductions, while reducing global background O3 and regionally high levels of PM. Lowering peak warming requires decreasing atmospheric CO2, which for some source categories would also reduce co-emitted air pollutants or their precursors. Model projections for alternative climate and air quality scenarios indicate a wide range for U.S. surface O3 and fine PM, although regional projections may be confounded by interannual to decadal natural climate variability. Continued implementation of U.S. NOx emission controls guards against rising pollution levels triggered either by climate change or by global emission growth. Improved accuracy and trends in emission inventories are critical for accountability analyses of historical and projected air pollution and climate mitigation policies.Implications: The expansion of U.S. air pollution policy to protect climate provides an opportunity for joint mitigation, with CH4 a prime target. BC reductions in developing nations would lower the global health burden, and for BC-rich sources (e.g., diesel) may lessen warming. Controls on these emissions could offset near-term warming induced by health-motivated reductions of sulfate (cooling). Wildfires, dust, and other natural PM and O3 sources may increase with climate warming, posing challenges to implementing and attaining air quality standards. Accountability analyses for recent and projected air pollution and climate control strategies should underpin estimated benefits and trade-offs of future policies.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ammonia (NH3) are the main gas pollutants emitted during composting. This study used boric acid (H3BO3) as an additive to simultaneously mitigate GHG and NH3 emissions during composting and produce boron-rich organic fertilizer. The results showed that high dose of boric acid (1425 mg/kg) simultaneously reduced carbon dioxide (16.4%), methane (97.0%), nitrous oxide (91.7%), and NH3 (27.1%) emissions in the composting process, resulting in the lowest carbon and nitrogen losses and global warming potential. However, low doses of boric acid (75 and 375 mg/kg) promoted nitrous oxide emissions and had limited emission reduction effects on other gases. Pearson correlation analysis showed that Corynebacterium, Planococcus, norank_f_MWH-CFBk5, Ruminofilibacter, norank_o_Actinomarinales and Truepera are key bacterial genera strongly associated with gas emissions. The results of principal co-ordinates analysis, network analysis, and structural equation modeling collectively indicated that the high dose of boric acid mitigates GHG and NH3 emissions by undergoing chemical reactions, altering physicochemical properties, and reshaping bacterial communities. This study provides an innovative approach for synchronously mitigating GHG and NH3 emissions and producing high value-added boron-rich organic fertilizer.

Abstract Paper aims This study aims to evaluate the economic-financial impact that the inclusion of environmental variable CO2 cost attributed to transportation (fuel consumption) and manufacturing activities (electricity consumption) represents in a distribution network optimization design. Originality This is the first work carried out in Brazil to present a feasible eco-efficient distribution network in the technical and economic aspects considering the tax aspects of ICMS. In addition, this work addresses the inclusion of CO2 as a cost associated with transportation and manufacturing activities. Finally, for the first time in literature, a reference framework that considers environmental variables is presented. Research method This study used the systematic literature review method to review the referential framework and carried out a cost reduction using specialist optimization software. Main findings The technical and economical feasibility in achieving reduction of both total logistic and CO2 costs in a distribution network design in Brazil and the inexistence of trade-offs without technical solution to the eco-efficient configuration of the distribution network. Implications for theory and practice The results of this paper presents a relevant contribution to logistics professionals and researchers, as it was able to present a framework and demonstrated the feasibility of an eco-efficient network design.

The distribution of the concentrations of CH4 and CO2 and other gases in the sediments of the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian seas was studied. A correlation was found between CH4 and CO2 in most sediment cores. The correlation coefficient R for the sediments of the Kara Sea ranges from 0.58 to 0.97 and does not depend on the gas distribution with depth. Methanogenesis in marine sediments is presumably associated with sulfate reduction, and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis leads to an increase in CH4 concentration against the background of high CO2 concentration. The high concentration of dimethyl sulfide in the sediments indicates the simultaneous formation of CH4 and CO2 through methylotrophic methanogenesis with the participation of CH3SCH3. In the upper layers of the sediment, opposite trends in the CH4 and CO2 distribution can be observed. The fact that the correlation coefficients between CH4 and CO2 gases in the sediments of the Laptev Sea acquire both negative and positive values is probably related to the fact that gas formation processes in the upper layers of the sediment captured by short columns differ from those of deep layers.

Electrification of bus fleets is an effective approach to reducing transportation-related pollution and carbon emissions. Evaluating the impact of electrification on existing bus fleets can provide valuable insights for promoting full electrification of public transportation in large cities. Utilizing the fuel life cycle method, we analyzed the CO2 and pollutant emissions of Zhengzhou's bus fleet before and after electrification and evaluated emissions under different electrification scenarios. Our results indicated that after electrification, the fuel life cycle CO2 and PM2.5 emissions increased by 32.6% and 42.6%, respectively, whereas CO, NOx, and VOC emissions decreased by 28%, 34%, and 25%, respectively. Optimizing the power generation structure is a critical factor in reducing CO2 and PM2.5 emissions during the electrification process. The best scenario for comprehensive electrification and power generation structure optimization could result in a 38.7% reduction in CO2, as well as reductions of 80.1% in CO, 84.4% in NOx, 92.2% in VOC, and 30.2% in PM2.5. Prioritizing electrification on long-distance routes is recommended during the replacement process. Additionally, replacing plug-in hybrid natural gas vehicles with pure electric vehicles has both advantages and disadvantages in terms of emission reduction. Achieving pollution reduction and carbon synergies requires advancing fleet replacement and power structure adjustments simultaneously.

Caves are windows to the extreme habitats of deep subsurface, and provide answers of unknowns about the underground life. Furthermore, sulfidic caves are important analogues for the early Earth environments, since some environmental conditions are common, such as high sulfur concentration, high temperature and oxygen-poor conditions. Kaklik Cave (Denizli, Turkey) with its travertine formation, carbonate- and sulfur-rich thermal springs, exhibits a unique ecosystem as a sulfidic cave. This study represents the first molecular survey of the microbial community in the Kaklik Cave, Turkey using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis. An average of 859–2,416 operational taxonomic units per sample were observed including 25 bacterial phyla and 3 archaeal phyla. The bacterial diversity profiles were generally dominated by Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. At the carbonate-rich hot spring, that formed travertine structure, 9.7% of sequence reads affiliated with Thiofaba spp. In contrast, 38.74% of the total sequence reads at the sulfidic hot spring samples associated with the genus Sulfurimonas and Sulfurovum. In the archaeal community composition, Thermoplasmata was the most abundant group in all sampling areas. The 454-pyrotag results provide leads about ammonia-, nitrite- and sulfur-oxidation as well as sulfur-reduction, carbon dioxide fixation, and nitrogen fixation.

Abstract: The global demand for energy and food generates, both in the countryside and in the city, environmental impacts, and many of these are due to the poor disposal of organic waste. One way to minimize these impacts on the environment is to carry out the treatment of waste generated in the various sectors. Among the possibilities for treating organic waste is anaerobic digestion. As a result of this process, there is the production of biogas, which is composed of several gases, including methane and carbon dioxide as the main ones. Biogas has energy potential, being able to generate electrical and thermal energy, in addition to being used in the form of biomethane. With the diversity of energy applications and the possibility of reducing waste, both anaerobic digestion and biogas contribute to the implementation and application of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals have a wide scope, ranging from the need for basic sanitation, clean and accessible energy for all, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption, to actions against global climate change, through the reduction of greenhouse gases. In this context, the objective of this work is to relate the SDGs and the anaerobic digestion of organic waste projects, which contribute both to the significant improvement of a community or region, as well as to environmental, social, and economic issues. The methodology used was the analysis of the concepts served by the use of the anaerobic digestion system in accordance with the objectives, goals, and sub-targets of the SDGs. Thus, the interrelation of at least five SDGs was observed: 6, 7, 11, 12, and 13. In summary, the use of anaerobic systems with the use of biogas helps in the substitution and/or reduction of energy sources not renewable resources, which can be applied both in the city and in the countryside, promoting a better quality of life for all.

Here, the unsupported Ni5Ga3 catalyst was prepared at different reduction temperatures in H2 for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation. The structural variation incurred by changing the reduction temperature was characterized carefully (including extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)) and related to the activity and reaction mechanism (by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)). The findings show the significant influence of H2 activation on the structural properties, activity, and selectivity of the catalysts. Specifically, Ni5Ga3-500 (i.e., reduced at 500 °C) encourages the copresence of Ga2O3 and NiGa alloys, which is key to achieve the appropriate interaction strength with the CO2-related intermediates, thus giving comparatively highest CO2 conversion and methanol yield. Longevity tests (100 h) of Ni5Ga3-500 showed slightly declined performance at the lower reaction temperature (viz., 220 and 260 °C), which was due to the further reduction of Ga2O3 and NiGa alloying during the catalysis.

The production of biofuels is strongly supported all over the world as a renewable energy source for reducing dependence on the unstable oil market. Bioethanol, the main biofuel produced in the world, is widely used to power vehicles in both the USA and Brazil, but concerns exist in both places regarding its sustainability. In Brazil, it is produced from a by-product of the sugar cane industry, while in the USA it is manufactured from food crops. The production of biogas and biodiesel is growing rapidly, but neither has outpaced the production of bioethanol. The European Union (EU) is greatly interested in this issue, and in 2011 adopted an extensive strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions related to transport by 60% by the year 2050. In order to achieve this result, the current European transportation system must be transformed. This ambitious goal will require the implementation of complex measures including the reduction of fossil fuels in favor of renewable fuels. This program has various options regarding the development of biofuels (e. g., biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel) and their related technologies, which are still on trial (mainly regarding the bioethanol production), and must also analyze their sustainability from a social and economic standpoint. The paper discusses the use of biofuels for transport in the European setting, and shows that their sustainability may result in relevant negative social effects due mainly to the use of land for energy crops (e.g., change of food price and world food shortage).

The article is devoted to the study of prerequisites, directions and measures to ensure China's energy transition. The purpose of the article is to study China's experience in ensuring the energy transition and identify key directions and policy initiatives for the implementation and development of sustainable energy innovations. It has been established that China is the world's largest energy consumer and in recent years has been characterized by continuous economic growth and acceleration of industrialization, development of the energy industry. The energy structure was analyzed and the dominance of coal production and consumption was determined – the first place in the world. The activity of green energy development has been revealed, but the share of clean energy sources in total energy consumption is still low. It was determined that the implementation of the principle of sustainable development and energy innovation is a priority for the further development of the Chinese economy. The key directions for ensuring the energy transition have been identified: diversified energy supply; green and low-carbon development; technological transformation and development. The dynamics of China's energy imports from 2013 to 2022 are analyzed. It was established that China ranked 17th in the Energy Transition Index in 2023, and for the first time entered the TOP-20 countries according to this ranking, which indicates the growing potential of China's energy transition. It analyzed the reasons for reducing energy consumption by 10,000 yuan of GDP from 2013 to 2022. In particular, it is notable that individual companies have reduced energy consumption and environmental pollution, promoting energy conservation, emission reduction and circular economy. It found that, along with the problem of high industrial emissions, China has become a leader in the adoption of clean energy technologies with investments in clean energy technologies exceeding US$650 billion per year. Key political initiatives contributing to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and the introduction of energy innovations are analyzed.

Abstract Paper aims This study aims to analyze the travel behaviors changings and the emissions reduction of CO2, CO, NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) promoted by the bicycle sharing system in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Originality The bicycle sharing systems have been experiencing rapid development in recent years, however, few empirical studies explore comprehensively the externalities of bicycle sharing, seeking to quantify the impacts of this travel system type on urban transport. Research method The research method used a modal distribution model calibrated with stated preference interviews and travel data provided by Tembici company. Main findings Results indicated a reduction in 2018 CO2 emissions compared to the existing system in 2014, not only because of the increase in the bicycle sharing system offer, but also due to a higher transfer rates from motorized transport to bicycle, particularly those originated from public transport and Transportation Network Company (TNC) services. Implications for theory and practice Results reveal the bicycle sharing in the city of Rio de Janeiro should be understood as a part of a process of adopting multimodality, with effective reductions achieved by the incentive to change passenger’s travel behavior.

ABSTRACT Objective To analyze the results of ten angioplasties of TASC C and D femoropopliteal lesions using CO2 as primary contrast in patients with no formal contraindication to iodine, aiming to decrease allergic reactions and potential nephrotoxicity in high-risk patients. Methods We describe the results of ten angioplasties of TASC C and D femoropopliteal lesions using CO2 as primary contrast in patients with high risk for open revascularization and no formal contraindication to iodine. We analyzed feasibility of the procedures, complications, quality of the angiographic images, clinical and surgical outcomes, and costs of C and D lesions treated using CO2 as contrast medium. Results The use of CO2 in C and D lesions needed iodine complementation in most of the cases (nine cases) but decreased the potential nephrotoxicity of iodine contrast medium by the reduction of its volume in this group of high-risk patients. The extension of the arterial lesions was the factor that most contributed to the need for iodine supplementation due to the difficulty to visualize the refill after a long arterial occlusion. Conclusion The use of CO2 as contrast in patients with C and D lesions with no restriction for iodine contrast medium was an alternative that did not dismiss the need of iodine supplementation in most of the cases, but could decrease the potential nephrotoxicity of iodine constrast medium.

ABSTRACT Objective: To analyze the effect of air pollution on heart rate variability in overweight individuals. Methods: A total of 46 adult individuals, both sexes, aged between 18 and 49 years and with body mass index >25kg/m2 were analyzed. All volunteers were students from public schools of two cities in the state of São Paulo. The clinical, demographic and anthropometric data of each individual, as well as heart rate variability through time domain, geometric and frequency indices were collected. For the air quality analysis, the following variables were investigated: concentration of carbon dioxide, particulate matter, temperature and relative humidity. The analysis was carried out with descriptive and analytical statistics, adopting a level of significance of 5%. Results: There was a reduction in overall heart rate variability in overweight individuals by the following indices: mean standard deviation of all normal RR intervals, long-term standard deviation of continuous RR intervals, ratio of short-and long-term standard deviation of continuous RR intervals. In addition, the indices responsible for parasympathetic control showed a downward trend in their values, as well as the low frequency index, which represented sympathetic action, although not significant. Conclusion: Overweight individuals exposed to air pollution had lower heart rate variability than the Control Group.

ABSTRACT Water availability is the main factor that explains current patterns of palm abundance. However, the interaction between water stress and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by climatic change and its effects on palm physiology remain poorly known. Macauba palm is a widespread Neotropical species commonly found in ecosystems subjected to seasonal drought and has potential use in oil production. The present work investigated the influence of increased CO2 concentrations on photosynthetic responses to drought in macauba palm plants. Exposure to increased CO2 concentrations led to up-regulation of photosynthesis through higher stomatal conductance and improved light and water use efficiency. Macauba palm plants under water stress, irrespective of CO2 concentration, were able to maintain constant levels of proline and chlorophyll, while preventing oxidative damage. Plants grown at higher CO2 concentrations were more capable of recovering from drought due to higher Rubisco carboxylation rate (Vc max) and electron transport rate (J max), which prevented a reduction in total dry mass at the end of the stress period. Stomatal control of photosynthesis, coupled with the prevention of severe damage under stress, would allow efficient biomass production by the macauba palm under future scenarios of climate change.

Acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) addresses CO2 loss, and thus mitigates the energy penalties associated with CO2 recovery; however, acidic CO2R suffers low selectivity. One promising remedy – using a high concentration of alkali cations – steers CO2R towards multi-carbon (C2+) products; but these same alkali cations result in salt formation, limiting operating stability to <15 hours. Here we present cationic groups (CG) functionalized copper that enables efficient CO2 activation in a stable manner: by replacing alkali cations with immobilized benzimidazolium cationic groups within ionomer coatings, we achieve over 150 hours of stable CO2R. We find the water-management property of CG minimizes proton migration that enables operation at a modest voltage of 3.3 V with mildly alkaline local pH, leading to more energy-efficient CO2R with a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 80%±3%. As a result, we report an energy efficiency of 28% for acidic CO2R towards C2+ products, and a single-pass CO2 conversion efficiency exceeding > 70%.

ABSTRACT The consolidation of concrete as the second most consumed material in the world has instigated the search for solutions to reduce clinker consumption and CO2 emissions. Aiming to provide a contribution to environmental sustainability and the cement industry, this research seeks to analyze the economic viability of self-compacting concrete (SCC) with low cement consumption. A study of the optimization of the granular skeleton and the composition of the paste was carried out using the Gomes (2002) dosing method for the SCC. Reductions of up to 25% of the cement consumption were measured in relation to the reference SCC. Regarding the relative cement consumption and unit cost indexes per MPa developed in 1 m3 of concrete, it was verified that the SCC’s with low cement consumption showed reductions of up to 34.75% and 16.83%, respectively, while being compared to the reference SCC. The greater effectiveness in the reduction of the consumption relative to the mechanical resistance to compression than in the consumption of cement per cubic meter of concrete observed, is due to the observation of higher levels of mechanical resistance to compression for the composition with lower paste volume and higher proximity to the optimal void index found in the aggregate packaging stage. This result shows that even in the lower dosage circumstances, the mechanical compressive strength can be increased, thus demonstrating the technical and financial superiority of the SCC with low cement consumption compared to conventional SCC dosages, in addition to the sustainability gains obtained by the reduction of the clinker consumption and the CO2 emissions inherent to the lower amount of cement mass per cubic meter of concrete.

Achieving carbon emission reduction in agriculture has become a key issue in promoting agricultural modernization. However, the continued open crop straw burning (OCSB) in China has exerted enormous pressure on agricultural modernization. Related research mostly focused on the synergic relationship between CO2 emission and agricultural modernization level (AML), ignoring the nonlinear response of agriculture emission to AML and regional differences, especially OCSB CO2 emission. Thus, based on the fire point data and crop straw yield, the OCSB CO2 emission of prefecture-level cities in China was calculated, and the AML was measured by constructing an evaluation index system of 23 indicators. With the constraint lines and restricted cubic splines (RCSs), their underexplored threshold relationships in Chinese nine agricultural zones were revealed, and targeted control areas were proposed. Results showed that during 2013–2021, Chinese OCSB CO2 emission showed an overall downward trend with a total 18,823 Mt reduction, while average AML steadily improved by 0.026. Significant negative U-shaped relationship was found between OCSB CO2 emission and AML, while OCSB CO2 emission attained the potential extreme values when AML reached 0.349. Meanwhile, AML thresholds varied significantly across the agricultural zones as OCSB CO2 emission from different crops reached the potential extreme values. Accordingly, cities were spatially divided into three types of control areas: priority prevention area, centralized remediation area, and strictly controlled area. We quantified OCSB CO2 emission and AML of prefecture-level cities and identified potential high OCSB CO2 emission areas, which can provide data support and differentiated management countermeasures for low-carbon agricultural development in various agricultural zones of China.

ABSTRACT The residual catalyst (CR) from Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) in petroleum refineries has been studied as pozzolan in cementitious materials to evaluate the development of mechanical properties and durability. However, studies on the degradation of these materials with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) are recent. This article evaluates the degradation of hardened pastes with replacement of cement mass by CR (0%, 15% and 30% CR) exposed for 7 h to scCO2, in the temperature and pressure condition estimated at 760 m depth (53,55 °C / 12,41 MPa). The density of the slurries was set at 1.89 g/cm3 and curing time of 28 days. The formulation of the slurries and supercritical condition aimed to simulate the application in the structure of an onshore well in the northeast of Brazil, considering that the contact with scCO2 happens after the hardening of the slurries. The microstructure was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermal Analysis (TG / DTG and DTA), hardness measured by Rockwell surface hardness (HR15T) and carbonated areas calculated after the pH indicator solution was sprayed. The slurries containing CR had reduced surface hardness and higher free water content, indicating a higher porosity in relation to pure cement slurries. The pozzolanic reactions of CR caused partial reduction of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] content and formation of cementitious compounds [C-S-H, C-A-S-H, C-A-H and Af(t)]. After exposure to scCO2, the pastes with CR had a larger area/depth of carbonation than the 0% CR paste. The formation of CaCO3 resulted in an increase in surface hardness mainly in the pastes with CR. Due to the reactions with scCO2, the CR-containing pastes had partially decalcified cementitious compounds but remained equivalent to or higher than those found in the 0% CR paste whose carbonatation caused a partial reduction of Ca(OH)2.

This work aims to investigate and develop a concept for CO2 separation based on PDMS/SSZ–13 (high-Si CHA) composite membranes. Firstly, an Al2O3 support was coated with SSZ-13 zeolite layer, then to increase the performance of the membrane, a Polydimethylsiloxane layer was effectively deposited homogeneously to cover the cracks and defects of the zeolite layer. The results of single gas permeation measurements displayed a notable increase in ideal CO2/CH4 selectivity up to 428 at the lowest PDMS concentration of 0.5 vol%. Moreover, a coating time of 10 min preserved CO2 permeance while increasing CO2/CH4 selectivity from 5 to 120. A twentyfold increase in CO2/CH4 selectivity was noted with mixed gas permeation without a reduction in CO2 permeance. Quantitative and qualitative microscopic analyses were also carried out on the coated membrane to better understand its morphology and microstructure. The outcomes indicated that PDMS layer decreased the permeation of N2 and CH4 and enhanced surface affinity toward CO2, resulting in reduced defects in the zeolite membranes and enhanced selectivity for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4.

ABSTRACT The objective of this work was to evaluate the plant-water relations, photosynthetic parameters and growth of macaw (Acrocomia aculeata (Jacp.) Lodd. ex Mart.) plants, thus, ten plants were subjected to three successive drought and rehydration cycles and ten other plants were irrigated normally as control. The drought cycles consisted of a suspension of irrigation until the net CO2 assimilation rate (A) reach values lower than 5% of the control, and a rehydration until a plants recover at least 85% of A of the control plants. Reductions in A, stomatal conductance (gs ) and transpiration (E), above 95%, were found with predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd) of -1.85 MPa. After rehydration, the gs and E of plants with and without water stress was not different, however, A presented a significant difference. Leaf water potentials below -0.5 MPa reduced the intracellular and atmospheric CO2 ratio and increased water use efficiency, and values of -1.85 MPa, when both showed an increase and decrease, respectively. The reduction of A and gs was linear and proportional to Ψpd. Total dry matter accumulation reduced by 50% in the plants subjected to drought. The cyclic water stress resulted in reduction of gas exchange and matter accumulation in macaw palm plants; a stomatal limitation of A occurred until Ψpd of -1.85 MPa, and then a non-stomatal limitation.

The technology of CO2-ESGR(CO2-enhanced shale gas recovery) is an effective means to practice energy saving and emission reduction and has drawn the attention of countries all over the world for its promising future. At present, the possibility and potential of the CO2-ESGR have been confirmed by some studies. However, the mechanism of shale gas occurrence is complex; existing studies have mainly focused on the static results of CH4 displacement by CO2. Therefore, the dynamic process of CH4 adsorbed in the shale being displaced by CO2 was simulated in this study. The results show that the process of CH4 displaced by CO2 is divided into the CH4 self-resolution phase, the displacement of residual CH4 by CO2, and the stabilization phase. Moreover, the diffusion and desorption of CH4 are less affected by pressure and pore size, and the effect of pressure and pore size on the diffusion and adsorption of CO2 is more significant. The high pressure enhances the adsorption capacity between the pore wall and CO2, which can promote the effect of CH4 displacement by CO2. In addition, another displacement phenomenon is derived in this study by examining the offset of the CO2 and CH4 density peak, in which CO2 only occupies part of the CH4 adsorption site and then both coexist for adsorption. This is different from the traditional theory that CO2 displaces CH4 by taking the place of it. It is conducive to revealing the dynamic mechanism of CO2 displacing CH4. An in-depth study of the dynamic repulsion mechanism of CH4 by CO2 in geological rock formations can promote the application of the CO2-ESGR technology.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">In the perspective of a reduction of emissions and a rapid decarbonisation, especially for compression ignition engines, hydrogen plays a decisive role. The dual fuel technology is perfectly suited to the use of hydrogen, a fuel characterized by great energy potential. In fact, replacing, at the same energy content, the fossil fuel with a totally carbon free one, a significant reduction of the greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and total hydrocarbon, as well as of the particulate matter can be obtained. The dual fuel with indirect injection of gaseous fuel in the intake manifold, involves the problem of hydrogen autoignition. In order to avoid this difficulty, the optimal conditions for the injection of the incoming mixture into the cylinder were experimentally investigated. All combustion processes are carried out on a research engine with optical access. The engine speed has is set at 1500 rpm, while the EGR valve is deactivated. The purpose of this work is to research the minimum amount of diesel fuel, which allows efficient and controlled hydrogen ignition. Starting from the dual fuel conditions investigated in previous works with two injections per cycle, one of the diesel injections was removed. Subsequently, the shift of the start of injection and the reduction of the energizing time of the diesel injection as well as the increase in the delivered mass of hydrogen are analysed. The final aim is to obtain an indicated mean effective pressure equal to the one previously analysed avoiding backfiring phenomena in the manifolds or abnormal engine operation. All the analysed tests are in ultra lean combustion conditions with premixed ratio higher than 95% and equivalence ratio higher than 0.32. From the investigated cases, it can be found that the best combustion efficiency is determined with a diesel start of injection around 10 before top dead centre, while the lowest amount of diesel corresponds to an energizing time of the injector equal to 209μs. Regarding the hydrogen injection in the intake manifold, a dependency on the intake valve timing is highlighted. Hydrogen was prevented from being thrown into the exhaust by starting its supply after the valve crossing; on the other hand, to avoid backfiring phenomena, it is noted that the hydrogen injection has to end prior to the compression phase commences. This information is of particular interest to fulfil engine decarbonisation optimizing the use of hydrogen in compression ignition engines and facilitating CFD analysis of hydrogen combustion in ultra lean conditions.</div></div>

Abstract Self-compacting concretes must simultaneously present fluidity and cohesion without the presence of exudation and segregation. These necessary characteristics of concrete in the fresh state are usually possible only through high contents of fines and, consequently, higher consumption of cement for its production. The consolidation of this material has instigated the search for solutions to reduce cement consumption and CO2 emissions. Aiming to contribute to environmental sustainability and the cement industry, this research study investigated the technical and economic feasibility of self-compacting concrete with low cement consumption. The densities of the concretes were determined, as well as their resistance to compression and diametral compression traction. The study analysed three concretes with reduced cement consumption and one reference concrete. The water/cement, fibre limestone/cement and active silica/cement ratios were maintained constant, while cement consumption ranged from 434.00 kg/m3 to 325.50 kg/m3, thus achieving a reduction of up to 25% in cement consumption. The results showed that it is feasible to produce self-compacting concrete with low cement consumption, guaranteeing the quality of its mechanical properties, with approximately cost reductions and CO2 emission of 6% and 19% respectively in relation to the reference concrete.

The concept of sector coupling is gaining international attention as a means to drive further decarbonization. Our study develops and simulates 27 sector coupling technology combinations based on assumptions derived from the literature and then evaluates their efficacy in meeting Germany's CO2 emission targets for 2030, 2045, and 2050, respectively. Our findings reveal that only ambitious technological pathways involving disruptive innovations in multiple sectors offer realistic pathways for achieving the country's decarbonization targets. Using a scoring system that incorporates technical and socioeconomic indicators, we reveal the relation between reductions in CO2 emissions and multi-criteria-based scores assigned to specific sector coupling scenarios. Our results favor emission reductions from both a socio-economic perspective and a purely economic one, and they highlight the benefits of disruptive sectoral linkages in achieving emission reduction targets. Nevertheless, none of the technology combinations analyzed here meet the more ambitious German emission targets set in 2021.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) of major arterial vascular territories, particularly in the contralateral hemodynamically unaffected hemisphere, in patients with unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) steno-occlusive disease compared to control subjects with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, twenty-seven patients with right-sided unilateral ICA steno-occlusive disease (age range, 25 to 91 years; 17 males) and twenty-one patients with left-sided unilateral ICA steno-occlusive disease (age range, 24 to 83 years; 14 males) and 41 control subjects were studied. CVR was quantitated as the change in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI signal (as a surrogate of cerebral blood flow), in response to a consistently applied step change in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The CVR of each major arterial vascular territory was assessed in the ipsilateral hemodynamically affected hemisphere and compared to the corresponding territory in the contralateral hemisphere. Results: In patients, a significant reduction in CVR was observed in the ipsilateral anterior circulation compared to that of the corresponding territory on the contralateral side (0.027 ± 0.083 vs. 0.109 ± 0.066% BOLD change/​mm Hg, p < 0.0001) and to controls (0.195 ± 0.054% BOLD change/mm Hg, p < 0.0001). The CVR of the contralateral anterior circulation was reduced on average by 50% compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The implication of these findings is that unilateral carotid stenosis affects the vascular reserve of both sides of the brain compared to control subjects. This indicates that the collateral blood flow support from the contralateral to the ipsilateral hemisphere comes at a cost of reduced reserve capacity in the contralateral hemisphere. The findings suggest that there may be a reduction in functional hyperemia associated with neuronal activation, not only affecting the hemisphere ipsilateral to an occlusion, but also the hemisphere contralateral to an occlusion. It remains to be determined if ‘stealing' from the ‘rich' to support the ‘poor' has clinical consequences over the long term.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a widely employed half-electrode reaction in oxygen electrochemistry, in applications such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, ammonia synthesis, and electrocatalytic hydrogenation. Unfortunately, its slow kinetics limits the commercialization of such applications. It is therefore highly imperative to develop highly robust electrocatalysts with high activity, long-term durability, and low noble-metal contents. Previously intensive efforts have been made to introduce the advancements on developing non-precious transition metal electrocatalysts and their OER mechanisms. Electronic structure tuning is one of the most effective and interesting ways to boost OER activity and spin angular momentum is an intrinsic property of the electron. Therefore, modulation on the spin states and the magnetic properties of the electrocatalyst enables the changes on energy associated with interacting electron clouds with radical absorbance, affecting the OER activity and stability. Given that few review efforts have been made on this topic, in this review, the-state-of-the-art research progress on spin-dependent effects in OER will be briefed. Spin engineering strategies, such as strain, crystal surface engineering, crystal doping, etc., will be introduced. The related mechanism for spin manipulation to boost OER activity will also be discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the development of spin catalysis are presented. This review aims to highlight the significance of spin engineering in breaking the bottleneck of electrocatalysis and promoting the practical application of high-efficiency electrocatalysts.

The presence of plastic waste in the environment poses a serious threat to all living beings and their immediate environment. The presence of micro and nano plastics in the environment has further endangered the soil health and aquatic life. The robust nature of plastics makes it stay in the environment for several years. Moreover, the processes like landfills and chemical treatments are not enough to handle the plastic waste generated at present, globally. Biodegradable plastics can offer a solution to the plastic waste issue, and could be beneficial for the environment. The bioplastics produced from the microorganisms like bacteria, microalgae, and macroalgae are potential candidates to replace the petroleum plastics with the biodegradable plastics. The use of biodegradable plastics leads to reduction in fossil fuel usage and thus reduces the carbon dioxide emissions. It also reduces the waste generation and thus aids in the recycling and reuse process. The current chapter deals with the various sources from which the biodegradable plastics can be produced, and the impact of plastic waste on agricultural lands, fresh, and marine water bodies. The technological readiness levels (TRLs) of the current technologies necessary for the production of biodegradable plastics, as well as the techno-economical aspects of the production process are discussed in the current chapter. Manufacturing, marketing, and acceptability of biodegradable plastics will affect the future of human kind in many ways. Thus, it is crucial to understand its manufacturing process, and its bottlenecks to further improve the overall process.

The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a reaction with a promise to provide a gainful means of utilizing an abundant greenhouse gas, methane, to produce ethylene; one of the world's most important chemicals is challenged by the co-production of carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas. The need to find efficient means of enhancing the reaction with a yield of the desirable C2 product and the reduction in the co-production of COx product continues to be the focus of increased research over the past two decades. The advent of modern computational techniques, including Density Functional Theory (DFT), and data analytical techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML), have inspired new ways of generating data and drawing intuition on the ways to improve the efficacy of the OCM reaction. This study focuses on highlighting the innovations carried out in the study of the OCM reaction over the last 22 years: the reaction mechanism, kinetics, and catalytic design. Despite the concerted efforts to model and design new catalysts, the development of improved catalysts that are selective for C2 yields higher than 30% at low temperatures continues to be a bottleneck in the process. The application of ML and DFT in OCM is poised to provide a means to predict, design, and develop new catalysts that will enhance the effectiveness of the reaction and the quality of the products. Both techniques provide opportunities to improve and ameliorate challenges bedeviling the OCM reaction, including the high activation energy, low C2 yield, and catalyst instability/deactivation.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added products provides a feasible pathway for mitigating net carbon emissions and storing renewable energy. However, the low dimerization efficiency of the absorbed CO intermediate (*CO) and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction hinder the selective electroreduction of CO2 to ethane (C2H6) with a high energy density. Here, we designed hydrophobic iodide-derived copper electrodes (I–Cu/Nafion) for reducing CO2 to C2H6. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H6 reached 23.37% at −0.7 V vs RHE over the I–Cu/Nafion electrode in an H-type cell, which was about 1.7 times higher than that of the I–Cu electrode. The hydrophobic properties of the I–Cu/Nafion electrodes led to an increase in the local CO2 concentration and stabilized the Cu+ species. In situ Raman characterizations and density functional theory calculations indicate that the enhanced performances could be ascribed to the strong *CO adsorption and decreased the formation energy of *COOH and *COCOH intermediates. This study highlights the effect of the hydrophobic surface on Cu-based catalysts in the electroreduction of CO2 and provides a promising way to adjust the selectivity of C2 products.

Peatbogs are important in global greenhouse gas budget estimates. The main aim of the work was to assess the amount of greenhouse gas emissions based on the Greenhouse Gas Emission Site Type (GEST) method and compare them with actual field measurements. The research was carried out in selected peatbog areas in the coastal zone of northern Poland. The proposed method allowed us to assess whether the restoration treatments carried out in peatbogs contributed to the emission of these gases. The results of this research using the GEST method indicate that, in the studied peatbog areas, the reduction in CO2 emissions was approximately 12%. These results were compared with actual measurements of greenhouse gas emissions made using the chamber method in 2018. The average CO2 emission for the entire peatbog was 16,338.7 t CO2-eq./yr. Comparing this result with the result obtained using the GEST method, it should be stated that it is lower by 2.464.1 t CO2-eq./year, which gives an approximately 13% overestimation of the result by the Gas Emission Site Type method.

Irrigation is a land management practice with major environmental impacts. However, global energy consumption and carbon emissions resulting from irrigation remain unknown. We assess the worldwide energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with irrigation, while also measuring the potential energy and carbon reductions achievable through the adoption of efficient and low-carbon irrigation practices. Currently, irrigation contributes 216 million metric tons of CO2 emissions and consumes 1896 petajoules of energy annually, representing 15% of greenhouse gas emissions and energy utilized in agricultural operations. Despite only 40% of irrigated agriculture relies on groundwater sources, groundwater pumping accounts for 89% of the total energy consumption in irrigation. Projections indicate that future expansion of irrigation could lead to a 28% increase in energy usage. Embracing highly efficient, low-carbon irrigation methods has the potential to cut energy consumption in half and reduce CO2 emissions by 90%. However, considering country-specific feasibility of mitigation options, global CO2 emissions may only see a 55% reduction. Our research offers comprehensive insights into the energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with irrigation, contributing valuable information that can guide assessments of the viability of irrigation in enhancing adaptive capacity within the agricultural sector.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Off-road diesel engines remain one of the most significant contributors to the overall oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>X</sub>) inventory and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has indicated that reductions of up to 90% from current standards may be necessary to achieve its air quality goals. In recognition of this, CARB has funded a program aimed at demonstrating emission control technologies for off-road engines. This program builds on previous efforts to demonstrate Low NO<sub>X</sub> technologies for on-road engines. The objective was to demonstrate technologies to reduce tailpipe NO<sub>X</sub> and particulate matter (PM) emissions by 90 and 75%, respectively, from the current Tier 4 Final standards. In addition, the emission reductions were to be achieved while also demonstrating a 5 to 8.6% carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction and remaining Greenhouse Gas (GHG) neutral with respect to nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). This paper focuses on the engine calibration efforts for aftertreatment (AT) thermal management and improved fuel economy which included a diesel Dynamic Skip Fire (dDSF™) calibration. Test results obtained with a development-aged (hydrothermal aging only) AT system over the applicable off-road test cycles and a low load cycle are presented. The emission control system and modified calibrations could achieve internal tailpipe (TP) NO<sub>X</sub> development targets with technologies suitable for production, allowing for a significant potential compliance margin. The level of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction was dependent on the test cycle with the target achievable without dDSF for all cycles except for the RMC where a 4% reduction was observed. The addition of dDSF reduced cycle CO<sub>2</sub> by an additional 0.5 to 3%, depending on the test cycle, and maintained higher AT temperatures which reduced the use of AT thermal management modes.</div></div>

Spain is among the 11 virtuous European countries that achieved the 2020 European targets, including the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the implementation of renewable energy. Yet, about 250 Mtons CO2 equivalent were still emitted in 2020 and is out of the question that the current efforts are not sufficient to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This Policy Brief aims to describe the current situation, critically analyze the trends, and give recommendations to the policy makers based on the ten-year experience of our group on CO2 emissions research.

Efficient energy utilization and decarbonization of energy systems are of paramount importance in tackling global climate change. A novel distributed energy system is proposed, integrating solar photovoltaics, methanol thermochemistry, solid oxide fuel cells, gas turbines, and CO2 capture. Methanol is reformed by photovoltaic waste heat to produce solar hydrogen-rich syngas, which is then efficiently converted to electricity by solid oxide fuel cells. High-purity CO2 is separated from the anode exhaust gas containing only CO2 and H2O through low-energy penalty separation via condensation of H2O, and is subsequently compressed for storage. Analysis demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms the reference system with parabolic trough solar collectors. The total electrical efficiency of the new system reaches 51.73%, surpassing that of the reference system by 5.02 percentage points, while solar-to-electricity efficiency improves by 19.69%. The overall exergy efficiency of the proposed system reaches 57.41%. The levelized cost of electricity and cost of CO2 avoided for the proposed system are 0.1163 $/kWh and 29.87 $/t, respectively, and the dynamic payback period is only 4.5 years. Sensitivity analyses indicate outstanding power generation performance, excellent CO2 reduction potential, and wide adaptability for regional applications.

ABSTRACT The response of leaf traits to irradiance and [CO2] in canopy leaves of several tall trees remains to be determined under natural conditions. Thus, the objective of this work was to determine gas-exchange parameters in sun and shade leaves of Dinizia excelsa Ducke in 35-45 m tall trees of Central Amazonia. We assessed light saturated photosynthesis (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs), mesophyll conductance (gm), transpiration rates (E), water use efficiency (WUE), intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi), maximum electron transport rate (Jmax), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vcmax), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci)specific leaf area (SLA) and fresh leaf thickness. We also estimated the CO2 concentration at the chloroplast level (Cc) and determined the light and CO2 saturated photosynthesis (Apot). Amax was obtained at light saturation (1200 µmol m-2 s-1), whereas Apot, Vcmax, Jmax and gm were obtained after constructing A/Ci response curves. There was a significant difference between sun and shade leaves in Ci and Cc, but for other parameters no differences were observed. Amax was positively correlated with gs, gm and E, and there was also a significant correlation between gs and gm (p ≤ 0.05), as well as between Jmax and Vcmax. Thicker leaves had higher values of Amax, gs, Ci, Cc and E. Apot was limited by the electron transport rate and by low gm. The canopy of the tree caused a decrease in irradiance (30-40%), but this reduction was not enough to reduce important photosynthetic parameters. Thus, all resources allocated to leaf production led to maximum use of the solar energy received by the leaves, which allowed this species to grow at fairly rapid rates.

ABSTRACT The market of stabilized, slow and controlled release nitrogen (N) fertilizers represents 1% of the world fertilizer consumption. On the other hand, the increase in availability, innovation and application of these technologies could lead to the improvement of N use efficiency in agroecossystems and to the reduction of environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to quantify agronomic efficiency relative index, ammonia volatilization, and CO2 emissions from conventional, stabilized and controlled release N fertilizers in corn summer crop. The experiment was carried out in a corn crop area located in Lavras, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, without irrigation. All treatments were applied in topdressing at rate of 150 kg ha-1 N. N-NH3 losses from N fertilizers were: Granular urea (39% of the applied N ) = prilled urea (38%) > urea coated with 16% S0 (32%) = blend of urea + 7.9% S0 + polymers + conventional urea (32%) > prilled urea incorporated at 0.02 m depth (24%) > urea + 530 mg kg-1 of NBPT (8%) = Hydrolyzed leather (9%) > urea + thermoplastic resin (3%) = ammonium sulfate (1%) = ammonium nitrate (0.7%). Thermoplastic resin coated urea, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate presented low values of cumulative CO2 emissions in corn crop. On the other hand, hydrolyzed leather promoted greater C-CO2 emission, when compared with other nitrogen fertilizers.

ABSTRACT: Accidents related to the rupture of iron ore tailings dams have dramatically impacted on the Brazilian natural ecosystem. So, the development of strategies to recover soil organic matter levels and build-up Technosols are required. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of N-mineral and -organic fertilization and the rhizospheric effect on soil organic matter mineralization from Technosols built under iron ore tailings. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse; we used a factorial scheme 2 × 2 × 3: without and with the plant Crotalaria juncea ; without and with mineral fertilization; and three different organic fertilization (without organic fertilization, sewage sludge, and household waste composting), with four randomized blocks. The experimental units were PVC columns installed with a top layer of iron ore tailing from a dam, where gases were sampled to determine the CO2-C, CH4-C concentrations, and CO2-δ13C. The organic fertilization promoted a positive priming effect of 184 %. However, with mineral fertilization, no effect was observed in soil derived-CO2-C accumulated and priming effect. Similarly to non-planted soil, the planted soils with mineral and organic fertilization promoted a steady reduction in soil derived-CO2-C accumulated and rhizosphere priming effect. The soil with mineral fertilization improved in 5.52 and 0.45 g per column the shoot and root dry matter of Crotalaria when compared to the soil without mineral fertilization. In summary, the organic fertilization in Technosols built over iron ore tailings dams during revegetation was not enough to ensure the plant development and preservation of soil organic matter. However, the combination of mineral and organic fertilization promoted negative rhizosphere priming effect and a significant increase in plant biomass.

There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of nasal high flow (NHF) to treat acute respiratory failure, particularly in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. Conversely, there are sparse data evaluating its effects in stable COPD patients. We identified randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of delivering air or oxygen via NHF, compared with delivering the same gas without NHF, in stable COPD patients through a systematic search using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Science Direct, and others sources until January 2019. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool) was performed by two independent authors. We included 6 studies (339 participants). Our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) at long (two studies, MD −3 mmHg, [95% Confidence interval (CI) −4 to −2]) and short-term (two studies, MD -3 mmHg [95% CI −4 to −2]). NHF significantly improved quality of life on the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (two studies, MD −5 out of 100, [95% CI −8 to −2]). NHF significantly reduced the rate of acute exacerbation at 1 year (one study, rate ratio: 0.6, [95% CI 0.6 to 0.7]). NHF did not significantly improve exercise capacity, hospitalization rate or mortality, but improved breathing pattern. NHF reduced PaCO2, acute exacerbation and improved quality of life in stable COPD patients. Further long-term studies are needed to confirm the present results and provide more data on patient-centered outcome such as quality of life, exacerbation, hospitalization and mortality.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into multi-carbon containing products with high activity and selectivity still remains a big challenge. Herein, we propose a novel Cu-SACs (Cu single atoms catalyst) supported on tin-tin oxide (CuSA-Sn-SnO2) synthesized following a simple wetness impregnation and sequential reduction method for the direct conversion of CO2 into ethanol, which shows good product selectivity, activity, and stability. It is confirmed that the copper single atoms with an oxidation state close to 1 are stabilized on the Sn-SnO2 substrates. The electrochemical analysis of Sn-SnO2 displays selectivity towards other products apart from CO and H2. With the impregnation with Cu single atoms, the products on the Sn-SnO2 surface shifts from HCOOH to ethanol. With the increase in Cu content, the ethanol production increases at the expense of CO, pointing towards dimerization of C1 products. The synthesized catalyst exhibited a remarkable selectivity as high as 74 % at −0.7 V vs RHE towards ethanol production with high stability.

Lead (Pb) poisoning and CO2-induced global warming represent two exemplary environmental and energy issues threatening humanity. Various biomass-derived materials are reported to take up Pb and convert CO2 electrochemically into low-valent carbon species, but these works address the problems separately rather than settle the issues simultaneously. In this work, cheap, natural ellagic acid (EA) extracted from common plants is adopted to assemble a stable metal-organic framework (MOF), EA-Pb, by effective capture of Pb2+ ions in an aqueous medium (removal rate close to 99%). EA-Pb represents the first structurally well-defined Pb-based MOF showing selective electrocatalytic CO2-to-HCOO- conversion with Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.37% at -1.08 V versus RHE. The catalytic mechanism is studied by 13CO2 labeling, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and theoretical calculation. The use of EA-Pb as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction represents a 2-in-1 solution of converting detrimental wastes (Pb2+) as well as natural resources (EA) into wealth (electrocatalytic EA-Pb) for addressing the global warming issue.

Coated Titanium Anodes (CTAs) exhibit significant potential in addressing the high energy consumption challenge inherent in current manganese electrowinning processes. However, the electrodeposition of manganese dioxide (MnO2) at the anode limits the utilization of CTAs in conventional manganese electrolytic cells. Herein, a novel H+ exchange membrane (HEM) electrolytic cell was proposed and applied to manganese electrowinning employing Ti/IrO2 − RuO2 − SiO2 anode. The HEM electrolytic cell is a three-chamber electrolytic reactor consisting of cathode chamber, acidification chamber and anode chamber separated by woven terylene diaphragm and HEM. The results indicated that after 24 h of electrowinning, the cathodic current efficiency (CE) of 85.1 % was achieved, along with a specific energy consumption (EC) of 4189 kW·h/t. Compared to conventional industrial electrowinning technology, this represents an increase in CE by more than 15 % and a reduction in EC by over 1400 kW·h/t. The unique structure of the HEM electrolytic cell effectively prevents MnO2 deposition, ensuring the functionality of the CTAs and eliminating the generation of anode mud. Additionally, the H+ from the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode is collected and concentrated in the acidification chamber. This resulted in a spent electrolyte with 15.2 g/L H2SO4, enabling its reuse in extracting manganese ores. Employing the HEM electrolytic cell with a Ti/IrO2 − RuO2 − SiO2 anode for manganese electrowinning is therefore considered an energy-efficient and clean approach. It is highly recommended for saving energy and reducing carbon emissions in industrial processes.

Scientific consensus affirms human activity, particularly carbon emissions from market participants, drives global warming. Foreign investment, crucial for sustainability in developing nations, now faces scrutiny regarding its impact on environmental quality in emerging economies. This study examines the influence of Chinese Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) and fintech on environmental conditions in the top five Chinese-invested African economies, alongside factors such as energy consumption, economic performance, and unemployment affecting CO2 pollution. Quarterly data from 2006–2021 confirm cointegration among variables via panel unit root and cointegration tests. Panel ARDL method estimates coefficients for short and long-run effects. Our findings reveal: (1) A 1% increase in Chinese investment leads to a 0.56% decrease in CO2 emissions, supporting its positive environmental impact. (2) Fintech adoption also demonstrates a beneficial effect, with a 1% increase associated with a 0.18% reduction in CO2 levels. (3) Total energy consumption, as expected, has a detrimental impact, causing a 0.92% increase in CO2 emissions with a 1% rise. (4) Interestingly, economic growth fosters environmental sustainability, while unemployment correlates negatively with it. These findings suggest that targeted Chinese investments and fintech adoption can aid in mitigating CO2 pollution in African economies while balancing economic considerations.

Single-atomic-site catalysts have been demonstrated as promising candidates for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). However, the universal construction strategies need to be further developed to synthesize the desired single-atomic-site catalysts with high eCO2RR activity for feasible CO2 utilization. Herein, a novel 2-methylimidazole-phthalocyanine-Ni (IM4NiPc) coordinatively modified ZIF-8 was rationally fabricated and applied to derive the single-atomic-Ni electrocatalyst (Ni-N-C-l), which is capable of delivering much improved activity for eCO2RR, compared to the pristine IM4NiPc immobilized onto ZIF-8-derived N-doped carbon surface, and is also comparable to the best reported catalysts. The satisfied Faradaic efficiency, current density and stability of CO2-to-CO electroconversion over Ni-N-C-l are shown to originate from the verified Ni-N4 configuration, particularly, reaching a CO Faradaic efficiency of 99% in a wide potential range. Moreover, based on the outstanding eCO2RR activity of Ni-N-C-l, we successfully realized the exemplary synthesis of amide polymer materials through CO-mediated electro/thermocatalytic cascade processes, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing CO2 for material manufacturing. This finding is expected to provide useful insight on the precise design and rational synthesis of the novel single-atomic-site catalysts for future CO2 intelligent utilization.

ABSTRACT: Piper betle L. is edible plant richer in polyphenols that might improve feed utilization in rumen diet. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of various Piper betle L. powder (PL) doses on in vitro rumen microorganisms, ruminal biogas and fermentation end-product production, and biohydrogenation including lipolysis-isomerization. The completely randomized design used five levels of PL supplementation (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg DM) incubated with 400 mg of a basal substrate of Pangola hay and concentrate (50:50). The matrix compounds (g/kg DM) of 0.27 catechin, 0.11 rutin, 3.48 quercetin, 0.41 apigenin, 0.04 myricetin, 0.27 kaempferol, 0.76 eugenol and 0.22 caryophyllene derived from PL altered the fermentation pattern, with an increase in degradable nutrients and total volatile fatty acids and acetogenesis without shifting pH during fermentation. These values promoted in vitro gas production, with higher carbon dioxide and lower methane production. Although, hydrogen recovery from lipolysis-isomerization in biohydrogenation was limited, PL successfully promoted stearic acid (C18:0) accumulation by changing the biohydrogenation pathway of fatty acids, causing more C18:1 trans-11 rather than C18:2 trans-11, cis-15. Consequently, this resulted in more conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) cis-9, trans-11, CLA trans-10, cis-12 and CLA trans-11, cis-13. Enhanced PL supply increased total bacteria and fungal zoospores due to a reduction in rumen protozoa. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that PL is a feed additive with potential for ruminants, promising improved ruminal fermentation and biohydrogenation, while reducing methane production.

The researcher examines the impact of public procurement on environmental concerns. The purpose of the study was to find out the impact of public procurement on environmental concerns. This study focused on the National Environment Management Authority as a case study. This study might help the National Environment Management Authority better advice the public on how to protect the environment through minimizing, reusing, and recycling the environment. The study was both descriptive and analytical, and the following instruments were used for collecting data: interviews, questionnaires, and documentary reviews. A sample section was used to select respondents who could participate in the research. The researcher recommends two types of public procurement. The government was to set minimum environmental standards for the procurement of a variety of goods. These standards were mandatory within the central government departments and agencies, as well as elsewhere in the public sector. The government was committed to sustainable procurement, which means only purchasing goods and services that are needed and buying items whose production, use, and disposal minimize negative impacts on the environment and society. Procurement is an important tool for helping a government meet its targets for operating sustainably, for example, by minimizing its use of energy and carbon dioxide emissions, water consumption, and waste levels, and increasing its recycling rates. Sustainable procurement also offers the opportunity and power to influence suppliers and the products they develop and design for the wider benefit of the economy and the environment. Partnership is a long-term collaborative form of relationship that is based on a high level of trust. The reason for this relationship with suppliers is risk reduction and product development to achieve better solutions.

PHOX2B is a transcription factor essential for the development of different classes of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. Heterozygous mutations in the PHOX2B coding region are responsible for the occurrence of Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare neurological disorder characterised by inadequate chemosensitivity and life-threatening sleep- related hypoventilation. Animal studies suggest that chemoreflex defects are caused in part by the improper development or function of PHOX2B expressing neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a central hub for CO2 chemosensitivity.Although the function of PHOX2B in rodents during development is well established, its role in the adult respiratory network remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether reduction in PHOX2B expression in chemosensitive neuromedin-B (NMB) expressing neurons in the RTN altered respiratory function. Four weeks following local RTN injection of a lentiviral vector expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Phox2b mRNA, a reduction of PHOX2B expression was observed in Nmb neurons compared to both naïve rats and rats injected with the non-target shRNA. PHOX2B knockdown did not affect breathing in room air or under hypoxia, but ventilation was significantly impaired during hypercapnia. PHOX2B knockdown did not alter Nmb expression but it was associated with reduced the expression of both Task2 and Gpr4, two CO2 sensors in the RTN. We conclude that PHOX2B in the adult brain has an important role in CO2 chemoreception and reduced PHOX2B expression in CCHS beyond the developmental period may contribute to the impaired central chemoreflex function.

Biodiesel contains unsaturated methyl esters making it susceptible to oxidation reaction. Among the factors that cause oxidative instability is the contamination by transition metal ions that in small quantities catalyze the oxidation reaction. The objective of this work was to evaluate the relative protection factor of rosemary extract, in biodiesel, in the presence of transition metal ions. Chromatographic analysis and characterization of biodiesel were performed as well as the quantification of total phenolic compounds and extract activity. The ions Cr3+, Co2+ and Fe2+, at a concentration of 3.95 x 10-3 mol L-1, were added to the biodiesel with and without rosemary extract. The samples were submitted to the Rancimat test and to infrared region analyses. The infrared region spectra of the samples with Cr3+ are in accordance with the least catalytic power of this ion under the biodiesel oxidation. Samples with Co2+ ions, without extract, presented bands of aldehydes, and samples with Fe2+ ions show the formation of peroxide radicals, without rosemary extract at 48h. The antioxidant effect of the extract in biodiesel is observed by the reduction of the induction period of the samples. The relative protection factor proved to be a good tool to evaluate its efficiency.

Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest,particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act ascarbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or “blue carbon” systems. Herewe compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collectedin pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within thesame geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The meanestimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes)were 402 78, 830 109, and 723 100 Mg C ha􀀀1, respectively, conservativelyestimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differencebetween C stocks per area (C ha􀀀1) considering each habitat type and between specificestuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasinglevels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potentialloss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 118,635tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of theseresults are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports theprotection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertaintiesof the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

Li-CO2 batteries are regarded as promising high-energy-density energy conversion and storage devices, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CORR/COER) kinetics. Due to the various crystal structures and unique electronic configuration, Mn-based cathode catalysts have shown considerable competition to facilitate CORR/COER. However, the specific active sites and regulation principle of Mn-based catalysts remain ambiguous and limited. Herein, we design novel Mn dual-active sites supported on N-doped carbon nanofibers (MOC@NCNF) and conduct a comprehensive investigation into the underlying relationship between different Mn active sites and their electrochemical performance in Li-CO2 batteries. Impressively, we find that owing to the in-situ generation and stable existence of Mn(III), MOC undergoes obvious electrochemical reconstruction during battery cycling. Moreover, a series of characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the different electronic configurations and coordination environments of Mn(II) and Mn(III) are conducive to promoting CORR and COER, respectively. Benefiting from such a modulating behavior, the Li-CO2 batteries deliver a high full discharge capacity of 10.31 mAh cm-2, and ultra-long cycle life (327 cycles/1308 h). This fundamental understanding of MOC reconstruction and the electrocatalytic mechanisms provides a new perspective for designing high-performance multivalent Mn-integrated hybrid catalysts for Li-CO2 batteries.

ABSTRACT: Chemical weathering and soil removal rates are responsible for the Earth’s landscape, composition of surface and groundwater, producing the soils and buffering the composition of the atmosphere. This study aimed to assess the chemical weathering and soil removal rates in the Sorocaba River basin, São Paulo State, Brazil, allowing answering the questions about the dynamics of fluvial transport of dissolved and suspended solids, the chemical weathering processes and associated atmospheric/soil CO2 consumption, and the relationship between chemical weathering and soil erosion rates. The annual specific flux of total suspended solids and total dissolved solids were 49.59 and 60.97 t/km2/yr. The chemical weathering process dominant in the Sorocaba River basin was the monosiallitization (RE = 2.4), with an associated atmospheric/soil CO2 consumption of 2.3 × 105 mol/km2/yr. The chemical weathering and soil removal rates were 7.2 and 29.8 m/Myr, respectively, indicating a soil thickness reduction. Finally, the soil removal rate in the Sorocaba River basin is almost 3-fold higher than the Cenozoic soil removal rates, being this difference related to the current land use which increased the soil removal processes.

ABSTRACT The cultivation of irrigated guava in semi-arid areas highlights the need for information regarding its responses to irrigation water quality and the fertilization management that enables its exploitation. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of water salinity and nitrogen (N) doses on the growth and physiology of the guava cv. ‘Paluma’. The experiments was conducted in drainage lysimeters under field conditions in an experimental area at the Center of Sciences and Agri-Food Technology of the Federal University of Campina Grande (CCTA/UFCG), Campus II, in Pombal, PB, Brazil. The experiment had a randomized block design, and treatments consisted of a 5 x 4 factorial arrangement corresponding to five levels of irrigation water electrical conductivity, ECw (0.3, 1.1, 1.9, 2.7, and 3.5 dS m-1), and four N doses (70, 100, 130, and 160% of the recommended N dose). The 100% dose corresponded to 541.1 mg of N dm-3 of soil. Increments in irrigation water salinity from 0.3 dS m-1 led to a reduction in stomatal conductance, internal CO2 concentration, CO2 assimilation rate, transpiration, instantaneous water use efficiency, the number of leaves and branches, stem diameter, and absolute and relative growth rates. Nitrogen doses ranging from 378.7 to 865.7 mg of N dm-3 of soil did not affect gas exchange and plant growth. Although ‘Paluma’ guava growth was affected by increases in water salinity, these plants can be irrigated using water of up to 1.42 dS m-1 with an acceptable reduction of 10% in growth variables. The interaction between irrigation water salinity and N fertilization had no significant effect on any of the variables studied.

Previously, we reported an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-1A derivative able to produce succinic acid (SA) from glycerol with net CO2 fixation. Apart from an engineered glycerol utilization pathway, the strain was equipped with the reductive branch of the TCA cycle (rTCA) and a heterologous SA exporter. However, the results indicated that a significant amount of carbon still entered the CO2-releasing oxidative TCA cycle. The current study aimed to tune down the flux through the oxidative TCA cycle by targeting the mitochondrial uptake of pyruvate and cytosolic intermediates of the rTCA pathway, as well as the succinate dehydrogenase complex. Thus, we tested the effects of deletions of MPC1, MPC3, OAC1, DIC1, SFC1, and SDH1 on SA production. The highest improvement was achieved by the combined deletion of MPC3 and SDH1. The respective strain produced up to 45.5 g/L of SA, reached a maximum SA yield of 0.66 gSA/gglycerol, and accumulated the lowest amounts of byproducts. Based on the obtained data, we consider a further reduction of mitochondrial import of pyruvate and rTCA intermediates highly attractive. Moreover, the approaches presented in the current study might also be valuable for improving SA production when sugars (instead of glycerol) are the source of carbon.

The urgent need to address environmental issues, particularly the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, has become a global priority. In this pursuit, various technologies are being explored to facilitate the promotion of sustainability. This study focuses on a virtual energy hub (VEH) integrated with Plug-in hybrid gas-electric vehicles (PHGEVs), various energy sources, and storage devices. However, the presence of fossil-based energy sources like combined heat and power (CHP), diesel generation (DG), boilers, and gas-based operation modes of PHGEVs, resulted in the release of carbon emissions. In this concern, the power-to-gas (P2G) technology, with its immense potential, is being considered to absorb and recycle captured CO2 emissions into methane gas, thereby enhancing economic and sustainability perspectives. Furthermore, uncertain parameters including the charge and discharge of PHGEVs, the price of the day-ahead market for heat and power, energy demands, and wind speed are considered in the VEH, the management of which is achieved through the downside risk constraint (DRC) method. The proposed model is implemented and tested on an IEEE 33-bus test system. Results show that P2G reduces the CO2 level by a mean of 3.7%. Also, for the minimum of 3.2% profit reduction, the risk level has fallen by nearly 100%.

Abstract Diverse agroforestry practices are prevalent in different Agro-Climatic regions of India and occupies substantial area. In Northern India’s Indo-Gangetic plains, agroforestry activities with respect to (eucalyptus) Eucalyptus tereticornis and (poplar) Populus deltoides based practices are very dominant. These agroforestry systems not only satisfy the need for wood to Wood-based Industries, but also contribute significantly to employment generation and the reduction of atmospheric Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) vis-à-vis mitigating climate change. Mapping and monitoring agroforestry areas by using the LISS-III and LISS-IV Multispectral High Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing data in the Yamunanagar district of Haryana has been undertaken to develop an operational method in the present research. Supervised classification method was used for land use land cover analysis for the year 2010 and 2019 in which training sites for seven parameters viz , agroforestry (Poplar, Eucalyptus based), agriculture, plantations (Horticulture, Scrub plantations, miscellaneous plantations) water bodies, forest, buildups, riverbed areas were mapped and monitored. The maximum area was estimated under agroforestry systems i.e. 4.06 and 9.69 percent, which includes both poplar and eucalyptus based Agri-silviculture and boundary systems for the year 2010 and 2019 respectively. Agricultural land, forests and other plantations constitute about 73.56%, 11.08% and 1.96% in 2010 and 67.77%, 10.99%, 1.7% in the year 2019 respectively of total district area. The accuracy of the image classification was delineated based on the ground truth data collected from the Yamunanagar district by using GPS (Global Positioning System) and accuracy found in Agroforestry was 90%.

Three novel conjugated porous organic polymers, denoted as C-POP1-3 and which consist of alternating pyrene cores with various contorted fluorene surrogates, were successfully synthesized from a versatile one-pot palladium-catalyzed [3+2] cyclocondensation reaction. The resulting polymers were obtained in excellent yields and displayed weight-average molecular weights (Mw) ranging from 12.2 to 20.2 kg/mol with polydispersity indices (Mw/Mn) ranging between 1.8 and 2.4, suggesting that the molecular masses are narrowly distributed and thus implying homogeneous polymer chains. Thermal stability exploration of C-POP1-3 by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed an impressive robustness with a 10% weight reduction temperature attaining 485 °C. Investigation of the inherent microporosity properties of C-POP1-3 via nitrogen adsorption experiments using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory discloses their surface areas which reach up to 560 m2 g-1 and pore volumes averaging 0.47 cm3 g-1. The target conjugated polymers were explored as adsorbents disclosing a maximum carbon dioxide adsorption of 83.0 mg g-1 at 273 K and low pressure for C-POP1, whereas iodine sorption tests portrayed prominent outcomes, notably for C-POP3 which proved to owe a strong affinity toward the hitherto mentioned halogen by achieving a maximum adsorption of 2220 mg g-1. Additionally, recyclability experiments confirmed the possibility to regenerate the polymers' adsorption capabilities even after seven consecutive cycles of adsorption-desorption cycles, which qualify them as auspicious iodine adsorbents.

The separation of CO2 from N2 remains a highly challenging task in postcombustion CO2 capture processes, primarily due to the relatively low CO2 content (3–15%) compared to that of N2 (70%). This challenge is particularly prominent for carbon-based adsorbents that exhibit relatively low selectivity. In this study, we present a successfully implemented strategy to enhance the selectivity of composite aerogels made of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and functionalized polymer particles. Considering that the CO2/N2 selectivity of the aerogels is affected on the one hand by the surface chemistry (offering more sites for CO2 capture) and fine-tuned microporosity (offering molecular sieve effect), both of these parameters were affected in situ during the synthesis process. The resulting aerogels exhibit improved CO2 adsorption capacity and a significant reduction in N2 adsorption at a temperature of 25 °C and 1 atm, leading to a more than 10-fold increase in selectivity compared to the reference material. This achievement represents the highest selectivity reported thus far for carbon-based adsorbents. Detailed characterization of the aerogel surfaces has revealed an increase in the quantity of surface oxygen functional groups, as well as an augmentation in the fractions of micropores (<2 nm) and small mesopores (<5 nm) as a result of the modified synthesis methodology. Additionally, it was found that the surface morphology of the aerogels has undergone important changes. The reference materials feature a surface rich in curved wrinkles with an approximate diameter of 100 nm, resulting in a selectivity range of 50–100. In contrast, the novel aerogels exhibit a higher degree of oxidation, rendering them stiffer and less elastic, resembling crumpled paper morphology. This transformation, along with the improved functionalization and augmented microporosity in the altered aerogels, has rendered the aerogels almost completely N2-phobic, with selectivity values ranging from 470 to 621. This finding provides experimental evidence for the theoretically predicted relationship between the elasticity of graphene-based adsorbents and their CO2/N2 selectivity performance. It introduces a new perspective on the issue of N2-phobicity. The outstanding performance achieved, including a CO2 adsorption capacity of nearly 2 mmol/g and the highest selectivity of 620, positions these composites as highly promising materials in the field of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) postcombustion technology.

ABSTRACT Inferior quality water can be used by agricultural producers in arid and semi-arid regions due to the lower availability of good-quality water. Therefore, the objective was to identify the influence of irrigation with saline water on gas exchange and leaf contents in corn (Zea mays L.) crop. The work was conducted in the field, in the experimental area of the Experimental Farm of the University of International Integration of Afro-Brazilian Lusofonia (UNILAB), Redenção-CE. The experimental design used in the research was randomized blocks, with five treatments: 1.0; 2.0; 3.0; 4.0 and 5.0 dS m-1 and four repetitions. At 45 days after sowing (DAS) the gas exchange variables were evaluated: transpiration, stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, internal CO2 concentration, water use efficiency and leaf temperature. And at 110 DAS the contents of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in plant leaves. The saline stress due to saltwater irrigation leads to a reduction in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, internal CO2 concentration and transpiration in field maize plants. Salt stress reduces the levels of N, P, K, Ca and Mg mineral elements in maize leaves.

The Mountain Pass mine is recognized as one of the world's primary sources of rare earth minerals. These rare earth minerals mainly consist of bastnaesite and a small amount of monazite phosphate, which cannot be decomposed and recovered through conventional oxidative roasting and hydrochloric acid leaching process. An efficient, clean, and economical process called the "combined method" was proposed for the utilization of the Mountain Pass mine to extract rare earths from Mountain Pass rare earth concentrate (MPREC). The main steps of this process include weak oxidation atmosphere roasting, step leaching of hydrochloric acid, solid-liquid separation, the monazite slag with sulfuric acid roasting water leaching, etc. In this paper, the roasting process of MPREC under a weak oxidation atmosphere was investigated. The study examines the thermal decomposition kinetics, phase transition process, and leaching behavior of MPREC in air/CO2 atmosphere. Results show that, the activation energy (Ea) for MPREC thermal decomposition in air and CO2 atmosphere are 146 and 320 kJ/mol, respectively. At temperature above 500 °C in air or above 700 °C in CO2 atmosphere, REOF are generated from bastnaesite through an in-situ reaction with CaO, which is decomposed from CaCO3, to form CaF2 and rare earth oxide (REO). Thus, F is regulated into solid phase. In an oxidizing atmosphere, the thermal decomposition of bastnaesite is accompanied by the rapid oxidation of Ce(Ⅲ). In contrast, the oxidation of Ce(Ⅲ) in a CO2 atmosphere is significantly inhibited. At 700 °C, the oxidation rate of Ce in air is 74.09%, while in a CO2 atmosphere, it is only 33.83%. The hydrochloric acid leaching experiment shows that, the leaching rate of rare earth after roasting at 600 °C under an air atmosphere reaches to 82.9%, and it reaches 87% after roasting at 800 °C under a CO2 atmosphere. The reduction of Ce oxidation in a weak oxidizing atmosphere significantly improves the leaching rate of Ce.

The EU Carbon-CAP project assembled a comprehensive portfolio of consumer initiatives in order to assess the potential total impact of consumer options on national carbon footprints. Existing evaluations of behavioural change have focused primarily on direct energy reductions, typically in households and buildings. However, changes in consumer demand have deeper impacts via their upstream supply chains. The consumer behaviour options considered in the portfolio focus on green household initiatives. Combining existing micro-level studies with a multiregional input-output economic model, we estimated the potential efficacy and uptake of each behaviour across the European Union (EU). The results suggest that adopting these consumer options could reduce carbon footprints by approximately 25%. While 75% of this is delivered as reductions in emissions within Europe, one-quarter of the effect is delivered as a reduced imported carbon footprint, due to changes in the composition of imports. Key policy insightsConsumer initiatives can have a big effect on embodied carbon imports, in addition to domestic impactsWe connect a portfolio of ∼90 green behaviour changes to a global supply chain database to model impacts holisticallyWe estimate that with reasonable levels of adoption green consumer actions can reduce the EU CO2 footprint by 25%A quarter of this effect is delivered in the form of reduced embodied emissions in imports Consumer initiatives can have a big effect on embodied carbon imports, in addition to domestic impacts We connect a portfolio of ∼90 green behaviour changes to a global supply chain database to model impacts holistically We estimate that with reasonable levels of adoption green consumer actions can reduce the EU CO2 footprint by 25% A quarter of this effect is delivered in the form of reduced embodied emissions in imports

ABSTRACT The negative impacts caused by civil construction to the environment are motivated mainly by the demand for natural resources. The cement industry stands out for being responsible for about 5% of global CO2 emissions. Strategies have been used to reduce these emissions, such as increasing the performance of the binder by reducing its content in the production of concrete, through dosing methods with the particle packing. In this sense, the objective of the study was to evaluate the behavior of low-cement concrete, and addition of Plant Biomass Ash (PBA), exposed to sodium sulfate. An experimental study was carried out characterizing the materials used, an evaluation of the dimensional changes of mortar specimens and analysis of the cracking of the pieces, physical and mechanical tests on concrete submitted to two curing processes (sodium sulfate solution or conventional curing). The mix was developed with the aid of the EMMA packaging software and spreadsheet available in the literature, in which the cement content was reduced by 10, 15 and 20% by weight, replacing with PBA. The reference material showed a significant reduction in expansion when exposed to sulfate solution compared to samples submitted to conventional curing. As for mixtures added with PBA, they showed a reduction in strength when exposed for conventional curing and better behavior when exposed to the aggressive sulfate medium, both in strength and in expansion for the mixes with 10 and 15% cement reduction, the latter being considered efficient for aggressive environments.

Spilling has already occurred as a result of rising the penetration of intermittent renewable generation, and it is anticipated that the level of renewable energy curtailment will continue to soar. This leads to an increase in operating costs, CO2 emissions, and not good utilization of renewable energy resources. A bi-level multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper to reduce wind power spillage (WPS) based on demand response (DR) and dynamic thermal line rating (DTLR). In the upper level, multiple objectives will be satisfied based on the optimal allocation and time of DR programs considering DTLR obtained in the lower level. The minimization of WPS, load shedding, power losses, and CO2 emissions are the objectives of this level. While the lower-level aims to maximize social welfare under different scenarios and overall system constraints. Under the uncertainty of the wind power and load demand, a collection of lower-level problems that represent the market clearing conditions is used to constrain the upper-level. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is examined on a modified two-area IEEE 24-bus test system. Results depict that the suggested bi-level model enables considerable reductions in the WPS by up to 32.7 %. Also, there is an enhancement in load shedding, power losses, and CO2 emissions by 28.93 %, 23.07 %, and 13.9 % respectively. Finally, the social welfare increased by up to 36.6 %.

ABSTRACT This study aimed to evaluate the gas exchanges and photosynthetic pigments of soursop seedlings cv. ‘Morada Nova’ irrigated with saline waters and subjected to exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide by seed soaking and foliar spraying. The study was carried out using plastic bags under greenhouse conditions at the Center of Technology and Natural Resources of the Federal University of Campina Grande, PB, Brazil, using a eutrophic Regolithic Neosol of sandy loam texture. Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design, in 5 x 5 factorial scheme, which consisted of five levels of electrical conductivity – ECw (0.7; 1.4; 2.1; 2.8 and 3.5 dS m-1) of irrigation water and five concentrations of hydrogen peroxide - H2O2 (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 µM), with four replicates and three plants per plot. As the salt stress increased, there were reductions in internal CO2 concentration, instantaneous carboxylation efficiency and water use efficiency, and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency was the most sensitive variable. Hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM attenuated the deleterious effects of water salinity on stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation rate and chlorophyll a content, and the concentration of 25 µM was the most efficient. The content of chlorophyll b and carotenoids of soursop cv. ‘Morada Nova’ had the deleterious effects caused by the salinity of irrigation water mitigated by the exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide in the concentration of 25 μM.

The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Indonesia in the Paris Agreement targeted emission reductions of 29% on its own and 41% with international cooperation in 2030, followed by Net Zero Emissions (NZE) in 2060. To achieve NZE, Indonesia enacted a carbon tax policy on April 1, 2022. The 2022–2024 carbon tax is limited to Steam Power Plants and will be imposed on other sectors by 2030. This research examines the ratio legis of carbon cost policies in Indonesia and compares the core of carbon tax policies in Indonesia with Sweden and Finland. Indonesia is starting to implement a Carbon Pricing policy under the ‘Cap-and-Tax’ scheme. The Cap scheme will be a means to force changes in the business culture in Indonesia, so the companies will pay attention to and reduce the carbon emission produced to avoid paying penalties for carbon exceeding the limits. Meanwhile, the Carbon Tax will provide economic resources to Indonesia to develop environmentally friendly technologies, fund research on renewable energy, and provide incentives for environmentally friendly businesses during the transition process to a carbon culture in Indonesia. Referring to the results of the comparison of carbon pricing policies in Finland and Sweden, Indonesia can gradually increase the cost of carbon taxes starting from Rp30,000/US$2 per ton CO2 equivalent to US$10 per ton CO2 equivalent. Meanwhile, for the imposition of high carbon tax rates, such as in Finland (US$73.02 per ton CO2 equivalent) and Sweden (US$137 per ton CO2 equivalent), Indonesia must carry out tax reforms, so the applied carbon tax is able to reduce carbon emissions without causing adverse impacts for the Indonesian economy.

With the increasing demand of passenger and freight air transportation and their key role in energy consumptions, this study developed a hybrid framework integrating machine learning algorithms to predict passenger and freight demand in air transportation and analyzed the impacts of the air transportation demand on energy consumption and CO2 emission. Critical variables are identified through correlation analyses between air transportation characteristics and economic, social, and environmental components, which are further selected to predict the air passenger and freight transportation demand. A hybrid framework is then developed where pairwise machine learning algorithms are developed to enhance prediction accuracy with an optimization model. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the effects of passenger and freight demand on energy consumption and CO2 emission. The framework is employed using Canadian air transportation as a case study. The pairwise machine learning algorithms are compared to single algorithm which increases prediction accuracy by 24.5% for passenger demand and by 25.85% for freight demand. It is predicted that the air passenger will increase by 94% to 94.25% and freight transportation demand will increase by 28.12% to 33.97% in 2050 relative to 2019 level. This surge can raise energy consumption and CO2 emission by 8.91% to 9.46% and 11.32% to 12.12% respectively. A 50% decrease in both air passenger and freight transport demand will result in a 5.43% reduction in energy consumption in Canada's transportation sector. Conversely, if demand increases by 50%, CO2 emissions will rise by 3.42% for air passenger transport and 3.67% for air freight transport. The predicted air transportation demand growth and trends can be used for capacity development and emission mitigations for sustainable planning and controls in passenger and freight demand in air transportation.

ABSTRACT. An increase in atmospheric CO2 levels and global climate changes have led to an increased focus on CO2 capture mechanisms. The in situ quantification and spatial patterns of forest carbon stocks can provide a better picture of the carbon cycle and a deeper understanding of the functions and services of forest ecosystems. This study aimed to determine the aboveground (tree trunks) and belowground (soil and fine roots, at four depths) carbon stocks in a tropical forest in Brazil and to evaluate the spatial patterns of carbon in the three different compartments and in the total stock. Census data from a semideciduous seasonal forest were used to estimate the aboveground carbon stock. The carbon stocks of soil and fine roots were sampled in 52 plots at depths of 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, and 60-80 cm, combined with the measured bulk density. The total estimated carbon stock was 267.52 Mg ha-1, of which 35.23% was in aboveground biomass, 63.22% in soil, and 1.54% in roots. In the soil, a spatial pattern of the carbon stock was repeated at all depths analyzed, with a reduction in the amount of carbon as the depth increased. The carbon stock of the trees followed the same spatial pattern as the soil, indicating a relationship between these variables. In the fine roots, the carbon stock decreased with increasing depth, but the spatial gradient did not follow the same pattern as the soil and trees, which indicated that the root carbon stock was most likely influenced by other factors.

ABSTRACT Drought stress is a limitation for the agricultural production, having as a primary effect the reduction of plant gas exchanges, and the continuity of its incidence results in a lower yield. This study aimed to evaluate the photosynthetic responses and the soybean yield, concerning the seed inoculation and foliar spray with Azospirillum brasilense and plant regulator containing auxin, gibberellin and cytokinin. A randomized complete block design was used under greenhouse conditions, with five treatments: four under drought stress (control, seed inoculation and foliar spray with A. brasilense and plant regulator) and one irrigated treatment. The soil gravimetric moisture, relative water content, CO2 net assimilation rate, apparent quantum efficiency, light compensation point and grain yield were evaluated. The water deficiency reduced the relative water content by 76.96 % and the soybean gas exchanges by 860.43 %, in the drought stress control. However, when using A. brasilense or plant regulator, the reduction of these values was mitigated, with maximum reductions of 52.40 % in the relative water content and 361.99 % in the gas exchanges. Thus, the mitigation of these effects was directly correlated with the grains yielded by plants, where the use of foliar spray with A. brasilense or plant regulator presented averages 19 % higher than the drought stress control. The applications of foliar spray with A. brasilense and plant regulator mitigate the effects of drought stress on the soybean photosynthesis and culminate in lower yield losses.

ABSTRACT Diuron is a widely used herbicide on pineapple cultivations. However, its application is recommended only for the implementation of the crop. The objective of this work was to evaluate the gas exchanges of four pineapple cultivars submitted to the application of the herbicide diuron at their reproductive stage. The experiment was conducted with the IAC Fantástico, Vitória, MD2 and Pérola pineapple cultivars using the active ingredient diuron at a dose of 7.5 mL L-1. Measurements of CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, vapor pressure deficit and water use efficiency were carried out weekly, by the hour, on two plants per cultivar, over a 24 hour period. These determinations were carried out two days before the application of the herbicide and 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36 days after application of the herbicide. Measurement of photochemical efficiency was performed weekly on the same dates and all these determinations were made on the ‘D’ leaf. Measurements of gas exchange were performed with an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) and of chlorophyll a fluorescence with a fluorometer. The application of diuron reduced the assimilation of CO2 in the pineapple varieties IAC Fantástico, Vitória, MD2 and Pérola, at their reproductive phase, in all CAM metabolism stages. Diuron promoted a temporary reduction of the stomatal conductance and a temporary increase in water use efficiency. The photochemical efficiency of the studied pineapple cultivars was negatively affected by the herbicide diuron, with the recovery of the initial values by cultivar IAC Fantástico.

Abstract In this groundbreaking experimental study, examines the impact of copper oxide (CuO) and Titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on both emissions and performance of a 4.1.5 kW diesel engine fueled by waste cooking oil biodiesel. B20 test fuel blends fortified with 50 ppm concentrations of CuO and TiO2 nanoparticles, subjected to rigorous testing across diverse engine loads (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) while maintaining a constant speed of 1,500 rpm. Through meticulous evaluation of key performance metrics such as brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), coupled with the analysis of emissions including CO, CO2, HC, and NOx, we observed remarkable enhancements. Notably, the introduction of 50 ppm copper oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles into biodiesel blends resulted in a notable boost in brake power (BP) and BTE, showcasing a remarkable surge from 12.39% to 22.14% in BP and 4.92% to 15% in BTE, underscoring their profound impact of particular significance, B2050CuO exhibited superior combustion characteristics compared to titanium nanoparticles, leading to elevated flame temperature and reduced ignition delay, thereby translating into improved engine performance, enhanced braking power output, and overall superior brake thermal efficiency. Furthermore, CuO and TiO2 nanoparticle blends demonstrated a significant reduction in CO emissions at full load with a 50 ppm dosage, achieving reductions of 6.32%, 8.57%, and 6.25%, respectively. Moreover, for B20 and B2050 TiO2 blends, HC emissions saw a notable drop by 9.14%, 6.57%, and 2.817%, promoting efficient combustion through enhanced fuel molecule interaction. Comparatively, the inclusion of B20, B2050TiO2, and B2050CuO fuel blends led to substantial reductions in CO2 levels by 14.4%, 4.8%, and 3.75%, along with lowered NOx emissions by 5.2%, 3.125%, and 2%, highlighting their potential in mitigating environmental impact."

Abstract Shading is a practical measure to reduce the heat stress to grape trees in the summer. However, inappropriate shading will cause the reduction in leaf photosynthesis and consequently the retardation of growth for the plants or the loss of fruit yield and quality for the mature grape trees. In this study we have used 1-year-old ‘YinHong’ grape plants growing under different levels of shading, ranging from full sunlight 0% to 80% reduction, to investigate their growth, physiological and biochemical responses. The results show that shading rate =45% did not significantly affect grape growth. Shading over 45% reduction of the full sunlight, the growth of the grape plants were started to be inhibited. In addition, soluble protein content, the activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), transpiration rate (Tr), PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), PSII potential activity1(Fv/Fo) and photochemical quenching (qP) were decreased, whereas free proline, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, the non-photochemical quenching coefficient (qN) and the ratio of the palisade/spongy tissue were gradually increased. In particular, significant changes in plant growth, photosynthetic and the other physiological and biochemical characteristics were observed under a strong shading.

The shaft furnace knowed Midrex™ is used for the production of direct reduced iron with the use of reformed gas. Another process based on shaft reactors is the Tecnored process, which exhibits the great advantage of using self-reducing agglomerates. Therefore, it was proposed a combination of the shaft furnace for direct reduction with self-reducing pellet burden. In addition, with the aim of improving the furnace efficiency and reducing the need for reformed gas, the injection of natural gas and oxygen into the bustle region is proposed. Thus, it is possible exploit the advantages of direct reduction involving high amounts of hydrogen and faster reactions of the self-reducing process to decrease the CO2 emission, compared to that of blast furnace. The energy profile, productivity, and carbon emission of the traditional shaft furnace were compared with the simulated results after partial replacement of the burden with self-reducing pellets containing fines of elephant grass charcoal. The simulation results for a combination of 15% of self-reducing pellets in the burden with 2.5% oxygen and natural gas injection were the best among the scenarios simulated, with the productivity being 2.7 ton/m3 day and the decrease in the amount of reformed gas being 10%.

Manufactured homes, which are built in the factory and shipped to the site, provide economical housing for more than 20 million Americans. To improve energy measures and facilitate deployment of renewable energy systems to achieve net zero energy in manufactured homes, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) made public the Zero Energy Ready Home (ZERH) National Program Requirements for manufactured housing in 2022. To understand how these changes will impact the environment and the building's durability, life cycle assessment and hygrothermal simulations were carried out for a standard manufactured home design and two ZERH designs in Knoxville, Tennessee. The embodied carbon and operational emissions were compared for the standard design and two ZERH designs for a service life of 60 years. Operational emissions were determined using the Building Energy Optimization tool, BEopt, and durability assessment was carried out using WUFI Pro. Life cycle assessment was performed in accordance with ISO 14040 using Athena's Impact Estimator for buildings. Results indicate that the investment in embodied carbon of the zero energy ready homes is small relative to the savings in operational emissions. The increase in embodied carbon in the zero energy ready homes is offset by the reduction in operational emissions compared to the standard home for the first year of operation. With an investment of 59 kg CO2 eq in embodied carbon, the reduction in operational emissions is approximately 680 kg CO2 eq after one year compared to a construction that meets the prescriptive performance of the building code for manufactured housing.

Light and soil water availability may limit carbon uptake of trees in tropical rainforests. The objective of this work was to determine how photosynthetic traits of juvenile trees respond to variations in rainfall seasonality, leaf nutrient content, and opening of the forest canopy. The correlation between leaf nutrient content and annual growth rate of saplings was also assessed. In a terra firme rainforest of the central Amazon, leaf nutrient content and gas exchange parameters were measured in five sapling tree species in the dry and rainy season of 2008. Sapling growth was measured in 2008 and 2009. Rainfall seasonality led to variations in soil water content, but it did not affect leaf gas exchange parameters. Subtle changes in the canopy opening affected CO2 saturated photosynthesis (A pot, p = 0.04). Although A pot was affected by leaf nutrient content (as follows: P > Mg > Ca > N > K), the relative growth rate of saplings correlated solely with leaf P content (r = 0.52, p = 0.003). At present, reduction in soil water content during the dry season does not seem to be strong enough to cause any effect on photosynthesis of saplings in central Amazonia. This study shows that leaf P content is positively correlated with sapling growth in the central Amazon. Therefore, the positive effect of atmospheric CO2 fertilization on long-term tree growth will depend on the ability of trees to absorb additional amount of P

Though livestock are one of the major contributors to climate change through emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), the intensity of emission and the mitigation potential from this sector is not clearly known in the study regions. Therefore, the present study was designed to estimate the emission of GHGs from the livestock sector over the time period (2003/04–2017/18) and evaluate the mitigation potential using the global livestock environment assessment model (GLEAM). Both primary and secondary data sources were used to obtain data on livestock population, herd parameters, feeding practices, and manure management. The study revealed an increasing trend of GHG from 2003/04 to 2017/18, where the annual emission increased with an average 3.8 Mt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) for all species and 3.3 Mt CO2-eq for cattle alone at national level. Though there is some variation between regions, methane (CH4) was the major gas emitted from ruminant production followed by nitrous oxide (N2O), however the emission of N2O was higher (> 70%) in poultry production. The emission intensity from chicken egg and meat, 1.8–3.3 and 2.2–7.2 kg CO2-eq/kg of product, respectively, was much lower than the emission intensity of meat from small ruminants (16.4–51.5 kg CO2-eq/kg of product) and cattle (34.2–148.2 kg CO2-eq/kg of product). Implementing the integrated mitigation approach has much pronounced reduction effect on GHG emissions as well as increasing the productivity of the livestock sector. Unless mitigation measures are taken, the sector’s emission will increase over time. Thus, federal and regional governments, and partner organizations working in the sector need to give more attention and implement the initiatives identified in the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recommendations to mitigate GHG emissions from the livestock sector.

CO2 methanation is an effective way for CO2 recycling, and nickel-based catalysts have attracted much attention in this field due to their excellent CH4 selectivity and cost-effectiveness; however, their applications are limited by their suboptimal catalytic activity. In this work, the catalytic activity of Ni-rutile-based catalysts was increased by almost an order of magnitude simply by doping the rutile with Fe. Series characterizations show that three factors that mainly contributed to the improved catalytic performance of the Ni/Fe-Rutile, which are the reduction of the Ni size, the increase of the basic sites, and the inhibition of the encapsulation of the Ni particles by the support. With Fe doping, the OH and oxygen vacancies on the rutile surface were reduced, which made the support difficult to reduce and thus suppressed the encapsulation of Ni by the support. As a result, the number of exposed active sites on the Ni/Fe-Rutile which with a smaller Ni size was further successfully increased, and the catalytic activity was significantly improved. This study provides new ideas for the design of activity-enhanced supported catalysts from the perspective of tuning the metal-support interaction and may be applicable to other reducible oxide-supported metal catalysts.

ABSTRACT. This study was developed to evaluate the effects of salinity on the growth and gas exchange of cassava plants, cultivar Verdinha. The four concentrations of NaCl (mM) were as follows: 0, 20, 40, and 60. Under salinity, the lowest concentration of Na+ ions was observed in the tuberous roots; however, the dry matter of tuberous roots was reduced with an application of just 20 mM NaCl. The harvest index was reduced 50% with the highest salt concentration. Salinity reduced carbon assimilation (A), stomatal conductance ( gs ), transpiration, and the instantaneous water use efficiency. The correlation between gs and A was high and positive, showing that stomatal movement was one of the responsible for the lower A. Under salt stress, there was an increase in intercellular CO2 concentration, indicating the impairment of carbon metabolism. Based on the reduction of dry matter of the tuberous roots (reduction of 81% under 60 mM NaCl), it was concluded that cassava is sensitive to salinity. The growth of shoots and the absorbing roots were minimally affected by salinity, even in the situation where A was reduced; therefore, the sensitivity of cassava was related to the high sensitivity of the tuberous roots to the ionic and/or osmotic effects of salinity. Thus, tuberous roots can be the target organ in studies that aim to improve the tolerance of cassava to salinity.

Acute pancreatitis is a common disease that occurs in 5—10% of patients with urgent pathology of the abdominal cavity. The most prevalent metabolic disorders affecting this group of patients are hypermetabolism and hypercatabolism syndromes, which are accompanied by excessive consumption of carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids, increased oxygen intake, and carbon dioxide production. Objective — to analyse the current state of the problem of nutritional support for patients with acute pancreatitis. The degree of nutritional disorders in patients with acute pancreatitis varies depending on the etiological factors and severity of the disease, necessitating a differential approach to their correction. Patients with acute pancreatitis experience disruption of the intestinal microflora due to the antibiotic therapy, nutrient and fiber deficiency, and lack of microbial antagonism. This disruption leads to excessive growth of bacteria, particularly gram‑negative microflora. The effectiveness and safety of enteral tube feeding are determined by a complex of factors: the timing of recovery of peristalsis and the absorption function of the intestinal wall, the type of mixture, and the method of its administration. Restoration of intestinal absorption in patients with severe acute pancreatitis occurs on average 48 hours after the start of complex conservative therapy. The use of antiflatulents as part of a mixture for enteral nutrition allows to improve the laboratory indicators of blood serum and reduce the frequency of intestinal complications on the 7th day by 21.5% (χ2=4.88, 95% CI 2.3—39.5, p=0.03). Nasogastric nutritional support in patients with severe acute pancreatitis is safe and leads to a 25.8% reduction in the incidence of local infectious complications (χ2=4.59, 95% CI 2.43—45.53, p=0.03), length of hospital stay by 16 days (p=0.04), and deaths by 21.4% (χ2=4.13, 95% CI 0.81—39.68, p=0.04) in comparison with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support should be started with nasogastric administration of a food mixture, and in case of complications (intolerance, aspiration, etc.), nasojejunal administration. Parenteral nutrition should be used if enteral nutrition is impossible or not tolerated.

ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to evaluate the reduction of viral replication (Colorado BoHV-1) in murine embryos after the treatment of ethanol extract of Punica granatum peel (PgEE). Swiss female mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were superovulated with 0.2 mL of the 5 UI hormones (eCG and hCG) and mated with males of the same age. After 18 hours, the females were euthanized in a CO2 chamber, and through the opening in the peritoneum, zygotes were collected and washed with 0.5% pronase solution. The zygotes were divided into four groups: G1 (control), G2 (exposed to the virus Colorado BoHV -1 to 108 TCID50/mL), G3 (exposed to PgEE) and G4 (exposed to the virus and to PgEE). The groups were maintained at 37.5ºC in TCM199 (100 mL) with 10% fetal bovine serum in an incubator at 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. After 24 h, we analyzed the cleavage rate (Fisher's exact test; p<0.05), the morphology (by light microscopy), the nested-PCR and the titration of embryos in co-culture with MDBK cells after over 72 h of treatment (Mann-Whitney test; p<0.05) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The murine embryos treated with PgEE showed satisfactory results: no morphological changes, cleavage rate similar to controls, despite the detection of the presence of virus by nested PCR and TEM, there was a decrease of the viral titer after the treatment with this extract, which suggests interference of this treatment in the viral cycle BoHV-1 Colorado without altering the embryo development.

ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to evaluate gas exchanges in seedlings of forest species grown in saline soils and subjected to soil waterlogging cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial arrangement, with four forest species: Myracrodruon urundeuva Fr Allemão, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, Tabebuia impetiginosa (Mart. ex. DC.) Standl and Azadirachta indica A. Juss, two soil salinity levels (1.2 and 8.6 dS m-1) and two water regimes (with and without waterlogging). Measurements of stomatal conductance, transpiration and CO2 assimilation rate were performed before and after each waterlogging period. The interaction of the highest saline level (8.6 dS m-1) and waterlogging caused greater reductions in leaf gas exchange, except for Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. Tabebuia impetiginosa (Mart. ex. DC.) Standl was the species with highest sensitivity to both studied factors of stress.

The current study uses annual time-series data from Pakistan from 1998 to 2022 to investigate the complex link between financial addition, economic inequality, and carbon emissions. The Auto-regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is used in the study to look at the dynamic correlations between variables including financial addition, income inequality, and carbon emissions. The empirical data indicates that increasing financial inclusion leads to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. In contrast, economic inequality, energy consumption, and growth have a positive correlation with CO2 emissions. These conclusions show the complicated relationship between socioeconomic determinants and environmental effects. Furthermore, the study's implications extend beyond Pakistan, giving valuable information to policymakers dealing with similar difficulties in other developing countries. This work contributes to the global discourse on sustainable growth and climate action by promoting economic addition and addressing financial disparities. It emphasizes the importance of implementing specific policy actions that promote both economic fairness and environmental sustainability. Such approaches have the potential to not only reduce carbon emissions but also encourage inclusive growth, promoting the wider aim of sustainable development in Pakistan and abroad.

The aim of the present study is to assess the potential of ethanol deriving from the mesocarp of babassu coconut to be used in fuel cells. Babassu ethanol was generated through hydrolysis and fermentation processes. The Pt, PtRh and PtRu electrodes were prepared in carbon Vulcan XC72R through the reduction method and applied as electrocatalysts in ethanol oxidation reaction. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), stripping CO, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) were used to characterize the synthesized eletrocatalysts. The electrocatalyst Pt80Ru20/C presented larger active area and higher catalytic activity than other studied materials. The current efficiency of CO2 production rated less than 1% in all studied electrocatalysts, thus showing that babassu ethanol oxidation produces less pollutants than the commercial ethanol.

This study elucidates the environmental benefits and the supply dynamics of electric vehicle sharing (EVS) across various trip modes and purposes. A comprehensive survey involving 1,784 participants is carried out to gauge travelers' latent preferences to EVS. An integrated model of the structural equation modeling (SEM) and the partial proportional odds model (PPOM) is developed to identify the interactive relationships between EVS and other trip modes. A before-and-after analysis is conducted to unveil the environmental benefits of EVS across different trip modes and purposes, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). In particular, marginal effect analysis is performed to assess the environmental benefits and supply dynamics as EVS adoption levels vary. The findings highlight a remarkable reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Beijing due to EVS operations, amounting to reductions of 168,000 kgce and 406,000 kgCO2, respectively. This study provides policymakers with insights into EVS's environmental potentials and optimization recommendations.

Abstract: The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of the soil remineralizer fine-graded mica schist (FMS) on soybean (Glycine max) physiology, yield, and grain quality under different water regimes (WRs) in the Brazilian Cerrado. The experiment was conducted under field conditions for two years, using four WRs and three treatments: mica schist, conventional fertilization, and control. In 2017 and 2018, the following WRs were evaluated: WR1, WR2, WR3, and WR4, corresponding to a mean value of 100, 65, 44, and 28% of crop evapotranspiration replacement, respectively. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, internal CO2 concentration, effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv’/Fm’), quantum yield (PSII) (ᶲFSII), and electron transport rate reduced as a function of the advanced phenological stage of soybean and the reduction in WR. Grain quality was only affected by the WR. The mica schist was statistically similar to conventional fertilization and the control in 2017 and 2018. Yield decreased due to the anticipation of soybean phenological age and WR, but there were no differences between the three treatments in 2017 and 2018. The reduction in soybean yield is attributed to stomatal closure, loss of photoprotective capacity, and damage to the photosynthetic machinery caused by drought.

Metal nanoframes have gained tremendous attention in the domain of modern research and development due to their distinctive 3D spatial structure, efficient physiochemical properties, and comparatively good activity. Different strategies have been implicated by the researchers to design nanoframes of varying chemical natures and shapes. Most of the synthetic protocols being adopted to design nanoframes consist of two main steps: nucleation and the growth of solid particles and, secondly, excavation of the interiors. In this context, many synthetic methods are overviewed. To show their unprecedented performance or activity, a few applications in catalysis, biomedicine, theranostics, SERS, the sensing of different materials, the reduction of CO2, etc., are also discussed.

Green (Ni2+/Al+3) and pink (Co2+/Al+3) layered double hydroxides (LDH) (molar ratio of 3:1) were intercalated with several organic anions and used as functional colored fillers into low density polyethylene (LDPE) by melt mixing in amounts of 0.2 to 7 wt.%. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) results of LDPE nanocomposites indicated that with low percentage of filler, all the LDH samples showed efficient delamination/exfoliation in the polymer matrix. Fillers added to LDPE with concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 2 and 5% presented, in general, maintenance of Young's modulus and tensile strength, tending to the reduction with a loading of 7%. Most of the nanocomposites presented similar elongations, although NiUS stood out, with an elongation increase of 300%. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated the effect of the Co/Al-LDH in inducing the formation of LDPE crystalline domains, especially at higher temperature than neat LDPE.

Introduction Onychomycosis is a common nail disorders. Antifungal resistance, interactions and side-effects limit treatment options. Fractional CO2 laser(FCO2) along with topical antifungal is effective in multiple monthly sessions. A modification reducing repeated visits and hence, better compliance is preferable. Single-session FCO2 laser following urea occlusion is reported to be effective. Thus, we conducted a study to determine the efficacy of single-session of FCO2 laser with 1%terbinafine cream with and without ‘urea cream occlusion’ in managing onychomycosis. Methods Prospective, randomized, parallel-group study conducted at a tertiary centre. Onychomycosis was confirmed by positive fungal mount and culture. Patients were randomized into 2-groups and administered single-session of FCO2 Laser. Group-A treated after overnight urea cream occlusion and Group-B without occlusion. Both groups applied 1%terbinafine cream twice daily for 3 months. Response was assessed by improvement in Onychomycosis Severity Index(OSI) at 6 months. Results Group-A had 10 patients, 14 nails. Clinical improvement was seen in 12/14(85.7%) nails. Average reduction in OSI was 10.78. Group-B had 10 patients, 11 nails. Clinical improvement was seen in 5/11(45.5%) nails. Average reduction in OSI was 1.73. ‘Reduction in OSI’ was statistically significant(P<0.05) only in group-A. Conclusion Single-session FCO2 laser following overnight Urea cream occlusion, followed by 1%terbinafine cream is effective for management of onychomycosis.

Abstract In this study, we assessed the gas exchange in Caryocar brasiliense seedlings in water deficit conditions and their capacity to recover after rehydration. We assessed plant photosynthetic rates, internal carbon concentrations, stomatal conductance, transpiration rates, water-use efficiency, instantaneous carboxylation efficiency, chlorophyll index, and photosystem II quantum efficiency. All gas exchange parameters were reduced after the suspension of irrigation. Seedling photosynthetic rates approached zero after 12 days. The equilibrium was reestablished in all variables 11 days after re-initiating irrigation, with the exception of internal CO2 concentration and stomatal conductance. Exposure of seedlings to water stress resulted in drastically reduced photosynthetic processes. This reduction occurred due to the limitation of stomatal conductance and low rubisco carboxylation efficiency but not to irreversible damage photosystem II. All of these parameters demonstrated recuperation with rehydration, but only the photosynthetic rates reached initial control values.

5th generation district heating and cooling networks (5GDHC) will play a rolein the reduction of CO2 emissions and the resilience to global warming. Our analysis of the literature points out that no simulation study proposes a comprehensive enough description of such networks. The simulation solution presented in this article considers the intertwined influences between the thermal-hydraulic balance in the network, the behavior of the decentralized heat pumps and chillers at substations, and the thermal coupling with the ground. For a given simulation scenario, the 3 developed models are iteratively solved until convergence is reached. After showing how the latter is handled,we exhibit an original result about the influence of the differential pressure between the hot and cold pipes.

To tackle the problem of severe air pollution, China has implemented active clean air policies in recent years. As a consequence, the emissions of major air pollutants have decreased and the air quality has substantially improved. Here, we quantified China’s anthropogenic emission trends from 2010–2017 and identified the major driving forces of these trends by using a combination of bottom-up emission inventory and Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) approaches. The relative change rates of China’s anthropogenic emissions during 2010–2017 are estimated as follows: −62% for SO2, −17% for NOx, +11% for NMVOC, +1% for NH3, −27% for CO, −38% for PM10, −35% for PM2.5, −27% for BC, −35% for OC, and +16% for CO2. The IDA results suggest that emission control measures are the main drivers of this reduction, in which the pollution controls on power plants and industries are the most effective mitigation measures. The emission reduction rates markedly accelerated after the year 2013, confirming the effectiveness of China’s Clean Air Action that was implemented in 2013. We estimated that during 2013–2017, China’s anthropogenic emissions decreased by 59% for SO2, 21% for NOx, 23% for CO, 36% for PM10, 33% for PM2.5, 28% for BC, and 32% for OC. NMVOC emissions increased by 11% and NH3 emissions remained stable from 2010–2017, representing the absence of effective mitigation measures for NMVOC and NH3 in current policies. The relative contributions of different sectors to emissions have significantly changed after several years’ implementation of clean air policies, indicating that it is paramount to introduce new policies to enable further emission reductions in the future.

Abstract The incorporation of waste glass as a partial replacement for cement in concrete can provide an alternative destination for the waste, reduce the consumption of cement (minimizing CO2 emissions and consumption of natural resources), and improve the concrete performance. Thus, this research evaluated the performance of concrete incorporating waste glass sludge (GS), resulting from the process of stoning and polishing of soda-lime flat glass, as a supplementary cementing material. Mechanical strength and durability properties were assessed through compressive strength, alkali-silica reactivity, electrical resistivity and chloride permeability, diffusivity and migration tests. Mixtures containing metakaolin (ME) were also evaluated. The results indicated that the use of the waste ground to an adequate size can replace up to 20% of cement. At this content, it caused a reduction of chloride penetration of over 80%, reduced ASR and conserved compressive strength. The combination of waste with metakaolin replacing 20% of cement also improved all the concrete properties, increasing the compressive strength up to 12% at 28 days.

A precise management framework is the first step towards multi-factor relationship optimization and environmental benefit maximization. However, refinery-chemical integration faces incongruity between increasing production demand and pollution mitigation owing to multi-factor interconnectedness and incomplete impact evaluation. The material and energy characteristics of the petrochemicals were considered to establish an integrated analysis framework using material-energy-coupled carbon flow tracking and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the entire process. Coupled analysis revealed that the refinery and chemical blocks accounted for 84.1 % and 15.9 % of the carbon flow, respectively, with a total carbon transformation of 73,667.1 kt carbon equivalent (C eq). Notably, multi-level carbon emission factors were calculated aligning with the proportion of carbon metabolism as the weight, among which the refinery-chemical integration reached 0.11 t CO2 equivalent (CO2 eq)/t scale. The LCA results indicated that the overall environmental contribution of the refinery block was considerably greater than that of the chemical block (82.82 % vs. 17.18 %), in which the major contributors were crude oil and ethylene, respectively. On this basis, an optimized scheme for waste resource recycling was proposed by converting petroleum coke to synthesis gas, which reduced the damage value by 2,484.0 MPt compared with the original process. This study provided a theoretical foundation for the precise management and practical support for the collaborative optimization of pollution and carbon emission reduction in the petrochemical industry.

MgAl2O4 spinel employed as support of reforming catalysts was doped by CeO2. The samples were prepared by wet impregnation from aqueous solutions of cerium nitrate, with and without chelating agents. The chelating agents used were ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and citric acid (CA) at different pH of impregnation. The solids were characterized by TG, XRD, SBET, TPR, SEM-EDX and CO2-TPD. Nanoparticles of CeO2 between 5 and 6.8 nm were obtained by the thermal decomposition in air at 600 °C. The surface cerium reduction occurred in a wide temperature range of 450° to 670 °C. The use of citric acid at pH= 8 led to the lowest crystallite size of CeO2 and the lowest interaction with the spinel. The H2 consumption and extent of CeO2-support interaction did not show a clear dependence with the CeO2 crystallite sizes. The use of chelating agents in the impregnation step did not modify the total basicity. Slight changes in the strength of weak basic sites were observed.

ABSTRACT Brazil has been facing a huge rise in fuel and diesel prices due to the rise in the international market and the war between Ukraine and Russia. The rise in electricity prices is also a problem that affects everyone in Brazil. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and emissions of a diesel engine for power generation that operates with crambe-based fuels with blends of 0% (control), B5, B10, B15, B20, B50, B70, and B90. The fuels were tested in an 8 kVA generator engine at a load of up to 6000 W. The biofuels were obtained from a mixture of diesel with crambe biodiesel at incremental levels from B0 to B90 in the fuel mixture. The increased proportion of crambe biodiesel resulted in lower specific consumption. Crambe biodiesel resulted in a reduction of CO, CO2, and NO2 emissions due to an increase in crambe biodiesel at the proportion. The results indicate that crambe biodiesel blends are viable technical solutions for the partial replacement of conventional diesel.

Introduction Use of home non invasive ventilation (NIV) to treat persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) effectively reduces readmission rates and mortality compared with standard therapy. Traditional workflows around the initiation and management of NIV include elective admission for therapy initiation and frequent face to face clinic visits for follow up, but use of telemedicine offers an alternative approach. Aim This retrospective cohort study evaluated the clinical efficacy and health resource use impact of a remote monitoring approach to the initiation and monitoring of home NIV. Methods Individuals with COPD, COPD obstructive sleep apnoea or obesity related respiratory failure who were started on remote-monitored home NIV from July 2016 to December 2020 were included. Data were obtained from electronic health records. The primary outcome was healthcare utilisation (hospital admissions and average number of bed days) in the 12 months after versus 12 months before starting NIV; secondary endpoints included 2 year survival and time to readmission, and blood gas analysis. Results In the 12 months after versus before NIV initiation, there was a significant reduction in the mean number of admissions (1.0± 2.1 vs. 1.4± 2.1; p<0.0001) and occupied bed days (9.6± 26.8 vs. 17.2± 27.5; p<0.0001); results were consistent across NIV indications. Time to first readmission (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58 – 2.8; p<0.001) and time to death (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.51 – 3.34; p<0.0001) were significantly worse in NIV non users versus users, but did not differ by deprivation quintile. Blood gas analysis showed that NIV significantly reduced carbon dioxide pressure and bicarbonate compared with before NIV. Conclusions A technology assisted service model for the remote initiation and monitoring of home NIV therapy for individuals with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure was feasible, had a beneficial effect on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, and offset typical adverse relative survival outcomes associated with deprivation.

Abstract Purpose: To evaluate the functional and structural response of tadalafil effects in the intestinal mucosa, using an experimental model of hypoxia and reoxygenation injury in rats. Methods: The animals were divided into 4 groups: CTL, H/R, H/R+Td and M+Td. The newborn rats allocated in groups H/R, H/R+Td and M+Td were submitted twice a day, to a gas chamber with CO2 at 100% for 10 minutes and afterward reoxygenation with O2 at 98% for 10 minutes, in the three first days of life. Tadalafil dose was given to newborn of group H/R+Td and to the pregnant rat of group M+Td. Histological analysis was made with hematoxylin-eosin technique and oxidative stress through nitrite and nitrate levels and lipid peroxidation. Results: The histological analysis showed a reduction of mucosa alterations in the groups that received tadalafil. In the oxidative stress evaluation, occurred an increase of NO levels and less lipidic peroxidation in the ileum segments that received tadalafil. Conclusion: Tadalafil provides tissue protection when administered independently to both, pregnant or newborns.

Blast furnace ironmaking produces abundant CO2, and molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) attracts great interest in ironmaking due to its carbon-free emissions. However, the anodes are the key limiting factor, making them very challenging due to high temperature and the intensive oxidation atmosphere. In this respect, a non-consumable argon plasma anode for iron electrolysis is proposed as a new technological process. During electrolysis, argon ionizes anodically and forms Ar+, which will jet into the molten oxide electrolyte and react with the O2– complex anion from the electrolyte. Metallic iron is obtained by cathodic reduction, while oxygen evolution and argon regeneration occur in the electrolyte through 2O2–(complex) + 4Ar+ = O2 + 4Ar, demonstrating the workability of the argon plasma as a non-consumable anode for molten oxide electrolysis.

ABSTRACT The accelerated carbonation during the early cure age is a process used to improve the physical and mechanical properties of cement-based composites. In this work, cement-based composites with coir pith particles addition were subjected to the accelerated carbonation process during the first 48 hours of cure in a rich CO2 environment. After curing, the samples were dried and subjected to curing conditions until saturated at 28 days. Thermogravimetric analyses, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction patterns were used to analyze the impact of accelerated carbonation during the early cure age in cement-coir pith composite. The results of the physical properties show an increase in bulk density and surface density of the carbonated samples, as well as reduced water absorption. The reduction of the Ca(OH)2 resulting in the increasing of CaCO3 content was observed by thermogravimetric analysis. The carbonated samples had a 41% increase in compression strength and 28% in the modulus of rupture as compared to non-carbonate samples. The results showed the potential of the accelerated carbonation cure process in cement-based composites with vegetable coconut waste addition.

ABSTRACT In this paper, we review briefly the commitments made by the signatories of the CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE since 1992, which led to the PARIS AGREEMENT where there are no mandatory goals for reducing greenhouse gases, as those of the 1997 KYOTO PROTOCOL. In addition, an analysis is made of the evolution of the CO2 emissions showing that substantive reductions were achieved by the European Union and the United States through the adoption of energy efficiency measures, unlike other countries. The average annual investment in these activities for 2011-2019 was $480 billion, but only 16% are concessional funds and the remaining are loans and investments. As for the transfer of funds from industrialized to developing countries, the amount was approximately $83 billion per year less than the target of $100 billion accorded at COP15 in Copenhagen, a small part in concessional terms. At COP27 in Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt, in 2022, little progress was made to limit global warming to 1.5 ºC by 2050, except the creation a new FUND to help more vulnerable countries face the consequences of global warming.

Operando electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (EC ATR-SEIRAS) is a valuable method for a fundamental understanding of electrochemical interfaces under real operating conditions. The applicability of this method depends on the ability to tune the optical and catalytic properties of an electrode film, and it thus requires unique optimization for any given material. Motivated by the growing interest in Sn-based electrocatalysts for selective reduction of CO2 to formate species, we investigate several Sn thin-film synthesis routes for the resulting SEIRA signal response. We compare the SEIRA performance of thermally evaporated metallic Sn to a series of Sn-based films on top of a SEIRA-active Au substrate (metallic Sn, oxide-derived metallic Sn, and metal oxide SnOx). Using alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers as a probe, we find that electrodepositing metallic catalyst films on top of SEIRA-active Au substrates yield higher signal relative to thermal evaporation as well as higher signal than the independent SEIRA-active Au underlayer. These observations come despite the fact that thermally evaporated Sn has a significantly higher surface roughness (and thus higher adsorbate population), suggesting specific SEIRA-magnifying effects for the stacked films. Finally, we applied these films to observe the electrochemical conversion of CO2. Differences are observed in spectral features based on the composition of the electrode being either metallic or oxide-derived metallic Sn, implying differences in their respective reaction pathways.

Introduction: Prediabetes is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, it may be reversed via lifestyle changes. Lumen® is a novel handheld device that measures exhaled CO2 producing results in agreement with those of indirect calorimetry when assessing metabolic fuel usage. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of following Lumen’s personalized, measurement-guided lifestyle intervention program on anthropometric and metabolic variables in adults with prediabetes. Methods: A 12-week single-arm intervention study was conducted in 27 participants. Body composition and blood markers were measured at the start and end of the study. Each participant took a daily morning (fasted) measurement and received feedback on their metabolic state (i.e., their degree of fat vs. carbohydrate oxidation). Participants were then provided with personalized daily guidelines for their carbohydrate, fat, and protein consumption, along with recommended lifestyle changes. Results: Intention to treat analysis revealed a significant decrease in body weight (5.99 kg, p < 0.001), comprising a significant reduction in percentage body fat (2.93%, p < 0.001) and waist circumference (6.23 cm, p < 0.001). Significant reductions were also observed in glycated hemoglobin A1c (0.27%, p < 0.001), triglycerides (0.45 mg/dL, p < 0.001), and systolic blood pressure (0.5 mmHg, p < 0.05). Conclusion: In a 12-week study of participants with prediabetes, Lumen usage significantly improved multiple metabolic parameters, demonstrating its potential to deliver better clinical outcomes for patients with T2DM and metabolic syndrome.

The use of tailings sand for CO2 mineralization and utilization (CMU) has been emerging globally, offering a sustainable solution for repurposing tailings sand while establishing a stable carbon sink. Despite several reports that evaluated process performance and project benefits, existing research has not delved into the project layout focusing on the tailings pond facility and the feasibility considerations from a cluster and ownership perspective. Conducting facility-scale refined mineralized carbon sink (MCS) and layout feasibility assessment is a key issue that needs to be addressed urgently. Here, we accounted for CMU potential (CMUP) of tailings sand using a sample of 6219 tailings pond ownerships in China, predicted future annual carbon sinks through an innovative ARIMA-cloud model, and analyzed the feasibility of project layouts within potential clusters concerning enterprise size. Our results indicate that the CMUP of accumulated tailings sand in China amounts to 1817.87 Mt. In a combined scenario involving future technological leapfrogging and increased utilization, the average annual carbon sink by 2030 is projected to be 24.73 Mt. A considerable reduction in project layout feasibility across all scenarios was observed due to the mismatch between carbon clusters and enterprise size. Our study reveals that CMU using tailings sand should be regarded as one of the essential green technologies in the portfolio of strategic Chinese CO2 mitigation. However, we highlight the necessity of aligning cluster programs with the support capacity of the ownership enterprise to ensure the optimal project success.

Lack of safe water availability and access to clean water cause a higher risk of infectious diseases and other diseases as well. Heavy metals (HMs) are inorganic pollutants that cause severe threats to humans, animals, and the environment. Therefore, an effective HM removal technology is urgently needed. In the present study, a customized bipolar membrane electrodialysis process was used to remove HMs from aqueous solutions. The impacts of the feed ionic strength, applied electrical potential, and the type and concentration of HMs (Cd2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, and Ni2+) on the process performance were investigated. The results showed that feed solution pH changes occurred in four stages: it first decreased linearly before stabilizing in the acidic pH range, followed by an increase and stabilization in the basic range of the pH scale. HM speciation in the basic pH range revealed the presence of anionic HM species. The presence of HMs on anion exchange membranes confirmed the contribution of these membranes for HM removal in the base channels of the process. While no clear trend was seen in the ionic strength solution, the maximum HM removal was observed when 1.5 g/L NaCl was used. The initial HM concentration showed a linear increase in HMs removal of up to 30 mg/L. A similar trend was seen with an increase in the applied electrical potential of up to 15 V. In general, the amount of HMs removed increased in the following order: Cd2+ ˃ Ni2+ ˃ Co2+ ˃ Cu2+ ˃ Cr3+. Under some operational conditions, however, the removed amount of Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ was similar. The mass balance and SEM-EDX results revealed that the removed HMs were sorbed onto the membranes. In conclusion, this process efficiently separates HMs from aqueous solutions. It showed the features of diluate pH adjustment, reduction in the overall stack electrical resistance, and contribution of anion exchange membranes in multivalent cation removal. The mechanisms involved in HMs removal were diffusion and migration from the bulk solution, followed by their sorption on both cation and anion exchange membranes.

Climate warming and air pollution are the main environmental problems in China. This study used China's Carbon Accounting Database, energy economic model, and air quality model to analyze the potential carbon emission peaking path and synergistic air quality improvement gain in the industrial sector in Hunan Province. Based on China's Carbon Accounting Database and the local industry/energy statistical yearbooks in Hunan, the total CO2 emissions in Hunan Province in 2019 were 310.6 Mt, of which the industrial sector accounted for over 70% of the emissions, mainly from the production and supply of electricity, steam, and heat; the production of non-metallic minerals; and the smelting and pressing of ferrous metals. Three potential industrial carbon emission peaking scenarios were analyzed using the LEAP energy economic model, including the business-as-usual scenario (peaking by 2030), moderate emission reduction scenario (peaking by 2028), and aggressive emission reduction scenario (peaking by 2025), by employing different economic growth rates, energy technology progress, and energy structures of the industrial sector. Furthermore, by combining the anthropogenic air pollutant emission inventory and the regional air quality model WRF-Chem, we analyzed the air quality improvement associated with various carbon emission peak paths. The results showed that the annual mean concentrations of major air pollutants had decreased in the three scenarios, especially in the Chang-Zhu-Tan Region. The aggressive emission reduction scenario was the most effective scenario, followed by the moderate emission reduction scenario and the business-as-usual scenario. Manufacturing was the sector with the most significant synergistic effect of pollution and carbon reduction. When carbon emission peaks were achieved, the annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in Hunan Province could be synergistically reduced by 0.6-1.8 μg·m-3 and 1.8-8.9 μg·m-3, respectively. Our findings offer important insights into carbon emission peaking and can provide useful information for potential mitigation actions.

Lead is environmental pollutant that even in low trace is harmful for human health and wildlife. In this study we presented a colorimetric method for determination of Pb2+ in water by aggregation of silver nanoparticles capped citrate in the presence of deferoxamine as chelating agent. Silver nanoparticles were prepared by reduction of AgNO3 with NaBH4. In the presence of Pb2+, mixture of silver nanoparticles capped citrate and deferoxamine aggregated and color of solution changed from light yellow to violet that depends on Pb2+ concentration. As a result of aggregation, local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band of silver nanoparticles around 440 nm decreases and a new band appears at 580 nm that depend on Pb2+ concentration. Under optimized conditions, linear relation of concentration of Pb2+ and absorbance ratio (A580/A440), was from 0.19 to 1.29 µmol L-1 and limit of detection of 0.056 µmol L-1 was found. Control experiments with the addition of 10 other metal ions (Ni2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Co2+, K+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Hg2+) did not result in a distinct change in the color or in the absorption spectra. This approach was successfully tested for determination of Pb2+ in well and tap water.

ABSTRACT Water deficit is most frequent in forest physiognomies subjected to climate change. As a consequence, several tree species alter tissue water potential, gas exchange and production of carbon compounds to overcome damage caused by water deficiency. The working hypothesis, that a reduction in gas exchange by plants experiencing water deficit will affect the composition of carbon compounds in soluble sugars, lipids and vegetative structures, was tested on Copaifera langsdorffii. Stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, and CO2 assimilation rate declined after a period of water deficit. After rehydration, leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange did not recover completely. Water deficit resulted in 13C enrichment in leaves, soluble sugars and root lipids. Furthermore, the amount of soluble sugars and root lipids decreased after water deficit. In rehydration, the carbon isotopic composition and amount of root lipids returned to levels similar to the control. Under water deficit, 13C-enriched in root lipids assists in the adjustment of cellular membrane turgidity and avoids damage to the process of water absorption by roots. These physiological adjustments permit a better understanding of the responses of Copaifera langsdorffi to water deficit.

ABSTRACT: Water deficit may affect the expression of lepidoptera-controlling proteins in cotton. However, it is unknown if there is a differential response of conventional and Bt cotton cultivars to water deficit, what could potentially affect the plant competition with weeds. The objective of this work was to investigate the response of Bt cotton cultivars to water deficit compared with their conventional near-isolines. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, where the cotton cultivars FMT 705, FMT 709 and IMACD 8276, with and without the Bt gene, were grown under two water regimens: 100% and 50% (moderate water deficit) of available soil water. Cotton phenology was severely affected by moderate water deficit, with a reduction in shoot and root dry matter production, root length and diameter, plant height and leaf area. No effect of the Bt gene was observed. Water deficit during cotton flowering decrease stomatal conductance, net assimilation of CO2 and transpiration rates. The leaf water potential is lower in plants exposed to a moderate water deficit compared with non-stressed plants. However, the introgression of the Bt gene does not modify cotton physiological and phenotypic response to water deficit.

ABSTRACT The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide on the emergence, growth and gas exchange of yellow passion fruit seedlings subjected to salt stress. The experiment was conducted in pots (Citropote®) under greenhouse conditions, in the municipality of Campina Grande, PB, Brazil. Treatments were distributed in a randomized block design, in a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement, with four levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (0.7, 1.4, 2.1 and 2.8 dS m-1) associated with four concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0, 25, 50 and 75 μM), with four replicates and two plants per plot. Irrigation using water with electrical conductivity above 0.7 dS m-1 negatively affects the emergence and growth of passion fruit. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations between 10 and 30 μM induce the acclimation of passion fruit plants to salt stress, mitigating the deleterious effects of salinity on the relative growth rate in stem diameter and leaf area, stomatal conductance, transpiration, CO2 assimilation rate and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency. Irrigation water salinity combined with hydrogen peroxide concentrations above 30 μM causes reduction in passion fruit growth and physiology.

Scarring is one of the most prevalent long-term complications of acne vulgaris and has cosmetic, psychological, and social burdens. Contemporary management programs integrate multiple modalities to best address the multiple factors underlying their development and persistence. This work assessed the impact of sequential multimodal laser therapy on acne scar geometrics and texture.Adult patients (n = 16) with Fitzpatrick skin type II-IV and presenting with facial acne scars, underwent three combination ablative (CO2), and nonablative (1570 nm) laser treatment sessions at two-month intervals. Treatment was delivered using a ProScan Hybrid applicator, with each regimen including illumination with both ablative and a nonablative lasers applied in a grid mode sequence. Scar microtopography was assessed at baseline and 6 months after the last treatment session.At baseline, all patients had both box and rolling scars, while only three had icepick scars. Six months following treatment, mean scar volume improved from 5.7 ± 5.2 mm3 at baseline to 3.1 ± 3.0 mm3 and mean affected area improved from 165.6 ± 134.0 mm2 94.0 ± 80.1 mm2, translating to 47.0 ± 7.9% and 43.2 ± 8.6% reductions from baseline, respectively. Patients were highly satisfied with treatment outcomes, and no serious adverse reactions were documented during the course of treatment or follow-up.Multimodal CO2 and 1570-nm laser treatment improved the surface profilometry of patients with atrophic facial acne scars. Customization of both treatment intervals and laser settings to cosmetic regions, scar profiles and skin phototypes may further enhance treatment outcomes and expand its applicability to additional skin deformities.

The intricate structure and surface properties of metal oxide catalysts pose a challenge for implementing hydrophobic surface treatment. Herein, the surface of CuAl2O4 catalysts is modified by means of grafting and bridging different saturated fatty acid molecules, including lauric acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid. Consequently, the modification leads to an enhancement in the hydrophobicity of the catalyst, as evidenced by an increase in the static water contact angle from 15.26° to 150.74°. The hydrophobization of CuAl2O4 catalysts, in turn, influences the decomposition and reduction capacity of CuAl2O4, thus favoring the formation of a more stable defective spinel structure and improving the dispersion of Cu particles, thereby restraining aggregation. Notably, the activity results indicate that the hydrophobically modified CuAl2O4 exhibits higher CO conversion and selectivity of dimethyl ether, while effectively suppressing the water–gas shift reaction and reducing CO2 selectivity. This observation points to the significance of the catalyst surface hydrophobicity in enhancing catalytic performance

The behaviour of Pd deposited on Ga2O3 and In2O3 by CVI is compared for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Ga2O3 alone is inactive, but In2O3 has good conversion, and selectivity as high as 89% to CH3OH. The addition of Pd to the catalysts had relatively little effect for In2O3, but in contrast, the addition of Pd to Ga2O3, has a very big effect, inducing high activity and selectivity to methanol. Both oxides form Pd intermetallics - Pd2In3 and Pd2Ga. However, for the In catalysts there is also a thick (~3 nm) overlayer of the oxide, while for the Ga catalyst there was no such overlayer. Hence this is why addition of Pd to the Indium catalysts has relatively little effect on performance compared with Ga. Furthermore, the effect of Pd and Zn co-deposition on Ga₂O₃ and In₂O₃ was investigated, as well as the effect of the support morphology. Upon co-deposition of Pd and Zn, and after reduction, the Pd2In3 catalyst remains phase stable, whereas the Pd2Ga alloy is replaced by PdZn, and is improved in methanol yield.

Abstract The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of different calcium chloride concentrations on the post-harvest conservation of jabuticaba variety Pingo de Mel at different storage temperatures. The fruit were collected 30 days after the anthesis and subjected to immersions in calcium chloride solution at different concentrations (0%, 2%, 4%, and 6%) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then, the fruit were dried and packed in polypropylene bags and incubated in a chamber at different temperatures (6 °C, 12 °C, and 25 °C). Samples were analyzed at time 0 and every two days, up to 12 days of storage. No effect of different calcium chloride concentrations was observed in the fruit characteristics at different storage temperatures over time. During storage, an increase of soluble and total pectin contents, antioxidant activity, CO2, total sugars, acidity, and weight loss was observed. Higher storage temperatures affected both the increase in weight loss, pH, and O2 production and the reduction of vitamin C content. Refrigeration was important for the post-harvest conservation of jabuticaba variety Pingo de Mel , once the fruit stored at 6 °C suffered minor variations with improvements or little changes during the 12 days.

Abstract The sweet potato is an alternative energy source, but its sustainability depends on efficient water use. The objective of this study was to evaluate sweet potato morpho-physiological characteristics, and water use efficiency (WUE). Irrigation depths of 50, 75, 100, and 125% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) were applied. The morpho-physiological indicators, WUE, leaf area index (LAI), leaf water potential, leaf temperature, and leaf chlorophyll index (ICF), were evaluated. The WUE of the sweet potato cultivars increased until the 75% water depth of the ETc. The LAI of these cultivars increased with irrigation depth, with higher values at 100% of the ETc. The leaf water potential of the two sweet potato cultivars was lowest with the lower irrigation depth. Leaf temperature was closer to that of ambient temperatures in treatments with greater irrigation depth. The increase of the WUE with the greater accumulation of dry biomass is due to greater CO2 diffusion by stomata. The reduction in the growth of these plants is due to water stress limiting stomatal conductance, transpiration, leaf growth (LAI) and chlorophyll concentration, proportional to soil moisture conditions. The functional relationship between soil moisture and growth is essential to optimize irrigation management at different growth stages.

In order to overcome the limitations of traditional clean energy utilization methods, this paper proposed an innovative technical solution for a combined heating system that cleverly integrated solar, wind, and geothermal energy to achieve complementarity and synergized among them, thereby ensuring stable and efficient energy utilization. First, a comprehensive mathematical model was developed for the entire heating system, encompassing solar thermal subsystem, geothermal subsystem, wind power generation subsystem, and a second-stage reheating subsystem. Subsequently, Ebsilon simulation software was utilized to cleverly couple these subsystems together, with corresponding boundary conditions set to ensure the overall efficiency and stability of the system. Based on meteorological data and geothermal resource parameters from a typical heating season in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China, this paper thoroughly analyzed the variations in key performance indicators such as the photothermal conversion efficiency of solar thermal subsystem and the heating capacity of geothermal subsystem. This provided valuable insight for optimizing the design of heating system. The results indicated that during the daylight hours of the heating season, both the photothermal conversion efficiency and the heat supply from the solar thermal subsystem exhibited an increasing trend as solar radiation increased. Among them, the photothermal conversion efficiency peaked at 76.013%, while the maximum heat supply output reached 40.311 kW. When solar direct radiation was relatively weak, the system primarily relied on the heat release process of the thermal storage tank to maintain heating, with a minimum heat supply of 27.268 kW. During nighttime hours of the heating season, the geothermal subsystem dominated the heating process, with a maximum heat supply of 125.556 kW. Additionally, for every 5 °C increased in geothermal water temperature, the heat supply from the geothermal subsystem increased by an average of 6.553 kW, demonstrating excellent heating response performance. Therefore, the integrated clean heating system that combines solar, geothermal, and wind energy not only significantly improves the utilization efficiency of clean energy but also enhances the heating stability of the integrated clean energy coupling system to a certain extent. The clean heating technical solution proposed in the paper had a theoretical total heating capacity of 19 680 kW during the heating season. When converted, this equates to a substitution of 6.9 tons of standard coal, resulting in a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 17.94 tons. This demonstrates the considerable cleanliness and environmental benefits of the proposed heating system. This study provides a valuable reference for the engineering application of renewable energy in the field of clean heating.

ABSTRACT Water deficit is the main cause of abiotic stress to which plants are susceptible, whether cultivated or those that are underexploited, such as Physalis peruviana L. Searching for tools that contribute to the management of water deficit in plants is fundamental for the maintenance of agriculture, especially in arid and semi-arid areas around the world. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of chemical priming with proline and sodium nitroprusside as promoters of increased tolerance to water deficit in P. peruviana plants. Plants grown under well hydrated conditions (FC of 70±5%) were sprayed with proline (10 and 20 mM) or sodium nitroprusside (25 and 50 μM) and evaluated after exposure to water deficit (FC of 20±5%). Plants cultivated under water deficit without pretreatment showed reductions in the variables of water relations, gas exchange and growth. Proline and sodium nitroprusside were effective in maintaining less negative water potential, contributing to improvements in gas exchange, such as CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance and transpiration. Thus, it was possible to measure greater tolerance to water deficit in pretreated plants and, consequently, greater biomass accumulation. It appeard that pretreatment of proline and sodium nitroprusside can have a priming effect against water deficit in P. peruviana plants.

ABSTRACT The study was carried out to evaluate the photosynthetic efficiency and growth of yellow passion fruit, cultivated under different levels of irrigation water salinity and exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide. The experiment was carried out in greenhouse of the Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, PB, Brazil, using drainage lysimeters with capacity for 100 dm3, filled with Entisol of sandy texture. The experimental design was randomized blocks using a 4 x 4 factorial scheme, with three repetitions, corresponding to four water salinity (0.7; 1.4; 2.1 and 2.8 dS m-1) and four concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0, 20, 40 and 60 µM). The different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were applied by soaking the seed for a period of 24 h and spraying the leaves on the adaxial and abaxial sides. At 35 days after transplanting, the interaction between water salinity and hydrogen peroxide concentrations did not significantly interfere with plant physiology and growth, except for the number of leaves. The hydrogen peroxide did not cause significant effects on any of the evaluated plant variables. Increasing salinity of irrigation water led to reduction in gas exchanges at 61 and 96 days after transplanting. Water salinity inhibited the CO2 assimilation, transpiration, stomatal conductance, instantaneous carboxylation efficiency and stem diameter of passion fruit plants.

ABSTRACT The analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence is one of many ways to quantify the salt damage to photosynthetic performance and crop production. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the photochemical efficiency and production of coriander, cultivar ‘Verdão’, as a function of the electrical conductivity levels of the nutrient solution and the cationic nature. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in a 4 × 3 factorial scheme, with four replicates. The treatments consisted of four electrical conductivities of the nutrient solutions (ECns = 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, and 6.4 dS m-1) and three kinds of water of different cationic natures (Na+; Ca2+; Mg2+), which were prepared with the dissolution of different salts - NaCl, CaCl2.2H2O, and MgCl2.6H2O in supply water (ECw = 0.12 dS m-1), that is, three predominant cationic natures. The study was carried out in a greenhouse between November and December 2019 at the Fertigation and Salinity Laboratory of the Agricultural Engineering Department of the Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco. It was found that the increase in the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution affected reaction centers, photochemical activity, and carboxylation efficiency and resulted in reductions in stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation rate, and therefore, in the biomass production of coriander. Different cationic prevalence in water causes differences in the intensity of salt damage, especially with increasing concentration.

ABSTRACT Castor bean is one of the crops with potential to provide raw material for production of oils for biodiesel. This species possess adaptive mechanisms for maintaining the water status when subjected to drought stress. A better understanding these mechanisms under field conditions can unravel the survival strategies used by this species. This study aimed to compare the physiological adaptations of Ricinus communis (L.) in two regions with different climates, the semi-arid and semi-humid subject to water stress. The plants showed greater vapor pressure deficit during the driest hours of the day, which contributed to higher values of the leaf temperature and leaf transpiration, however, the VPD(leaf-air) had the greatest effect on plants in the semi-arid region. In both regions, between 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., the plants presented reduction in the rates of photosynthesis and intracellular CO2 concentration in response to stomatal closure. During the dry season in the semi-arid region, photoinhibition occurred in the leaves of castor bean between 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. These results suggest that castor bean plants possess compensatory mechanisms for drought tolerance, such as: higher stomatal control and maintenance of photosynthetic capacity, allowing the plant to survive well in soil with low water availability.

Wood pellets have become a preferred solid biomass fuel for heat and power generation due to their standardized nature, known properties, and consistent quality. However, pellets produced from fresh sawdust sometimes undergo self-heating and off-gassing and this poses a challenge for their transportation and storage. The aim of this thesis was to increase the body of knowledge towards understanding the mechanisms underlying the self-heating and off-gassing of wood pellets. The results from paper I showed that the total amount of extractives in the raw material has little effect on off-gassing. Although pellets produced from Scots pine sawdust with lower extractive contents exhibited reduced concentrations of off-gasses; CO, CO2 and CH4, increasing the extractive content of the sawdust through the addition of additive oils did not result in increased off-gas emissions. The results of pure cellulose pellets with added additive oils showed that off-gassing is influenced by the type of extractives in the raw material (paper II). The highest concentrations of off-gasses were recorded from pure cellulose pellets with added linseed oil due to their high content of unsaturated fatty acids of 73.9% linolenic and 7.6% linoleic. The results from papers III and IV indicated significant effects of both raw material and drying temperature on off-gassing and self-heating of wood pellets. There was a strong linear correlation between off-gassing and the sapwood content of the raw material, with correlation coefficient (R) values greater than 0.9 at p < 0.001 for all the off-gases (paper III). An increase in sapwood content led to a significant increase in off-gassing of CO2, CO and CH4, and O2 consumption. Storing of sawdust for over six months prior to pellet production, and increasing the drying temperature led to a significant reduction in off-gassing for sapwood pellets. For heartwood pellets, increasing the drying temperature resulted in increased off-gassing while raw material storage had no effect. In the other study (paper IV), the pellets produced from Scots pine mature wood sawdust were more prone to self-heating and off-gassing compared to those produced from juvenile wood sawdust. Steam drying the sawdust at high temperature led to a significant reduction in heat and gas generation for both materials. The overall results indicated that a biological process, in combination with the chemical oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids lay behind the self-heating and off-gassing of wood pellets.

Abstract The flotation process currently considered for apatite concentration from the Santa Quitéria phosphate deposit (Brazil), involves bulk flotation of apatite and calcite with anionic collector at pH=10 followed by calcite flotation at pH=5.5, adjusted with H3PO4. Although this concept is efficient from the point of view of separation between apatite and calcite, the intensive use of inorganic acids causes ion accumulation in the process water, especially Ca2+ and PO4 2-, which leads to problems in the flotation stage as well as in the environment. CETEM has been studying a process for the separation of carbonate minerals and apatite that involves the use of carbonic gas injected into the bubble generation system of flotation machines instead of inorganic acids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Ca2+ ion concentration on the water during the calcite flotation stage of the Santa Quiteria phosphate ore, between 6 mg/L (standard test) and 670 mg/L (maximun concentration) on the flotation performance in terms of P2O5 grade and its loss and the CaO/P2O5 ratio (RCP). The results indicated a reduction in the selectivity on the flotation of calcite from apatite for Ca2+ concentrations from 6 mg/L to around 285 mg/L. Despite this, the results obtained in this study indicated that the process based on the application of CO2 for the separation of calcite and apatite may be a technical alternative that causes less impact in flotation performance for the phosphate concentration ores with carbonated gangue.

Postoperative evaluations of patients, who undergo of transoral thyroarytenoid myoneurectomy using CO2 laser for the treatment of Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia (ASD), reveal some residual laryngeal symptoms such as intermittent spasms, vocal effort, and stiffness in laryngeal muscles which can be identified on videolaryngo-stroboscopy (VLS) by patterns of Muscle Tension Dysphonia (MTD) and mucosal wave, and as deviations in acoustic perceptual measures. This study aims to document these vocal symptoms observed postoperatively, and most importantly highlight the need for voice therapy postoperatively and report the short-term vocal outcomes post-therapy.Retrospective case series.The case series includes five patients, three females and two males, in the age range of 40 to 76years, who underwent transoral thyroarytenoid myoneurectomy using CO2 laser for severe ASD. The assessment protocol to document pretherapy (3-week postop) and post-therapy (after 1month of therapy) findings included VLS, Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), VHI-10 GRBAS, and Multi-Dimensional Voice Profile (MDVP) (acoustic voice analysis). Voice therapy regimen included Resonant Voice Therapy, semi-occluded vocal tract exercises, Vocal Function Exercises, and/or breath support exercises customized for individual symptoms.MTD of varying grades, MPT less than 10 seconds, deviant F0, mild to moderate degrees of perceptually rough and predominantly strained voice were noted in the pretherapy evaluation. Following 1month of voice therapy, changes noted were a reduction in strained and rough voice quality and an increase in MPT and muscle tension. Improvement of almost all parameters of MDVP tended towards normative as compared to pretherapy including F0.Voice therapy initiated at the earliest recovery stage postoperatively does lead to positive short-term vocal outcomes in patients with severe ASD. It is necessary to have long-term follow-ups and aim for the maintenance of satisfactory vocal outcomes.

ABSTRACT: The responses of two maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars, ‘LY336’ (shade tolerant) and ‘LC803’ (shade sensitive), to shade stress in a pot experiment conducted in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons were investigated. The impact of 50% shade stress treatment on shoot biomass, photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content was evaluated. The shoot biomass of the two maize hybrids was decreased significantly by shade stress treatment, for shade stress 7 d, the LC803 and LY336 were reduced by 56.7% and 44.4% compared with natural light. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of LY336 were not significantly affected by shade stress, whereas those of LC803 were significantly affected, the Fo increased under shade stress; however Fm, FV/FM and ΦPSII were decreased under shade stress. Among photosynthetic parameters measured, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), and transpiration rate were significantly decreased compared with natural light, LY336 and LC803 reduction by 28.0%, 22.2%, 57.7% and 35.5%, 18.9%, 62.4%; however, intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) was significantly increased, for the two cultivars. Under shade stress for different durations (1, 3, 5, 7 d), Pn, Gs, Ci, and MDA content differed significantly between the two cultivars. Results indicated that different maize genotypes showed different responses to shading. Shade-tolerant genotypes are only weakly affected by shade stress.

Agriculture and its supply chain pose significant environmental threats. This study employs Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to explore the environmental impact of fresh bell pepper production and distribution, comparing Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture (UPA) with Rural Long-Distance Food Supply Systems (RLDFS). Four UPA scenarios (hydroponics, soil-based greenhouse, open-field conventional, and organic) and two RLDFS scenarios (soil-based greenhouse and open-field conventional) are evaluated using SimaPro, incorporating input from UPA practitioners and rural farmers. Results reveal an energy demand range of 0.011 to 5.5 kWh/kg eq., with urban greenhouses exhibiting the lowest consumption and hydroponics the highest due to lighting, ventilation, and irrigation. Hydroponics exhibits a global warming potential of 7.24 kg of CO2 eq·kg−1, with energy demand contributing over 95 %, surpassing other scenarios by 7–25 times, necessitating reduction for sustainability. RLDFS's environmental impact is dominated by transportation (over 70 %), meanwhile other UPA systems are influenced by irrigation, infrastructure, and fertilizers. Despite challenges, UPA-hydroponics proves to be 1.7 to 4.3 times more land-use-efficient than other scenarios, emphasizing its potential. The study highlights the need to address electricity usage in UPA-hydroponics for carbon footprint reduction. Despite challenges, hydroponics could contribute to sustainable food security, and RLDFS does not significantly lag in environmental performance compared to UPA other than Ozone layer depletion criteria attributed to fossil fuel usage in transportation. These insights offer valuable guidance for urban development and policy formulation, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and supporting policies for agronomic and supply chain sustainability.

To quantify the carbon source/sink function of riparian zone swamps and explore the feedback relationship with climate change, we measured the annual fluxes of soil greenhouse gas, soil carbon emission, net vegetation carbon sequestration and related environmental factors (temperature, water level, etc.) by static chamber-gas chromatography and relative growth equation methods in three kinds of forest swamps (Alnus sibirica swamp, Betula platyphylla swamp, and Larix olgensis swamp) distributed along the water reduction gradient of lowland to highland in the stream riparian zone of Changbai Mountains. The results showed that the annual fluxes of CH4(0.19-0.85 mg·m-2·h-1), CO2(60.81-228.63 mg·m-2·h-1), and N2O (-0.02-0.05 mg·m-2·h-1) showed spatial variations along the water gradient of lowland to highland, with a trend of first constant then decreasing, decreasing, and first absorption then emission, respectively. The spatial variations of annual fluxes of these greenhouse gases were controlled by water levels. The annual net carbon sequestration of vegetation (2.61-3.45 t C·hm-2·a-1) was constant along the water gradient, which was mainly promoted by nitrate nitrogen content. The carbon source/sink and global warming potential (GWP) undergo regular changes along water gradients. The A. sibirica swamp was a carbon sink (1.93 t C·hm-2·a-1), the B. platyphylla swamp was a weak carbon source (-0.18 t C·hm-2·a-1), and the L. olgensis swamp was a strong carbon source (-2.51 t C·hm-2·a-1). The spatial variation of carbon source/sink in forest swamps was jointly promoted by water level and nitrate nitrogen content. A. sibirica swamp exhibited a strong cooling effect with a strong negative feedback effect on climate change (-5.88 t CO2·hm-2·a-1). L. olgensis swamp exhibited a strong warming effect with a strong positive feedback effect (10.97 t CO2·hm-2·a-1). B. platyphylla swamp exhibited a weak warming effect, approximately neutral (2.95 t CO2·hm-2·a-1). The spatial variation of GWP in forest swamps was mainly inhibited by water level.为量化河岸带湿地碳源/汇并探究其对气候变化的反馈关系,采用静态箱-气相色谱法和相对生长方程法,测定长白山溪流河岸带低地至高地沿水分减小梯度依次分布的3种森林沼泽(毛赤杨沼泽、白桦沼泽和落叶松沼泽)土壤温室气体年通量、土壤年净碳排放量、植被年净固碳量及相关环境因子(温度、水位等)。结果表明: 长白山溪流河岸带森林沼泽的CH4(0.19～0.85 mg·m-2·h-1)、CO2(60.81～228.63 mg·m-2·h-1)和N2O(-0.02～0.05 mg·m-2·h-1)年通量沿低地至高地水分梯度依次呈先恒定后降低、递减和先吸收后排放的空间变化规律,且这3种温室气体年通量的空间变化均受水位控制。河岸带森林沼泽的植被年净固碳量(2.61～3.45 t C·hm-2·a-1)沿水分梯度呈恒定型,主要受硝态氮含量促进。河岸带森林沼泽的碳源/汇及全球增温潜势(GWP)沿水分梯度发生了规律性的转变,其中,毛赤杨沼泽为碳汇(1.93 t C·hm-2·a-1),白桦沼泽为弱碳源(-0.18 t C·hm-2·a-1),而落叶松沼泽为强碳源(-2.51 t C·hm-2·a-1);且森林沼泽碳源/汇的空间变化受水位和硝态氮含量联合促进。毛赤杨沼泽表现为强冷却效应,与气候变化间存在较强负反馈作用(-5.88 t CO2·hm-2·a-1);落叶松沼泽表现为强增温效应,存在较强正反馈作用(10.97 t CO2·hm-2·a-1);而白桦沼泽表现为弱增温效应,近似于中性(2.95 t CO2·hm-2·a-1);且森林沼泽GWP的空间变化主要受水位抑制。.

ABSTRACT: The high demand for concrete has triggered studies on the mitigation of Portland cement production impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy demands, in addition to enabling cost reduction. Partial replacement of cement with other materials has been employed as an alternative to minimize the damage caused by the cement industry. In this regard, it is necessary to use materials that efficiently replace cement clinker. This study uses waste generated from the production of metallic magnesium as a partial replacement for Portland cement. The substitution is aimed at reducing the amount of clinker used, as its production necessitates high energy consumption and results in emission of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. The tailings were characterized via X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and granulometric analysis. For evaluating the mechanical behavior and porosity, 25% of the cement (by mass) was replaced with tailings, and the resulting composite was molded into cylindrical specimens. After curing for 28 and 91 days, all specimens underwent compression testing. The results of the physical characterization showed that more than 65% of the tailing grain was lesser than 45 μm in size, which contributes to the packaging effect. In terms of the chemical and mineralogical composition, the tailing had high levels of calcium, and the predominant phases could be identified. The compressive strength of the mortar with substitution was higher than 40 MPa. The convergence observed between the results of the different characterization techniques demonstrates the efficiency of using the waste as a supplementary cementitious material.

Abstract An indispensable factor to the development of improved enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is the in-depth insight into the fractional flow mechanistic effects of waterflood performance. Especially for an inefficient waterflood operated field. In this study the inefficiency of waterflood on FWU is investigated. The field is divided into two halves (East and west) of the same reservoir and similar geological characteristics. Though the east was prolific on primary recovery it failed on waterflood whiles the west performed efficiently and hence its undergoing WAG CO2-EOR improved recovery technique. Through core-flood experiments, the causative mechanisms are unraveled. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) analyses were also conducted to assess mineral composition, pore characteristics and distribution. The core samples exhibited extremely low permeability, resulting in a drastic reduction in flow capacity. The reservoir primarily consists of quartz, clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, smectite), feldspar, and carbonates. Single-phase injection of low salinity water (SIIW) further reduced permeability and increased differential pressure compared to high salinity water (SCW). Higher flow rates caused significant increments in differential pressure, likely due to velocity-induced fine migration. pH changes and the presence of Al3+, Fe2+, and Zn ions indicated brine reactions. Two flood recovery strategies showed incremental recovery with SIIW injection with observed adverse effects. Fine migrations, clay swelling, scaling, and precipitation were identified as key causes of formation damage during low salinity water flooding. Element-mineral associations showed clays and mineral particles obstructing pores and pore throats. In summary, the principal mechanisms of waterflood inefficiency include low permeability, mineral composition (especially clay minerals), clay mineral reactivity, and increased pressure drop (ΔP). These factors collectively contribute to formation damage, pore plugging, reduced flow capacity, and ultimately the inefficiency of waterflood operations. These insights contribute to the development of effective waterflood strategies and improved recovery techniques for incremental recovery from the FWU-east field especially considering CO2-WAG EOR.

Carbon emissions are a global issue around the world due to energy consumption, and to resolve this, increasing focus has been placed on attaining carbon neutrality. This research bridges the gap in related literature by considering perspectives on electricity. We develop a regression model from renewable energy consumption and production and apply game theory to get different decisions on electricity production from renewable energy (RE) production-consumption and subsidies on RE resources. Subsequently, a simulation-driven optimization method is employed to generate various scenarios. Various experiments are manipulated to find the optimal decisions of carbon-neutral indicators. Results indicate that subsidies on renewable energy that generate electricity exhibit a significant role in maximizing CO2 emission reduction. It is found that subsidies on wind energy consumption and production play a pivotal role in mitigating carbon emissions. This study elaborates on a valuable contribution in providing optimal decisions for achieving carbon neutrality in RE production and consumption. It offers guidelines to pay attention to the policies about RE resources to make the environment clean. Ultimately, this research not only presents optimal pathways for attaining carbon neutrality but also marks the necessity of targeted policies focused on RE resources to promote a cleaner and sustainable environment globally.

Electrochemical hydrogen compression is a promising alternative to conventional mechanical compression due to low maintenance costs and high one-stage compression ratios. The typically employed planar systems, however, are intrinsically difficult to operate in high differential pressure environments. Tubular systems are inherently advantageous for high differential pressure systems but require innovative membrane electrode assembly development. This study unveils the first tubular EHC featuring a membrane electrode assembly supported by a stainless steel 3D-printed porous anode. The membrane electrode assembly for gas-phase electrochemistry is produced by spray coating the porous anode with Pt/C as the catalyst and joining the anode with a tubular catalyst-coated membrane. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates the functionality of the tubular EHC at current densities up to 60 mAcm−2 with a cell potential of 200 mV under non-pressurized conditions. Moreover, a pressure difference of 2 bar is achieved at 60 mAcm−2 within the first 60 min in continuous mode. By demonstrating the proof-of-principle for the first tubular EHC, this work paves the way for new research avenues in electrochemical process engineering, offering a broad spectrum of applications, from enhancing EHC technologies to advancing electrochemical CO2 reduction.

The oxidation of heavy oil (HOO) during In-situ combustion (ISC) within the porous media of reservoir rock matrix is a critical process. Although previous research has individually investigated the catalytic capabilities of clay minerals (e.g., kaolinite) and carbonate minerals (e.g., dolomite) in HOO, their combined influence remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate the impact of dolomite and kaolinite coexistence on HOO in the Badaowan Formation reservoir located in the Karamay Oilfield. The findings reveal that the Hongqian (HQ) core displays remarkable catalytic ability for HOO, evidenced by the reduction in peak temperatures (Tpeak) of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infrared absorption of H2O and CO2 during heavy oil HTO stage. The enhanced catalytic ability is not solely attributed to the presence of single-component minerals like quartz, feldspar, dolomite, or kaolinite within the HQ core. Instead, the kaolinite/dolomite composite showcased a synergistic effect, significantly lowering the Tpeak of DSC (HTO) beyond the performance of kaolinite or dolomite acting independently. This synergistic effect is closely associated with the dehydroxylation process of kaolinite. Notably, the catalytic effect of the kaolinite/dolomite composite on HOO was further enhanced at calcination temperatures above 450 °C, primarily due to the increased catalytic ability of dolomite after calcination.

Enhancing soil health is critical to improve crop productivity, fertilizer use efficiency, and resilience to climate change impacts for smallholder farmers in Africa. Increasing the use of mineral fertilizers is critical for achieving higher crop yield and residue return. However, it is crucial to consider the simultaneous use of carbon (C)-rich organic materials alongside mineral fertilizers to support soil health and enhance fertilizer use efficiency. It is proposed that increasing mineral fertilizer use without a concurrent increase in C-rich organic materials may not enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil health in the long term. When the labile pool of nutrients is increased through mineral fertilizer, it can reduce microbial C use efficiency, thereby hindering the formation and stabilization of SOC. This reduction in efficiency can cause a more significant proportion of the returned plant residues to be lost as CO2 through microbial respiration rather than being incorporated into the SOC pool. However, this effect can be mitigated by the concurrent application of large amounts of organic amendments, such as compost, manure or biochar, which provide a balanced supply of nutrients and C substrates to support microbial activity and enhance SOC formation.

ABSTRACT The effects of soil compaction on crop growth and productivity have been well studied in recent years, however, studies on the physiological responses of crops to compaction are scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil compaction on gas exchange, and photochemical efficiency of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) genotypes of different growth habits. The experimental design was a randomized block in a 3×4 factorial arrangement, with three lima bean genotypes (Branca-Pequena, Orelha-de-Vó and Roxinha) and four compaction levels (soil densities of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7 g cm-3), with four replications. The following variables were evaluated at 38 days after sowing: photosynthetic rate (A), leaf transpiration (E), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO2 concentration (Ci), instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE), intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE), instantaneous carboxylation efficiency (iCE) and photochemical efficiency (Fo, Fm, Fv and Fv/Fm). The data were subjected to analysis of variance at 5% probability by the F test. The genotypes showed a reduction in the photosynthetic rate with increasing soil compaction. The soil compaction affected the photochemical efficiency of the genotype Orelha-de-Vó, with the Fm and Fv fitting to the linear model, and the Fv/Fm fitting to the quadratic model. The genotype Orelha-de-Vó had the highest rate of E and gs at the soil densities of 1.24 and 1.29 g cm-3, respectively. Regarding the photosynthetic rate, the genotype Roxinha is more efficient than Branca-Pequena at the soil density of 1.7 g cm -3.

ABSTRACT The salinity of irrigation water or soil is the abiotic factor that most negatively impacts the yield of crops, including green maize, so it is necessary to find alternatives to ensure production. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, and growth of maize under salinity of irrigation water and application of hydrogen peroxide. The experiment was conducted at the Center of Sciences and Agrifood Technology, Pombal, PB, belonging to the Federal University of Campina Grande, in the period from January to February 2015, using the maize hybrid ‘AG 1051’. The treatments consisted of two salinity levels of irrigation water (0.3 and 2.0 dS m-1) and five concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0, 40, 80, 160, and 320 µmol L-1) applied via irrigation water. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme, with four replicates. ECw of 2.0 dS m-1 reduces transpiration, stomatal conductance, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, and initial growth, but does not affect the dry mass accumulation of maize plants. Application of H2O2 via soil varying from 0 to 320 µmol L-1 causes reductions in the CO2 assimilation rate and transpiration, as well as at concentrations from 0 to 160 µmol L-1 for stomatal conductance of plants irrigated with ECw of 2.0 dS m-1. Application of H2O2 via soil up to a concentration of 320 µmol L-1 increases the plant height, but reduces culm diameter of maize.

The decarbonisation of the steel and cement industry is of utmost importance in tackling climate change. Hence, steel production in modern integrated steel mills will be shifted towards electric arc furnaces in the future, in turn causing dwindling supplies of blast furnace slag, which is used as a supplementary cementitious material inter alia to reduce the CO2 emissions of cement production. Achieving a sustainable circular steel and building material economy requires the valorisation of currently landfilled steel slags and investigating utilisation options for electric arc furnace slag, which is increasingly being generated. For this purpose, different metallurgical residues and by-products were treated by carbothermal reduction in an inductively heated graphite crucible and then rapidly cooled by wet granulation, yielding a slag fraction similar to granulated blast furnace slag and a metal fraction valuable as a secondary raw material. A spreadsheet-based model was developed to calculate residue combinations to accomplish target compositions of the slag and metal fractions to fulfil previously identified requirements of the targeted cementitious and ferrous products. The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the model in predicting the properties (e.g. main oxide composition) of the generated slag and metal fraction, which fulfil the needed requirements for their use as (i) a supplementary cementitious material and (ii) a secondary raw material in steel production.

In the pharmaceutical industry, energy efficiency has played a minor role compared to other energy-intensive industries. However, there is a growing recognition of the need to address environmental concerns. With ambitious climate targets and the increasing demand for significant reductions in CO2 emissions, the pharmaceutical industry is now embracing the opportunity to enhance its sustainability practices. Mainly fossil fuels are used to provide process steam at moderate temperature levels at about 160-180°C and to a lesser extent to provide hot water or for on-site power production in CHPs. In this paper, the main processes with demands for process heat, such as media supply, cleaning, or air conditioning, are presented and possibilities for increasing efficiency, for switching to alternative heat supply and for using alternative process technologies are evaluated with respect to economics, but also regarding hurdles for implementation such as requirements for revalidation of production processes and possible necessity of re-approval of products. The present study highlights the potentials for decarbonization of the Austrian pharmaceutical industry using a generic but representative production site applying various measures that either reduce heating and cooling requirements or alter the temperature requirements for heat supply. It is shown that, at least for the example case, full decarbonization is technically feasibly without an increase in energy costs if efficiency measures are progressively used on demand level.

Aestivation is a form of seasonal dormancy observed in various insect species, usually coinciding with the summer season. Psylliodes chrysocephala (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), the cabbage stem flea beetle, is a key pest of oilseed rape and obligatorily aestivates as adult in late summer. At present, our understanding of the physiological and transcriptional changes linked to aestivation in P. chrysocephala is still limited. In this study, physiological parameters and RNA-seq analyses were performed with laboratory-reared beetles at pre-aestivation, aestivation, and post-aestivation stages. Measurements of CO2 production supported the notion that aestivating beetles dramatically reduce their metabolic rate and, together with assessments of reproductive maturation, allowed precise discrimination between the three adult stages. Aestivating beetles showed a reduction in carbohydrate reserves and an increase in lipid reserves compared to pre-aestivating beetles, indicating that aestivation is associated with drastic changes in energy metabolism. In agreement with these findings, we found that genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, digestion, and mitochondrial activity are differentially expressed between the three stages. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis suggested the regulation of transcription factors associated with aestivation maintenance and the involvement of cytochrome P450s in conferring a summer-resistant phenotype during the aestivation period. In conclusion, this study represents the first exploration of the transcriptomic and physiological aspects of the aestivation response in P. chrysocephala.

ABSTRACT The use of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) has grown in agricultural spraying around the world, but there is a lack of research data to assist users in making more assertive decisions due to its recent nature. This study aimed to evaluate spray deposition in corn using an RPA DJI AGRAS-MG-1 at two application heights compared to the application using a knapsack sprayer. Sprayings were carried out in the corn crop at the phenological stage V5-V6. The experiment consisted of three treatments and eight replications, applied with an RPA at heights of 1.5 and 3.0 m and a CO2-pressurized knapsack sprayer. The application rate was 10 L ha-1 for RPA and 115 L ha-1 for the knapsack sprayer. Flat fan spray tips were used for all treatments. Tracer deposition in the corn canopy and spray loss to the soil were evaluated using spectrophotometric detection, while coverage, density, and droplet spectrum were evaluated on water-sensitive paper. Total and effective deposition swath were also evaluated for RPA. Although droplet density provided by RPA varied between 26 and 39 droplets cm-2, the coverage was lower than 1.3%. Application using RPA at the height of 1.5 m provided tracer deposition on corn leaves similar to that carried out with the knapsack sprayer. The increase in application height to 3.0 m promoted a reduction in the deposition. Ground spraying promoted higher spray loss to the soil. The effective deposition swath consisted of 5.7 and 7.6 m for application heights of 1.5 and 3.0 m, respectively.

Stabilization of central carbohydrate metabolism plays a key role in plant stress response. Carbohydrates are substrate for numerous metabolic and stress-responsive reactions and have been shown to be involved in diverse signalling processes on a whole plant level. Regulation of enzymatic sucrose synthesis and degradation is well-known to be central to many stress-related processes as it significantly impacts stress tolerance. Leaf sucrose metabolism involves sucrose cleavage by invertases and ATP-consuming re-synthesis catalysed by hexokinase and sucrose phosphate synthase. These reactions establish a metabolic cycle. To study the physiological role of sucrose cycling, a kinetic model was developed to simulate dynamics of subcellular sugar concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana under combined cold and high light stress. Model simulation revealed that subcellular reprogramming of invertase-driven sucrose cleavage varies substantially between natural accessions of Arabidopsis which differ in their cold tolerance levels. A stress-induced shift of sucrose cleavage from the cytosol into the vacuole could only be observed for the tolerant accession while the susceptible accession increased the cytosolic proportion of sucrose cleavage. Under stress, reduction of vacuolar invertase activity significantly affected maximum quantum yield of photosystem II and CO2 assimilation rates. While wild type plants circumvented a limitation of sucrose cleavage by increasing vacuolar invertase activity, mutant plants were not able to compensate their deficiency of vacuolar by cytosolic activity. Consequently, the capacity for cytosolic hexose generation was lower than for enzymatic hexose phosphorylation suggesting a role of vacuolar invertase activity in preventing a limitation in cytosolic hexose metabolism under stress.

As electrocatalysts, molecular catalysts with large aromatic systems (such as terpyridine, porphyrin, or phthalocyanine) have been widely applied in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, these monomeric catalysts tend to aggregate due to strong π–π interactions, resulting in limited accessibility of the active site. In light of these challenges, we present a novel strategy of active site isolation for enhancing the CO2RR. Six Ru(Tpy)2 were integrated into the skeleton of a metallo-organic supramolecule by stepwise self-assembly in order to form a rhombus-fused six-pointed star R1 with active site isolation. The turnover frequency (TOF) of R1 was as high as 10.73 s–1 at −0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE), which is the best reported value so far at the same potential to our knowledge. Furthermore, by increasing the connector density on R1's skeleton, a more stable triangle-fused six-pointed star T1 was successfully synthesized. T1 exhibits exceptional stability up to 126 h at −0.4 V vs RHE and excellent TOF values of CO. The strategy of active site isolation and connector density increment significantly enhanced the catalytic activity by increasing the exposure of the active site. This work provides a starting point for the design of molecular catalysts and facilitates the development of a new generation of catalysts with a high catalytic performance.

Developing cobalt-based catalysts with a high abundance of oxygen vacancies (Vo) and exceptional Vo utility efficiency for the prompt removal of stubborn contaminants through peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation poses a significant challenge. Herein, we reported the synthesis of the reduced Mg-doped Co3O4 nanosheets, i.e. Mg-doped Co3O4-r, via Mg doping and followed by NaBH4 reduction, aiming to degrade tetracycline (TC). Various characterization results illustrated that NaBH4 reduction imparted higher Vo utility efficiency to Mg-doped Co3O4-r, along with an ample presence of reduced Co2+ species and an increased surface area, thereby substantially elevating PMS activation capability. Notably, Mg-doped Co3O4-r achieved more than 97.9% degradation of 20 mg/L TC within 10 min, showing an over 8-fold increase in reaction rate relative to the Mg-doped Co3O4 (kobs: 0.3285 min-1 vs 0.0399 min-1). The high removal efficiency of TC was sustained across a broad pH range of 3 to 11, even in the presence of common anions and humic acid. Radical quenching trials, EPR outcomes, and electrochemical analysis indicated that neither radicals nor 1O2 were the primary active species. Instead, electron transfer pathway played dominant role in TC degradation. The Mg-doped Co3O4-r displayed excellent recyclability and versatility. Even after the fifth cycle, it maintained an impressive 83.0% removal of TC. Furthermore, it exhibited rapid degradation capabilities for various pollutants, including levofloxacin, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, malachite green, and rhodamine B. The TC degradation pathway was proposed based on LC-MS determination of its degradation intermediates. This study showcases an innovative strategy for the rational design of an efficient cobalt-based activator, leveraging electron transfer pathways through PMS activation to degrade antibiotics effectively.

In this regard, we constructed an ACE inventory for Shandong Province at a resolution of 1 km × 1 km, integrating the emission factor method with geographic information system (GIS) technology. Building upon this, we explored the dynamic evolution patterns of ACEs using kernel density estimation and conditional probability density estimation. Additionally, long short-term memory networks were trained to predict ACEs under various scenarios. The results showed that: (1) ACEs in Shandong Province exhibited two stages of change, i.e., “rise and decline”. Notably, 64.39% of emissions originated from the planting industry. The distribution of emissions was closely correlated with regional agricultural production modes. Specifically, CO2 emissions were predominantly distributed in crop cultivation areas, while CH4 and N2O emissions were primarily distributed in livestock breeding areas. The uncertainty of the emission inventory ranged from −12.04% to 10.74%, mainly caused by emission factors. (2) The ACE intensity of various cities in Shandong Province is decreasing, indicating a decoupling between ACEs and agricultural economic growth. Furthermore, the emission disparities among different cities are diminishing, although significant spatial non-equilibrium still persists. (3) From 2022 to 2030, the ACEs in Shandong Province will show a continuous downward trend. By 2030, the projected values under the baseline scenario, low-carbon scenario I, and low-carbon scenario II will be 6301.74 × 104 tons, 5980.67 × 104 tons, and 5850.56 × 104 tons. The low-carbon scenario reveals greater potential for ACE reduction while achieving efficient rural economic development and urbanization simultaneously. This study not only advances the methodology of the ACE inventory but also provides quantitative references and scientific bases for promoting low-carbon, efficient, and sustainable regional agriculture.

The study provides a comprehensive assessment of strategic zoning for biomass energy development across various regions in Iraq through GIS-based analysis. It delves into the energy surplus factor a pivotal metric indicating a region capacity to produce energy beyond its consumption needs. Results indicate a significant disparity in energy production-consumption balance across the regions, impacting local and national energy sustainability initiatives. A notable proportion of the study areas exceed a surplus factor of 3.5, showcasing the possibility of regions to not only meet their own energy needs but to also contribute to a surplus, thanks to effective renewable energy use and other energy-efficient practices. Conversely, a considerable number of cities have surplus factors below 1, signaling energy deficits and a dependence on external energy sources due to high consumption, underdeveloped local energy infrastructure, or other inefficiencies. Meanwhile, other regions achieve a balance, with surplus factors ranging from 1.5 to 4, indicating a more sustainable alignment of energy production with consumption. The study segments regions into tiers based on their surplus factors, suggesting that those with higher factors have greater CO2 reduction potential, thereby offering a nuanced strategy for resource management and environmental policy-making. These insights establish a nuanced framework for optimizing energy production, managing consumption, and reducing emissions, tailored to the diverse energy landscapes of Iraq regions.

One of the most important challenges for the South East Europe region will be replacing more than 30% of its presently installed fossil fuel generation capacity by the end of 2030, and more than 95% by 2050 if its age structure is considered. This requires a strong policy framework to incentivise new investments in a region currently lacking investors, but also presents an opportunity to shape the electricity sector over the long term according to the broader energy transition strategy of the EU and the Energy Community. The aim of this paper is to assess what type of long-term pathways exist for electricity sector development in the region if they follow the energy transition process of the EU. In this model-based scenario assessment, long term electricity sector futures are explored using a set of interlinked electricity models evaluating the level of renewable energy investment required in the region to reach a deep decarbonization target, assuming emission reduction above 94% by 2050 compared to 1990 in line with the long term market integration and climate policy goals of the EU. It also explores what are the most important system wide impacts of the high deployment of renewable energy concerning generation adequacy and security of supply.

Differentially dolomitized carbonate strata in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) are increasingly targeted for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), yet few studies have evaluated the petrophysical characteristics of these conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs for this purpose. To address this, this study uses drill core analysis (sedimentology, diagenesis, pore morphology and distribution), together with core plug and production data, to evaluate the properties of five depleted oil and gas fields in the Middle to Upper Devonian Swan Hills Formation, Leduc Formation and Wabamun Group. The Swan Hills and Leduc Formations are comprised of reef, shoal and lagoon deposits that are predominantly fossil-rich (e.g. stromatoporoid-dominated rudstones and boundstones). In contrast, the carbonate ramp deposits of the Wabamun Group are fossil-poor, consisting instead of variably bioturbated carbonate mudstones, wackestones and packstones. Replacement dolomitization is variable throughout each stratigraphic unit, but generally occurs within fossil-rich and/or heavily bioturbated intervals. Fracture densities are broadly comparable in limestone and dolostone. Porosity in the Swan Hills and Leduc Formations is predominantly moldic and vuggy, occurring where fossils (e.g. stromatoporoids) are partially or fully dissolved. Pore space in the Wabamun Group is mostly restricted to intercrystalline porosity within burrows. In general, burial cements (e.g. calcite and dolomite) are volumetrically insignificant and only partially fill pores. Exceptions to this include porosity-occluding cements associated w ith fractures and breccias in the vicinity of faults. Dolomitization and depositional facies are found to exert a strong control on pore morphology, distribution and interconnectivity. Porosity is primarily controlled by the relative abundance of skeletal grains and by the presence of burrows. These highly porous facies acted as fluid pathways during burial diagenesis, resulting in their preferential dolomitization, solution enhancement of pre-existing pores, and creation of volume reduction-related porosity. The high CO2 storage capacity and low unplanned plume migration risk (due to depositional/diagenetic baffles) of dolomitized reefal reservoirs (e.g. Swan Hills and Leduc Formations) make them more attractive targets for CCUS than those with limited capacity and/or potential migration pathways (e.g. fault-related fractures and breccias in the Wabamun Group). These results demonstrate that drill core analysis, in combination with legacy data, can provide valuable insights into the factors that control reservoir CO2 injectivity, plume migration and storage capacity.

Coffee beans are a major agricultural product and coffee is one of the most widely traded commodities and consumed beverages globally. Supply chains and cropping systems are very diverse, with contrasted potentials and performance, as well as environmental impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies are needed to inform on reduction in impacts, but there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the variability of existing LCA results and impacts of the cropping systems and their trade-offs along the supply chains. In an attempt to address this knowledge gap, the paper presents a systematic literature review of coffee LCA, considering a total of 34 studies covering 234 coffee systems. Global warming potential (GWP) was the impact category most reported in the literature, but the results varied greatly at both the farm and drink levels. For the former, the GWP was in the range of 0.15–14.5 (median 3.6) kg CO2 eq./kg green coffee beans and for the latter the values ranged from 2 to 23 (median of 8.8) kg CO2 eq./kg consumed coffee in drinks. Main contributors to the GWP of production of green coffee beans were land use change (LUC), fertilisers and wet processing. However, there were great inconsistencies across studies in terms of LUC accounting, field emissions and wet process modelling. Green coffee beans production was also the main contributor to the GWP of coffee consumed, followed by brewing and coffee cup washing. Some studies covered other impacts, in addition to GWP. At both the farm and drink levels, fertilisers and pesticides were the main contributors to eutrophication and acidification, and to ecotoxicity, respectively. Brewing was the second main contributor at the drink level, in some cases the top contributor for energy-related indicators. Assumptions on packaging, cup washing and waste disposal were highly variable across studies. Water impact indicators were hardly comparable due to the system variability and method inconsistencies. Given the large diversity of coffee cropping systems worldwide, but also the diversity of possible coffee drinks, we recommend that LCA studies be standardised with respect to the definition of the functional unit, including consistent quality aspects for both green coffee beans (moisture) and coffee drinks (organoleptic properties). They should also be more thorough in detailing processes at all stages. More attention should be paid to the farming system complexity and a mass balance should be ensured when assessing biomass flows concerning LUC, co-products and residue emissions. Finally, more primary data would be needed to decipher the cropping system diversity, as well as to characterise emissions from all inputs to the field and bean processing, notably for wet and semi-wet processing.

Here, we successfully synthesized Sr-doped perovskite-type oxides of La1−xSrxCo1−λO3−δ, “LSX” (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7), using the glycine-assisted solution combustion method. The effect of strontium doping on the catalyst structure, NO to NO2 conversion, NOx adsorption and storage, and NOx reduction performance were investigated. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were studied by XRD, SEM-EDS, N2 adsorption–desorption, FTIR, H2-TPR, O2-TPD, and XPS techniques. The NSR performance of LaCoO3 perovskite was improved after Sr doping. Specifically, the perovskite with 50% of Sr doping (LS5 sample) exhibited excellent NOx storage capacity within a wide temperature range (200–400 °C), and excellent stability after hydrothermal and sulfur poisoning. It also displayed the highest NOx adsorption–storage capacity (NAC: 1889 μmol/g; NSC: 1048 μmol/g) at 300 °C. This superior performance of the LS5 catalyst can be attributed to its superior reducibility, better NO oxidation capacity, increased surface Co2+ concentration, and, in particular, its generation of more oxygen vacancies. FTIR results further revealed that the LSX catalysts primarily store NOx through the “nitrate route”. During the lean–rich cycle tests, we observed an average NOx conversion rate of over 50% in the temperature range of 200–300 °C, with a maximum conversion rate of 61% achieved at 250 °C.

Advancements in new technologies, a reduction in CO2 emissions, and the rising demand for energy are causing a growth in the share of renewable energy sources. In distribution networks, an increasing number of distributed generators (DGs) makes the utility grid’s protection complex and demanding. Vector surge and rate-of-change-of-frequency are the established anti-islanding protection methods, recognizing that the standard paradigm for protection, involving distributed generation, cannot be set only once but has to be continuously updated following the requirements and changes in the system. One of the requirements is active participation in the preservation of system frequency and voltage, which can be interrupted if the DG trips and disconnects from the utility grid. Anti-islanding protection and spurious tripping can be avoided by implementing new algorithms and techniques. This paper presents a novel protection scheme based on a voltage frequency differential. The proposed algorithm employs remote and local frequency measurements in such a manner that, for the occurrence of a frequency difference, it is assumed that the DG is in an islanding state. In this article, we demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm through numerical analysis of grid events and laboratory testing emulating real grid-measured values. The test results show that the algorithm is resilient to false tripping for non-islanding events and more reliable than conventional methods in islanding detection. The algorithm can be set to low-frequency differential values, drastically reducing the non-detection zone in any DG type, regardless of its size and voltage level at the point of common coupling. Unlike standard anti-islanding methods, the algorithm supports the ability of the DG to fault-ride through demand.

The preparation of cement-based supplementary cementitious materials is an important method for the efficient use of iron tailings and the reduction in CO2 emissions. The aim of this study is to improve the reactivity of iron tailings by mixing them with steel slag, slag, and fly ash through orthogonal tests to solve the problem that iron tailings cannot be utilised on a large scale. The compressive strength, hydration products, and microstructure of the iron tailings–cement-based supplementary cementitious materials were investigated using ICP-OES, XRD, TG, FTIR, and SEM. The results revealed that each solid waste raw material played a distinct role in the hydration reaction. In the iron tailings–cement-based supplementary cementitious materials system, steel slag provided Ca2+, OH−, and Si4+ ions, slag provided Ca2+ and Al3+ ions, fly ash contributed a significant amount of Ca2+ and Al3+ ions, and iron tailings offered more nucleation sites and some Si4+ ions for the hydration products. Moreover, there was a synergistic effect among these four materials, promoting the formation of hydration products such as ettringite, C-(A)-S-H gels, and others. When the proportion of IOTs:SS:FA:SL was 9:8:8:2, the highest 7 d compressive strength of cementitious material was 24.8 MPa. When the proportion of IOTs:SS:FA:SL was 9:6:8:4, the highest 28 d compressive strength of cementitious material was 35.0 MPa. This study provides a comprehensive solution for the utilisation of iron tailings and contributes to the high-value green utilisation of solid waste.

The files present the ventilation and air exchange rates of two residential buildings in İzmir, Turkey. The results of this paper are published in the Journal of Environmental Research and Technology.  Kindly see the abstract below to find out more:  Houses are the places where people spend most of their time. That is why indoor air quality at home is essential for public health. Sufficient ventilation is the factor to avoid accumulation of pollutants in indoor air, which include microorganisms, such as SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, adequate ventilation is needed to provide good indoor air quality for human health and reduce infection risk at home. There are no reports of residential ventilation rates in Turkey. In this study, CO2 concentrations were measured in two residences in Izmir, Turkey. Three experiments were conducted to determine background concentrations and the rate of natural ventilation with infiltration and opening windows. Results show that air exchange provided by infiltration is low for both case rooms, while adequate ventilation could be achieved with natural ventilation under the studied conditions. Infiltration provided air exchange and ventilation rates of 0.18 h-1 and 5.9 m3/h for Case 1 and 0.29 h-1 and 8.23 m3/h for Case 2, respectively. Air exchange and ventilation rates were increased to 2.36 h-1 and 76.9 m3/h for Case 1 and 1.2 h-1 and 34 m3/h for Case 2, respectively, by opening the windows. Although ventilation can be provided by opening the windows, the other factors that determine its rate, e.g., meteorological variables, cannot be controlled by the occupants. Consequently, people cannot ensure the good indoor air quality in bedrooms and sufficient reduction in transmission of pathogenic microorganisms; therefore, risk of spreading diseases such as COVID-19 at home.

Abstract The XPC protein, which is mutated in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group C (XP-C), is a lesion recognition factor in NER, but it has also been shown to interact with and stimulate DNA glycosylases, to act as transcriptional co-activator and on energy metabolism adaptation. We have previously demonstrated that XP-C cells show increased mitochondrial H2O2 production with a shift between respiratory complexes I and II, leading to sensitivity to mitochondrial stress. Here we report a marked decrease in expression of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, in XP-C cells. A transcriptional role for XPC in PGC-1α expression was discarded, as XPC knockdown did not downregulate PGC-1α expression and XPC-corrected cells still showed lower PGC-1α expression. DNA methylation alone did not explain PGC-1α silencing. In four different XP-C cell lines tested, reduction of PGC-1α expression was detected in three, all of them carrying the c.1643_1644delTG mutation (ΔTG) in XPC. Indeed, all cell lines carrying XPC ΔTG mutation, whether homozygous or heterozygous, presented decreased PGC-1α expression. However, this alteration in gene expression was not exclusive to XPC ΔTG cell lines, for other non-related cell lines also showed altered PGC-1α expression. Moreover, PGC1-α expression did not correlate with expression levels of TFAM and SDHA, known PGC-1α target-genes. In turn, PPRC1, another member of the PGC family of transcription co-activators controlling mitochondrial biogenesis, displayed a good correlation between its expression in 10 cell lines and TFAM and SDHA. Nonetheless, PGC-1α knockdown led to a slight decrease of its target-gene protein level, TFAM, and subsequently of a mtDNA-encoded gene, MT-CO2. These results indicate that PGC-1α and PPRC1 cooperate as regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and maintenance in fibroblasts.

Abstract This study examines the relationship between inflation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in three major economies: the United States of America (USA), the European Union (EU), and China. The analysis spans from 1960 to 2021 for the USA and EU, and from 1971 to 2021 for China. A feedforward neural network model, optimized using the Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation algorithm, was employed to predict GHG emissions based on annual inflation rates and fossil fuel energy consumption. The study integrates historical data on inflation trends with GHG emissions, measured in CO2 equivalents, and fossil fuel energy consumption, expressed as a percentage of total energy use. This multidimensional approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the economic-environmental interplay in these regions. Key findings indicate a nonlinear response of GHG emissions to inflation rates. In the USA, GHG emissions begin to decrease when inflation rates exceed 4.7%. Similarly, in the EU, a steep reduction in emissions is observed beyond a 7.5% inflation rate. China presents a more complex pattern, with two critical inflection points: the first at a 4.5% inflation rate, where GHG emissions start to decline sharply, and the second at a 7% inflation rate, beyond which further increases in inflation do not significantly reduce emissions. A critical global insight is the identification of a uniform inflation rate, around 4.4%, across all regions, at which GHG emissions consistently increase by 1%, hinting at a shared global economic behavior impacting the environment. This discovery is vital for policymakers, emphasizing the need for tailored regional strategies that consider unique economic structures, energy policies, and environmental regulations, alongside a coordinated global approach.

AbstractDecreasing mortality and disability after traumatic brain injury is a significant medical challenge. Desflurane, a widely used volatile anesthetic has proven to be neuroprotective in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic brain injury. The aim of this study was to prove that desflurane reveals its neuroprotective properties in an in vitro model of traumatic brain injury. Organic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from brains of 5-7 day old C57/BL6 mice pups. After 14 days of culture the slices were exposed to a focal mechanical trauma and thereafter incubated with three different concentrations of desflurane (2, 4 and 6 vol %) for 2, 24 and 72 hours. Cell injury was assessed with propodium iodide. Our results showed that after two hours of desflurane exposure no significant change in trauma intensity was observed. However in the group without traumatic brain injury, a concentration of 2% and 4% desflurane could reduce the trauma intensity significantly in comparison to the group without desflurane and trauma. Incubating with 4% desflurane for 24 hours doubled the trauma intensity in comparison to the trauma control group and further increased after 72 hours of incubation. Furthermore, a dose-dependent increase of trauma intensity after 24 hours exposure was observed. In conclusion, our results suggest that a general neuroprotective attribute of desflurane in an in vitro model of traumatic brain injury was not observed.Figure 1 Trauma intensity of TBI organic hippocampal slice cultures incubated with various concentrations of desflurane for 2 hours After 2-hour incubation, cell death was stained using fluorescence images. Trauma intensity of the different groups is shown in relation to trauma intensity of mechanical traumatized slices after an incubation with 5% CO2, 21% O2,74% N2 for2 hours. Significant differences to the trauma no desflurane group are marked with *. There was no significant reduction in trauma intensity at the groups with mechanical trauma (P > 0.05). In the group without TBI, a concentration of 2% desflurane (*P = 0.033) and 4% desflurane (*P =0.004) reduced the trauma intensity significantly in comparison to the group without desflurane and trauma. For each group an average of 80 with a minimum of 56 slices where analyzed.Figure 2 Trauma intensity of TBI organic hippocampal slice cultures incubated with various concentrations of desflurane for 24 hoursAfter 24-hour incubation, cell death was stained using fluorescence images. Trauma intensity of different groups is shown in relation to trauma intensity of traumatized slices after an incubation with 5% CO2, 21% O2,74% N2 for 2 hours. Significant differences compared with the positive control group after two hours of incubation (Trauma without desflurane) are marked with *. Important significant differences between the groups after 24h incubation are also marked with * on the top of the figure. After 24 hours of incubation the trauma intensity tripled as compared to the trauma intensity after 2 hours of incubation. In the group without TBI the increase of trauma intensity rises also from 2% desflurane (*P = 0.000) to 6% desflurane (*P = 0.000). For the trauma group a significant increase of trauma intensity was observed at 4% desflurane (*P = 0.006) and 6% desflurane (*P = 0.000). For each group an average of 73 with a minimum of 62 slices were analyzed.Figure 3 Trauma intensity of TBI organic hippocampal slice cultures incubated with concentration of 4% desflurane for 2, 24 and 72 hours.In summary on this figure slices were exposed to a concentration of 4% desflurane and to 5% CO2, 21% O2, 74% N2 (trauma no desflurane) for 2-72 hours. Trauma intensity of the different groups is shown in relation to trauma intensity of traumatized slices after an incubation without desflurane for 2 hours. Significant differences compared with the trauma no desflurane after two hours of incubation are marked with *. After 2 hours of incubation, there was no significant difference between the trauma no desflurane group and the trauma group with 4% desflurane (P = 0.273). After 24 hours, an increase to the double trauma intensity at the trauma group without desflurane was observed. Incubating with 4% desflurane after trauma led to an increase of trauma intensity to the four-fold. Finally after 72 hours the trauma intensity represents without desflurane and with 4% desflurane in the trauma group. For each group an average of 94 with a minimum of 73 slices where analyzed.

Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) over a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by reduction of a NiAl2O4 spinel is a promising alternative route to produce H2 from biomass. This work deepens into the effect of reaction conditions (450–650 °C, a steam/ethanol (S/E) ratio of 3–9, and a weight space time up to 1.3 h) and evaluates the time on stream evolution of the yields of H2, gaseous byproducts (CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H4O), and formed carbon/coke. The results are explained taking into consideration the thermodynamics, the extent of each individual reaction, and the catalyst deactivation. Up to 600 °C, the predominant intermediate in the H2 formation is C2H4 (formed by ethanol dehydration) with the preferential formation of nanostructured carbon (nanotubes/filaments) by C2H4 decomposition. The deposition of this type of carbon partially deactivates the catalyst, mainly affecting the extent of the C2H4 decomposition causing a sharp decrease in the H2 and carbon yields. Nevertheless, the catalyst reaches a pseudosteady state with an apparent constant activity for other reactions in the kinetic scheme. At 650 °C, C2H4O (formed by the ethanol dehydrogenation) is the main intermediate in the H2 formation, which is the precursor of an amorphous/turbostratic carbon (coke) formation that initially causes a rapid deactivation of the catalyst, affecting the ethanol dehydration and, to a lower extent, the reforming and water gas shift reactions. The increase in the S/E ratio favors the H2 formation, attenuates the catalyst deactivation due to the suppression of the ethanol dehydration to C2H4, and promotes the reforming, water gas shift, and carbon/coke gasification reactions. A H2 yield of 85% stable for 48 h on stream is achieved at 600 °C, with a space time of 0.1 h and an S/E ratio of 9.

The UK Government's Climate Change Act (CCA) aims to achieve a net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050. Supermarkets, being among the most energy-intensive non-residential buildings, play a pivotal role in this endeavour. This research delves into the influence of climate change on supermarket buildings, exploring methodologies to mitigate its impact and assessing its effects on operational energy and carbon emissions. The United Nations has emphasized the built environment's significant contribution to global CO2 emissions, necessitating urgent action. Using a quantitative approach, this study employs the TAS – EDSL software to simulate energy consumption, carbon emission, and building regulations for various supermarket case studies. The research also evaluates the performance of these buildings across different UK climates and emission scenarios, incorporating EU Zebra2020 tool metrics. The primary challenge encountered was the scarcity of literature specifically targeting the UK supermarket industry in the context of climate change. The research underscores the importance of balancing energy consumption, carbon emissions, and future climate adaptations, especially given the industry's nZEB target by 2050. The findings of this study serve as a beacon for all non-residential buildings, bridging the knowledge gap between climate change, building futureproofing, and emission reduction strategies. The research underscores the importance of long-term planning, continuous monitoring of energy-intensive buildings, and the holistic approach of reducing emissions across a building's lifespan. This research aims to guide policymakers and building designers in future-proofing structures, emphasizing the need for energy-efficient measures and the integration of renewable technologies. The overarching goal is to foster the creation of sustainable, climate-resilient buildings for future generations.

Abstract Plate tectonics plays an essential role in the redistribution of life-essential volatile elements between Earth's interior and surface, whereby our planet has been well tuned to maintain enduring habitability over much of its history. Here we present an overview of deep carbon recycling in the regime of modern plate tectonics, with a special focus on convergent plate margins for assessing global carbon mass balance. The up-to-date flux compilation implies approximate balance between deep carbon outflux and subduction carbon influx within uncertainty but remarkably limited return of carbon to convecting mantle. If correct, carbon would gradually accumulate in the lithosphere over time by (i) massive subsurface carbon storage occurring primarily in continental lithosphere from convergent margins to continental interior and (ii) persistent surface carbon sinks to seafloors sustained by high-flux deep CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Further assessment of global carbon mass balance requires updates on fluxes of subduction-driven carbon recycling paths and reduction in uncertainty of deep carbon outflux. From a global plate tectonics point of view, we particularly emphasize that continental reworking is an important mechanism for remobilizing geologically sequestered carbon in continental crust and sub-continental lithospheric mantle. In light of recent advances, future research is suggested to focus on a better understanding of the reservoirs, fluxes, mechanisms, and climatic effects of deep carbon recycling following an integrated methodology of observation, experiment, and numerical modeling, with the aim of decoding the self-regulating Earth system and its habitability from the deep carbon recycling perspective.

Abstract Microcosm biofilms can reproduce the complexity of a dental biofilm. However, different forms of cultivation have been used. The impact of the culture atmosphere on the development of microcosm biofilms and their potential to cause tooth demineralization has not yet been deeply studied. Objective This study analyzes the effects of three experimental cultivation models (microaerophile vs. anaerobiosis vs. experimental mixed) on the colony-forming units (CFU) of the cariogenic microorganisms and tooth demineralization. Methodology 90 bovine enamel and 90 dentin specimens were distributed into different atmospheres: 1) microaerophilia (5 days, 5% CO2); 2) anaerobiosis (5 days, jar); 3) mixed (2 days microaerophilia and 3 days anaerobiosis), which were treated with 0.12% chlorhexidine (positive control – CHX) or Phosphate-Buffered Saline (negative control – PBS) (n=15). Human saliva and McBain’s saliva containing 0.2% sucrose were used for microcosm biofilm formation, for 5 days. From the second day to the end of the experiment, the specimens were treated with CHX or PBS (1x1 min/day). Colony-forming units (CFU) were counted, and tooth demineralization was analyzed using transverse microradiography (TMR). Data were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s or Sidak’s test (p<0.05). Results CHX was able to reduce total microorganism’s CFU compared to PBS (differences of 0.3–1.48 log10 CFU/mL), except for anaerobiosis and microaerophilia in enamel and dentin biofilm, respectively. In the case of dentin, no effect of CHX on Lactobacillus spp. was observed. CHX significantly reduced enamel demineralization compared to PBS (78% and 22% reductions for enamel and dentin, respectively). Enamel mineral loss did not differ when compared with the other atmospheres; however, the enamel lesion depth was greater under anaerobiosis. Dentin mineral loss was lower under anaerobiosis when compared with the other atmospheres. Conclusion The type of atmosphere has, in general, little influence on the cariogenic ability of the microcosm biofilm.

This study investigated the effects of ordinary limestone powder (OLP) and two ultrafine limestone powders (ULPs) on the early and late age hydration characteristics of cement pastes with low water-to-binder (w/b) ratios of 0.21. The compressive strengths and autogenous shrinkage rates were also examined. Calorimetry and setting data showed that finer limestone powder (LP) significantly shortened the induction period and setting time of the paste and accelerated the early hydration reaction. The kinetic model showed that the rates of nucleation and crystal growth (NG), phase boundary reaction (I), and diffusion (D) increased, and the duration of process I decreased with increasing LP fineness. This indicated that the increased rate from the early hydration reaction was closely related to accelerated nucleation of smaller LP particles. Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) revealed that the finer LPs generated more hydration products and improved hydration degree in the later stages. Moreover, under favorable conditions for nucleation and increased effective w/b ratios, the hydration products of the LP pastes were formed rapidly, exceeding those of the pure paste at late stages. A finer LP increased the compressive strength and autogenous shrinkage, but due to the reduction in clinker, the compressive strength and autogenous shrinkage were lower than those of the pure paste. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) showed that the cumulative volume of the pores greater than 50 nm decreased when the LP was finer, thus increasing the compressive strength and autogenous shrinkage. The incorporation of 25 vol% ULP (dv,50 = 2.653 μm) decreased the CO2 emissions per unit 28-day compressive strength by 17.34% compared to those of the pure paste. This study improves our understanding of the hydration behavior and properties of ULPs in cement-based materials with low w/b ratios and improves the use of LPs in HPC and UHPC.

Grass collected as part of roadside maintenance is conventionally subjected to composting, which has the disadvantage of generating significant CO2 emissions. Thus, it is crucial to find an alternative method for the utilisation of grass waste. The aim of this study was to determine the specific biogas yield (SBY) from the anaerobic mono-digestion of grass from road verges and to assess the content of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) in grass in relation to the time of cutting and the preservation method of the studied material. The biochemical biogas potential (BBP) test and the FAMEs content were performed on fresh and ensiled grass collected in spring, summer, and autumn. The highest biogas production was obtained from fresh grass cut in spring (715.05 ± 26.43 NL kgVS−1), while the minimum SBY was observed for fresh grass cut in summer (540.19 ± 24.32 NL kgVS−1). The methane (CH4) content in the biogas ranged between 55.0 ± 2.0% and 60.0 ± 1.0%. The contents of ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in biogas remained below the threshold values for these inhibitors. The highest level of total FAMEs was determined in fresh grass cut in autumn (98.08 ± 19.25 mg gDM−1), while the lowest level was detected in fresh grass cut in spring (56.37 ± 7.03 mg gDM−1). C16:0 and C18:0, which are ideal for biofuel production, were present in the largest amount (66.87 ± 15.56 mg gDM−1) in fresh grass cut in autumn. The ensiling process significantly impacted the content of total FAMEs in spring grass, leading to a reduction in total saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and an increase in total unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs). We conclude that grass biomass collected during the maintenance of road verges is a valuable feedstock for the production of both liquid and gaseous biofuels; however, generating energy from biogas appears to be more efficient than producing biodiesel.

Construction and demolition waste (CDW) has been recently identified as a potential aluminosilicate source for geopolymers. However, the available research has mainly focused on developing CDW-based geopolymer pastes and mortars, while studies on geopolymer concretes sourced from CDW have been very limited. Thus, the current study aimed at experimentally identifying different CDW materials suitable for producing geopolymer concretes. Additionally, the study analysed the mechanical, microstructural, and environmental properties of CDW- based geopolymer concrete produced. In this regard, the effect of relevant parameters on the compressive strength development of CDW-based geopolymer concretes was comprehensively investigated, including those related to precursor types/fineness, alkali activator solution, aggregate type/size and curing regimes. Microstructural analyses were also conducted on the selected samples (100% brick waste, 100% tile waste, 100% concrete waste and 75% brick waste + 25% GGBS). Finally, the environmental impact of geopolymer concrete was assessed and compared with similar traditional concrete. Results showed that employing CDWs alone is not suitable to achieve sufficient strengths under all curing regimes. However, the inclusion of 25% GGBS significantly improved the strength performance of CDW-based geopolymer concrete, in comparison to other supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as Class-C fly ash and calcium hydroxide. The particle size of CDWs and concentration of alkaline activators highly affect the performance of CDW-based geopolymer concretes. Utilization of CDWs with particles finer than 75 μm and high concentrations of NaOH (12 M) is recommended to achieve good performance. The results also indicate that almost similar energy is needed for producing CDW-based geopolymer and OPC-based traditional concrete, whereas a huge reduction in CO2 emission (∼40%) was estimated in the case of geopolymers. The outcomes of the current study are expected to contribute to the advancement of geopolymer concrete derived from CDW in addition to providing valuable insights into this type of concrete for practitioners and academics.

The U.S. rice paddy systems play an increasingly vital role in ensuring food security, which also contribute massive anthropogenic non-CO2 (CH4 and N2O) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with expanding cultivation area. However, the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of net GHG balance, i.e., trade-offs between SOC (Soil Organic Carbon) sequestration and non-CO2 GHG emissions, in paddy soils and the drivers of their changes, have not yet been rigorously assessed. Integrating an improved agricultural ecosystem model with a meta-analysis of multiple field studies (a total of 322 site-year data representing 43 locations for U.S. rice paddies and 3402 site-year data representing 1113 locations for global rice paddies), here we found that U.S. rice paddy was a rapidly growing net GHG emission source, increased 138% from 3.73 ± 1.16 Tg CO2eq yr-1 in the 1960s to 8.88 ± 2.65 Tg CO2eq yr-1 in the 2010s. CH4 emission made the most significant contribution (10.12 ± 2.28 Tg CO2eq yr-1) to this increase in net GHG emissions in the 2010s, but increasing N2O emissions, accounting for ~2.4% (0.21 ± 0.03 Tg CO2eq yr-1), cannot be ignored. SOC sequestration could offset about 14.0% (1.45 ± 0.46 Tg CO2eq yr-1) of the climate-warming effects of soil non-CO2 GHG emissions in the 2010s. The intensification of land use/cover area, atmospheric CO2,synthetic N fertilizer usage and the application of manure were the dominant factors that induced net GHG emissions aggravation in rice paddies. Climate change was also critical in aggravating ~21% of soil N2O emission and ~10% of soil CO2 release in the 2010s. However, adopting no/reduced tillage resulted in a substantial decrease of ~10 % in net soil GHG emissions, and non-continuous irrigation exhibited the potential to mitigate around 39% of soil non-CO2 GHG emissions. Overall, the cost of this net GHG emissions for achieving increased U.S. rice yield markedly declined from 1960 to 2018, resulting in 0.84 ± 0.18 kg CO2eq ha-1 of net soil GHGs on average for each kilogram of grain produced in the 2010s. There would be a great potential to reduce emissions intensity in the mid-South U.S., especially the Mississippi Delta region, through optimization of the synthetic N fertilizer and manure ratio, reduction of tillage practices, and implementation of non-continuous irrigation. Our findings underscore the importance of net CO2 GHG mitigation in U.S. rice paddies for achieving net zero-emission and climate-friendly rice production.Unit: CH4 (g C/m2); N2O (g N/m2); CO2 (g C/m2)

Data associated with the, “Unravelling the drivers of greenhouse gas emissions in estuaries” project, funded by ARC Linkage Grant LP150100519.  Contact Naomi Wells (naomi.wells@scu.edu.au) if you have any questions or queries about the data. Project Team: Bradley Eyre, Matt Hipsey, Badin Gibbs, Dirk Erler, Damien Maher, Naomi Wells, Peisheng Huang, Jian-Jhih Chen (Kenji)  Description: 1) Data is from surface water surveys carried out in eight estuaries in SE Queensland, Australia in 03/2016 (wet season) and 10/2016 (dry season). The estuaries are labelled as No (Noosa River Estuary), Ma (Maroochy River Estuary), Mo (Mooloolah River Estuary), Ca (Caboolture River Estuary), Pi (Pine River Estuary), Br (Brisbane River Estuary, including Oxley Creek, Ox), Lo and Al (Logan/Albert Rivers Estuary), and Ne (Nerang River Estuary). 2) Data is from ex-situ incubations of intact sediment cores (0-20 cm) from three SE QLD estuary (Noosa River Estuary, Maroochy River Estuary, and Brisbane River Estuary). Cores were collected every ~three months (Dec 2016, Feb 2017, May 2017 & Aug 2017). Incubations were carried out with site water and conditions, and nutrient (NH4+, NO3-, PO43-) and gas (O2, CH4, N2O) fluxes between sediments and surface waters measured over a 12 h dark-light cycle. Cores were collected from different habitats within each estuary: bare mud upstream (S1), bare sand downstream (S2), bare mud downstream (S3), macroalgae vegetation (V1), seagrass Halophila (V2), or seagrass Zostera (V3).

The model included two C pools representing CH4 and CO2. Four microbial functional groups control the SOC cycle: fungi FDEP are responsible for depolymerisation of PolyC; heterotrophs BAER are responsible for aerobic respiration on MonoC, MonoCN, MonoCS, and PolyCN; methanogens BMGB are responsible for anaerobic respiration on MonoC; and methanotrophs BMOB are responsible for CH4 oxidation. The C cycle was coupled with the N and S cycles to account for the feedback introduced by e- donors and acceptors on the biotic response of each elemental cycle (Figure 1). Specific to the N cycle, we accounted for atmospheric N2 fixation, NH4+ nitrification by ammonia oxidizers BAOB and nitrite oxidizers BNOB, and NO2- and NO3- denitrification mediated by denitrifiers BDEN. For S, we accounted for reduction, disproportionation, and oxidation reactions mediated by sulphur S reducers BSrRB, thiosulfate and sulfite (S2O32-, SO32-) reducers BThSRB, sulfate SO42- reducers BSRB, S2O32- and SO32- disproportioning microbes BSDB, and photolithoautotroph oxidizers BSOB. Each of the organic and inorganic C, N, and S pools can be in the aqueous and gaseous phases, or minerally-associated, that is, protected from biological action. All the biochemical reactions and corresponding parameters are presented in Supplementary Information in Pasut et al., 2021. Table 1 summarizes the pool aggregation used in this work, and each flux from and to each pool.  Contents We distribute the turnover time and carbon fluxes of global freshwater wetlands. The computational domain covers an average wetland surface area of 3.8 Mkm2 (ranging between 1.2 and 11.4 Mkm2 from 2000 to 2017) described by about 45,000 grid cells at a grid resolution of 0.5 degree (about 50 km at the equator). Grid cells covered by wetlands for at least 2% of the total grid cell area were selected from the SWAMPS v3.2 wetlands database (Poulter et al., 2017), which reported the monthly flooded land area from 2000 to 2017 based on active and passive microwave satellite images excluding lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and saline environments. Each selected grid cell is represented by 2 m atmospheric column that includes four atmospheric layers necessary for heat and gas exchanges, and water flooding (30, 30, 40, and 100 cm thick from land surface upward), one layer of the topsoil (0 to 30 cm), two layers of subsoil (30 to 100 cm), and one layer below the root zone (100 cm thick). Each grid cell is characterized by a depth-specific soil bulk density, porosity, and textural soil fractions (Poggio et al., 2021), hydraulic and thermal conductivity, heat capacity, air-entry potential, and pore volume distribution index (Dai et al., 2013). Table 1 summarizes the data released in this version and the corresponding variables.

The climate crisis and loss of biodiversity, two closely related threats to human and planetary health, meet the criteria for the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an international public health emergency, as occurred with COVID-19 (1), and urged by numerous scientific journals (2). Attaining decent work, understood as "opportunities for women and men to work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity" (3), in the context of the climate emergency, creates a paradox for worker health. Outdoor workers (notably those in agriculture and construction), many of them informal workers, are among the populations most vulnerable to climate-related hazards. Simultaneously, they are inevitably at risk of exposure due to their role in maintaining the economy and functioning of society. A similar situation happened during the pandemic with essential workers (4). The WHO declaration of a public health emergency helped manage that global crisis. A consequence of the industrial revolution The current climate crisis is a direct consequence of the Industrial Revolution where key processes emerged to explain the current situation: the appearance of wage labor and the working class, with consumerism as a basic economic driver, and the exploitation of natural resources – especially fossil fuels – in their own territories and in the colonies. The extension of this capitalist model of society to virtually the entire planet is a reality. Now, we see how this economic system has brought both great harm and significant benefits. Since its beginning, capitalism has wrought great suffering for people, masterfully described, among others, by Fredrich Engels in the Manchester of 1845 (5) or the London of 1838 in Charles Dickens` Oliver Twist (6). Although working conditions have since improved in many countries, there are still unbearable examples worldwide of worker exploitation and suffering. Among them, child labor, where 70% are working in agriculture (7) or some underregulated platform work (8), in a context of ever-increasing social inequalities (9). On the other hand, due to improved working and life conditions, there has also been an extraordinary increase in the world population, from one billion at the beginning of the 19th century to approximately eight billion today, leading to a linear increase in life expectancy at birth, which doubled globally between the beginning of the 20th century and the present. In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Planetary Health (10) pointed out that never before has humanity faced such an unintended paradox. While human well-being has been improving, the planet has been degrading. A contradiction that can no longer be sustained. We have lived as if our planet`s resources are unlimited. Based on comparisons to average temperature readings of the planet between 1850 and 1900, the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change estimated in its latest report that temperatures increased by 1.1° C between 2011 and 2020. This increase is very close to the 1.5° C established by the 2015 Paris Agreement as the limit beyond which climate impacts may become irreversible. Beyond any reasonable doubt, this is mostly attributable to the greenhouse effect produced by CO2 emissions, a consequence mainly of human activity and our way of living initiated by the Industrial Revolution. This global increase in temperature, with heat waves, floods and other extreme temperature events as its most obvious manifestations, is already having effects on worker health (12, 13). Climate change is also having effects on the economy and the labor market, both in the primary (agriculture and fishing) and services (tourism) sectors, with reductions in productivity and employment. Estimates from the European Commission reveal an average loss of 3% of GDP among EU countries between 1980 and 2020 (14). Simultaneously, we should not forget that the capitalist society that emerged from the Industrial Revolution is based, among other pillars, on full or near full employment. As such, wages represent the main economic resource for the majority of people, in addition to being the primary source of wealth generation for society, on whose income and taxes the welfare state was built. Of course, employment means much more than wage earning, as it plays a fundamental role in the social processes that sustain human dignity and social cohesion (15). However, only approximately 50% of the employed population, mainly in high-income countries, enjoy decent employment with a living wage and social rights (16). The resulting Gordian knot before us is enormous, with humanity facing the climate emergency and trying to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, while simultaneously seeking to maintain and increase decent employment for all Earth`s inhabitants, boosting the welfare states at the same time (17). Controlling climate-related hazards and just green transition The alternatives proposed to escape this crossroads vary between those that propose a new paradigm, which radically changes the current economic model, betting on measures that break drastically from the capitalist economy (18), versus a gradual process, supported by mitigation, adaptation, and compensation policies (19). Favoring this second alternative, but without ruling out the need to profoundly change human consumption patterns with important repercussions on the productive system (energy, transportation, food, etc.), gradualist policies will also directly or indirectly impact employment and working conditions during the transition from carbon emission energy to green energy. To cope with this urgent situation, specific control measures have been proposed over the last few decades. Schulte and colleagues have systematically reviewed the literature (20, 21, 22), identifying new and exacerbated old climate-related hazards such as extreme temperatures, air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, natural disasters, biological hazards, indoor air quality, etc., and they also assessed the impact of employment transition and economic burden on occupational health equity and mental health. On this basis, the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has elaborated recommendations to mitigate and control the impact of several climate-related hazards on worker health and well-being (23). Similarly, the EU Agency for Safety and Health at Work has published guidelines for heat at work (24). Going further, some governments, such as Spain, have begun regulating and enforcing specific measures (25). Implementation of these workplace preventive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change is the responsibility of employers, with full participation of workers. Devoting resources to hazard recognition; performing risk assessments to identify which workers are most vulnerable to climate change-related hazards; and implementing a control strategy with policies, procedures, equipment, and work organization changes aiming to eliminate or minimize the impact of these hazards can improve employer preparedness (26). Adaptation policies to reduce emissions of CO2 and other gases that are driving the greenhouse effect, still with limited results, could mean a loss of six million jobs worldwide, according to estimates of the International Labor Organization (ILO) (27). This same estimation predicts a promising creation of 24 million jobs, mainly in economies emphasizing recycling and reutilization of manufactured products (the so-called "circular economy"), infrastructure construction, development of renewables and energy efficiency. Also, during this transition, new forms of work will emerge (e.g., human-robot interfaces and artificial intelligence), and with them the need to train workers, both new and existing, to adapt to those new forms of work. While waiting for positive results from mitigation and adaptation policies, a just transition to a green economy must simultaneously incorporate compensation policies. To achieve this, it is essential to strengthen social protection systems, a cornerstone of decent employment. For example, there were measures adopted during the pandemic, such as temporary employment regulation for employees or benefits covering the cessation of activity of the self-employed. Similar compensation measures may help workers affected by mitigation and adaptation policies during a transition phase, possibly to a lesser degree than in the pandemic, but lasting longer. In summary, as was the case in the most recent public health emergency, the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring the climate emergency as an international public health emergency by the WHO could play a critical role in managing this new global health crisis. Research programs, supported by global occupational health surveillance systems, to monitor the effectiveness of mitigation, adaptation and compensation measures are urgent.
