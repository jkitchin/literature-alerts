Carbon dioxide (CO2) generated from the consumption of fossil fuels is one of the main factors contributing to the greenhouse effect. How to mitigate the greenhouse effect and reduce the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels has become an issue worthy of study. In recent years, a technology for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to fossil fuels and chemicals has attracted a great deal of attention by providing a new way to solve this problem. This paper reviews the basic principles of three fundamental catalytic CO2 reduction, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and thermocatalysis, and two advanced catalytic modes, thermocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, derived from these three modes, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the challenges that the catalytic reduction of CO2 is currently facing are also discussed. Although this technology has made significant progress over the decades, it is still in its preliminary stage with some shortcomings and there is a long way to go before it can be applied in reality.

The study of carbon dioxide (CO2) methanation mechanisms widely argues on the nature and formation of intermediates. How reactants dissociate is still poorly understood. To gain deeper knowledge on its mechanism, we focused on studying reactants dissociation. After H2 dissociation and diffusion, the spillover H atom was observed, as well as the confirmation of H cluster formation on metal through aggregation by simulation and experiment. This H cluster facilitated C-O bond scission to easily form H ligand cobonded to metal, and thus resulted in high CO2 methanation performance. Four driving forces could dissociate CO2, three of them came from supports and metals, and another one was atomic H on metal as the strongest force. This simple and convenient method has wide adaptability and can be developed as an effective standard method for studying CO2 dissociation. The facile dissociation study of reactants would be very helpful in understanding the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism.

Long-chain hydrocarbons and oxygenates are used as fuels as well as in many daily applications. The majority of these molecules are derived from fossil fuels, which is a non-renewable commodity. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has been recently found promising in producing C4+ molecules. Herein, we summarize recent works on this topic. The design of C4+ -producing catalysts is compared with those that produce C1-C3 products. Mechanisms for the C–C coupling step are reviewed.

Background and objective: Since people spend 70-80% of their time indoors, the quality of indoor air has become a crucial factor in overall health. Therefore, poor indoor air quality can have significant adverse effects on our well-being. Common indoor air pollutants are particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Plants can remove PM and CO2 through the photosynthesis process and leaf surfaces, and regulate the temperature and humidity of the air. By analyzing the PM and CO2 reduction of four broad-leaved evergreen plants, this study aims to provide data for air purification in indoor spaces.Methods: The four different plant species (Neolitsea sericea (Blume) Koidz., Coffea arabica L., Photinia glabra(Thunb.) Franch. and Sav., and Farfugium japonicum (L.) Kitam.) were selected for this study. Mosquito coils and a CO2 cylinder were the primary sources of PM and CO2. These pollutants were injected into a closed acrylic chamber with plants, and the air quality within the chamber was monitored for a duration of five hours. The plants' effectiveness in reducing carbon dioxide was evaluated through the clean air delivery rate (CADR), while their ability to reduce PM was assessed by analyzing the PM reduction rate. Photosynthetic rates and leaf area were also measured to determine the correlation between air pollution removal and these factors.Results: The ability to remove PM and CO2 varied among plants. Plants with higher rates of photosynthesis were more effective in reducing PM and CO2 than those with lower rates. Among the four plant species, C. arabica and P. glabra were more effective in removing PM and CO2 than the other species. The chamber containing plants exhibited higher humidity and lower temperatures compared to the chamber without plants.Conclusion: These findings suggest that plants can play a significant role in improving indoor air quality. Not only do they effectively reduce levels of PM and CO2, but they also contribute to the regulation of indoor temperature and humidity. The implications of these results highlight the potential of integrating plants into indoor spaces as a natural and multifaceted solution for creating healthier and more comfortable environments.

Renewable and nuclear energy are seen as clean and eco-friendly substitutes for energy derived from fossil fuels. Which of the two is better, though, is still up for debate. In order to meet their combined global energy objectives and perhaps become carbon neutral or even carbon negative in the near future, a shift to additional renewable energy sources and nuclear energy will be necessary. One such method of improving energy usage through the implementation of a renewable energy management system (REMS) that will help attain a continuous and reliable source of energy, allowing for the proactive and effective management of renewable assets and dependable supply. This article investigates attitudes and opinions about nuclear and renewable energy production technologies by analyzing the dependence of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on non-renewable energy sources, renewable energy sources, and nuclear energy in the group of twenty (G20) countries, over the period from 2000 to 2021. This study employs advanced panel data econometric techniques in the presence of outliers in the G20 dataset, utilizing a random coefficient regression (RCR) model via the robust M-estimation approach to study the impacts of non-renewable, renewable, and nuclear energy use with respect to CO2 emission mitigation in G20 countries. The overall conclusions of the econometric analysis confirm renewable and nuclear energy's importance in reducing CO2 emissions. The findings indicate that energy derived from renewable sources reduces CO2 emissions. Total energy consumption, on the other hand, increases CO2 emissions in the long run. Furthermore, the findings pinpoint that nuclear energy greatly cuts CO2 emissions in all G20 countries. According to these findings, it is pivotal for the G20 countries to increase nuclear energy use and employ REMS to reduce the majority of G20 countries' reliance on fossil fuels in order to minimize CO2 emissions.

During the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CO2 adsorption on the catalyst’s surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal‐CO2] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO2 nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]x@TiO2), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs’ charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cux[POM]@TiO2). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO2 core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs’ surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo‐harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of CuII/I and multi‐electron CO2 reduction potentials. Photochemical CO2 reduction with Cux[POM]@TiO2 results in 30 µmol gcat.‐1 CO (79%) and 8 µmol gcat‐1 of CH4 (21%). Quasi‐in‐situ Raman study provides evidence in support of CO2 adsorption on the Cux[POM]@TiO2 surface. 13C and D2O labeling studies validates the {Cu‐[CO2]‐} adduct formation. Despite the photo‐harvesting ability of Nax[POM]@TiO2 itself, the poor CO2 adsorption ability of sodium ions highlights the crucial role of copper ion CO2 photo‐reduction. Characterization of the {M‐[η2‐CO2]‐} species via surface tuning validates the CO2 activation and photochemical reduction pathway proposed earlier.

The imperative reduction of carbon dioxide into valuable fuels stands as a crucial step in the transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Perovskite oxides, with their high compositional and property adjustability, emerge as promising catalysts for this purpose, whether employed independently or as a supporting matrix for other active metals. In this study, an A-site-deficient La0.9FeO3 perovskite underwent surface decoration with Ni, Cu or Ni + Cu via a citric acid-templated wet impregnation method. Following extensive characterization through XRD, N2 physisorption, H2-TPR, SEM-EDX, HAADF STEM-EDX mapping, CO2-TPD and XPS, the prepared powders underwent reduction under diluted H2 to yield metallic nanoparticles (NPs). The prepared catalysts were then evaluated for CO2 reduction in a CO2/H2 = 1/4 mixture. The deposition of Ni or Cu NPs on the perovskite support significantly enhanced the conversion of CO2, achieving a 50% conversion rate at 500 °C, albeit resulting in only CO as the final product. Notably, the catalyst featuring Ni-Cu co-deposition outperformed in the intermediate temperature range, exhibiting high selectivity for CH4 production around 350 °C. For this latter catalyst, a synergistic effect of the metal–support interaction was evidenced by H2-TPR and CO2-TPD experiments as well as a better nanoparticle dispersion. A remarkable stability in a 20 h time-span was also demonstrated for all catalysts, especially the one with Ni-Cu co-deposition.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction will be a key player in net-zero technologies, yet its industrial implementation is limited. Improvements by fine-tuning the microenvironments, electrolyte environments around the catalytic sites, have been scarce due to the interplay between electrode kinetics and transport. Here, we couple atomistic insights with continuum transport via ab-initio multiscale modeling, explicitly including electrolyte effects at all scales. The model was validated on Ag planar electrodes in several liquid electrolytes and the current dependence with voltage aligns with experimental observations. We show that a balance between CO2 diffusion and cation accumulation needs be achieved to obtain optimal rates. In ionomers, this limitation can be overcome since organic cations-based microenvironments are present at a fixed concentration, but water management becomes critical. Our approach paves the way towards rational microenvironment design in electrochemical CO2 conversion.

Plasma technology has emerged as a very helpful tool in a variety of sectors, notably metallurgy. Innovators and scientists are focused on the problem of finding a more ecologically friendly way of extracting titanium and iron metal from natural ilmenite concentrate for industrial applications. A direct current (DC) plasma torch operating at atmospheric pressure is used in this study to describe a decarbonization process for reducing an ilmenite concentrate. The plasma gases employed in this torch are CO2 and CH4. The molar ratio of the gases may be crucial for achieving a satisfactory reduction of the ilmenite concentrate. As a result, two molar ratios for CO2/CH4 have been chosen: 1:1 and 2:1. During torch operation, a thin layer of graphite is formed on the cathode to establish a protective barrier, prolonging the cathode’s life. The material was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The output gases were analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS). In addition, a thermodynamic analysis was performed to predict the development of thermodynamically stable phases. An economic assessment (including capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX)) and a carbon balance were developed with the feasibility of the piloting in mind.

Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are technologies sought to reduce the level of CO2 in the atmosphere. Industrial carbon capture is associated with energetic penalty, thus there is an opportunity to research alternatives. In this work, spectroelectrochemistry was used to analyze the electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) in CO2 saturated monoethanolamine (MEA)-based capture solutions, in a novel CCU process. The in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy experiments show that at the Bi catalyst, the active species involved in the eCO2R is the dissolved CO2 in solution, and not carbamate. In addition, the products of eCO2R were evaluated under flow, using commercial Bi2O3 NP as catalyst. Formate and acetate were detected, with normalized FE for acetate up to 14.5%, a remarkable result, considering the catalyst used. Acetate is formed either in the presence of cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactant or at higher current density (> -100 mA cm-2) and the results enabled the proposition of a pathway for its production. This work sheds light on the complex reaction environment of a capture medium electrolyte and is thus relevant for an improved understanding of the conversion of CO2 into value-added products and to evaluate the feasibility of a combined CCU approach.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2R) is a promising approach for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels using renewable energy sources. We investigated the mechanism of eCO2R for a small Cu8 cluster placed on SnO2 containing O vacancies using density functional theory and predicted current density and selectivity by microkinetics simulations within the computational hydrogen electrode model. Low and high H coverages were modeled by Cu8/SnO2-x and Cu8H6/SnO2-x models, using statistical methods to identify their most stable structures. Different CO2 adsorption modes on Cu8/SnO2-x and Cu8H6/SnO2-x surface models, all containing an O vacancy, resulted in distinct reaction pathways, leading to either HCOOH or CO. The preferred formation of HCOOH occurred upon CO2 adsorption on an O vacancy on the Cu8H6/SnO2-x surface, followed by sequential hydrogenation to HCOO and HCOOH. Adsorption of CO2 on Cu8/SnO2-x opened a facile pathway to CO. Electronic structure analysis revealed that differences in charge donation of Cu to the antibonding orbitals of CO2 can explain the predicted selectivity differences. The preferred adsorption mode of CO2 is bidentate at the Cu-SnO2-x interface. Our findings emphasize the role of H coverage on Cu on the selectivity of eCO2R for Cu/SnOx catalysts.

The ATR-SEIRAS (attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy) activity of electrodeposited Cu nanoparticles on indium tin oxide (ITO)-modified Si internal reflection elements is reported. The solution in the cell is easily, and repeatedly, exchanged between a copper deposition bath and a solution containing 4-methoxypyridine through the use of a flow-through spectroelectrochemical cell. 4-methoxypyridine is a convenient SEIRAS probe molecule exhibiting potential dependent adsorption/desorption on the copper surface. Successive amounts of copper are deposited and then evaluated for electrochemical SEIRAS activity without the need to expose the Cu surface to ambient conditions. It is found that copper deposition charge densities of approximately 60 mC cm-2 exhibit the largest amplitude and most symmetric IR absorption peaks of the investigated electrodeposition conditions. SEM images of the different Cu charge density films are correlated with the SEIRAS results and establish that close-packed two-dimensional, percolated arrays of oblate, ellipsoidal Cu nanoparticles are responsible for ideal SEIRAS performance and three-dimensional aggregates of larger particles should be avoided. Textured films of Cu nanoparticles are used to determine the adsorbed species present on the copper surface during CO2 electroreduction at low overpotentials. Evidence of adsorbed CO and COH is found at lower overpotentials than those described in previous reports.

An integrated CO2 photoreduction to CO by photo-induced electrons coupled with selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to carbonyl compounds by photo-generated holes using metal-free anthraquinone (AQ) as an organo-photocatalyst under visible illumination is described. The maximum conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was 65.4% with a selectivity of 98%, accompanied with the CO yield in gaseous phase 8.67 μmol h-1 g-1. DFT calculations indicate that initial binding of benzyl alcohol with AQ forms an intermediate IM1 that subsequently interacts with CO2 to give CO2 anion with a free energy change of 0.24 eV. Further, the reduction of CO2 to CO coupled with the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and the release of a water molecule. This concerted metal-free photocatalytic system efficiently offers the combined use of electron-hole pairs for integrated organic synthesis coupled with the CO2 conversion in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.

The cement industry accounts for 8% of global energy- and process-related greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve global net-zero emission targets by 2050, the need for commercially ready low-carbon construction materials is becoming increasingly urgent. The fixation of captured carbon dioxide in concrete through CO₂ sequestration is a crucial area of study to reduce concrete embodied carbon. This paper discusses the development of a low-carbon ready-mix concrete (RMC) with aqueous CO2 sequestration, and the synergy between carbon dioxide and other constituent materials. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated through mineralogical composition analysis using TGA, and the mechanical and rheological properties of various concrete mixes were studied. Aqueous CO2 sequestration using carbonated mixing water can stably fix up to 0.84% of CO2 by weight of cement within the cement matrix as CaCO3. The poor workability and incompatibility with GGBS that results from this approach were addressed by the inclusion of RCA as an external source of alkalinity and lubrication. This mix of low-carbon RMC has similar strength and rheological properties to conventional RMC and achieved an embodied carbon reduction of approximately 47%.

Coupling renewable electricity to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) electrochemically into carbon feedstocks offers a promising pathway to produce chemical fuels sustainably. While there has been success in developing materials and theory for CO2 reduction, the widespread deployment of CO2 electrolyzers has been hindered by challenges in the reactor design and operational stability due to CO2 crossover and (bi)carbonate salt precipitation. Herein, we design asymmetrical bipolar membranes assembled into a zero-gap CO2 electrolyzer fed with pure water, solving both challenges. By investigating and optimizing the anion-exchange-layer thickness, cathode differential pressure, and cell temperature, the forward-bias bipolar membrane CO2 electrolyzer achieves a CO faradic efficiency over 80% with a partial current density over 200 mA cm–2 at less than 3.0 V with negligible CO2 crossover. In addition, this electrolyzer achieves 0.61 and 2.1 mV h–1 decay rates at 150 and 300 mA cm–2 for 200 and 100 h, respectively. Postmortem analysis indicates that the deterioration of catalyst/polymer–electrolyte interfaces resulted from catalyst structural change, and ionomer degradation at reductive potential shows the decay mechanism. All these results point to the future research direction and show a promising pathway to deploy CO2 electrolyzers at scale for industrial applications.

The urban residential building footprint is expected to increase four-fold during 2020-2050 in the Indo-Gangetic Plains region of India. The business-as-usual construction technology of RCC frame with solid burnt clay brick as the walling material use large quantities of steel, concrete and solid brick and is highly resource and carbon intensive. The region produces 110-140 billion solid burnt clay bricks per year. Brick production is associated with large energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission, air pollution and degradation of agricultural land. The study presents an innovative new burnt clay product – vertically cored interlocking burnt clay block that is being manufactured by a brick manufacturer in the region. The study presents the results of the life cycle analysis (as per EN 15804) and quantifies reductions in carbon and resource consumption for the product and the building element (wall). The analysis is based on the data collected from the industry. The cradle to gate analysis shows a reduction of 31% in the CO2 emissions (kgCO2/m3 of burnt product) and 58% in soil consumption (m3 of soil/m3 of burnt product) for the vertically cored hollow block. A 150 mm thick wall made of vertically cored hollow block results in 55% reduction in the CO2 emissions (kgCO2/m2 of wall) when compared to a 230 mm thick wall of solid brick. In addition, the cement consumption in mortar reduces by 66% and sand consumption by 62% per m2 of wall area. The study further indicates a significant reduction in concrete and steel consumption by extending the analysis to the building level.

The reduction of carbon dioxide to valuable chemical products is a promising solution to address carbon balance and energy issues. Herein, amorphous nitrided copper-iron oxides are prepared by gas-phase nitriding of CuFe-layered double hydroxide precursors with urea as nitrogen source. Amorphous materials are more likely to generate defect vacancies during the reaction process, and these vacancies can function as active sites for catalytic reactions. Therefore, the obtained materials show high activity for CO2 electroreduction to methane and formic acid, achieving a total Faraday efficiency of 74.7% at −0.7 V vs RHE and exhibiting a continuous 10 h durability in the H-cell. The uniformly distributed Cu+ sites act as active sites by losing electrons to activate CO2. During the CO2 electroreduction, CO2 is converted to *COOH via proton-electron coupling, *COOH combines directly with a proton in solution to produce the HCOOH product, and the other part of *COOH undergoes a protonated dehydration process to form the *CHO intermediate which dehydrates again to form CH4. This study provides a new approach for designing CO2 electroreduction catalysts.

Reducing Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is vital at both global and national levels, given their significant role in exacerbating climate change. CO2 emission, stemming from a variety of industrial and economic activities, are major contributors to the greenhouse effect and global warming, posing substantial obstacles in addressing climate issues. It's imperative to forecast CO2 emission trends and classify countries based on their emission patterns to effectively mitigate worldwide carbon emission. This paper presents an in-depth comparative study on the determinants of CO2 emission in twenty countries with high Human Development Index (HDI), exploring factors related to economy, environment, energy use, and renewable resources over a span of 25 years. The study unfolds in two distinct phases: initially, statistical techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), fixed effects, and random effects models are applied to pinpoint significant determinants of CO2 emission. Following this, the study leverages supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods to further scrutinize and understand the factors influencing CO2 emission. Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX), a supervised ML model, is first used to predict emission trends from historical data, offering practical insights for policy formulation. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), an unsupervised learning approach, is used to group countries by similar emission patterns. The dual-phase approach utilized in this study significantly improves the accuracy of CO2 emission predictions while also providing a deeper insight into global emission trends. By adopting this thorough analytical framework, nations can develop more focused and effective carbon reduction policies, playing a vital role in the global initiative to combat climate change.

Gas adsorption on the surface of nanoporous rocks is an important process that occurs in many applied scenarios such as shale gas production or CO2 enhanced gas recovery or storage. However, a systematic investigation of the impact of gas adsorption on gas flow and permeability is still lacking. In this paper, permeability of four adsorptive gases, i.e., nitrogen, argon, methane, and carbon dioxide, was measured, along with helium permeability, for two nanoporous rock samples that have high and low total organic carbon (TOC) content, respectively. The measurements were conducted at a range of pore pressures from 150-1500 psi. Gas adsorption isotherms were also measured at the same conditions. A mathematical model that considers adsorption with specific boundary conditions for the experimental setup was used for data analysis. The results show that gas adsorption causes larger drop in pressure decay and greater retardation in pressure equilibrium. However, the reduction of permeability relative to helium is similar for gases with different levels of adsorption, indicating the occurrence of single-layer adsorption for these gases. Comparison between the two samples further supports the concept of single-layer adsorption and signifies the impact of pore size on the permeability reduction due to adsorption. These findings deepen the understanding and provide important clarification on the effect of gas adsorption on gas flow and permeability in nanoporous rocks.

As the world's largest emitter of carbon, China is actively addressing climate change responsibly and aims to achieve the most significant reduction in carbon emission intensity globally within approximately 30 years. With the transition to a new low-carbon environment, Chinese enterprises must take a more proactive role in embracing carbon neutrality as a social responsibility. How to supplement the green transformation funds that have not yet been covered by green finance has become an important issue related to Chinese enterprises achieving sustainable development and promoting high-quality development. This study, leveraging hand-collected data on companies' carbon emissions from 2005 to 2022, using the fixed effects model,provides a systematic investigation of the role of trade credit embedded within the supply chain in propelling the green evolution of Chinese companies and diminishing their carbon dioxide emissions. It reveals that trade credit substantially reduces CO2 emissions for Chinese businesses while also amplifying their intention to greener practices, their investment capacity for green transformation, and the caliber of their green outputs. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the acquisition of trade credit exhibits more suppressive influences on carbon emissions for heavy-polluting enterprises, private enterprises, low-supplier concentration enterprises, and mature enterprises. Similarly, the supply of trade credit notably curtails the carbon emissions for non-heavy polluting enterprises, state-owned enterprises, low-medium customer concentration enterprises, and mature enterprises. The empirical findings of this study contribute to reconciling the substantial dilemma between corporate goals for energy conservation, emissions reduction, and production growth, which offers key insights to support businesses in achieving a gentle transition towards energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint in line with the overarching trend of sustainable and low-carbon economic progress.

The attainment of carbon neutrality has become a global consensus as a result of the increasing environmental problems caused by the consumption of fossil fuels. To achieve this objective, there has been widespread attention towards the electrocatalytic reduction reaction of carbon dioxide driven by renewable energy sources due to its mild reaction conditions. In recent years, generating high value-added multicarbon products has been the focus of considerable research efforts. However, the process of generating these products has been restricted by the complexity of the reaction path, the limitations of the scaling relationship, and the poor adaptability to the reaction environment, thereby impeding previous studies from achieving efficient conversion at high current densities. As a result, a more suitable catalyst design strategy is required to obtain high value-added products. This study proposes that the design approach of tandem catalysis will be effective in generating multicarbon products by exploring the mechanism of C–C bond coupling and the configuration of the reaction environment. This research summaries the mechanism and design requirements of tandem catalysis scaled by different intermediates transport distances and review strategies of tandem catalyst configurations, such as nanostructures, phase-mixed, phase-separated, and application of special supports, in facilitating the generation of multicarbon products. The study provides suggestions for the design of CO2 electrocatalytic tandem catalysts and conclude with a discussion of possible future directions.

This study comprehensively evaluates the efficacy of solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations taking into account key metrics such as annual EV charging capacity, monthly fluctuations in energy generation, investment costs, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions achievable. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13, this novel case work employs a comparative modeling approach to evaluate and optimize the performance of copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar panels based on performance ratio (PR), panel sizing and unused energy metrics across six diverse Indian cities. The result data revealed that the 8.1 kWp system for both CIGS and CdTe achieved peak PR while concurrently registering the least energy deficit due to wasted power across all investigated locations. On a monthly basis, CIGS panels produced an average of 1242.6 kWh during the summer months, surpassing the CdTe panels by a 1.50% relative increase in energy output. Annual analysis of energy production revealed that the CIGS modules in Kochi generated 13,163 kWh, surpassing CdTe by 2.7%. This translates to a potential charging capacity of 438 EVs for CIGS, highlighting the critical role of module selection in maximizing fleet electrification efficiency. As for carbon-footprint, about 8150 kg per year of CO2 emissions can be reduced on using CIGS modules. Economic evaluation of EV charging infrastructure revealed that the installation cost per kilometer for CIGS modules stands at ₹ 3.95, which is 3.8% and 7.7% lower per kilometer incurred with CdTe modules and traditional gasoline stations.

The Haber-Bosch process and chemical looping ammonia generation (CLAG) are the two main pathways for ammonia synthesis in urea production. However, the technical and economic potential of these two methods requires further investigation. This paper establishes and evaluates eight urea-electricity-heat-cooling multi-generation systems driven by renewable energies. This includes two ammonia production processes based on the Haber-Bosch process and the CLAG, two hydrogen production processes based on proton exchange membrane electrolysis and solid oxide electrolysis, and three nitrogen separation processes based on solid oxide fuel cell, pressure swing adsorption, and reduction reactor. For each system, energy, exergy, economic, and environmental evaluation models are developed. Considering the fluctuation in renewable energy resources, an annual evaluation of the different systems is conducted based on a monthly time scale. Also, the effects of purifying excess carbon dioxide for storage on the evaluation indicators are analyzed and assessed. The results showed that the average energy and exergy efficiencies for the Haber-Bosch process are in the ranges of 60-80% and 40-50%, respectively. For the CLAG, the respective efficiencies are 50-70% and 30-40%. Additionally, the multi-generation system combining the Haber-Bosch reaction, reduction reactor, and SOFC yielded the highest energy and exergy efficiency among the eight systems, at 68.2% and 45.78%, respectively. On the other hand, the multi-generation system integrating CLAG, SOFC, and biomass gasification has the shortest discounted payback period of 8 years, with annual revenue and net present value of 32.63 and 6.60 MUSD, respectively. While the operating expenditures of the Haber-Bosch process (12.6-16.6 MUSD) are lower than those of the CLAG process (13.9-17.5 MUSD), its capital expenditures (398.9-433.2 MUSD) are significantly higher than those of the CLAG process (315.9-321.4 MUSD). Also, the conducted environmental assessment highlighted that the multi-generation system integrating the CLAG, reduction reactor, and biomass gasification processes exhibited the lowest overall carbon emissions (0.013 t CO2/t urea) among the investigated systems.

Achieving the objective of "peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality" in the new stage of development will require the synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction. In the new stage of development, achieving the goal of "peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality" will necessitate the synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction. This study assesses the degree to which pollution reduction and carbon reduction have a synergistic effect using the coupling coordination model, and uses the fixed effect model, the dynamic panel GMM model, the OLS model and the threshold effect model to examine how green process innovation affects pollutant reduction and carbon reduction synergistically, including direct, heterogeneous, and nonlinear effects. The results show that: firstly, green process innovation has a direct promoting effect on synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction; Secondly, due to the differences in the economic development of different regions in China, the impact of green process innovation on the synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction is heterogeneous in different regions, and presents a gradient distribution of "east > west > middle". Finally, there is a threshold effect in the impact of green process innovation on regional synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction. This paper provides some reference value for promoting green process innovation and enhancing the collaborative impact of mitigating pollution and decreasing carbon emissions.

This study introduces the development of novel, flexible gas sensors operating at room temperature (RT), utilizing a graphene oxide (GO) via the modified Hummers method and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) composite to enhance gas detection in industrial and environmental settings. The composite materials, denoted as GO@BNC, were synthesized with varying GO concentrations ranging from 2 % to 30 %, aiming to investigate their responsiveness to gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), acetone (Ac), and ethanol (Eth). The prepared nanomaterials were characterized using FT-IR, Raman, TGA, SEM, and AFM techniques. The bandgap of Go ranges from 4.19, 3.47, 3.16, 2.79, and 2.48 eV for 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 % GO concentrations, respectively. Notably, the sensor containing wt % of 20 % GO concentration exhibited remarkable sensitivity to Ac, achieving a 270 % increase in resistance at a concentration of 250 μL/L. Conversely, the sensor with a wt % of 30% GO composition showed superior sensitivity to Eth, with a 420% signal enhancement under similar conditions. Further modification of GO@BNC through mild reduction resulted in the formation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@BNC) composites intended to assess the functional groups' impact on sensing performance. Our findings underscore the potential of GO@BNC composites as sustainable and efficient materials for fabricating eco-friendly flexible gas sensors and devices for detecting organic compounds.

The digital economy is a crucial focus for realizing the transformation of old and new kinetic energy in China. It is widely integrated with various fields of the economy and society, constantly providing a new dynamic mechanism with synergetic control of environmental pollution and carbon emissions (SCEPCE). Based on panel data from 292 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2021, this study discusses the spatial effects and mechanisms of the digital economy on the coordinated control of pollutants and carbon emissions. The study found that: (1) The digital economy has direct and indirect influences on the coordinated control of pollutants and carbon emissions. The digital economy can drive reductions in pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions by upgrading industrial structures and transforming energy structures. (2) Green innovation plays an active regulatory role in the digital economy and structural optimization, particularly in the context of SCEPCE. This interference helps mitigate the impact of the digital economy on pollution and carbon emissions. (3) The digital economy has a significant spatial spillover effect on the coordinated control of pollutants and carbon emissions. (4) The influence mechanism of the digital economy on pollution reduction and carbon reduction synergy exhibits geographical heterogeneity, resource endowment heterogeneity. To enhance the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction, it is essential to bolster support and optimise the digital economy at various levels. This includes reinforcing regional balance, considering spatial spillover effects, and enhancing the leading role of developed cities in the region.

The population increase and the demand for water and energy, accompanied by the implications of environment pollution for natural and human resources, indicate the critical necessity for a coherent movement towards nexus between water, energy, and environment. Due to the fact that power generation industry is responsible for a significant proportion of water and fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emissions within the world, in this research, the application of the hybrid renewable system in a thermal power plant has been assessed based on the approach of analyzing the link between energy, water and environment. The design of the solar system and the assessment of carbon balance during the power plant lifetime have been conducted in PVsyst application in 2022. Moreover, ReCipe environmental model has been used for assessing the effect of decrease in carbon emission on the ecosystem. The findings of the research indicate that the replacement of at least 2 % of the nominal capacity of the fossil fuel power plant with the renewable one, prevents the emission of 1431.28 tons of carbon dioxide yearly. This amount equals to 380.34 cubic meters of reserve in fossil fuel consumption and 391.73 tons of crude oil. The results also showed that in addition to preserving natural resources, the hybrid cycle design leads to significant water demand reduction which equals to 3842 cubic meters with the capacity to supply underground water sources. Due to the interests of preserving water and energy resources and decreasing carbon emission in power plant industry, within the framework of nexus approach, management of energy supply by replacing resources and using water and heat recovery technologies and application of energy demand management policies based on energy efficiency and environmental implications is recommended.

With the rapid development of urban economy and the construction of new towns, the problem of solid waste such as a large number of domestic garbage, sludge and agricultural and forestry waste has become increasingly prominent. In this context, it is particularly urgent to design an integrated scheme of source, grid, load and storage including electricity-carbon-gas cycle. In this paper, a collaborative utilization framework of waste-to-energy system, carbon capture equipment and power-to-gas technology is constructed to form an electricity-carbon-gas cycle. Among them, carbon capture equipment captures carbon dioxide produced by waste power generation, which is used for power-to-gas technology to convert into natural gas, and the power consumption of power-to-gas equipment and flue gas treatment is jointly transferred through storage equipment to achieve peak shaving and valley filling of load and fluctuation of renewable energy output. A multi-strategy fusion honey badger algorithm is proposed to be applied to the research on source-network-load-storage integration, which effectively improves the solution efficiency and the stability of the results. The simulation results show that the scheme has significant advantages in economy, carbon emission and energy efficiency, which provides guidance for the utilization of biomass waste resources and electricity-carbon-gas cycle in the region, and promotes the improvement of regional carbon emission reduction and energy efficiency.

Sustainable and green hydrogen (also known as GH2) is a form of hydrogen produced by a renewable energy source or a low-carbon power. The biomass pathway could generate hydrogen for India, which is both practical and effective. The National Green Hydrogen Mission has received government approval to advance the use of GH2 in India. By 2030, the Mission will probably provide the following results: Development of a GH2 production capability of at least 5 MMT (million metric tons) annually, along with an increase of 125 GW in the nation's renewable energy capacity; around Rs. 8 lakh crores have been invested overall, creating more than 6 lakh employment; decrease in fossil fuel imports of more than Rs. 1 trillion cumulatively; and reduction of yearly greenhouse gas emissions by around 50 MMT. India is not a pioneer in using biomass for power generation, while biomass for hydrogen production offers great promise. In today's chemical sector and refineries, hydrogen is a key intermediate. Since it emits no emissions and is made from renewable resources, hydrogen is regarded as a green fuel. Biomasa carbon-neutral feedstock can potentially be one of the promising methods to create this GH2. Because plants absorb the carbon dioxide produced during combustion through photosynthesis, biomass has the potential to be used as a raw material for producing biofuels that are considered to have a balanced carbon footprint, meaning they do not contribute to a net increase in carbon dioxide levels. Thermochemical, biological, and steam reformation of glycerol are three ways biomass can be converted to hydrogen. This chapter deals with the production of GH2 from biomass.

This research paper presents a comprehensive study on energy management and carbon footprint reduction in an educational institutional campus. It focuses on implementing energy-efficient technologies and practices to minimize energy consumption and environmental impact. The study encompasses four cases, each addressing different aspects of energy use in a university setting, including the installation of LED lighting, programmable remote switches, and high-efficiency air conditioning systems. The methodology involves a detailed analysis of energy consumption patterns, using smart energy meters and theoretical calculations. Case I establishes a baseline energy consumption, while subsequent cases implement energy-saving measures. Case II involves replacing traditional tube lights with energy-efficient LED lights, resulting in considerable energy savings. Case III extends these savings further by integrating programmable remote switches mapped with student timetables. Finally, Case IV proposes the replacement of older air conditioning units with 25 SEER models, leading to significant reductions in energy use. The results highlight the effectiveness of these interventions. Case II achieves a 66.67% energy saving, while Case III yields up to 77.78% energy saving in lighting and 33.34% in air conditioning. In Case IV, the adoption of high-efficiency air conditioners can result in a 52% energy saving during teaching weeks. The economic benefits of these measures are substantial, with cost savings per classroom ranging from 7.65% in Case II to 53.46% in Case IV. Moreover, the environmental impact of these energy conservation techniques is substantial. The study reports reductions in carbon emissions from 14.71metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MT CO2e) in base Case I to 6.85 MT CO2e in Case IV. The overall carbon emission reductions for Cases II, III, and IV are 7.61%, 36.37%, and 53.43%, respectively. This study demonstrates the profound impact of integrated energy management strategies in reducing the carbon footprint and energy consumption in educational institutions, offering a model for sustainable and economically viable operations.

Introduction. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is a complex of symptoms resulting from changes to the vulvovaginal region, urethra and bladder due to estrogen and other sex steroid deficiency. Vulvovaginal atrophy is one of its manifestations, and vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, burning and itching are the most common symptoms. Aim. To analyse 20 clinical cases of the use of innovative laser procedures combined with phytoestrogens in patients with vulvovaginal atrophy as a symptom of GSM vs the standard systemic protocol for menopausal hormone therapy. Materials and methods. A clinical case-control study was conducted among 20 postmenopausal women. The age of the subjects ranged from 50 to 65 years with amenorrhea for at least 1 year, a follicle-stimulating hormone level of >30 IU/L and various presentations of GSM. The women were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 10) received laser therapy combined with phytoestrogens, group 2 (n = 10) received systemic menopausal hormonal therapy. To evaluate the results, a survey with a specialized international vulvovaginal symptom questionnaire (VSQ) was carried out to determine the vaginal health index scores before and after treatment. Results. After treatment, both groups showed significant improvement in the form of the reduction or disappearance of symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy. The prescription of phytoestrogens provided an additional positive effect after 3 sessions of carbon dioxide laser treatment. Conclusion. The carbon dioxide laser exposure resulted in the reduction or disappearance of the local symptoms of climacteric syndrome in the form of GSM, and the use of phytoestrogens as part of Mense BAA supplemented the treatment of psychoemotional and neurovegetative changes, which allowed us to make a conclusion about the feasibility, high efficiency and safety of the complex treatment for women, who do not wish to take menopausal hormone therapy and (or) have absolute contraindications. However, further research on the laser technologies and other non-hormonal techniques to treat GSM is required to carry out a more complete and accurate assessment of the effectiveness and safety of these treatments.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is widely used as a primary plastic packaging material in the global socio-economic system. However, research on the metabolic characteristics of the PET industry across different countries, particularly regarding the entire life cycle supply chain of PET, remains insufficient, significantly hindering progress in addressing plastic pollution worldwide. This study employs the Life Cycle Assessment-Material Flow Analysis (LCA-MFA) method to comprehensively analyze the environmental impacts of PET plastics, with a focus on the processes from production to disposal in 12 regions (covering 41 countries) in 2020. By constructing 13 scenarios and analyzing the development trajectory of PET plastics from 2020 to 2030, this study provides scientific evidence and specific strategies for waste reduction and emission reduction measures in the PET industry. Overall, in 2020, the 12 regions (41 countries) consumed 7297.7 kilotons (kt) of virgin PET resin and 1189.4 kt of recycled PET resin; 23% of plastic waste was manufactured into recycled PET materials, 42% went to landfills, and 35% was incinerated. In 2020, the entire PET plastic supply chain emitted approximately 534.6 million tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, with production emissions accounting for 46.1%, manufacturing stage emissions accounting for 44.7%, and waste treatment stage emissions accounting for 9.2%. Research indicates that under a scenario of controlled demand, resource efficiency improvement and emission reduction are the most effective, potentially reducing carbon emissions by up to 40%.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely used in various fields due to their remarkable electrical and mechanical properties. In the construction industry, several studies have been conducted in an attempt to impart conductivity to cement-based composites by incorporating CNTs into the composites. The electrical properties of CNT-incorporated cement-based composites undergo changes due to several factors, allowing one to use these composites as cement-based sensors. Carbonation has been regarded as a significant factor contributing to the deterioration of concrete structures. The reaction between hydrates and dissolved carbon dioxide in concrete leads to the precipitation of calcium carbonate and reduction of pH levels, causing corrosion of reinforcement. Thus, numerous efforts have been dedicated to non-destructively assessing the extent of carbonation of concrete structures. This paper summarizes previous studies on the non-destructive evaluation of the extent of carbonation in concrete. In addition, a preliminary study on the applicability of CNT-incorporated cement-based composites embedded in the concrete structure as sensors for measuring carbonation front will be introduced.

Abstract The electrochemical C‐N coupling process, facilitating the production of organic nitrogen substances (such as urea, methylamine, formamide, and ethylamine) via the simultaneous reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and small nitrogen‐based substances, stands at the forefront of advancing carbon neutrality and the artificial nitrogen cycle. This method has garnered substantial interest due to its potential economic and environmental benefits. Although considerable progress has been achieved in this emerging field, it still faces challenges, including slow reactant adsorption, competing side reactions, and complex multi‐step pathways, resulting in low yields and selectivity. Strategically designing and developing low‐cost and exceptionally performant catalysts is crucial for cost‐effective and precise electrochemical C─N bonding. This article offers an in‐depth review of the electrosynthesis of valuable organic nitrogen compounds at ambient conditions from earth‐abundant resources/wastes, such as CO 2 and small nitrogenous molecules (nitrogen: N 2 , nitrite: NO 2 − , nitrate: NO 3 − , ammonia: NH 3 , etc.), via electrochemical C─N bond formation reactions, especially using carbon‐based catalysts. The relevant electrochemical C─N bond formation mechanisms, the design principles of advanced carbon‐based electrocatalysts, and the impact of different electrolyser designs are discussed, along with the present obstacles and upcoming prospects in this dynamic field.

Due to the cumulative effect of the recycled flue gas in oxy-fuel combustion, the reduction of NO has become the focus of research in which the role of CO2 gasification has a nonnegligible effect. In this article, the heterogeneous gasification mechanisms of CO2 on coal char during oxy-fuel combustion were studied by density functional theory and transition-state theory. The zigzag char model and char(N) model were selected to investigate the CO2 adsorption and gratification reactions at the molecular level. By comparison, the CO2 gasification reaction is preferred to occur on the zigzag char model with a reduction in the energy barrier and an increase in the reaction rate. When considering char nitrogen conversion, the gasification reaction is more prone to releasing NO first, leading to the contraction of the aromatic ring and the generation of CO at high temperatures. Therefore, the study further highlights the promoting role of CO2 gasification on the homogeneous and heterogeneous reduction of NO, which is mainly reflected in the reduction effect of CO. Moreover, it also accelerates the consumption of coal char and NO formation, which is favorable for the reduction reactions to a certain extent.

Bicarbonate electrolyzers (BCEs) offer a promising approach to reducing the energy cost of CO2 reduction by integrating upstream carbon capture and downstream electrochemical utilization. However, the faradaic efficiency of CO2 electrolysis in BCEs has been limited by insufficient activated CO2 on the catalyst surface. We report a hierarchical design strategy combining molecular and system-level innovations to ensure that there is sufficient activated CO2 on the catalyst in BCEs. At the molecular scale, we introduce a single-atom catalyst CoPc@CNT with strong CO2 adsorption to prevent CO2 desorption from the catalyst surface. Systemically, a cathodic electrolyte cross-flow strategy further enhances CO2 mass transfer. This approach achieves a faradaic efficiency exceeding 96.2% for CO at 50–300 mA cm−2, with a 36.0% and 35.3% reduction in overall energy cost compared with conventional BCEs and CO2 gas-fed electrolyzers, respectively. This innovative strategy represents a significant advancement in low-energy-consumption exhaust conversion technologies for carbon neutrality.

Abstract With the continuous increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to human activities and the resulting severe climate issues, there is global concern about energy conservation and emission reduction. However, detailed data on energy consumption and emissions at a fine-grained scale, particularly regarding spatial dimensions and sector-specific emissions, remains insufficient and in need of refinement and timely updates. In Japan, following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, there has been a significant shift from nuclear power generation to reliance on fossil fuels across various sectors, highlighting disparities in emissions data across different regions and industries. Our work extends the emissions time series for Japan’s 47 prefectures, incorporating their socioeconomic characteristics over a broader time frame and with a more detailed sectoral classification. The emissions inventory, covering the period from 1990 to 2020, is based on the consumption of the three main fossil fuels across 32 sectors, with emissions carefully allocated for regional power generation. This dataset, presented in a unified format, is expanded to include longer time scales and more detailed socioeconomic data. It is anticipated to offer crucial insights for establishing regional emission reduction targets and identifying sectoral priorities for decarbonization.

Concerns about high-strength concrete (HSC) have increasingly grown in tandem with the building industry's rapid development. However, the high CO2 emissions, high hydration heat, and high autogenous shrinkage of HSCs considered key issues that limit their wide application. In this study, various proportions of dry ice (solid CO2) were added to concrete to optimize HSC. The test results indicated that adding solid CO2 decreased the hydration heat and autogenous shrinkage and increased the mechanical properties and surface electrical resistivity of HSC. This is primarily attributed to the physical and chemical effects of solid CO2 in HSC curing. At 28 d of curing, the sample containing 3 wt.% solid CO2 exhibited the most significant optimization effect. This is attributed to the fact that, at lower solid CO2 content (3%), the production of carbonation products compensates for the loss of strength caused by the reduction of hydration products. In addition, the addition of solid CO2 caused a decrease in the initial temperature, which delayed the hydration reaction and reduced the autogenous shrinkage. Adding solid CO2 led to an increase in acidity and promoted the formation of AFt, further reducing the autogenous shrinkage. And the more solid CO2 added, the greater the reduction in CO2 emissions for the mixture. Therefore, adding solid CO2 can play a role in optimizing the performance and promoting the sustainability of HSC and can contribute to the objectives of low CO2 emissions, low hydration heat, and low autogenous shrinkage of HSC.

We report a solvothermal method for the synthesis of an oxygen vacancy-enriched ZrO2 photocatalyst with Co single atoms and Ni clusters immobilized on the surface. This catalyst presents superior performance for the reduction of CO2 in H2O vapor, with a CO yield reaching 663.84 μmol g–1 h–1 and a selectivity of 99.52%. The total solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency is up to 0.372‰, which is among the highest reported values. The success, on one hand, depends on the Co single atoms and Ni clusters for both extended spectrum absorption and serving as dual-active centers for CO2 reduction and H2O dissociation, respectively; on the other hand, this is attributed to the enhanced photoelectric and thermal effect induced by concentrated solar irradiation. We demonstrate that an intermediate impurity state is formed by the hybridization of the d-orbital of single-atom Co with the molecular orbital of H2O, enabling visible-light-driven excitation over the catalyst. In addition, Ni clusters play a crucial role in altering the adsorption configuration of CO2, with the localized surface plasmon resonance effect enhancing the activation and dissociation of CO2 induced by visible–near-infrared light. This study provides valuable insights into the synergistic effect of the dual cocatalyst toward both efficient photothermal coupling and surface redox reactions for solar CO2 reduction.

Abstract Acid fracturing in challenging gas wells imposes multiple areas for improvement. The objective is to implement effective acid fracturing treatment with combination of CO2 foam and the use of dissolvable plugs to maximize diversion across the net pay and to improve overall operations efficiency. The scope of the paper shows improved well production and operations efficiency using CO2 foamed acid fracturing and dissolvable frac plugs compared to conventional acid fracturing. The area of improvement for acid fracturing is to ensure effective fluid diversion across target pay. Effective stimulation is through shorter interval with multiple stages using temporary isolation rather than through single stage and longer interval. The choice of dissolvable frac plugs for temporary isolation is to eliminate coiled tubing milling operations. The use of CO2 foamed technique provides good acid retardation for effective diversion and extended reaction with formation. CO2 foamed acid fracturing treatment uses lower stimulation fluid volume compared to conventional treatment. Volume reduction and the energized foam accelerates flowback for effective well cleanup. The combination of CO2 foamed fracturing technique and the use of dissolvable frac plugs were applied in gas Well-A, having high temperature and low reservoir pressure. Well (A) was completed with two stages treatment with temporary isolation using a dissolvable plug to ensure good stimulation across the pay. CO2 foam lowers the formation temperature which reduces acid reactivity on sand face resulting in deeper etched fracture length. Foaming agents are included in the stimulation fluid to maximize CO2 entrainment producing stable foam for effective diversion and energizing the fluid to accelerate well flowback. Reduction of flowback time and enhanced clean-up can be attributed to the CO2 energize assist and significant fluid volume reduction, up to 50% reduction compared to conventional treatment. The use of dissolvable frac plugs coupled with CO2 stimulation, eliminates the need of coiled tubing milling and N2 lifting intervention as a result of reducing the wellbore hydrostatic column. The effectiveness of this technique can be proven from higher production in gas rate compared to other reference wells that were not treated similarly. Overall operations efficiency is improved due to reduced logistics, reduced fluid mixing, enhanced flowback rate and eliminating the need of Coiled Tubing intervention.

Carbon sequestration through CO2 injection into a formation is an effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, a one-dimensional long reactor was constructed to simulate the CO2 injection process under various sediment temperatures, pressures, and flow rates. The formation of CO2 hydrate and the resulting blockages were investigated in detail through a series of indoor experiments. Due to the increasing driving force for CO2 hydrate formation, reducing sediment temperature and increasing sediment pressure can cause hydrate blockage to form near the injection end, leading to an increase in CO2 injection pressure and a reduction in the storage range. Furthermore, CO2 injection rate has a substantial impact on the pattern of hydrate blockage. A lower injection rate facilitates full contact between CO2 gas and pore water, which helps to increase the formation and blockage degree of CO2 hydrates, thereby decreasing the amount of CO2 injection. The experimental investigation presented in this paper examines the laws of CO2 injection and clogging under various sediment conditions and injection processes on a one-dimensional scale, which can provide valuable insights for the design of CO2 sequestration processes.

The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable sources in power generation at local and building-level poses growing issues in balancing generation and demand. To avoid imbalances, it is therefore necessary to ensure adequate levels of flexibility in the building energy system. This can be done both on the generation side, through the coupling of different energy carriers (cogeneration, power-to-heat solutions) and/or the integration of storage systems, and on the demand side, through smart “demand response” programs. This paper considers a tourist facility located in central Germany as a case study to evaluate the energy, economic and environmental benefits that can be obtained from the application of appropriate demand response strategies. The electrical demand data of the facility are monitored at both aggregate and individual load levels and made available by means of a cloud platform. The facility includes two stationary combined heat and power internal combustion engines powered by natural gas and a photovoltaic system. The results show how, thanks to appropriate load management, it is possible, on the one hand, to increase the self-consumption of PV-generated energy and, on the other hand, to keep more constant the load of the engines, which can therefore operate with better efficiencies. This results in both a reduction in energy expenses and a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions attributable to the building.

The environmental impact caused by the intensive exploitation of fossil fuels to generate heat and electricity has already reached a critical level. Also, as the industrial sector is the largest energy consumer, mainly in the form of heat, it has then become compulsive to implement the use of renewable solar heat in industrial processes, such as those found in the food processing and beverages industries, which do not require high temperatures. Consequently, this study examines the viability of supplying heat as hot water at 80 °C and saturated steam at 160 °C to a medium-sized brewery factory through a hybrid solar plant composed of flat plate and parabolic trough collectors and sensible thermal energy storage. The study was conducted numerically using the meteorological conditions of a city different from that where the factory is located because it benefits from higher insolation levels. The mean annual solar fractions achieved were 49.9% for hot water production and 37.3% for steam generation, at a levelized cost of heat of 0.032 USD/kWh, which can be considered competitive if compared against the values reported in other similar solar projects. Also, the decrease in fossil fuel consumption allowed an annual reduction of 252 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction has gained significant attention in the field of sustainable energy, especially the Cu-based catalysts for CO2 conversion to valuable alcohols. In this study, we developed Cu nanoparticles supported on pyridinic N-B doped graphene nanoribbons/amorphous carbon (Cu/BNC-1) as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction, exhibiting substantially improved ethanol (EtOH) conversion rate in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The Cu/BNC-1 achieved a remarkable 58.64% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for producing EtOH at -1.0 V vs. RHE with a current density of 20.4 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. In-situ Raman, FT-IR, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the high C2+ product selectivity of Cu/BNC-1 attributed to the pyridinic N-B modulation, lowering the CO dimerization barrier. Moreover, the synergistic confinement effect of Cu and BNC can stabilize the C-O bond of the ⁎HOCCH intermediate, thereby increasing the yield of EtOH.

Addressing marine oil spills and industrial water pollution necessitates the development of eco-efficient oil-absorbing materials. With increasing concern for the environment, there is a consensus to decrease the use of petroleum-based polymers. Herein, lightweight poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blend foams with varying thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) content were fabricated via a solvent-free, eco-friendly supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) extrusion foaming technology. The incorporation of TPU significantly enhanced the crystallization rate of PLA, with the semi-crystallization time of PT30 and PT50 blends at 105 °C exhibiting a reduction of 77.2 % and 47.9 %, respectively, compared to neat PLA. The resulting foams exhibited an open-cell structure with excellent selective oil adsorption capabilities. Notably, the PT30 foam achieved a remarkable maximum expansion ratio of 36.0, while the PT50 foam attained the highest open-cell content of 96.2 %. The PT50 foam demonstrated an outstanding adsorption capacity, spanning from 4.7 to 18.8 g/g for diverse oils and solvents, with rapid adsorption kinetics, reaching 94.9 % of the equilibrium adsorption capacity for CCl4 within just 1 min. Furthermore, the PT50 foam retained 95.2 % of its adsorption capacity for CCl4 over 10 adsorption-desorption cycles. This study presents a scalable and sustainable approach for large-scale production of high-performance, bio-based foams, facilitating efficient oil-water separation.

Anemia is a condition where there is a lack of healthy red blood cells. Anemia can be caused by various factors, including deficiencies of iron and vitamin C. The aim of this research is to explore the important role of iron and vitamin C in preventing and treating anemia. This research adopts a qualitative approach in its research methodology. The data collection technique used is literature study. After the data is collected, analysis is carried out in three stages, namely data reduction to identify important information, data presentation to organize relevant information, and conclusion drawing to summarize the findings and their implications. The results showed that iron, protein and vitamin C have important roles in the prevention and treatment of anemia. There is a close relationship between these three components in preventing and treating anemia. Iron deficiency is the root cause of anemia, while vitamin C and protein play a role in increasing iron absorption, thus playing an important role in preventing or treating anemia. Iron is an indispensable mineral for the body to form hemoglobin and myoglobin, which are major components in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Vitamin C as an antioxidan has a positive effect on immune function and also helps the body absorb iron more easily. So to reduce the risk of anemia, by fulfilling daily protein and then eating foods rich in vitamin C and combining them with iron sources.

Ammonia is a vital chemical with numerous applications. Currently, the primary methods for generating the necessary reactants for ammonia production involve steam methane reforming (SMR) and cryogenic air separation unit (CASU), while the Haber-Bosch process converts these reactants into ammonia. However, the SMR process releases substantial amounts of CO2, making it imperative to employ an efficient and cost-effective CO2 capture technology to mitigate emissions. This investigation focuses on evaluating the cryogenic CO2 capture (CCC) process for blue ammonia production and provides a thorough economic analysis, estimating both the initial investment costs and operational expenses involved in producing blue ammonia. The results indicated that the CCC process can capture 90% of the CO2 content in the flue gas emitted by the SMR, incurring an energy penalty of 0.724 MJe/kgCO2 while capturing CO2 in the liquid phase with purities exceeding 99.9%. In this case, the estimated CO2 capture costs would be 18.05, 45.1, and 16.65 USD/ton in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. This represents a 40% reduction compared to the CO2 capture costs associated with conventional amine-based technology. The results of this study indicate that the annual electricity costs for ammonia production increase by 38.5% and 64.2% when employing the CCC and amine-based processes, respectively. This investigation employed an isothermal reactor for ammonia synthesis, using the heat from the exothermic reaction in a water ammonia absorption refrigeration cycle (ARC) to condense and purify ammonia. The results show that the ARC system can effectively condense ammonia at −6 °C, producing a liquid ammonia stream with 99.3% purity. This leads to a 95% reduction in power consumption compared to a vapor compression refrigeration cycle (VCRC). Consequently, this method has the potential to decrease the annual operational costs for ammonia production by 2.92%, 2.69%, and 3.13% in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. This study indicated that the hydrogen production unit incurs the highest initial investment costs, as well as operating costs, in the blue ammonia production process, followed by CASU and the Haber-Bosch process.

This study explores green hydrogen production, focusing on life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic feasibility; specifically, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and hydrogen production cost. Existing literature lacks a comprehensive exploration of the impact of solar and wind resource variations, ambient conditions, and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer sizing on the carbon intensity (CI) and hydrogen production cost. This work explores the relationship between the performance of photovoltaic (PV) and wind systems and the CI of renewable electricity in the U.S. Secondly, this study incorporates the hourly variations in solar and wind resources to assess the variation in hydrogen CI and production costs across California. The study examines how reductions in PEM and Renewable Energy Systems (RES) costs, technological advancements, and the inclusion of co-products' carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) credits and revenues impact hydrogen CI and production costs. Wind-based systems consistently demonstrate lower CI (0.35 − 1.9 kg CO2eq/kg H2) except for the central regions (CI can reach up to 4.34 kg CO2eq/kg H2), with geographical variations larger than solar-based systems (1.58 − 2.95 kg CO2eq/kg H2). Similar trends are observed for the hydrogen production cost which varies between 1.5 and 15 USD/kg H2 for wind-based systems and between 3.0 and 5.2 USD/kg H2 for the PV-based systems. This study highlights the importance of optimal sizing of PEM electrolyzer to maximize its utilization for hydrogen production and the use of hourly-based models to assess the CI and production costs of hydrogen. Additionally, the geographical variation in the renewable energy resources and the ambient conditions are important factors that affect the hydrogen cost and the CI of both renewable electricity and green hydrogen.

The cathodic reduction of pressurized CO2 (PrCO2CR) at suitable cathodes can allow to produce various chemicals, such as formic acid/formate and carbon monoxide or synthesis gas, with high faradic efficiencies (FEs) and productivities. Here, we have performed the conversion of CO2 in an undivided pressurized electrochemical reactor using silver cathode in order to determine the optimal values of CO2 pressure and current density. It was found that the plot FE vs. pressure resulted in a curve with a maximum. Similarly, an optimal value of current density can be selected for the PrCO2CR. The competition between the production of carbon monoxide and formic acid/formate is strongly affected by both the pressure and the current density. Eventually the effect of pressure and current density on the economic figures of the process was evaluated.

To achieve a sustainable electricity grid, affordable and dispatchable power capacity that supports grid stability and does not increase atmospheric CO2 levels will be required. Combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) with post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) can meet these requirements by capturing and permanently storing all combustion CO2 emissions and, coupled with negative emissions technologies, any remaining life-cycle emissions. For the first time, we present a comprehensive analysis of the technical and financial challenges of producing zero-carbon electricity from CCGTs on a life-cycle basis. We conclude that when the design is optimised, fossil CO2 capture fractions can be increased from 96% to 100% with minimal process modification, commercially available technology and an additional 0.5% decrease in thermal efficiency. This represents a significant 60–70% reduction in the additional efficiency penalty required to reach zero CO2 emission operation. The Cost of CO2 Avoided of 100% fossil CO2 capture is just 128 £/tCO2, a 3 £/tCO2 increase over the 95% gross CO2 capture fraction required to permit PCC projects in the UK. Indeed, within the bounds of the UK power CCS business model, we show that 100% fossil CO2 capture maximises both variable and capacity payments to the producer, resulting in a 2% decrease in the cost of power produced. For zero-carbon electricity on a life-cycle basis, the recapture and permanent geological storage of all remaining life-cycle CO2e emissions from plant construction & decommissioning, CO2 T&S network operation and the natural gas supply chain (operational CO2e emissions and methane leakage) increases the median Cost of CO2 Avoided to 178 £/tCO2 (130–371 £/tCO2), leading to the novel conclusion that a market mechanism equating to a CO2 price of over 178£/tCO2 is likely sufficient to incentivise the development of truly CO2-neutral CCGTs.

The key aspect of the photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (PEC CO2 RR) lies in designing cathode materials that can generate high-energy photoelectrons, enabling the activation and conversion of CO2 into high-value products. In this study, a coaxially wrapped ZnO@ZnSe array heterostructure was synthesized using a simple anion exchange strategy and metallic Bi nanoparticles (NPs) were subsequently deposited on the surface to construct a Bi/ZnO@ZnSe photocathode with high CO2 conversion capability. This array photocathode possesses a large aspect ratio, which simultaneously satisfies a low charge carrier migration path and a large specific surface area that facilitates mass transfer. Additionally, the barrier formed at the n-n heterojunction interface hinders the transfer of high-energy photoelectrons from ZnSe to lower energy levels, resulting in their rapid capture by Bi while maintaining a relatively long lifetime. These captured electrons act as active sites, efficiently converting CO2 into CO with a Faradaic efficiency above 88.9% at -0.9 V vs. RHE and demonstrating superior stability. This work provides a novel approach for synthesizing high-energy photoelectrode materials with long lifetimes.

This study investigates the influence of green finance, green technology, and eco-innovation on CO2 emissions within ASEAN countries, framed within the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Utilizing data from 2002 to 2019 and adopting the Pool Mean Group (PMG) methodology, our analysis sheds light on the critical dynamics between sustainable financial practices, technological advancement in green technologies, and eco-innovative approaches towards achieving significant CO2 emissions reduction. Our findings reveal that green finance significantly empowers the deployment of green technologies and eco-innovations, leading to a notable decrease in CO2 emissions across the studied nations. The study highlights the importance of country-specific policy interventions that cater to the unique economic and technological contexts of ASEAN countries to optimize the contribution of green finance and technology to climate action. These insights offer a valuable guide for policymakers, financial institutions, and other stakeholders in harnessing green finance and technology for environmental sustainability, in alignment with the SDGs. This research contributes to the discourse on sustainable development, emphasizing the pivotal role of finance and innovation in environmental stewardship and carbon reduction efforts across ASEAN countries.

Electrocatalytic reduction (ECR) of CO2 to chemical products is an important carbon emission reduction method. This work uses DFT to study the stability of N-doped graphene-supported four metal single-atom catalysts (M–N–C) and the effects of the coordination environment and metal centers on the selectivity of CO2 ECR to C1 products. The results show that Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu have good stability. The coordination environment has a significant modulating effect on product selectivity, and the change of the number of ligand nitrogen atoms will affect the size of the potential-limiting step of each product. When the number of nitrogen ligands is the same, the different metal centers of the M–N–C catalyst have a significant effect on the selectivity of different products. In addition, the introduction of nitrogen atom ligands can adjust the electronic structure of the graphene-supported metal center, increase the d-band center of most metals, and improve the reaction activity.

Advancing the Faraday efficiency (FE) and current density of Cu catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) reaction to produce C2+ products is important for its practical applications. Constructing a hydrophobic interface to regulate the local reaction environment is an effective method to improve the selectivity of C2+ products, but it is limited by the low reaction current density. In this work, we fabricated a novel hydrophobic and ECR active copper stearate (CuSA2) decorated CuO nanoparticle catalyst (CuO/CuSA2) for ECR reaction toward C2+ products. As a result, the CuO/CuSA2 catalyst achieved an FE of 61.33 % and a partial current density of 429.33 mA cm−2 for C2+ products. The CuSA2 and CuO nanoparticle cooperate very well for the formation of C2+ products. The in-situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and electrochemical adsorption experiments indicated that the hydrophobic CuSA2 regulated the local ECR reaction environment. The local ∗CO2.- and *CO adsorption were strengthened by hydrophobic CuSA2 modification while the H2O adsorption was inhibited. CuO nanoparticle promotes *CO coupling reaction and enhances C2 intermediates (*OCCOH and *OC2H5) adsorption. Hydrophobic CuSA2 and CuO nanoparticle synergistically promote the generation of C2+ products. This work provides new insights into the design of hydrophobic CO2 reduction electrocatalysts for the preparation of C2+ products.

To mimic the carbon cycle at a kinetically rapid pace, the sustainable conversion of omnipresent CO2 to value-added chemical feedstock and hydrocarbon fuels implies a remarkable prototype for utilizing released CO2. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have been recognized as remarkable catalytic systems for achieving large-scale applicability in energy-driven processes. POPs offer mesoporous characteristics, higher surface area, and superior optoelectronic properties that lead to their relatively advanced activity and selectivity for CO2 conversion. In comparison to the metal organic frameworks, POPs exhibit an enhanced tendency toward membrane formation, which governs their excellent stability with regard to remarkable ultrathinness and tailored pore channels. The structural ascendancy of POPs can be effectively utilized to develop cost-effective catalytic supports for energy conversion processes to leapfrog over conventional noble metal catalysts that have nonlinear techno-economic equilibrium. Herein, we precisely surveyed the functionality of POPs from scratch, classified it, and provided a critical commentary of its current methodological advancements and photo/electrochemical achievements in the CO2 reduction reaction.

Air treatment in environmental air conditioning systems exposes the system to gases, contaminants, and often biological pollutants that cannot be solved by traditional mechanical filtration, motivating decision-makers to diagnose challenges and develop innovative strategies to mitigate the problem. More and more, in environments with high turnover of people (e.g., hospitals, hotels and shopping centers), fresh air ventilations are avoided and replaced by closed windows air purifier solutions to account for undesirable saturation of the atmosphere and the presence of pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, PM1.0, nitrogen, and carbon oxides. The consensus is that polluting gases render the most efficient traditional filters ineffective. The ANSI/ASHRAE 62.1 and EN13779 standards reveal the absence of air treatment technologies that use the wet route in air conditioning systems. This work discusses the liquid air multi-venturi centrifugation technology of hydrodynamic precipitator purifiers in association with the synchronized and continuous monitoring of parameters (PM10, PM2.5, PM1.0, CO 2 ) in the external urban environment and internal environments of a shopping center. It evaluates the performance of the wet route for the physical-chemical and biological treatment of air. Efficiency for retaining particulate matter in a single step without disposable filter reached levels above F9 (85-95% PM2.5), with a reduction of 82.4% for CO 2 . Wet route technology extends the air conditioner’s life, reducing external air flows and energy consumption by up to 13%, making IAQ a manageable and customizable variable. Among the conclusion of the investigation, the authors believe that the migration of industrial pollutant control technologies, such as liquid filtration promoted by gas scrubbers and hydrodynamic precipitators, should be considered as a first choice option due to the high efficiency achieved in the three types of pollutants to be controlled. That is micrometric particulate matter such as anthropogenic PM1.0 capable of reaching the lung alveoli, chemicals such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and biological assets such as viruses and bacteria that showed the vulnerability of HVAC-R systems during the COVID pandemic that rendered windowless corporate buildings unusable.

Summary CO2 storage in saline aquifers may contribute to a 90% share in preventing emissions to the atmosphere. Due to low CO2 viscosity at the subsurface often found in supercritical (sc) conditions, the injected CO2 may spread quickly at the formation top and increase the probability of leakage. This work relates to improved CO2 storage in saline aquifers by effective viscosification of the sc-CO2 at very low concentrations of engineered oligomers and the effectiveness of slug injection of viscosified CO2 (vis-CO2). We present the results from X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to advance the understanding of two-phase CO2-brine flow in porous media and firmly establish the transport mechanisms. X-ray CT imaging of displacement experiments is conducted to quantify the in-situ sc-CO2 saturation spatiotemporally. In neat CO2 injection, gravity override and adverse mobility ratio may result in early breakthrough and low sweep efficiency. We find cumulative brine production from the fraction collector to be lower than X-ray CT imaging at 2 pore volume (PV) injection. The difference between the two is attributed to the solubility of the produced water in the produced CO2 at atmospheric pressure. We show that when the solubility is accounted for, there is a good agreement between direct measurements and in-situ saturation results. There are three reports (two by the same group) that oligomers of 1-decene (O1D) with six repeat units may have marginal CO2 viscosification. The majority of published work by other groups shows that O1D with six repeat units and higher are effective CO2 viscosifiers. In the past, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of an O1D in the displacement of brine by CO2 at a concentration of 1.5 wt%. The effectiveness is examined and identified by three different methods. In this work, we show that the same oligomer is effective at a low concentration of 0.6 wt%. The oligomer slows the breakthrough by 1.6 times and improves the brine production by 34% in the horizontal orientation. X-ray CT imaging results reveal that such a large effect may be from the increase in the interfacial elasticity. We also show that there is no need for continuous injection of the oligomer. A slug of 0.3 PV injection (PVI) of vis-CO2 followed by neat CO2 injection has the same effectiveness as the continuous injection of the vis-CO2. In this work, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of a new engineered molecule at 0.3 wt% that may increase residual trapping by about 35%. The combination of mobility control and residual brine saturation reduction is expected to improve CO2 storage by effective viscosification with low concentrations of oligomers.

n‐propanol is an important pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate. To produce n‐propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C1 and *C2 intermediates to form the *C3 intermediate for n‐propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra‐small Cu2O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu2O and Cu nanodomains. The n‐propanol current density is as high as 101.6 mA cm−2 at the applied potential of −1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO‐*CO coupling and *CO‐*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n‐propanol.

n‐propanol is an important pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate. To produce n‐propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C1 and *C2 intermediates to form the *C3 intermediate for n‐propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra‐small Cu2O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu2O and Cu nanodomains. The n‐propanol current density is as high as 101.6 mA cm−2 at the applied potential of −1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO‐*CO coupling and *CO‐*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n‐propanol.

Herein, we reviewed the main components of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) which are an emerging cheap and environmentally benign alternative for solar energy capture and conversion to electricity. The role of individual parts such as the semiconductor electrode, counter electrode, photosensitizer, electrolyte, and substrate and their contribution to the overall efficiency (η) of DSSCs are discussed. In addition, parameters such as short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and fill factor used to quantify the efficiency of DSSCs are addressed. The highest solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 13 % has been achieved using titanium dioxide as a semiconductor electrode, a triiodide system as a redox couple, and platinum counter electrodes. Semiconductors are made up of materials such as glass, carbon, conductive polymers and other metal oxides have lower efficiencies (< 8 %). In addition, synthetic photosensitizers especially ruthenium complexes have higher efficiencies (10-11 %) compared to natural dyes among which the highest efficiency (4.6 %) was achieved using chlorophyll. The performance of natural dyes based on efficiency of the DSSC is generally in the order: chlorophyll > anthocyanins > carotenoids that is highly attributed to their structure which not only dictates electron release and recombination but also attachment to other components. The DSSC performance is not fixed but rather tunable by variations in the components to achieve desired structural and electronic properties such as firm anchorage between the photosensitizer and the semiconductors, the reduction of the energy band gap by incorporation of other metal salts to extend the absorption range and use of additives that prevent electron recombination with the photosensitizer or any hindrances in the electrolyte redox reactions.

Herein we address the efficiency of the CO2 sorption of ionic liquids (IL) with hydrogen bond donors (e.g., glycols) added as viscosity modifiers and the impact of encapsulating them to limit sorbent evaporation under conditions for the direct air capture of CO2. Ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, and diethylene glycol were added to three different ILs: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium 2-cyanopyrrolide ([EMIM][2-CNpyr]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF4]), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]). Incorporation of the glycols decreased viscosity by an average of 51% compared to bulk IL. After encapsulation of the liquid mixtures using a soft template approach, thermogravimetric analysis revealed average reductions in volatility of 36 and 40% compared to the unencapsulated liquid mixtures, based on 1 h isothermal experiments at 25 and 55 °C, respectively. The encapsulated mixtures of [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/1,3-propanediol and [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/diethylene glycol exhibited the lowest volatility (0.0019 and 0.0002 mmol/h at 25 °C, respectively) and were further evaluated as CO2 absorption/desorption materials. Based on the capacity determined from breakthrough measurements, [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/1,3-propanediol had a lower transport limited absorption rate for CO2 sorption compared to [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/diethylene glycol with 0.08 and 0.03 mol CO2/kg sorbent, respectively; however, [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/diethylene glycol capsules exhibited higher absorptions capacity at ∼500 ppm of CO2 (0.66 compared to 0.47 mol of CO2/kg sorbent for [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/1,3-propanediol). These results show that glycols can be used to not only reduce IL viscosity while increasing physisorption sites for CO2 sorption, but also that encapsulation can be utilized to mitigate evaporation of volatile viscosity modifiers.

The hydrogenation of CO2 holds promise for transforming the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. However, the challenge lies in developing robust and selective catalysts for this process. Transition metal oxide catalysts, particularly cobalt oxide, have shown potential for CO2 hydrogenation, with performance heavily reliant on crystal phase and morphology. Achieving precise control over these catalyst attributes through colloidal nanoparticle synthesis could pave the way for catalyst and process advancement. Yet, navigating the complexities of colloidal nanoparticle syntheses, governed by numerous input variables, poses a significant challenge in systematically controlling resultant catalyst features. We present a multivariate Bayesian optimization, coupled with a data-driven classifier, to map the synthetic design space for colloidal CoO nanoparticles and simultaneously optimize them for multiple catalytically relevant features within a target crystalline phase. The optimized experimental conditions yielded small, phase-pure rock salt CoO nanoparticles of uniform size and shape. These optimized nanoparticles were then supported on SiO2 and assessed for thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation against larger, polydisperse CoO nanoparticles on SiO2 and a conventionally prepared catalyst. The optimized CoO/SiO2 catalyst consistently exhibited higher activity and CH4 selectivity (ca. 98%) across various pretreatment reduction temperatures as compared to the other catalysts. This remarkable performance was attributed to particle stability and consistent H* surface coverage, even after undergoing the highest temperature reduction, achieving a more stable catalytic species that resists sintering and carbon occlusion.

The nanointerfaces of ZnO-Cu and the size of active nanoparticles (NPs) play crucial roles in the development process of CO2 hydrogenation. Herein, Zn-PBC80 with an unsaturated coordination Zn2+ center was constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3,5-bis(4′-carboxyl-phenyl) pyridine (H2PBC), serving as an anchoring site for supporting Cu2+ and a platform for encapsulating NPs. The different loading concentrations of Cu2+ and pyrolysis of the MOFs-based precursor vary the chemical environments of the catalysts, resulting in different distributed states and average sizes of active sites. Specifically, the pyrolysis of Zn-PBC80-Cu-1 with a concentration ratio of 1:1 facilitates the construction of an interfacial ZnO-Cu nanocomposite and smaller NP size. Among a series of CO2 catalysts, the resultant ZnO-Cu-1-700 exhibits the best catalytic performance with a satisfying CO2 conversion rate (16.5%), outstanding CO selectivity (100%), and promoting catalytic stability over 30 h. The best catalytic performance could be attributed to the more stable electronic structure of metallic Cu NPs and the generation of oxygen vacancies resulting from the unique ZnO-Cu nanointerfaces among the catalysts. This discrepancy in catalytic performance indicates that the active nanointerfaces affects the electronic structure of active centers, providing valuable insight into the design of efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction.

This paper investigates the potential benefits of integrating rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) with buildings to reduce energy and CO2 costs, contributing to urban decarbonization efforts. This integration not only advances sustainable urban agriculture but also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) - Affordable and Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) - Sustainable Cities and Communities, through its energy-efficient, low-carbon approach. We hypothesize that this integration can significantly lower energy use in integrated RTGs (i-RTGs) and set out to validate this through dynamic models for both building and i-RTG climates, focusing on CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature. Central to our approach is the implementation of a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework, which utilizes these dynamic models to make control decisions aimed at minimizing total control costs. This framework operates in a receding horizon procedure, regulating climate factors within the i-RTG and building using various actuators. We validate our approach by simulating an i-RTG atop a building in eleven different cities, demonstrating interactions such as energy, moisture, and CO2 exchange. Significantly, our study reveals that integrating i-RTG with buildings under the NMPC framework leads to a 15.2% reduction in control costs. Additionally, we find that the i-RTG model is adaptable to different climates, with colder regions showing greater cost reduction potential. Our study underscores the viability and advantages of integrating i-RTGs with buildings, offering a sustainable, decarbonizing solution for urban agriculture and building management that contributes to the fulfillment of SDG7 and SDG11.

This study examines the intricate interplay of political stability, natural resource rent, industrialization, globalization, economic growth, and carbon emissions in nine Arab resource-abundant countries (ANRAC) from 1996 to 2019. Applying advanced statistical approaches, such as the Method of Moment Quantiles Regression (MMQREG) as a baseline estimation approach, along with the inclusion of PCSE, FGLS, and FMOLS, to enhance, to enhance the reliability and stability of the obtained results. The study results suggest that globalization, coupled with the interplay between political stability and economic growth, fosters advancements in environmental conditions and the pursuit of sustainable practices. In contrast, political stability, abundant natural resources, sustained economic expansion, and widespread industrialization are associated with increased CO2 emissions, posing detrimental effects on the environment. Notably, there seems to be a correlation between the concurrent improvement of political stability and economic growth and a reduction in CO2 emissions.

Nowadays, we have observed the dynamic development of bio-heating plants that use wood biomass for heating or energy purposes. The result of this process is a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions as well as in the production of biomass ash (BA). Despite the waste nature of BA, it should be carefully analyzed and assessed for various applications, including environmental ones. Due to the features attributed to BA, including its alkaline reaction, the high capacity of its sorption complex, relatively low salinity, and significant content of macro- and microelements, a hypothesis was put forward in this work undertaken about the positive role of BA as an immobilizing factor for Cd-, Pb-, and Zn-contaminated soils. This research was based on a pot experiment in which four series were considered: (1) BA; (2) BA + Cd; (3) BA + Pb; and (4) BA + Zn. BA was used at doses of 30, 60, and 90 mg pot−1, and metals at doses of 2 mg Cd, 100 mg Pb, and 300 mg Zn kg−1 of soil. The test plant was corn grown for green mass. The study took into account the influence of BA on the content of the total forms of heavy metals (Metot) and their available forms (Meav). In the soil without the addition of metals, a significant increase in the content of Cdtot and Cdav, and a decrease in the content of Zntot were observed due to the application of BA. The addition of metals against the background of the BA used resulted in a significant increase in Cdtot, Pbtot, and Zntot, as well as an increase in the available forms of Pbav but a decrease in Znav. However, there was no significant increase in the Cdav content. The obtained results may indicate the potentially immobilizing role of BA only in the case of zinc. They may constitute the basis for further, more detailed research aimed at determining the role of BA in the immobilization of various metals in soil.

Abstract This study assesses China's CCUS deployment, pivotal for the nation's carbon neutrality by 2060 and transition to sustainable energy. It explores the social, economic, and industrial impacts, including job creation, product exports, and global CCUS market influence. The paper outlines critical goals for successful CCUS implementation, impacting China's future industrial competitiveness. We employed machine learning to analyze CO2 emissions data from China's power, iron and steel, cement, and oil and gas industries, supplemented by expert consultations. Our findings reveal significant emission characteristics: thermal power dominates the power industry's emissions, contributing over 50% to China's industrial total. The iron and steel sector accounts for over 60% of global emissions in its field, comprising 15-18% of China's emissions. Cement production, with a CO2 emission factor of 0.86, results in approximately 620 kg of CO2 per ton. The oil and gas sector, particularly petrochemicals, represents 9% of national emissions. These insights shape our analysis of the CCUS development pathway in these key sectors. Our analysis of carbon emissions and CCUS development in key Chinese industries, informed by expert consultation, leads to these conclusions: China's CCUS evolution follows three stages. The research, development, and demonstration phase (2020-2025) anticipates CCUS projects scaling to 15 Mt CO2/year. The industrial rollout phase (2025-2035) projects expansion to 50 Mt CO2/year. Full deployment (2035-2050) will see project sizes reaching 1500 Mt CO2/year, with significant milestones of 500 Mt in 2040 and 1500 Mt by 2050. Under an aggressive model, CCUS plays a crucial role in direct emission reductions, targeting 2.5 billion tonnes CO2 by 2050. Regional CCUS strategies align with each province's carbon peak goals, sequestration resources, and industrial structures. Aligned with China's 14th Five-Year Plan, our study underscores the strategic importance of CCUS technology, analyzing its potential and affordability in major sectors like electricity, iron and steel, cement, and oil and gas. We propose a CCUS deployment roadmap for China, detailing strategies for large-scale emission source retrofitting and industry-level source-sink matching. This forms the foundation for the Ministry of Science and Technology's planning of regional CCUS clusters.

In 2021, Mexico produced approximately 24.2 million tons of white corn, generating 3.6 million tons of corn cob residue. The final disposal of corn cob poses an environmental challenge in certain regions. This study examines the technical–economic feasibility and the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of integrating a small-scale cogenerating gasifier fueled by corn cob into a nixtamalized corn flour manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). This integration enables the generation of heat and electricity from the produced synthesis gas. Moreover, the process yields residual carbon, which can be used as biochar for soil restoration and removing atmospheric CO2. This option holds significance for the corn flour agroindustry in Mexico, as, in 2021, it consumed approximately 601.9 GWh of electrical energy and 938,279 GJ of thermal energy from LP Gas in its manufacturing processes to produce 2.6 million tons of nixtamalized white corn flour. These processes contributed to a total emission of 410,232 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The findings of this study demonstrate a cumulative reduction of 51.7% in CO2 emissions, resulting in economic benefits of USD 85,401 in 2017 for a case study SME that annually produces 1039 tons of corn flour. This study reveals the integration of a gasifier–cogenerator system fueled by corn cob as an economically viable low-carbon technology in the corn flour manufacturing industry.

Nowadays, self-checkouts are becoming increasingly popular in stores and markets. This is simply because they offer customers the convenience of shopping without having to wait in line and provide store owners with an opportunity to increase sales and improve the customer experience. Meanwhile, the sustainability options of the devices have gained more traction, such as reducing the CO2 emissions of the product and production. However, it is initially unknown how to investigate the sustainability of self-service devices due to insufficient research in this area. To address this issue, the different methodologies have been analyzed based on domain-oriented boundaries. The life cycle assessment (LCA) is chosen to assess the sustainability. Then, the inventory analysis is worked out to gather the relevant raw data. Subsequently, the model of the product's life cycle is established in an LCA software tool. The assessment and interpretation is carried out. A case study of self-checkout is conducted in the industrial company and the results shows that recycled material zincor and using solar energy could lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 41.8%.

New Zealand has committed to a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) from 2005 levels by 2030. Dietary changes within New Zealand could simultaneously improve population health and contribute towards the nation’s emissions reduction target, as agricultural emissions are estimated to account for half of New Zealand’s GHGEs (1) . This research aimed to quantify the GHGEs associated with household purchases of major food groups in New Zealand and identify the sociodemographic characteristics that are associated with per capita household dietary emissions. Household dietary emissions were estimated using the NielsenIQ Homescan (R) consumer panel — a large sample of households within New Zealand who report purchasing data of take-home food and beverages. The sample is nationally representative in terms of broad geographical regions and selected key demographic characteristics. Carbon emission estimates were assigned to 1,908,485 total food and beverage purchases from 1,775 households over one year (2019) using a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) dataset initially constructed in the United Kingdom (UK) and adapted for New Zealand (2) . This LCA dataset contains estimates of greenhouse gas emissions generated over the life cycle of the production of food products from the following stages: farming and processing, transit packaging, consumer packaging, transport, warehouse and distribution, refrigeration, and overheads. Greenhouse gas emissions are expressed in kg of carbon dioxide equivalents per kg of food product over a 100-year time horizon. Total emissions from purchases of major food groups were then estimated. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationships between household variables and per capita dietary emissions. Overall purchases of red and processed meat (35%) and dairy products (19%) were responsible for the greatest proportion of emissions. The age group of the primary household shopper as well as household size were predictors of per capita dietary emissions — households with primary shoppers > 65 years had, on average, 33% (95% CI: 20% to 49%) higher per capita dietary emissions, compared to households with primary shoppers 34 years; and every additional household member was associated with, on average, 11% (95% CI: 9% to 13%) lower per capita dietary emissions. We have shown in this large representative sample of New Zealand households that purchases of just two food groups — red and processed meat, and dairy — were responsible for approximately half of dietary greenhouse gas emissions. Larger households had lower per capita dietary greenhouse gas emissions, and older shoppers had relatively higher greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst similar associations have been reported elsewhere more research is needed to confirm these latter findings. With enhanced understanding of the observed association between age of a household’s primary shopper and per capita dietary emissions, interventions may be devised that encourage shoppers to purchase lower-emitting foods, particularly less meat and dairy.

Iron ore reduction using hydrogen instead of coal is a promising technology for minimizing CO2 emissions in the metallurgical industry. In this study, the hydrogen reduction mechanism and kinetics of boron-bearing iron concentrate were investigated in a fluidized bed at 650 ∼ 850 °C, and the reduction data were quantified with an online gas composition analysis technique. The kinetics parameters were calculated using the model-free method and conventional kinetics model, and the mineral phase composition and micromorphology characteristics of reduced products were analyzed. The results showed that the reduction process of boron-bearing iron concentrate in a fluidized bed can be divided into two periods, with the earlier period was controlled by the spherical shrinking model and the later period was controlled by the three-dimensional diffusion model, and the apparent activation energy was significantly increased from 65.22 kJ/mol to 96.11 kJ/mol. Firstly, the magnetite was rapidly reduced to wüstite and dense metallic iron. With an increase in the thickness of the metallic iron layer, the diffusion of oxygen through the dense iron became the rate-limiting step of the reaction, and the defects within the iron layer played a pivotal role in the following mass transfer process. However, the reduction of ludwigite did not suffer from this restriction since the dense product layer was absent.

A company located in South Sulawesi, intends to mitigate emissions from the Power Plant by constructing an environmentally friendly alternative, namely the Floating Solar Power Plant (FSPP), in Towuti. The development plan involves a feasibility analysis for each configuration of the FSPP, considering technological, economic, and environmental criteria. The selection of the preferred configuration is determined using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, based on input from experts. According to this method, the chosen configuration is the on-grid non-battery Floating Solar Power Plant, with a Net Present Value of Rp. 1,431,159,245,752, an Internal Rate of Return of 9.46%, a Payback Period of 8.916 years, a Profitability Ind ex of 1.299, a system efficiency of 21.56%, a carbon footprint of 35,003 kg CO2, and an emission reduction of 9,136,808,273 kg CO2. Decision analysis, involving open and abandonment scenarios based on fluctuations in industrial electricity prices, was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation, yielding a volatility value of 31.2%. The real options analysis recommends abandonment in the twentieth year, with a decision success potential of 38%, based on the results.

This paper studies the intra-day impacts of wind power on wholesale electricity prices and conventional generation in the UK. Exploiting the variations by hour across years from 2008 to 2019, we differentiate the long-run impact of wind power that is largely due to capacity increases and the short-run impact that is primarily driven by weather conditions. The result shows that the expansion of wind energy significantly decreases the electricity price in most hours except the early morning ramp-up and late evening ramp-down hours. We also estimate the substitutional effect of wind energy on conventional generation technologies. Wind generation is found to displace coal and CCGT generation during peak hours. Consequently, this leads to significant reductions in CO2 emissions. The increased wind generation contributed to 24.5MtCO2 reduction per year over the sample period.

Restrictions on high-GWP refrigerants have made the use of transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems widespread. Using transcritical booster refrigeration cycle in warm climates is unsatisfactory due to its high energy consumption. This paper presents theoretical analysis and performance comparison of three different transcritical CO2 supermarket refrigeration cycle configurations with ejector expansion in Türkiye, which has different climatic regions. Bin-hour data were derived using hourly dry-bulb temperature values for provinces from 7 different regions in Türkiye. The applicability of multi-ejectors to each modeled cycle was also investigated. Annual energy consumption and environmental impact reductions of up to 17% were obtained using ejector expansion cycle compared to booster cycle. Ejector expansion cycles achieved higher performance than booster cycle up to 46% in terms of exergy efficiency at investigated ambient temperatures. Unit product exergy costs of the ejector cycles were found up to 28% lower than booster cycle.

The anaerobic-multistage anoxic/aerobic (A-MAO) process has shown good potential for advanced nitrogen removal in recent years, but its greenhouse gas emissions still need to be fully explored. The effects of the influent distribution and external carbon source sodium acetate on nutrient removal, greenhouse gas emissions, and the microbial community structure in a continuous plug-flow A-MAO reactor fed with real low C/N ratio domestic sewage were investigated. The results showed that altering the allocation of carbon source resulted in average chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) concentration in effluent reduced to 26.10 ± 4.86 and 6.65 ± 1.73 mg/L, respectively. Both operations reduced the emission rate of greenhouse gas. While the addition of external car-bon sources leaded to lower N2O emission rates and higher CO2 and CH4 emission rates. The addition of sodium acetate facilitated nitrification and denitrification processes, thereby leading to a reduction in N2O production. Meanwhile, it spurred the growth of methanogenic bacteria and heterotrophic microorganisms, thus boosting the production of CO2 and CH4. Influent distribution promoted the increase of Bacteroidota, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteriota of the reactor. The enrichment of typical hydrolytic bacteria and glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) increased the utilization efficiency of carbon sources in the system after the addition of sodium acetate. The significant increase of typical denitrifying bacteria (DNBs) Azospira reduced the N2O emission during heterotrophic denitrification process, which was considered to be an important functional genus for increasing nitrogen loss in this system. The rational utilization of carbon source makes the difference in metabolism function. The study provides a valuable strategy for comprehensively evaluating the pollutant removal and greenhouse gas emission reduction from the A-MAO process.

Oxygen vacancies (OV) in nonmetallic plasmonic photocatalysts can decrease the energy barrier for CO2 reduction, boosting C1 intermediate production for potential C2 formation. However, their susceptibility to oxidation weakens C1 intermediate adsorption. Herein we proposed a "photoelectron injection" strategy to safeguard OV in W18O49 by creating a W18O49/ZIS (W/Z) plasmonic photocatalyst. Moreover, photoelectrons contribute to the local multi‐electron environment of W18O49, enhancing the intrinsic excitation of its hot electrons with extended lifetimes, as confirmed by in‐situ XPS and femtosecond transient absorption analysis. Density functional theory calculations revealed that W/Z with Ov enhances CO2 adsorption, activating *CO production, while reducing the energy barrier for *COH production (0.054 eV) and subsequent *CO‐COH coupling (0.574 eV). Successive hydrogenation revealed that the free energy for *CH2CH2 hydrogenation (0.108 eV) was lower than that for *CH2CH2 desorption for C2H4 production (0.277 eV), favouring C2H6 production. Consequently, W/Z achieves an efficient C2H6 activity of 653.6 μmol g‐1 h‐1 under visible light, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6%. This work offers a new strategy for the rational design of plasmonic photocatalysts with high selectivity for C2+ products.

In light of global challenges such as the war in Ukraine and the depletion of fossil fuel resources, it is essential to explore sustainable energy solutions. Hybrid energy systems represent a potential solution, offering energy independence to urban housing estates and reducing CO2 emissions. This article aims to explore the feasibility of integrating photovoltaic systems (utilizing vacuum collectors) and combined utilities (system heat and electricity) in a hybrid setup, leveraging existing technical infrastructure with necessary modifications. A key aspect is to perform calculations on the amount of heat and electricity generated from these systems. The study analyzes the demand for heat and electricity among consumers compared to the estimated production from renewable sources. Calculations also include the potential energy savings and CO2 emission reductions achievable through the proposed solutions. The findings indicate that hybrid photovoltaic systems with heat storage could effectively address energy issues in urban housing estates, given adequate support and community involvement. The innovative methodology employed in this study encompasses both analytical and experimental research approaches. The analysis employs advanced statistical techniques and data integration to enhance understanding of the phenomena studied, while the experimental research provides robust results through controlled variable manipulation and precise measurement tools, thereby verifying the study’s objectives.

Primary aluminium industry is one of the largest industries associated with high greenhouse gas emissions. It is reported that in 2022, the aluminium production emitted nearly 270 Mt of direct CO2 in the atmosphere. To achieve the European goals of zero emissions by 2050, a reduction of 4% annually is essential. Τhe industry needs to take a turn towards less impactful production practices, focusing on the valorisation of residues for promoting sustainability. Bauxite residue from alumina production represents a remarkable source of Rare Earth Elements (REEs). This study offers valuable insights into the environmental and economic aspects of processes related to resource Scandium (Sc) extraction and processing in Greece, Romania and Turkey. In this frame, a comparative analysis of the environmental impact of the extraction process of REEs from Bauxite Residues (BR) in the regions mentioned above is presented. The results show that an up to 23% greenhouse gas emissions reduction can be achieved, while the environmental categories of human health risks, aquatic toxicity potential, and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential are improved by applying hydrothermal processes and direct leaching to BR. While the stages of Sc extraction remain consistent, variations in the chemical compositions of BR underscore the influence of local factors. The findings also emphasize the importance of tailoring extraction processes to local conditions and compositions for scandium extraction. These insights can guide industry decisions and contribute to responsible resource management in the future.

Target conditioning is a crucial ingredient of high-power extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source operation in state-of-the-art nanolithography. It involves deforming tin microdroplets into tens of nanometer-thin sheets, sheets which are subsequently irradiated by intense CO2 laser radiation to form a hot, EUV-emitting plasma. Recent experiments have found that a substantial fraction of the initial droplet mass is lost in the deformation phase through fragmentation. The goal of the present study is to investigate, using radiation-hydrodynamic modeling, how variations in the sheet mass affect EUV source power and the laser-to-in-band conversion efficiency (CE). It is found that high-mass sheets can “feed” the plasma with sufficient mass to sustain the production of in-band-emitting charge states over the course of laser irradiation. Low-mass sheets, on the contrary, cannot supply enough mass to sustain this production over the pulse, thus leading to a reduction in in-band power and CE. The dependence of CE on laser energy and target thickness is quantified, and a rather weak reduction of CE with increasing laser energy for high-mass sheets is identified.

Abstract There is a vast building stock of existing buildings and the exchange rate is low (up to 0.2% per year). Therefore, there is a very strong need to deal with the existing building stock in respect to circularity. The effect of (new) regulations and standards on this volume for refurbishment and recycling of building materials is therefore crucial to meet the targets of CO2 reduction by increasing aspects of circularity overall to support environmental sustainability. The influence of standards towards the harmonization of technical requirements for refurbishment of existing buildings is therefore essential for wider implementation and acceptance in the market. There is, however, a gap identified between existing relevant standardization efforts and research in the field of refurbishment in the context of circularity. The effect of newly released standards and regulation will be analysed and identified barriers are discussed such as the generation and dissemination process of these standards.

Abstract Drilling operations generate CO2 emissions from diesel fuel used to power generators and other equipment on drilling rigs as extraction activities create around 10-15% of total energy-related emissions globally, an equivalent of 5 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Improving operational efficiency is crucial for reducing overall emissions and combating climate change. Therefore, recognizing more efficient approaches and solutions with reduced carbon footprints is essential in creating future business continuity. This paper presents the application of machine learning optimization techniques in carbon emission management through technical limit performance benchmark. A Machine Learning (ML) model utilizing basic drilling parameters such as weight on bit (WOB), rotary speed (RPM), penetration rate (ROP), and torque (TOR) was used to estimate instantaneous Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) within the technical limit of operational performance across the different Lithologies. Supervised learning algorithm with 70:30 data splits using four ML algorithms, including Random Forest, support vector regression, artificial neural network (ANN), and Categories boost, was utilized in the prediction. The estimation was then leveraged to determine the maximum achievable penetration rate baseline for various lithologies based on rock drillability. Enabling a comparative assessment between actual drilling performance against an engineered technical limit drill rate performance as well as the expected greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). A case study using a field dataset showed that the models predicted instantaneous UCS based on the low- cost drilling parameters other than using the high-cost well-log and core sample techniques. Prediction accuracy was within the acceptable margin of error with CatBoost and ANN as best predictors, with correlation coefficient (R2 ) values of 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. The defined baseline performance benchmark improved drilling performance by 30-60% with a reduction in CO2 emissions across the project by 20 tCO2e emissions, equivalent to a 50% reduction in carbon emissions. The result of this research is essential for the continuous improvement in drilling carbon emission, performance monitoring, and improvement of overall drilling performance.

Abstract. The newly developed offline land ecosystem model Terrestrial Ecosystem Model in R (TEMIR) version 1.0 is described here. This version of the model simulates plant ecophysiological (e.g., photosynthetic and stomatal) responses to varying meteorological conditions and concentrations of CO2 and ground-level ozone (O3) based on prescribed meteorological and atmospheric chemical inputs from various sources. Driven by the same meteorological data used in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, this allows asynchronously coupled experiments with GEOS-Chem simulations with unique coherency for investigating biosphere–atmosphere chemical interactions. TEMIR agrees well with FLUXNET site-level gross primary productivity (GPP) in terms of both the diurnal and monthly cycles (correlation coefficients R2>0.85 and R2>0.8, respectively) for most plant functional types (PFTs). Grass and shrub PFTs have larger biases due to generic model representations. The model performs best when driven by local site-level meteorology rather than reanalyzed gridded meteorology. Simulation using gridded meteorology agrees well for annual GPP in seasonality and spatial distribution with a global average of 134 Pg C yr−1. Application of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory to infer canopy conditions from gridded meteorology does not improve model performance, predicting an increase of +7 % in global GPP. Present-day O3 concentrations simulated by GEOS-Chem and an O3 damage scheme at high sensitivity show a 2 % reduction in global GPP with prominent reductions of up to 15 % in eastern China and the eastern USA. Regional correlations are generally unchanged when O3 is present and biases are reduced, especially for regions with high O3 damage. An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration of 20 ppmv from the level in 2000 to the level in 2010 modestly decreases O3 damage due to reduced stomatal uptake, consistent with ecophysiological understanding. Our work showcases the utility of this version of TEMIR for evaluating biogeophysical responses of vegetation to changes in atmospheric composition and meteorological conditions.

Hungary boasts exceptional geothermal capabilities, with an Earth's crust thermal gradient nearly double the global average. However, the current utilization of these resources is often one-sided and lacks careful consideration. This comprehensive study offers updated insights into Hungary's geothermal potential and its current energy utilization. By presenting a practical example and employing scenario-based analyses, this study demonstrates how basic calculations can guide investment decisions in geothermal infrastructure. The aim is to address the prevailing issue of cities and towns prioritizing fossil fuel-based energy sources, thereby overshadowing renewable energy alternatives, despite advancing technology. Notably, in the case of Székesfehérvár, it was determined that annual natural gas consumption could be reduced by an impressive 40–50%, leading to a substantial reduction of 5,000–9,200 tons of CO2 emissions, depending on the specific scenarios examined.

Plastic polymers are present in most aspects of routine daily life. Their increasing leakage into the environment poses a threat to environmental, animal, and human health. These polymers are often resistant to microbial degradation and are predicted to remain in the environment for tens to hundreds of years. Fungi have been shown to degrade complex polymers and are considered good candidates for bioremediation (biological pollutant reduction) of plastics. Therefore, we screened 18 selected fungal strains for their ability to degrade polyurethane (PU), polyethylene (PE), and tire rubber. As a proxy for plastic polymer mineralization, we quantified O2 consumption and CO2 production in an enclosed biodegradation system providing plastic as the sole carbon source. In contrast to most studies we demonstrated that the tested fungi attach to, and colonize the different plastic polymers without any pretreatment of the plastics and in the absence of sugars, which were suggested essential for priming the degradation process. Functional polymer groups identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and changes in fungal morphology as seen in light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used as indicators of fungal adaptation to growth on PU as a substrate. Thereby, SEM analysis revealed new morphological structures and deformation of the cell wall of several fungal strains when colonizing PU and utilizing this plastic polymer for cell growth. Strains of Fusarium, Penicillium, Botryotinia cinerea EN41, and Trichoderma demonstrated a high potential to degrade PU, rubber, and PE. Growing on PU, over 90 % of the O2 was consumed in <14 days with 300–500 ppm of CO2 generated in parallel. Our study highlights a high bioremediation potential of some fungal strains to efficiently degrade plastic polymers, largely dependent on plastic type.

This research analyzes drivers of CO2 emissions across ASEAN countries from 1971-2017 to inform effective policies for sustainable decarbonized development. The goal is to identify critical factors influencing emissions growth and reductions to guide strategic climate mitigation planning. Data includes 3128 emissions, GDP, population, and energy consumption observations from 9 ASEAN nations. Results using the Kaya Index and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition reveal GDP growth and population as primary drivers of increasing emissions, while energy efficiency dampens growth. Indonesia saw the highest emissions growth, driven by population and economic expansion. Thailand's phenomenal GDP growth of 3003.7% led to its emission increases. Singapore and the Philippines achieved notable reductions. Findings suggest integrated policies like clean energy, efficiency gains, infrastructure planning, and low-carbon economic reform are needed. Transitioning towards affordable clean energy systems with proactive leadership can enable ASEAN to sustain growth while mitigating climate risks. Further research should identify optimal policy mixes to maximize socio-economic progress and welfare while meeting urgent emission targets tailored to each nation. This study provides vital insights into key factors influencing ASEAN emissions and highlights pathways towards sustainable decarbonized development. The analysis of historical trends aims to inform strategic policymaking for decarbonization.

During COP26, Canada joined the Global Methane Pledge aiming to reduce global methane (CH4) emissions by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. Rapid reduction of anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the atmosphere is considered one of the most effective strategies to slow global warming in concert with carbon dioxide mitigation measures. In Canada, a large part of anthropogenic CH4 emissions can be attributed to the oil and gas industry in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), which is the fourth largest reserve of fossil fuel in the world. Recent studies highlighted big discrepancies between CH4 emissions reported in Canada's National Inventory and emissions estimated with approaches using atmospheric measurements for the oil and gas sector. Measuring the isotopic signature of CH4 (δ13CH4) at different atmospheric monitoring stations and comparing these measurements to detailed archives of δ13CH4 from oil and gas wells and associated CH4 leaks in the WCSB could help better characterize the emissions from different CH4 sources over the region. In this study, we compare two independent sets of data: (1) thousands of δ13CH4 of samples from oil and gas production wells and their associated leaks (surface casing vents and ground migration) collected across the WCSB, and (2) atmospheric mixing ratios of CH4 and their δ13CH4 measured successively at three locations across this region between 2016 and 2020 combined with their atmospheric footprints modeled with HYSPLIT-STILT. We observed a gradient in the isotopic signatures of the oil and gas samples within the WCSB with δ13CH4 being more depleted in the Southeast than in the Northwest. The analysis of these samples showed that the isotopic signature of CH4 emitted by the production of fossil fuel depends on the geological formations from which it is extracted. Also, CH4 isotopic signatures vary more depending on the region where CH4 comes from than on the type of fossil fuel extracted (natural gas, oil, heavy oil, shale gas). The atmospheric measurements showed a strong seasonality of δ13CH4 at one of the atmospheric monitoring sites with isotopic signatures associated with thermogenic sources in winter and isotopic signatures associated with a mix of biogenic and thermogenic sources in summer. Using the δ13CH4 archive database from oil and gas samples, we estimated that 28 to 39 % of the CH4 emitted near this site in summer was coming from a biogenic source (most likely wetlands). Ultimately, atmospheric measurements collected during winter combined with their associated HYSPLIT-STILT footprints presented a spatial distribution of δ13CH4 over the WCSB comparable to the one observed in the archive database from the oil and gas sector, confirming that the oil and gas sector is the main source of CH4 in this region.

Polyoxometalate-based hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts were modified using cysteine to construct efficient CoMoS active phase. Cysteine, characterized by chelating (–COOH, –NH2) and reducing (−SH) groups, assumed a triple role in catalyst synthesis, including reduction, chelation, and dispersion. Cysteine pre-reduced polyoxometalates to heteropoly blue, significantly increasing the catalyst sulfidation. The increased nucleophilicity of heteropoly blue enhanced their attraction to Co2+ ions, intensifying the Co-Mo bimetallic synergy. The formation of Co-chelate species delayed Co sulfidation, allowing for the concurrent sulfidation of both Co and Mo species and promoting the generation of the CoMoS active phase. Carbonaceous deposits from the high-temperature carbonization of cysteine weakened the metal-support interaction, facilitating the dispersion of the active phase. The S-CoPMo12-Cys/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated high activity in the HDS reaction of dibenzothiophene, showcasing their potential for advanced HDS reaction.

Normally, the acidic impurities in hemihydrate phosphogypsum (HPG) must be neutralized when HPG is utilized, and a little amount of calcium hydroxide (CH) is the best choice. In this paper, the effects of excessive CH (5 wt.%, 10 wt.%, 15 wt.% and 20 wt.% of HPG) for carbonation curing on the performance of hardened HPG paste were studied. According to the results of macro tests and microanalyses of XRD, TG, SEM-EDS, MIP and N2 physisorption, it could be verified that CaF2, Ca3(PO4)2 and a large amount of nanoscale CaCO3 crystals were produced as a result of neutralization and carbonation, and the compressive strength and the water resistance of carbonated HPG + CH paste were significantly improved due to the effects of nanoscale CaCO3 crystals on pore refinement and the coverage on the surfaces of gypsum crystals of the hardened paste. Therefore, this study suggests a feasible and green method for recycling HPG/PG, with the collaborative effects of neutralization, performance enhancement and reductions in CO2 emissions.

The tri-nuclear Pt(II)-Ru(II)-Pt(II)(RuPt2) and Re(I)-Ru(II)-Re(II)(RuRe2) complexes, synthesized from mononuclear Ru(II) complex were explored for efficient energy conversion through water splitting and CO2 reduction. The catalysts show excellent activity, serving as promising platforms for sustainable energy applications. The study focuses on designing, stepwise synthesis of the catalysts with insights into the multiple components’ contribution to enhanced catalytic performance. Photophysical and electrochemical analyses highlight the role of the complexes as photocatalysts, where the Ru(II)-polypyridyl unit acts as photosensitizer and the Pt(II)/ Re(I)-polypyridyl units as catalytic sites. Synergistic effects among the components lead to stability, improved performance and emphasizes the significance of multi-nuclear M-Ru(II)-M[M= Pt(II), Re(I)] catalysts in promoting cleaner and more sustainable energy sources.

Understanding structure–property relationships in atomically precise metal nanoclusters is vital in finding selective and tunable catalysts. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was used to benchmark seven exchange correlation functionals at different basis sets for 17 atomically precise nanoclusters against experimentally determined geometries, band gaps, and optical gaps. The set contains both monometallic and bimetallic clusters that possess at least two types of 3d transition metals (specifically, Cu, Ni, Fe, or Co). The benchmark highlights that PBE0 is a good functional to use regardless of the basis set, and Minnesota functionals do well with respect to specific metals. Further, while long-range corrected functionals overestimate band and optical gaps, they model absorption features better than the other considered functionals. The study additionally looks at the photoinduced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the CO2 reduction mechanism on nanoclusters reported from the literature.

Here, in situ assembly in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and CoFe2O4 composite (LSCFC) cathode was induced by Pr to form La0.6Sr0.4CoxFeyO3-δ/PrCoO3/Co3O4/PrO2 (LSCFC-PI) multiphase heterostructures. The surface of LSCFC-PI forms uniform nanoparticles, and the unique core-shell structure prevents Sr segregation, thereby enhancing CO2 tolerance and increasing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) active sites. Furthermore, compared with LSCFC, LSCFC-PI increases the oxygen vacancy content of the cathode due to the existence of multiphase heterostructure, improves the ORR kinetics, and the conductivity is also greatly improved. The peak power density (PDD) of LSCFC-PI as a single-cell cathode at 700 ℃ reached 1.51 W cm-2, which was 2.65 times higher than that of LSCFC's 0.57 W cm-2, and in the long-term stability test at a constant voltage ~0.8 V for 100 hours, showing excellent stability. In situ assembly of multiphase heterostructures is expected to become a new strategy for developing high-performance IT-SOFC cathodes.

Food-delivery platforms provide unique opportunities to design user interfaces that encourage healthy, low-carbon meal choices. We conducted an incentivised online randomised controlled trial with 4,008 participants using a simulated food delivery app to test three potential interventions: a sign-posted meat tax, a carbon-footprint label, and a choice-architecture intervention that changed the order of the menu so that the lowest carbon-impact restaurants and dishes were presented first. Results show that only the choice-architecture nudge significantly reduced the average meal carbon footprint—by 0.3 kg/CO2e per order (12%), driven by a 5.6 percentage point (13%) reduction in high-carbon meal choices. Furthermore, menu repositioning resulted in healthier meal choices, with greater nutritional value and fewer calories, while significantly increasing self-reported satisfaction. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that menu repositioning would be a highly cost-effective policy instrument if implemented at scale, with an expected return on investment in the range of £1.28 to £3.85 per metric ton of avoided CO2 emissions, depending on implementation costs.

Physiological responses of soil microorganisms to global warming are important for soil ecosystem function and the terrestrial carbon cycle. Here, we investigate the effects of weeks, years, and decades of soil warming across seasons and time on the microbial protein biosynthesis machineries (i.e. ribosomes), the most abundant cellular macromolecular complexes, using RNA:DNA and RNA:MBC (microbial biomass carbon) ratios as proxies for cellular ribosome contents. We compared warmed soils and non-warmed controls of 15 replicated subarctic grassland and forest soil temperature gradients subject to natural geothermal warming. RNA:DNA ratios tended to be lower in the warmed soils during summer and autumn, independent of warming duration (6 weeks, 8-14 years, > 50 years), warming intensity (+3°C, +6°C, +9°C), and ecosystem type. With increasing temperatures RNA:MBC ratios were also decreasing. Additionally, seasonal RNA:DNA ratios of the consecutively sampled forest showed the same temperature-driven pattern. This suggests that subarctic soil microorganisms are depleted of ribosomes under warm conditions and the lack of consistent relationships with other physicochemical parameters besides temperature further suggests temperature as key driver. Furthermore, in incubation experiments, we measured significantly higher CO2 emission rates per unit of RNA from short- and long-term warmed soils compared to non-warmed controls. In conclusion, ribosome reduction may represent a widespread microbial physiological response to warming that offers a selective advantage at higher temperatures, as energy and matter can be reallocated from ribosome synthesis to other processes including substrate uptake and turnover. This way, ribosome reduction could have a substantial effect on soil carbon dynamics.

Choosing environmentally benign strategy in product manufacturing is a relevant need that has been influencing all the industrial sectors aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This necessity often collides with the production costs. A different design strategy based on a multi-material approach can result in an economic efficiency playing, at the same time, a fundamental role in reducing the environmental footprint. Taking into account this scenario, an optimisation study was proposed focusing on the minimisation of both costs and environmental impacts of a car's lead anti-intrusion side door inside beam (SDIB) manufactured using a multi-material approach. The materials takeable into account in the executed design strategy were a carbon steel, an aluminium alloy, and a carbon fibre reinforced polymer. The objective of the work was to find a balance between cost efficiency and environmental sustainability throughout the entire product life cycle. Specifically, the input variables in the optimisation analysis were energy consumption, CO2 emissions, resource use and direct production costs. The model was developed taking these multiple factors into account and making possible the minimisation of costs and environmental impact, simultaneously respecting, at the same time, the required product performance.

There is a lack of research in the literature on the application of nanoparticles to different cascade cycle configurations with environmental refrigerants in ultra-low temperature refrigeration applications. This study is the first on the use of nano-refrigerants in cascade refrigeration cycles. In this study, the effect of 2 wt. % of CuO to RE170 and R170-pure refrigerant utilization in cascade vapor compression refrigeration cycle (CVCRC), cascade ejector refrigeration cycle (CERC) and cascade ejector intercooler refrigeration cycle (CEIRC) are investigated to achieve higher performance values in ultra-low temperature applications. For CVCRC, CERC and CEIRC, the increases in terms of coefficient of performance (COP) with the use of nano-refrigerant were found to be 12.77%, 8.20%, and 6.37%, respectively, and 18.55%, 14.05%, and 6.07%, for exergy efficiency. Upon scrutinizing the results with nano-refrigerant in relation to the COP, the analysis revealed that the CEIRC cycle exhibited an improvement ranging from 13.43% to 20.49% in comparison to CERC. Additionally, with nano-refrigerant, the CEIRC cycle demonstrated an increase ranging from 42.39% to 75.41% when compared to CVCRC in COP. It was observed that the utilization of CEIRC led to a 13.03% decrease in kg CO2 emissions in compared to CERC and a reduction of 32.53% compared to CVCRC with using nano-refrigerant.

This research examines the potential impact on the procurement sustainability of replacing steel rebars with Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) rebars in the construction industry, focusing on screed pre-cast hollow core topping in a project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted using One Click LCA (Version 0.26.0) software for cradle-to-grave analysis. The assessment covers various stages, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, usage, and recycling. The comprehensive LCA highlights GFRP rebars as a more sustainable alternative to steel, emitting 17% less CO2 equivalent (2e) per kilogram throughout its life cycle. Additionally, GFRP requires substantially less mass compared to steel, resulting in a dramatic reduction in CO2e emissions ranging from 77.89% to 85.26% across different spacing configurations in real-world construction scenarios, as presented in this research case study. These findings suggest that GFRP rebars offer a promising solution for reducing the environmental impact of construction activities while potentially yielding significant cost savings over the project’s life cycle. Integrating environmental considerations into material selection processes can prioritize sustainability without compromising performance or safety, contributing to a more sustainable future for the construction industry globally.

Rice husk ash (RHA) is agricultural waste with high silica content that has had proven technical feasibility as a pozzolanic material since the 1970s. Notwithstanding, its use in mortars and concrete is limited by the standards currently utilized in some countries where RHA production is high and the aforementioned pozzolanic material is not standardized. This is the case of Spain, one of the main rice producers in Europe. Nowadays, the high pressure placed on the Portland cement production sector to reduce energy use and CO2 emissions has given rise to a keen interest shown in mineral admixtures for cement manufacturing. In this research, we intend to establish the contribution of different RHA types to final blended Portland cement properties (symbol “H” was used to identify RHA in standardized cements). The experimental results demonstrated that RHA with good pozzolanic properties (large specific surface and high amorphous silica content) had to be limited to 10% cement replacement because of the severe reduction in workability at higher replacement percentages. RHA with lower reactivity, such as crystalline RHA, or fly ash (FA), can be used to prepare binary and ternary blended cements with reactive RHA. It is possible to design the following cements: CEM II/A-H and CEM II/A-(H-V) It would also be possible to design cement (CEM II/B-(H-V) with replacement values up to 30% and the same 28-day mechanical performance observed for the Portland cement without mineral addition.

Abstract The strategic target and path to peak CO2 emissions and carbon neutrality, which have been initiated by several countries over the last decade, considerably affected whole energy industry especially oil and natural gas fields. The recoverable shale-gas reserves of Sichuan Basin in China is beyond 1.0×1012 m3. Environmental pollution and carbon emission issues caused by diesel-powered operations cannot be ignored. The electrification of upstream operations has been concerned and applied only in production, processing and transportation. Electrification work towards shale gas was still faced with poor economy when large-power operations such as drilling and fracturing are performed. Due to unpredictable developing progress and high energy-consuming operation, power supply and load demand forecast is quite challenging. Existing operations using coal-based power generation negatively affects environmental-social-governance (ESG) initiatives without green renewable energy. One ESG path to green production and recommended practices towards electrifying recovery were proposed in this paper. Fully electric-powered equipment (2500HHP to 7000HHP pumping units, blending units, manifold etc.) was widely used with 35kV customized power grids. Due to great hydropower in Sichuan Basin, power generation exhibits seasonal fluctuation and focused on peak electricity consumption for civilian use in summer and winter. The hydropower and energy-storage sharing with data centers was applied to deal with seasonal energy supply and fluctuating load especially fracturing operations with great economic advantages. Electrical load variation and power gap between supply and demand were precisely forecasted through machine-learning algorithms under different conditions of drilling and fracturing. At the end of 2022 shale-gas production in Sichuan Basin has increased to 1.39×1010 m3. Hydropower proportion has accounted for 72% of power consumption for shale-gas development with 19 newly-constructed transformer substations, 1145.7 km of 35kV grids and 1197 MVA of grid capacity. The fully electric-powered operation reached almost 40% of all operating pads. It was estimated that hydrocarbon fuels of 6.1×105 ton were replaced and CO2 emission reduction reached more than 7.7×105 ton so far. The detailed recommended practices and lessons learnt from electrifying shale-gas recovery were guidable for the recovery of other unconventional resources.

Abstract The majority of oil production at the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) rely on Electrical Submersible Pumping (ESP) systems. One such reservoir in Kuwait with over than 120 producing well equipped with electrical submersible Pumps are exposed to a harsh production environments including corrosive fluids (sweet corrosion due to presence of Co2). Historical data shows that over 40% of all pulled Electrical Submersible Pumps where dismantle inspection and failure analysis (DIFA) were performed in the past 4 to 5 years within the field have failed due to corrosion within the well completion (mainly corrosion in the tubing) or in Electrical Submersible Pump components. When analyzing existing data (reservoir, design, equipment specifications, operation and DIFA) the majority of failed wells equipped with Electrical Submersible Pump show signs of corrosion in the tubing although they rarely appear on the ESP components. Further analysis shows that 80% of these completion (mainly tubing) failures occur between 4 to 18 months where the tubing used in these cases are all found to be of carbon steel metallurgy. Sweet corrosion is one of the major issues for wells equipped with electrical submersible Pump in one of reservoir located in Kuwait. An increase in water cut percentages in the reservoir has led to increased CO2 corrosion rate in the saline formation water (high chloride level). The collected data shows that more than 40% of all pulled electrical submersible Pumps where DIFA have been performed were due to corrosion in the completion components (mainly corrosion hole in the tubing). As a proactive measure, KOC have been installing Internally Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) lined carbon steel tubing for wells that have corrosion related tubing failures. In additional, KOC decided to enhance the Electrical Submersible Pump components specifications to mitigate the risk related to sweet corrosion. This paper shows a field study for 36 cases where Internally Glass Reinforced Epoxy lined carbon steel tubing were used on existing failed wells due to corrosion to evaluate the effectiveness of using GRE lined tubing when exposed to the same harsh environments (sweet corrosion) and the resulting equipment run life. When compared with conventional carbon steel tubing, a significant increase in run life and reduction of numbers of completion failures are recorded. Over all, the average run life for all cases has improved by over 422 days. This study will help ESP operators facing similar challenges to understand the effectiveness of using Internally Glass Reinforced Epoxy lined carbon steel tubing as a replacement for conventional carbon steel tubing towards mitigating sweet corrosion environments.

For the aviation sector, it is extremely important to devise revolutionary solutions in the field of technology to restrain the potential impact of civil aviation on the environment to the level of the established strategic goals of ACARE (FlightPath2050). The introduction of innovative technologies (improvement of the combustion chamber, the introduction of electric hybrid power plants on airplanes, and the use of alternative aviation fuel) will ensure the sustainable growth of air transportation. To assess the effectiveness of advanced technologies, it is extremely important to have a model for calculating global/local emissions that takes into account the parameters of the flight path of conventional and hybrid aircraft, operational characteristics of the aircraft engine and hybrid powerplant, and the features of sustainable fuel. The improved module for calculating emission indices by combining the module for calculating the parameters of the flight path and the results of calculating the thermogas-dynamic calculation of the aircraft engine makes it possible to detect the influence of fuel consumption (engine thrust) on the values of the emission indices. This feature is representative for evaluating the efficiency of hybrid powerplants because the electrification of the aircraft fleet is primarily aimed at reducing fuel consumption. The analysis of simulation results reveals that the fuel consumption and EINOx are significantly reduced (for the climb stage – 25 %; for the descent stage – 30 %) for the hybrid AN26 compared to the conventional AN26. The specified operational measure, in the part of the low-pitch descend, significantly reduces EICO for the hybrid AN26 by an average of 50 % compared to the descend stage for the conventional trajectory. The results of calculations for the entire flight path demonstrate that the use of a hybrid power plant for An26 contributes to an average reduction of fuel consumption by 10 %, NOx emissions by 25 %, water vapor emissions by 10 %, and CO2 by 10 %.

The Shimensi super-large tungsten polymetallic deposit is located in Late Jurassic- Early Cretaceous Porphyry-Skarn tungsten ore belt in the south Yangtze metallogenic belt. There are 3 types of mineralization: veinlet-disseminated type, thick quartze vein type and hydrothermal crypto-explosive breccia type. Based on geological studies, this paper presents new petrographic, microthermometric, laser Raman spectroscopic and hydrogen and oxygen isotope research of the fluid inclusions from the deposit. The results show that there are five different types of fluid inclusions: liquid-rich inclusions, vapor-rich inclusions, pure liquid inclusions, pure vapor inclusions, and fluid inclusions containing a solid crystal. The homogenization temperatures of the fluid inclusion range from 140℃-270℃, the salinities are 3%-5% NaCleq and the densities of ore-forming fluid range from 0.64 g/cm3 to 0.99 g/cm3. For the analyses of Laser Raman spectroscopic, the ore-forming fluids can be approximated by a Ca2+-Na+-SO42--Cl- fluid system with small amount of CO2, CH4 and N2. Otherwise, the datas of the pressure, pH and Eh show a fluid metallogenic environment of low pressure, weak acid and weak reduction. The values of the homogenization temperature in 3 types of orebodies suggest that the mineralization is characterized by the decrease of the temperature under the condition of the fluid immiscibility. The H-O isotope values are interpreted to indicate that the ore-forming fluids are mainly composed of magmatic water, and also the meteoric water was added with the process of the magma rising.

In this study, the effect of internal sidewall reflector (ISR), simultaneous thermoelectric heating and cooling system (STHCS), hollow circular fins (HCFs), and nano-CuO mixed PCM (NMPCM) in a double slope SS of four cases: case-I includes SS, case-II includes SS along with STCHS and ISR, case-III includes SS along with STCHS, ISR, and HCFs, case-IV includes SS along with STCHS, ISR, HCFs and NMPCM have been investigated. The evaluations were conducted in Rajshahi, Bangladesh, located at latitude 24°22′N and longitude 88°36′E. The design modification in case IV significantly increases production, a figure that is approximately 118.70% more than the case I, with a daily cumulative distillate of 2.10 L/m2. In comparison to cases II and III, exergy efficiency of case IV is 131.33 and 95.92% higher, respectively. Feasibility of modified SS in case IV is observed for having the 74.89% incremental exergo-economic factor. For cases II, III, and IV, respectively, a reduction of 7.22, 7.90, and 8.41 tons of CO2 emissions is possible attained over lifetime and the payback period is reduced 37.31% compared to cases I. After conducting sustainability analysis this made a crystal-clear picture that case IV shows significant improvements than the others.

Velocity-selective arterial spin labelling (VSASL) MRI is insensitive to arterial transit time. This is an advantage over other perfusion measurements, where long arterial transit times can lead to bias. Therefore, VSASL can be used to study perfusion in the presence of long arterial transit times, such as in the ageing brain, in vascular pathologies, and cancer, or where arterial transit time changes, such as during measurement of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). However, when calculating perfusion (cerebral blood flow, CBF, in the brain) from VSASL signal, it is assumed that images are acquired before the trailing edge of the labelled blood has arrived in the imaging slice. The arrival of the trailing edge of the labelled bolus of blood will cause an underestimation of perfusion. Here we measure bolus duration in young, healthy human brains, both at rest and during elevated CBF. Grey matter bolus duration was 1.61 +/- 0.31 s, but there was a large spatial heterogeneity, with bolus duration being lower in anterior brain regions, with some areas having bolus duration < 1.2 s. We place these results in context of recommendations from a recent consensus paper, which recommends imaging 1.4 s after the label, potentially underestimating CBF in anterior regions. Further, we observed a 0.23 +/- 0.12 s reduction in grey matter bolus duration with 5% CO2 inhalation. These results can be used to inform the experimental design of future VSASL studies, to avoid underestimating perfusion by imaging after the arrival of the trailing edge of the labelled bolus.

With increasing focus on equitable and just energy transition, it is critical to understand the trade-offs of different decarbonization outcomes across economic, environmental, and social sustainability criteria. In this analysis, we use a multi-criteria decision analysis to quantify sustainability outcomes across 32 decarbonization outcomes in 2050 in the U.S. The economic sustainability criteria we use are system cost, national average retail rate, and electricity system employment. The environmental sustainability criteria we use are life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, life cycle water depletion, life cycle land transformation, and air pollution fatalities. The social sustainability (distributional impacts) criteria we use are retail rate equality across states, electricity employment equality across low-income households, and air pollution disparities across census tracts. We evaluate performance across these criteria under eleven different stakeholder preference scenarios. We find that decarbonization policies with indefinitely extended tax credits have the highest sustainability score under equal criteria weighting, with greater investments in renewable energy technologies, and result in better environmental, system cost, job, and air pollution disparities compared to mid-case scenarios, that only include current policies and CO2 reduction targets. We also see that our multi-criteria decision analysis identifies decarbonization outcomes that would not have been identified as optimal under a single objective, which highlights the importance of trade-off analyses to understand decarbonization outcomes more holistically.

The paper aims to clarify the regulation mechanism of sulfur migration and transformation in a low water-binder ratio system incorporating phosphogypsum aggregate (LWC-PG). Firstly, the combination of S-containing adhesive material and phosphate gypsum aggregate can reduce the migration of sulfate ions (SO42-) in the phosphate gypsum aggregate. The reaction mechanism and macro and micro properties of LWC-PG are characterized by universal testing machine, low field nuclear magnetic field, isothermal calorimeter, XRD diffractometer, scanning electron microscope and nano-indentation. The results show that the calcium sulfoaluminate cementitious system (CSA) is compatible with PG. The results show that CSA is compatible with PG, and the 28d strength of 80% phosphogypsum is 83.4MPa, which can maintain the required strength for high-performance concrete. Secondly, the sulfides in PG react with C4A6S in CSA, resulting in the formation of ettringite that coats the surface of the C-S-H gel, thereby retarding the hydration rate of the slurry. However, due to the presence of phosphate gypsum aggregate, the reaction continues, enhancing the hydration of sulfate cement. Moreover, the interfacial transition zone between the PG and matrix exhibits a strong bond and shows no significant signs of deterioration. Lastly, when using 80% phosphogypsum aggregate instead of natural sand and gravel to produce 100 m3 of concrete, 42 t of phosphogypsum aggregate can be used, which reduces the consumption of natural sand and gravel by 61.4 t, decreases energy consumption by 3070 MJ, reduces CO2 emissions by 178.06 kg, SO2 emissions by 0.37 kg, NOX emissions by 0.25 kg, and dust emissions by 0.087 kg. Life cycle evaluation demonstrates that the production of LWC-PG is associated with low carbon emissions and environmental friendliness, which significantly reduces environmental burden. This is of significant research importance for solid waste management and energy-saving and carbon reduction efforts.

Despite many years of research, results from prebiotic chemistry experiments—where biologically relevant compounds are formed from simple monomers such as cyanate, CO2, or formaldehyde— still yield complex mixtures with only trace amounts of the molecules of interest. The prevailing idea that life originated from a sequence of chemical reactions, starting from very simple active molecules and evolving into progressively more complex systems, might be incorrect for two reasons: First, after 70 years of experiments, we still lack robust experimental demonstration of such networks; second, small reactive molecules typically do not exist in high concentrations and readily react to form tars and other complex mixtures. Here I adopt an alternative approach, demonstrating that numerous primary metabolites can be derived from tar-like mixtures through the Advanced Reduction Process (ARP). Tars are formed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are widespread in the Universe and likely were the main source of organic carbon on early Earth. Under conditions thought to exist on the prebiotic Earth—characterized by sunlight, an anoxic sulfur-rich atmosphere, and iron-rich dust - PAH suspensions in water are decomposed to succinic, lactic, malonic, and glycolic acids, all known as primary metabolites in all living systems and main components of ubiquitous citric acid cycle. The sum of reaction yields for these biologically important metabolites reaches up to 40%, with individual product yields ranging from 1-15%. The simplicity of this reaction and the ubiquity of PAHs on prebiotic Earth make this process particularly appealing, suggesting it could have occurred on a vast scale on sunlit planetary surfaces. These findings may reveal an overlooked initial step in the origin of life on Earth, and potentially elsewhere in the Universe.

Biocrusts are common living covers found across drylands worldwide, and their photosynthesis substantially contributes to carbon input in these ecosystems. However, direct monitoring of biocrusts' photosynthetic carbon fixation is challenging due to their scattered distribution, dark pigments, and lower CO2 exchange rate. Current studies have limited monitoring frequency and the results are difficult to extend to a broader spatial scale. Greenness typically functions as an indicator of both vegetation cover and plant photosynthesis. Monitoring biocrust greenness is expected to be able to provide insights into their environmental responses and estimate carbon fixation rates, particularly for moss biocrusts. Here, we monitored greenness, soil moisture and temperature, and gross primary productivity (GPP) of moss biocrusts, as well as climatic factors over two years in the northern China's Loess Plateau. The results indicated that moss biocrust greenness was highly sensitive to changing environmental conditions and exhibited significant temporal variability. Moss biocrust greenness exhibited a notably higher value in wet season (0.384) than in dry season (0.259). According to these greenness values, we proposed moss biocrust activity and classified it into high (>0.403), medium (0.334–0.403), low (0.271–0.333), and dormancy (<0.270). Soil moisture, relative humidity, and wind speed were the three main determinates of moss biocrust greenness. Higher soil moisture and relative humidity were linked to increased greenness, whereas elevated wind speed led to a reduction. In dry seasons, soil moisture contributed 23.4 % to the variation in moss biocrust greenness, while in wet seasons relative humidity contributed 16.1 %. A significant and positive correlation between moss biocrust greenness and GPP was found, and annual GPP prediction based on greenness using machine learning performed well. Our study highlights the significance of moss biocrust greenness and their potential as indicators for moss biocrust photosynthetic carbon fixation rates and possibly other ecological functions in drylands.

Abstract. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11064126, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that, for the 2014–2023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] °C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] °C was human-induced. For the single year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] °C in 2023 relative to 1850–1900. This is below the 2023 observed record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] °C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2014–2023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 ± 5.4 GtCO2e per year over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.

<p dir="ltr">Millennial-scale climatic oscillations have been documented in numerous ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland for the last glacial period. These glacial events, termed Antarctic Isotope Maxima (AIM) and Dansgaard – Oeschger (DO) events in Antarctica and Greenland, respectively, are understood as ocean-mediated mechanisms, with asynchronous progression into warming and cooling. This bipolar seesaw originates from the out-of-phase strengthening and weakening of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). While proxy records provide strong evidence for enhanced AABW formation during AIM events, the mechanism of its formation during these events remains indiscernible. The process of AABW formation, however, is likely to be different from today. In modern times, AABW formation occurs in front of ice-shelves, whereas during glacial periods, the ice sheets extended to the continental shelf, and the ice-shelves were absent. Ice cores allow the reconstruction of an array of environmental conditions. Here, we present new data from a high-resolution coastal ice core record that sensitively captures changes in temperature, sea ice conditions, primary productivity, and atmospheric circulation pattern. The new data provide important insights into the drivers of AIM events, AABW formation, and the evolution of the bipolar seesaw.</p><p dir="ltr">This thesis focuses on the high resolution record of major ions bracketing 26-40 kilo year (ka) Before Present (BP), from Roosevelt Island, West Antarctica. Roosevelt Island is a grounded ice rise, located in the north-east of Ross Ice Shelf, in the Southern Ross Sea. The ice core was drilled to bedrock at 764m, as a part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project. The record has been dated to 753m which captures the past 83 ka BP. The major ion record comprises of concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium, chloride, sulphate, nitrate, and Methane Sulphonic Acid (MSA), with an average resolution of ~25 years.</p><p dir="ltr">We demonstrate that the RICE MSA, sea salt aerosols, and non-sea salt calcium records are sensitive recorders of primary productivity, open-ocean area, and latitudinal position of Southern Hemisphere westerly winds, respectively. Our results suggest that AIM events in the Ross Sea region are driven by open-ocean convection. We test this hypothesis using the outputs from LOVECLIM, an intermediate complexity earth system model, based on contrasting scenarios, with and without open-ocean convection in the Ross Sea region. Our results confirm that open-ocean convection as a prominent mechanism for the formation of AABW in the Ross Sea region during AIM events. </p><p dir="ltr">Availability of high resolution, continuous flow methane data for the AIM 4 event provides an opportunity to examine the relative phasing of the events in RICE and North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) ice cores. We demonstrate that the RICE AIM 4 event leads by over 200 years the Greenland DO 4 event. Our data suggest that the Antarctic lead is caused by the coupled interaction between open ocean convection and local insolation changes, which also highlights the significant role of the Southern Ocean in the evolution of bipolar seesaw. Using non-sea salt calcium data in RICE and other Antarctic ice cores to reconstruct atmospheric circulation pattern, we find an equatorward migration of Southern Hemisphere westerly winds between 31-32 ka BP. This shift evokes large scale consequences that include a reduction in atmospheric CO2 and strengthening of tropical rainfall. This atmospheric rearrangement might be linked to reduced summer insolation, leading to Southern Ocean sea surface cooling and subsequent sea ice expansion.</p>
