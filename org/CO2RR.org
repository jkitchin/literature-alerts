Since carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased at unprecedented rate over the last ten years, global warming has become an increasingly pressing concern for humanity. This work suggests a sustainable solution to this issue by employing a unique mechanism that uses sunlight and electricity to transform CO2 into useful fuel. To construct the device, a Simulink model of the electrochemical reduction cell was created. The model essentially transforms photovoltaic power, CO2 and water into other chemical products. Using the reversible, activation and ohmic equations, the voltage needed to run the CO2 reduction cell was determined. As the anode, cathode, and voltage source blocks are the three main models that make up the CO2 electrolyser cell, the production flow rates of formic acid and oxygen were also evaluated based on molar and charge balances, as well as continuity equations at operating conditions of 1 atm and 298 K. The simulation predicts about 176 kg of CO2 consumption in 10 seconds of the electrochemical conversion. Therefore, the implication of this study is to justify photosynthesis as electrochemical reduction process to efficiently mitigate the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Electrochemistry offers a transformative approach for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), addressing critical challenges such as energy consumption and scalability. By using clean electricity, electrochemical systems can significantly reduce operational costs, making CDR technologies more cost-effective. This paper delves into the potential of electrochemical methods, specifically in Direct Air Capture (DAC), Indirect Water Capture (IWC), and Hybrid Systems (HYB). Drawing on recent developments in the field and findings from RMI's Insight Brief: Breaking Barriers in CDR with Electrochemistry, we explore the latest advancements, energy and system trade-offs, and provide actionable guidance for investors, entrepreneurs, and research funders interested in scaling these technologies.

Utilizing sunlight for photoelectrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (PEC CO2 RR) is a carbon-neutral path to valuable liquid fuels. Higher quality photoabsorbers are needed to improve the efficiency of the PEC CO2 RR process. We show how the optoelectronic properties of sputtered ZnTe absorbers can be improved for this purpose via chloride treatments. MnCl2 and MgCl2 heat treatments recrystallize ZnTe absorbers to enlarge grains and improve photoluminescence. These material improvements result in the highest PEC CO2 RR photocurrent density reported for planar ZnTe and >50% Faradaic efficiency to CO formation with diaryliodonium additive in the solution. These results pave the way to integration of polycrystalline thin-film photoabsorbers in PEC CO2 RR systems.

Human (anthropogenic) influence, mostly generalized industry, intensive conventional agriculture, traffic and others, causes the increase of concentration of greenhouse gases to a level by which significantly more heat is radiated back to the earth than it was in the initial state. This is how climate warming occurs. At the international level, periodic inventories are carried out that show the fact that the biosphere absorbs, approximately, half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and at the terrestrial level, the carbon source and reserve is given by the northern hemisphere.This study presents some results from the literature regarding the methods of C emissions reduction and its sequestration per surface unit, i.e. per hectare of agricultural crops, to increase the contribution of agriculture to environmental depollution. The used methods included searching of databases, such as Web of Science or Google Scholar, in order to identify some relevant results.Reducing CO2 emissions can be achieved through biological, chemical and technological options, either by reducing or sequestering them.

This work addresses fundamental questions that deepen our understanding of secondary coordination sphere effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using derivatized hydride analogues of the type, [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H] (Cp* = C5Me5‐) – a well‐studied family of organometallic complex – as models. More precisely, we describe the general reactivity of [(Cp*‐BR2)Fe(diphosphine)H], which contains an intramolecularly positioned Lewis acid, and its cooperative reactivity with CO2. Control experiments underscore the critical nature of borane incorporation for CO2 to reduced products, a reaction that does not occur for unfunctionalized [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H]). Additional experiments highlight relevance of borane hybridization and substituent effects. Mechanistic studies performed in the presence and absence of CO2 emphasize the significance of carbonyl substrate to catalyst longevity. Lessons from these reactions were also transferable – with such borane‐containing complexes enabling the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes in the presence of alkenes. These findings provide valuable insights into metal‐ligand cooperative design strategies for carbonyl reduction and illustrate the versatility of intramolecularly positioned Lewis acids for otherwise challenging chemical transformations.

With the rising levels of atmospheric CO2, electrochemistry shows great promise in decarbonizing industrial processes by converting CO2 into valuable products through scalable and sustainable technologies. In this framework, the present study investigates the solar-driven CO2 reduction toward carbon monoxide, achieved by the integration between the electrochemical reactor and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), both in experimental and modeling perspectives. COMSOL® Multiphysics 6.3 was used to develop a detailed finite element method model of the electrochemical cell integrated with a photovoltaic module, validated with the experimental results that demonstrated a strong correlation. A 2D model was designed, incorporating cathode and anode regions divided by an ion-exchange membrane. The model includes platinum foil and silver nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction, respectively. Integration with the fundamental equations of the DSSCs was simulated to analyze the solar-driven CO2 reduction behavior under solar irradiance variations, offering a valuable tool for optimizing operating conditions and predicting the device performance under different environmental conditions. The integrated device successfully produces CO with a faradaic efficiency of 73.85% at a current density of J = 3.35 mA/cm2 under 1 sun illumination, with the result validated and reproduced by the mathematical model. Under reduced illumination conditions of 0.8 and 0.6 suns, faradaic efficiencies of 68.5% and 64.1% were achieved, respectively.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) has historically been the primary focus of carbon management programs and portfolios driven by increasing atmospheric levels that reached approximately 36.8 billion tonnes in 2022, which amounted to a 0.9% increase over the previous year. Early carbon management efforts concentrated largely on large point sources like the fossil energy power generation sector, primarily coal. More recently, the scope has broadened to include natural gas power generation and the more challenging-to-address industrial sector. Over the past five years, there has been a notable effort to address the latter harder-to-abate industrial and commercial sectors through carbon dioxide reduction (CDR). Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that establishing a compelling business case is essential to enable widespread implementation to meet the climate change targets of 1.5°C or 2°C scenarios. Methane (CH4) has been regarded as the transition fossil fuel alternative to coal for over a decade due to its low carbon intensity, abundance, worldwide portability, and potential to be integrated into existing point source facilities. Among the various greenhouse gases, some with higher global warming potential, CH4 is the one carbon-based species that has the inherent potential to be the most impactful for tackling climate change while also having the potential of no net cost since captured emissions can offset the cost of abatement. The global priority of addressing methane emissions is underscored by the Global Methane Pledge that originated at COP26 and was expanded at COP28. The importance of reducing methane emissions was demonstrated by The White House Office of Domestic Policy's U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan and Executive Order 14057 to lead the Federal Government to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050. The US Department of Energy (DOE) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have jointly undertaken measures to address methane emissions.The mission of the DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) is to minimize the environmental and climate impacts of fossil fuels and industrial processes while working toward net-zero emissions. FECM collaborates closely with the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) whose mission is to drive innovation and deliver solutions for an environmentally sustainable and prosperous future. Collectively FECM and NETL have been at the forefront of carbon management research for the past three decades through programs that support research, development, demonstration, and deployment to advance technologies that reduce emissions and other environmental impacts of fossil fuels and industrial production. FECM and NETL leverage their well-established core competencies to lead comprehensive programs focused on carbon dioxide (CO2) management, including point source carbon capture, carbon dioxide removal, and carbon storage, abatement of methane emissions, including methane mitigation technologies, and natural gas decarbonization hydrogen technologies to accelerate the development of a carbon-free power sector by 2035 and a "net-zero" carbon economy by 2050.To meet a 1.5ºC scenario, it is imperative to implement a wide range of carbon management strategies encompassing both carbon capture and methane emissions abatement. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), giving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to award grants for financial and technical assistance for activities including the reduction of methane and other GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems and infrastructure. In late 2023, the EPA partnered with NETL to provide technical support, along with program and project management expertise, to provide technical expertise and implement a program strategy to invest over $1 billion to measure and mitigate methane emissions. Currently, FECM and NETL are managing over $5 billion in Bipartisan and Infrastructure Law (BIL) and IRA funding directed toward Carbon Management and Resource Sustainability (oil & gas).This paper will examine the progress and achievements of FECM and NETL in developing a carbon management solution that tackles both sources of carbon: carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). It covers an overview of the current program, lessons learned from the program and project execution, and the status of ongoing funding opportunity announcements.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate offers a promising pathway to mitigate the energy crisis and realize carbon neutrality. Bismuth (Bi), as a metal catalyst for the CO2RR, is considered to have great potential in producing formate, yet hindered in low current density and selectivity. Herein, we constructed an oxide-derived copper foam substrate (OD-Cu) to improve the electrocatalytic properties of Bi dendrites loaded on its surface. Bi electrodeposited on the OD-Cu (Bi/OD-Cu) grows as pinecone-like dendrites, exhibiting a high formate faradaic efficiency (FEformate) of 97.2% and a formate partial current density of ~24 mA·cm−2 at −0.97 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in an H-cell. Notably, the Bi/OD-Cu electrode demonstrates an FEformate of 95.8% at −0.97 V vs. RHE and a total current density close to 90 mA·cm−2 at −1.17 V vs. RHE in a neutral flow cell. The experimental studies reveal that the remarkable CO2RR performance of the Bi/OD-Cu results from the electron transfer from Cu to Bi, which optimizes adsorption of the CO2•− and boosts reaction kinetics. This study emphasizes the crucial role of substrate engineering strategies in enhancing catalytic activity and shows the possibility for a porous metal electrode in advancing the industrialization of formate production.

Achieving high product selectivity at ampere‐level current densities is essential for the industrial application of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the operational stability of CO2 electrolyzers at large current density has long been hindered by flooding of gas diffusion layer (GDL). Herein, a new heteroarchitectural GDL is designed to overcome flooding. Such GDL is constructed by sequentially sputtering the conductive silver and titanium boride (TiB2) onto a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate. Assembled with Cu catalyst in a flow cell, a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 64.7% was achieved at a current density of 1.2 A cm−2 in 6 M KOH. Furthermore, the GDL is capable of stable operation for over 40 hours at 400 mA cm−2. Theoretical calculations and in‐situ experiments demonstrate enhanced intermediates adsorption on the TiB2‐supported Cu surface, thereby reducing the energy barrier for C‐C coupling. When coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2% for ethylene and 85.4% for 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid were achieved at 1.2 A cm−2. This work provides a highly stable GDL for efficient CO2 conversion at ampere‐level current density and paves the way for integrating biomolecules conversion in stack‐level devices.

This study assesses the environmental efficiences of specialized milk farms across the European Union (EU) countries, with a focus on CO2 emissions reduction. Using Tone's model under the assumption of generalized returns to scale, the analysis reveals an average environmental efficiency score of 0.599. Countries like Malta, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands have achieved full environmental efficiency, exemplifying optimal environmental performance. In contrast, countries such as Slovakia and Estonia demonstrate lower efficiency, suggesting significant opportunities for emission reductions. Czechia, Bulgaria, and Estonia show environmental efficiency levels ranging from 0.24 to 0.30. In contrast, Finland, Portugal, Romania, Lithuania, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, and Slovenia have achieved efficiency levels that fall between the average of 0.30 and a value of 0.599. The study highlights that higher populated and higher-income countries tend to exhibit higher environmental efficiency. The findings suggest that to improve environmental efficiency, milk production should be concentrated in larger farms, with an emphasis on sustainable agricultural practices, advanced technologies, and efficient resource management. Furthermore, the study recommends targeted policies and strategies to enhance environmental efficiency, particularly in countries with lower population densities and incomes. These strategies include transitioning to pasture-grazing systems, improving nitrogen use efficiency, enhancing animal welfare, and investing in advanced farming technologies. The study underscores the importance of integrating environmental considerations into broader agricultural policies to achieve sustainability in the specialized milk farms of the EU.

In this study, a performance comparison experiment with a vortex exhaust installed at the end of a ventilation device to enhance the effect induced by reducing indoor pollutants was conducted. The experiment was carried out by constructing a mock-up room with a limited indoor environment, and performances were compared based on the following two tests. First, to confirm the effect of pollutant reduction, the wind speed was measured based on the distance from each exhaust system to verify the depth and speed at which wind can flow. Pollutants were induced to the vortex exhaust, general exhaust gasses were generated, and their performances were compared. Second, Arizona dust was used to confirm the performance with regard to the removal of pollutants which existed in particulate form (PM 10), and for CO2 gas, a representative gaseous pollutant was used as a reference. Based on the results, it was confirmed that installing a vortex exhaust system can allow for the generation of wind speeds that allow propagation at greater depths (>110 mm) compared to cases in which general exhaust is used; accordingly, exhaust performance can be achieved at increased depths. In addition, the experiment confirmed that vortex exhaust can improve the efficiency of simultaneous removal of PM 10 and CO2 compared with general exhaust. Further, it was shown that installing a vortex exhaust system can remove PM 10 and CO2 farther from the exhaust port in a shorter period than a general exhaust port. In addition, it was inferred that vortex exhaust can be utilized to prevent indoor pollutants and diseases in combination with the latest technology.

Reactions of 1,2-dimagnesioethane compound [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-C2H4)] (TCHPNON = 4,5-bis(2,4,6-tricyclohexylanilido)-2,7-diethyl-9,9-dimethyl-xanthene), formed by the two-electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N2, viz. [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)], with CO and CO2 have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross-coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-O2C4H4)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-O2C4H4)(THF)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-C2H4)] with CO2 led to insertion of CO2 into both Mg‒C bonds and all Mg‒N bonds of the 1,2-dimagnesioethane species, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg}2(-O4C4H4)], in which the diamide ligands of the starting material have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reactions can be viewed as involving the “masked-magnesium(I)” induced cross-coupling of ethene with either CO or CO2, to give more complex organic products. Reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to insertion of CO2 into all Mg‒N bonds of the magnesium-dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg}2(-O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this dissociates to monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(-O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2. In contrast, C‒C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] with a CO2 analogue, i.e. the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed intermediate containing a reduced carbodiimide radical fragment, gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]∞. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(-H)}2] (formed by activation of H2 with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)]), gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON-CO2)Mg}(-O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into only one Mg‒N bond of each TCHPNON ligand. All of the above-mentioned reactions reveal the capacity of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross-coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C2H4, CO, CO2 and H2, to give value-added organic fragments.

Low‐cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)‐etching and in situ growth of metal‐organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron‐sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST‐n (POM = PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero‐interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226 µmol g‐1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010 µmol g‐1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02 µmol g‐1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu‐MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1< x ≤2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron‐sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface‐coating metal‐organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the ternary composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60 h without noticeable activity loss.

This study investigates the application of pipe freeze crystallization (PFC) as a sustainable, zero-waste technology for treating high-salinity industrial wastewater, enabling the simultaneous recovery of salts and clean water. PFC addresses the limitations of traditional brine treatment methods such as evaporation ponds and distillation, which are energy-intensive, produce concentrated brine requiring disposal, and emit significant CO2. A pilot demonstration plant in Olifantsfontein, South Africa, served as the basis for this research. The plant operates at an energy consumption rate of 330 kJ/kg, significantly lower than distillation’s 2200 kJ/kg. It efficiently recovers high-purity Na2SO4 and clean ice, which can be reused as water, with plans underway to incorporate NaCl recovery. Comparative analyses highlight PFC’s energy efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, achieving an 82% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to evaporation-based methods. This study evaluates the operational parameters and scalability of PFC for broader industrial applications. X-ray Diffraction analysis confirmed that the Na2SO4 recovered from the pilot plant achieved a purity level of 84.9%, demonstrating the process’s capability to produce valuable, market-ready by-products. These findings reinforce PFC’s potential as a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional methods. PFC offers a transformative solution for managing saline effluents, aligning with zero-waste objectives and contributing to reduced environmental impact. This technology provides industries with an economically viable solution for resource recovery while supporting compliance with stringent environmental regulations.

Data centers are poised for unprecedented growth due to a revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI), rise in cryptocurrency mining, and increasing cloud demand for data storage. A sizable portion of the data centers’ growth will occur in the US, requiring a tremendous amount of power. Our hypothesis is that the expansion of data centers will contribute to an increase in US CO 2 emissions. To estimate CO 2 emissions, we applied three forecasted power demands for data centers and applied 56 NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) power mixes and policy scenario cases using 11 AI models. Among these, the linear regression model yielded the most accurate predictions with the highest R-square. We found that overall CO 2 emissions in the US could increase up to 0.4–1.9% due to expansion of data centers by 2030. This increase represents ~3–14% of CO 2 emissions from the US power sector by 2030. Using the state-level power mix forecasts for 2030 among increasing CO 2 emission scenarios, we predict that Virginia’s power mix will maintain emissions in line with the US average, while the Texas, Illinois, and Washington’s power mix are expected to reduce emissions due to greater renewables in their power mix in 2030. However, Illinois and Washington may face challenges due to their limited power resource availability. In contrast, New York and California’s power mix may increase CO 2 emissions due to higher natural gas in their power mix in 2030. The highest variability in data center CO 2 emissions stems from AI-driven demand and improvements in data center efficiency and is followed by the power mix. To reduce CO 2 emissions from data centers, we offer pathways such as reducing power consumption, improving power mix with renewable sources, and using hydrogen in power plants. We propose focusing on New Mexico and Colorado for data centers to minimize CO 2 emissions. Finally, we highlight a set of federal policies supplemented by states to facilitate CO 2 emission reductions across energy, emissions, waste, R&amp;D, and grid infrastructure.

Abstract The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is required to convert CO2 into useful commodity chemicals with renewable energy thereby reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. We report significantly enhanced CRR activity by incorporating the s-donating, e- reservoir ligand Imdye (1-imidazole-2,4,6-tri(carbazol-9-yl)-3,5-dicyanobenzene) within the complex fac-[MnI(bpy)(CO)3(Imdye)]+ (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine). The reduction potentials of Imdye, MnI/0, and CO2 to CO are close, allowing the active catalyst [Mn0(bpy)(CO)2(Imdye-)]- to provide 2e- to CO2 at small overpotentials. This system reduces CO2 to CO with bulk turnover numbers up to 830 very near the CRR reduction potential. This CRR activity arose from Imdye promoting the CRR at small overpotentials, and from utilizing the electrooxidation of CH3OH/H2O to CO2, 6H+ and 6e- at the Pt counter electrode, neutralizing pH changes from the CRR. These strategies will apply to most CRR electrocatalytic systems.

When large surface areas of the Earth are altered, radiative forcing due to changes in surface reflectance can drive climate change. Yet to achieve the necessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters to have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo modification (SAM) can easily overwhelm the reduction in radiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 due to ERW or mCDR over timescales of decades. SAM via ERW can be either cooling or warming. We identify some of the many questions raised by radiative forcing due to these forms of CDR.

Blue Carbon ecosystems, which include all tidal wetlands, mitigate climate change by capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Most carbon fixation in these systems is thought to be driven by plant and microbial photosynthesis, whereas chemosynthetic processes are assumed to play a minor role. However, these ecosystems often contain anoxic environments ideal for chemosynthetic microbes such as acetogens. Here, we show that acetogens are abundant and active mediators of carbon sequestration in tidal wetland soils by pairing gene- and genome-resolved metagenomic analysis with isolation and analysis of gas-fermenting acetogens in bioreactors. Metagenomic profiling revealed that diverse microbes can mediate carbon fixation, primarily through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and Wood-Ljungdahl pathways. These include various bacteria and archaea capable of reductive acetogenesis. On this basis, we grew bacterial enrichment cultures from tidal wetland soils using the gases hydrogen and CO2 as the sole energy and carbon sources. Bioreactor analysis revealed that these enrichments are dominated by clostridial acetogens that grow rapidly by converting CO2 into acetate and other products. Collectively, these results reveal Blue Carbon ecosystems harbour communities that can exclusively subsist by using CO2 as their sole electron acceptor and for carbon fixation, thereby providing evidence of a novel carbon sink pathway within these ecosystems beyond the known mechanisms of photosynthetic carbon fixation and soil sequestration. Additionally, the discovery and isolation of these chemosynthetic communities provide opportunities for developing further mechanisms of CO2 removal through industrial gas fermentation.

The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is one of the most promising ways to valorise CO2 as a source of carbon. The development of novel, efficient and scalable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction in electrolysers is still a big challenge. This paper reports on the preparation of sustainable, efficient, and stable gas diffusion electrodes utilizing silver as catalyst for the CO2 electroreduction to CO. The catalyst is prepared by sputter deposition and subsequent surface modification by oxygen plasma. It is uniformly deposited as a thin layer on the hydrophobic porous structure of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), minimizing the amount of silver required and simultaneously addressing the problem of substrate flooding by the electrolyte. This leads to a synergetic, beneficial impact on the CO2RR, as evaluated in a flow reactor with gas-fed CO2. The optimized gas diffusion electrodes, with high porosity and electrochemical surface area, show high activity at low overpotentials, faradaic efficiency for CO over 90% and stability tested over periods up to 24 hours. This approach allows for high performance using a minimal amount of metal, while exploiting the processing advantages of sputtering as an industrial state-of-the-art, high-throughput technique.

Policy interventions and technological advances are mitigating emissions of air pollutants from motor vehicles. As a result, vehicle fleets are expected to progressively combust fuel more efficiently, with a declining ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide (CO/CO2) in their emissions. We assess trends in traffic combustion efficiency in Los Angeles (LA) and Salt Lake City (SLC) by measuring changes in summertime on-road CO/CO2 between 2013 and 2021 using mobile observations. Our data show a reduction in CO/CO2 in LA, indicating an improvement in combustion efficiency that likely resulted from stringent regulation of CO emissions. In contrast, we observed an increase in CO/CO2 values in SLC. While slower progress in SLC compared to LA may be partially due to a later adoption of vehicle emission regulations in Utah compared to California, differing driving conditions and fleet composition may also be playing a role. This is evidenced by increased CO/CO2 in LA during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to faster driving speeds and changes to the fleet composition. Our results demonstrate the success of California's CO-reducing policy interventions and illustrate the impacts of traffic characteristics on vehicle combustion efficiency and air pollutant emissions.

To promote the practical application of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), it is important to reduce the monitoring costs after the completion of injection and to increase social acceptance, and CO2 mineralization is thought to contribute to both. In particular, the use of basalt as a reservoir could be a solution not only to promote CO2 mineralization, but also to expand its storage potential. On the other hand, enhanced weathering as a negative emission technology is expected to be one of the local CO2 reduction measures using basalt. To evaluate the applicability of Japanese basalts for CO2 storage and enhanced weathering, geological surveys and rock sampling were conducted at outcrops of basalt volcanoes that were formed on the seafloor in the past and subsequently exposed at the surface, as well as relatively new onshore basalt volcanoes. Comparison of basalt properties by region revealed that basalt with the excellent injectivity essential for storage is limited, and that an evaluation of the entire rock mass over a wider area is necessary. In contrast, with respect to mineralization potential, the results suggest that the rate of leaching of ions, which are the raw materials for carbonate minerals, is more important than the absolute amount of these ions, in the short term.

Abstract The combined effect of the operating pressure and supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) injection level on structure development during puffing of milk protein concentrate by supercritical fluid extrusion was studied. The extrudates were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, texture analyzer, and electrophoresis. Extrudates obtained with SC-CO2 injection rate corresponding to the equilibrium solubility demonstrated a highly porous structure (mean pore size &lt; 500 μm, mean pore wall thickness &lt; 40 μm). In contrast, both undersaturated and oversaturated conditions formed extrudates having fewer large irregular pores (mean pore size &gt; 700 μm, mean pore wall thickness &gt; 80 μm). Reduction in interfacial tension with increasing CO2 concentration favored homogeneous nucleation up to saturation CO2 levels, resulting in uniformly porous extrudates. SC-CO2 input rate above the saturation levels resulted in undissolved gas vacuoles in the melt, allowing dissolved CO2 to diffuse into them at die exit, favoring coalescence. These findings could have significant utility in designing novel milk protein-based puffed products of predefined structural and physicochemical properties.

Besides the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the reduction of aviation's climate impact requires the mitigation of its other forcing effects, most importantly the avoidance of warming condensation trails (contrails). From current understanding a decrease of both, soot and water vapor emissions from aircraft engines yields a reduced occurrence and persistence of contrails and contrail cirrus, reducing their radiative forcing. The WaterEnhanced Turbofan (WET) for instance is one concept that achieves both effects through water recovery from the engine exhaust and particle washout. In this first set of simplified sensitivity studies applying the established Contrail Cirrus Prediction (CoCiP) tool, we simulate and assess the impact of potential soot number and water vapor emission reductions on contrail radiative effect and optical properties in an application scenario in Europe. We find a non-linear impact of the soot particle reduction, which is strongest if soot number concentration is reduced by more than one order of magnitude compared to current engines. For water vapor, a large impact on contrail radiative effect is achieved by a reduction of one order of magnitude. Both effects can be combined almost independently. Therefore, we expect a significant decrease in contrail radiative effect if WET-like technologies were applied to a broad fleet. Nevertheless, other contrail nucleation pathways like condensation on volatile particles have not been considered in this study.

Rice serves as a crucial staple food for nearly half of the world's population. However, rice paddies contribute remarkably to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Prior studies often showed a trade-off between reducing GHG emissions and impairing rice yield. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing modulating probiotics to develop a win-win strategy for enhancing rice yields while reducing GHG emissions. Three paired plots of rice paddies were used in the field experiment during the spring growing season (from February to July 2022). Each pair of plots was divided into control and probiotic addition paddies to investigate the effects of modulating probiotic treatment on GHG emissions using the whole-plant chambers. Our results revealed notable reductions in GHG emissions and increases in rice yield with the probiotic treatment relative to the control. The probiotic treatment resulted in a 47.58% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a 21.53% reduction in methane (CH4) emissions, and an impressive 88.50% reduction in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions over the growing season. We also observed a 27.75% increase in rice yield with the probiotic treatment. These findings suggest that employing modulating probiotics has the potential to pave the way for mutually beneficial outcomes, enhancing rice productivity while mitigating the GHG emissions associated with rice cultivation.

Understanding the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in influencing global temperature is essential to the contemporary debate about anthropogenic global warming. Human activities releasing greenhouse gases are identified as dominant contributors to the observed climate change, including global warming and its acceleration. The consequences for humanity are predicted to be severe. Therefore, to mitigate global warming, significant efforts are being devoted to reducing CO2 emissions and stabilizing (or even reducing) atmospheric CO2 concentration. Various countries are taking measures to curtail the utilization of fossil fuels, i.e., coal, oil products, and natural gas, with the intent of transforming the transportation, heating, and energy sectors. This enormous endeavor of 'decarbonization' comes with substantial costs, running into trillions of USD in Western countries alone. Fundamentally, the entirety of endeavors, actions, and outcomes hinges upon the central hypothesis stating that the increase of CO2 concentration from approximately 0.03% to more than 0.04% causes a noticeable temperature rise. Given the paramount significance of this hypothesis, the generally accepted rules of science would necessitate rigorous scrutiny for substantiation. Such substantiation is typically provided by experimental evidence. Yet, surprisingly according to the results of this research, exactly this essential experimental evidence supporting the central hypothesis seems to be lacking, not fully adhering to fundamental principles of scientific analysis. Consequently, robust experimental evidence must be presented to substantiate the hypothesis, as the failure to do so would necessitate a reassessment of the emphasis on CO2 emissions reduction as the primary solution to climate change. The discussion about this subject should be conducted objectively, fair, and open-mindedly, embracing diverse perspectives.

A good quantitative knowledge of regional sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle. It is also a key prerequisite for elaborating cost-effective national strategies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. However, available estimates of CO2 fluxes for many regions of the world remain uncertain, despite significant recent progress in the remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation and atmospheric CO2. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of inferring reliable regional estimates of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) retrieved from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) observations as constraints on parameters of the widely used Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration model (VPRM), which predicts ecosystem fluxes based on vegetation indices derived from multispectral satellite imagery. We developed a regional-scale inverse modeling system that applies a Bayesian variational optimization algorithm to optimize parameters of VPRM coupled to the CHIMERE chemistry transport model and which involves a preliminary transformation of the input XCO2 data that reduces the impact of the CHIMERE boundary conditions on inversion results. We investigated the potential of our inversion system by applying it to a European region (that includes, in particular, the EU countries and the UK) for the warm season (May–September) of 2021. The inversion of the OCO-2 observations resulted in a major (more than threefold) reduction of the prior uncertainty in the regional NEE estimate. The posterior NEE estimate agrees with independent estimates provided by the CarbonTracker Europe High-Resolution (CTE-HR) system and the ensemble of the v10 OCO-2 model intercomparison (MIP) global inversions. We also found that the inversion improves the agreement of our simulations of XCO2 with retrievals from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Our sensitivity test experiments using synthetic XCO2 data indicate that the posterior NEE estimate would remain reliable even if the actual regional CO2 fluxes drastically differed from their prior values. Furthermore, the posterior NEE estimate is found to be robust to strong biases and random uncertainties in the CHIMERE boundary conditions. Overall, this study suggests that our approach offers a reliable and relatively simple way to derive robust estimates of CO2 ecosystem fluxes from satellite XCO2 observations while enhancing the applicability of VPRM in regions where eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes are scarce.

Abstract Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas causing warming after carbon dioxide, and the emission reductions potentials are known to be limited due to the difficulty of abating agricultural methane. We explore in this study the emerging option of atmospheric methane removal (MR) that could complement carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in mitigation pathways. MR is technologically very challenging and potentially very expensive, so the main question is at which cost per ton of methane removed is MR more cost effective than CDR. To address this question, we use an intertemporal optimization climate-GHG-energy model to evaluate the MR cost and removal potential thresholds that would allow us to meet a given climate target with the same or a lower abatement cost and allowing for equal or higher gross CO2 emissions than if CDR through BECCS were an option. We also compare the effects of MR and CDR on the cost-effective mitigation pathways achieving four different climate targets. Using the ACC2-GET integrated carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, climate and energy system model, we consider a generic MR technology characterized by a given unit cost and a maximal removal potential. We show that to totally replace bioenergy based CDR with MR, the MR potential should reach at least 180 to 290 MtCH4 per year, i.e., between 50% and 90% of current anthropogenic methane emissions, with maximum unit cost between 11,000 and 69,000 $/tCH4, depending on the climate target. Finally, we found that replacing CDR by MR reshapes the intergenerational distribution of climate mitigation efforts by delaying further the mitigation burden.

The present study investigates the impact of bulk viscosity on the complex flow dynamics past a rotating cylinder, with particular emphasis on compressible and non-equilibrium effects that emerge in nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). By solving unsteady conservation laws obtained from the Boltzmann–Curtiss transport equation, the research focuses on key flow features such as vortex shedding, vorticity generation, enstrophy, kinetic energy dissipation, and the degree of thermal non-equilibrium. Numerical simulations are performed at a Mach number of 0.6 using the dbnsTurbFoam solver with unstructured meshes, and the computational model is verified using available data for flow past a rotating cylinder. The results reveal that bulk viscosity significantly affects vortex shedding, particularly suppressing vortex formation and reducing flow instability. In CO2, high bulk viscosity nearly eliminates vortex shedding, leading to a laminar wake, while in N2, vortex shedding is dampened but persists. Enstrophy and vorticity production through stretching and baroclinic effects are also reduced in both gases as bulk viscosity increases, with CO2 showing more dramatic reductions due to its higher inherent viscosity. The study further indicates that bulk viscosity enhances kinetic energy dissipation in both gases, with N2 exhibiting sharper dissipation than CO2. Additionally, the role of rotational speed is explored, showing that higher rotational speeds amplify vorticity production and energy dissipation. While high-speed rotation induces more turbulence and instability in N2, it stabilizes the flow in CO2, leading to a more organized wake. The findings demonstrate that bulk viscosity and rotational speed are crucial in controlling flow stability and energy dissipation, with significant variations depending on the gas properties.

This study focuses on the use of advanced neural network methods to predict the transient behavior of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes in the presence of disturbances in gas separation/purification units, specifically targeting the upgrading of biogas by separating methane (CH4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) utilizing carbon molecular sieve (CMS) as the adsorbent. The cyclic nature of PSA, with its sequence of adsorption, depressurization, blowdown, purging, pressure equalization and repressurization steps, necessitates robust modeling techniques to achieve high purity rates. This paper emphasizes the development and validation of surrogate models based on NARX, LSTM and GRU neural networks that can replicate the PSA process with high fidelity, thus offering significant reductions in computational time compared to traditional methods. The study's findings indicate that LSTM networks provide the best balance of accuracy and speed, making them a viable tool for real-time optimization and control of PSA systems. In other words, while the pseudo-real plant's runtime surpasses 20 sec per cycle, creating difficulties for real-time optimization and control applications, the LSTM-based surrogate model can accurately predict the desired outputs for 900 cycles in just 0.63 sec, with an outstanding error magnitude of 1e-6, which is less than 0.004 % of the full-order model.

Sector-leading innovators in direct air capture (DAC), carbon dioxide (CO2) mineral storage, and CO2 conversion technologies have initiated collaborative efforts to establish the Ankeron Carbon Management Hub in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, a region which has significant renewable energy production and vast resources for geological storage in basalt formations via mineralization. The Hub aspires to realize the Department of Energy's Carbon Negative Shot target price for durable carbon removal of $100/tonne and deliver benefits to local communities.1,2 The Hub is focused on technological diversity and on the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG), which represents the lowest-hanging fruit for a first-of-a-kind commercial mineral storage project in the US. It has the potential to drastically alter the cost structure and risk profile of DAC and CO2 storage and conversion, while also unlocking the >10,000 gigaton (Gt) storage capacity of basalts in the United States (US). The Hub is also intended to support the net-zero emission goals of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, and deliver benefits to local communities and citizens.The first phase of the project is a comprehensive two-year feasibility study, which will address scientific, technical, economic, and community-related concerns and requirements for a hub that will prove viable and deliver benefits for local communities. Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) will manage overall execution of the study. The study will be a first step toward conceptualizing, designing, planning, constructing, and operating a large-scale carbon management hub in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Project goals include: (1) validating the commercial scale-up potential of the proposed DAC, CO2 conversion, and CO2 mineralization technologies in the PNW region and demonstrating a viable pathway towards the Carbon Negative Shot goal of <$100/tonne of durable carbon dioxide removals by 2032; (2) preparing for infrastructure development for a sustainable build-out of a mineralization-based DAC hub in the PNW, with potential for expansion into a truly regional carbon management network; (3) determining what is required for forms of deployment that maximize climate impacts while minimizing land, water, and energy usage and other environmental impacts; and (4) developing a Hub that delivers the greatest benefits to PNW communities, minimizes negative impacts, invests in the American workforce, and advances diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) standards.The delivery of this feasibility study builds on the combined experience of Carbfix and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the only two entities worldwide that have successfully stored CO2 in basaltic rocks to date, as well as Carbfix's experience with DAC and storage integration and commercial operation in Iceland. Complementing this effort is a body of geological characterization work that will be carried out in Oregon as a part of the recently funded HERO Basalt CarbonSAFE Phase 2 Project. This work should facilitate an evidence-based, stakeholder-informed path to successful Class VI permitting.3The Ankeron Hub also brings together innovative and potentially game-changing DAC technologies developed by Heirloom, Removr, and Sustaera. These technologies have been validated at the lab/pilot scale to have reached Technology Readiness Level 5-8 and are powered by electricity only. This electricity-powered Hub will leverage the abundant renewable energy resources of Washington state and Oregon with further build-out and reduction in carbon intensity planned in the near future.Local communities are rightly focused on the long-term impacts of projects on the region's health, employment, resources, and infrastructure. Additionally, extreme weather conditions and high demand for natural resources, such as water, must be considered by technology developers. Early work to be performed in this study includes the creation of a community benefits plan, a development proposal, analysis and planning for regional Hub infrastructure siting, analysis of potential Hub governance models, development of a preliminary permitting workflow, and analysis of regional suitability for direct air capture, conversion, and storage technologies. Results to be shared include non-proprietary aspects of these analyses and valuable lessons learned to date that can be applied to other projects.

It is well known that there is a positive correlation between a high standard of living and access to affordable and reliable energy. Energy provides the foundation for human progress and economic opportunity. Continued access to an expanded energy supply is necessary to support a growing global population and to elevate a larger portion of that population towards an improved circumstance.Of equal importance is the concern that traditional energy production has exacerbated a climate and environmental crisis. Rising greenhouse gas emissions, in particular the increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), have reached a level that now requires immediate action. Ideally, there exists a portfolio of solutions that will allow energy delivery to continue alongside emissions reduction.Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UN IPCC) have stated that widespread deployment of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is required to achieve the emissions reductions targets outlined within the Paris Agreement. It is recognized that CCS technologies maintain a strategic role in the pursuit of a low carbon future. However, implementation of CCS projects has been slow, resulting in limited impact to date on global CO2 emissions.Urgent action is needed across all regions and sectors to achieve climate objectives. These ambitions require a significant and rapid increase in investment in CCS project development and ongoing technological innovation. To achieve this momentum, governments need to set enabling policy and regulatory frameworks that support a business case for broad adoption.To demonstrate effective CCS policy, GLJ will review multiple jurisdictions where CCS progress has already begun. Effective legal and regulatory regimes facilitate CCS activities, allowing for rapid technological evolution and decreasing cost structures. These can serve as examples for additional jurisdictions to craft documentation that provides clarity and certainty to create markets and to encourage private investment. Important information will be provided from Canada, the United States, Norway, and Indonesia. Topics to be considered will include: • Pore space ownership – who owns it and who can use it?• Liability – who is responsible for storage permanence and what does that mean?• Monitoring, Measurement, and Verification (MMV) – who designs, conducts and reports?• Taxes and incentives – who pays for it and who benefits from it?Even in jurisdictions that have made substantial regulatory progress, there still remain gaps to fill and enhancements to consider. GLJ will reflect on several key topics that continue to challenge the durability of CCS frameworks and the collaborative action that large scale industrial development requires:• Transboundary portability of CO2 and carbon credits – if emissions reduction is a global issue, why do intra-national and international borders get in the way of project development?• Contract for differences – what is it and is it a good thing?• Environmental Justice and Equity Considerations – how does early engagement impact permitting timelines?GLJ reviewed the CCS policy and legal landscapes of these and other jurisdictions to develop recommendations regarding enabling regulations in support of widespread and rapid CCS deployment across the globe. Additionally, an evaluation such as this is done to inform stakeholders in an effort to build stakeholder confidence through assurance of a well-regulated industry. To achieve the scale needed for CCS to fulfil its intended role as a major global emissions abatement opportunity, governments, project proponents, and the global population must be aligned regarding the critical need for this proven emissions management tool. All must be involved in the discussion to take a very real and necessary step towards additional CCS project implementation.

A high-resolution carbon dioxide emission inventory is essential for accurate carbon emission assessment and management. This study used a top-down spatial proxy model to develop a high-resolution (1 km) carbon dioxide emission inventory for East Asia from 2012 to 2021. Combining multiple data sources with geographically weighted regressions can improve the accuracy of the spatial distribution of sectors within carbon dioxide inventories. To demonstrate accuracy, we compared our inventory with existing carbon dioxide inventories, such as the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China, which uses a 'bottom-up' approach. We outline and discuss the convergence and divergence in the estimation results of the different approaches, finding generally consistent results. Based on the high-resolution carbon dioxide grid, nationally, China accounted for over 80% of East Asia's carbon dioxide emissions, followed by Japan and South Korea. The results of the hotspot and driver analyses reveal persistent hotspots in Northern and Eastern China, as well as new trends in Northwestern China. The main drivers of emissions growth in hotspots are economic growth and changes in the energy mix. The drivers of emission changes in cold hotspot regions vary depending on regional characteristics. Actionable insights are provided for targeted regional carbon reduction strategies. Continued growth of carbon dioxide emissions occurred across Northern and Eastern China in the period 2012-2021, and a new growth hotspot emerged in Northwest China, according to a high-resolution top-down emissions inventory for East Asia.

Abstract In addition to steep carbon emission reductions, all modeled pathways to reach global climate goals require carbon removal. Marine carbon dioxide removal has the potential to play a large role in drawing down legacy anthropogenic emissions due to the scalability and durability of proposed methods. While this field is rapidly expanding, a number of issues remain, including efforts to grow the industry, align projects with equity and justice goals, and ensure development of trusted, unique, durable carbon credits. We, a group of early career ocean professionals (ECOPs), provide an overview of the scale of the field, the aforementioned issues, and then make recommendations to ensure global equity and expand early career capacity in the marine carbon dioxide removal sector. We argue that substantial investment is needed to reduce costs of marine carbon dioxide removal and spur innovation in monitoring, reporting, and verification, but also in the training and development of early career researchers. Careful co‐design of marine removal projects by experienced and emerging collaborators, including local communities, can help mitigate perpetuating existing global inequalities. Given the anticipated growth of the marine carbon dioxide removal workforce, ECOPs can contribute their existing interdisciplinary expertise, if they are supported within traditional structures. Those entering the field can leverage skill sets that intersect engineering, policy, community engagement, and business. We maintain that ECOPs will be key leaders in the field, if appropriately engaged, compensated, and empowered.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized as an essential technology for mitigating global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), and offers a viable pathway toward a low-carbon economy. Canada has emerged as a leader in CCS, with several operational projects and significant planned investments. However, public perception remains a persistent challenge, largely due to concerns about CO2 containment, as highlighted by incidents such as the historical Kerr complaints in Weyburn, Canada, where false leakage allegations led to extensive investigations.The success of CCS projects lies in the implementation of robust Measurement, Monitoring, and Verification (MMV) systems. Such systems ensure the safety and security of injected CO2. Surface MMV, specifically the comparison of surface soil gas emission patterns to pre-injection baselines, plays a key role in gaining public trust, as it provides insight into natural variability and demonstrates the ability to detect potential leaks. The Aquistore project is a state-of-the-art CCS science project in Saskatchewan, Canada, designed to test, among other things, the efficacy of MMV programs. The surface soil-gas MMV program at Aquistore uses mainly process-based indicators, including gas concentrations of CO2, oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), and the radiocarbon isotope CO2 (14CO2). Unlike other sites, these parameters were measured extensively in a pre-injection baseline study and subsequently monitored post-injection at regular bi-annual intervals.This paper examines the strengths and challenges of the process-based MMV approach while highlighting the role of adaptability over time, as demonstrated by the Aquistore experience. Since 2012, the surface soil-gas MMV program has evolved to address the changing project needs, integrating an adaptive sampling strategy that reduced resource demands while maintaining data integrity. Over a decade, a well-established baseline dataset, including pre-injection measurements, proved essential for accurate interpretation. Although no baseline geochemical surface soil-gas MMV research at this site has shown evidence of surface impacts due to CO2 injection, pre- and post-injection monitoring consistently identified old 14CO2 values. Initially, these 14CO2 signatures appeared to indicate fossil-sourced CO2 rising to the surface in parts of the monitoring area. However, further investigation revealed that these anomalous 14CO2 signatures predated injection and were linked to the microbial decomposition of weathered coal fragments from historic surface coal mining at the site. Without the extensive and adaptive baseline monitoring dataset, these findings could have been misinterpreted, emphasizing the significance of an MMV approach that evolves throughout the project lifecycle to enhance the reliability of CCS monitoring programs.Despite the effectiveness, the existing integrated process-based framework and adaptive baseline MMV approach pose challenges, including labor intensity, surface detection limitations, and reliance on pre-existing data. Basin analysis at Aquistore has shown no significant preferential pathways between the storage site and the surface. However, risk assessments identified the most probable CO2 migration path along the injection and monitoring wells due to potential well integrity issues. To address these challenges, a partial shift to a risk-based monitoring approach is proposed in this paper, incorporating modern continuous sensor and algorithm systems to monitor high-risk areas continuously and non-invasively, with a proportional reduction in process-based sampling. These advanced systems, which were unavailable during the initial design of the Aquistore MMV program, provide a more targeted and maintainable solution by combining CO2 and CH4 sensors with Lagrangian back-trajectory algorithms to detect anomalies, minimizing false positives through geochemical ratios and spatial matching.Findings from Aquistore underscore the importance of adaptive and continuous baseline monitoring to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpretation, such as those seen in previous leak allegations at the Weyburn site. Ultimately, a well-conceived baseline MMV framework is less costly than responding to seepage allegations, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive MMV in successful CCS deployment.

Reducing production-related carbon dioxide emissions is a crucial prerequisite for achieving the European goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. This study provides an overview of possible emissions by using a current vehicle and the corresponding expressions, as well as the options that need to be addressed. Since industry contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, the effect of manufacturing emissions on all stages of a vehicle's lifecycle is noticeable. Predictive maintenance is called "new oil," and the application of advanced analytics is considered the driving source of a fundamental change at the production site. In addition to the early prediction of defects and the reduction of downtime and lower repair costs, one possible application is dealing with increased demand for zero-emission vehicle production to gain carbon neutrality in manufacturing. This essay aims to address sustainable manufacturing practices regarding zero-emission vehicles. The focus of the research is placed on the car industry, but the presented research could be utilized as the basis of application in any common car production. Since vehicle manufacturing is more pollution-inclined than the vehicle's use, it is essential to find an energy source that will sustain this industry's growth and, at the same time, respect the environment and keep pollutants practically zero. This is why, in this essay, electric-powered vehicles are outlined to substitute cars powered by conventional internal combustion drives, as they do not consume liquids and do not emit CO2 or other harmful gases. In addition to the benefits in terms of the environment, they are cleaner and generally healthier for the people who use them and eco-friendly, which is the goal of the project from every perspective of modern society. The application of advanced analytics is suitable not merely for energy development or sustainability; precisely, the intelligence could also be used in the production of systems. However, if power is a kind of energy, this paper will focus on its application in aspects of car industry production. The overall aim can be defined as an analysis of the benefits and downsides of using predictive analytics to improve the environmental aspects of the production domain by providing cleaner cars. The importance of corresponding illustrations is emphasized, and the essay ends with the connection between the importance of the industry's contribution from an environmental point of view and the necessity for sustainability aspects.

Climate issues significantly impact people’s lives, prompting governments worldwide to implement energy-saving and emission-reducing measures. However, many areas lack carbon emission data at the lower administrative divisions. Additionally, the inconsistency in the standards, scope, and accuracy of carbon dioxide emission statistics across different regions makes mapping carbon dioxide spatial patterns complex. Nighttime light (NTL) data combined with land use data enable the detailed spatial and temporal disaggregation of carbon emission data at a finer administrative level, facilitating scientifically informed policy formulation by the government. Differentiating carbon emission data by sector will help us further identify the carbon emission efficiency in different sectors and help environmental regulators implement the most cost-effective emission-reduction strategy. This study uses integrated remote-sensing data to estimate carbon emissions from fossil fuels (CEFs). Experimental results indicate (1) that the regional CEF can be calculated by combining NTL and Landuse data and has a good fit; (2) the high-intensity CEF area is mainly concentrated in Shanghai and its surrounding areas, showing a concentric circle structure; (3) there are obvious differences in the spatial distribution characteristics of carbon emissions among different departments; (4) hot spot analysis reveals a three-tiered distribution in the Yangtze River Delta, increasing from the west to the east with distinct spatial characteristics.

Climate change and global warming demand immediate action, and a global carbon trading system can help by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon credits allow companies to emit a defined amount of carbon dioxide, with each credit typically equaling one ton. Although these credits incentivize emissions reduction, current systems lack transparency, face high transaction costs, and benefit intermediaries. Our project proposes a blockchain-based Carbon Credit Ecosystem that uses blockchain and smart contracts to create a more transparent, accessible, and efficient carbon market. This system will tokenize carbon credits, establish protocols for credit creation and retirement, and transparently manage trading. Engaging stakeholders like the energy sector, project verifiers, NGOs, citizens, and governments, our model provides broad benefits and is adaptable to other credit and trading systems.

Wind and solar generation constitute an increasing share of electricity supply globally. We find that this leas to shifts in the operational dynamics of thermal power plants. Using fixed effects panel regression across seven major U.S. balancing authorities, we analyze the impact of renewable generation on coal, natural gas combined cycle plants, and natural gas combustion turbines. Wind generation consistently displaces thermal output, while effects from solar vary significantly by region, achieving substantial displacement in areas with high solar penetration such as the California Independent System Operator but limited impacts in coal reliant grids such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator. Renewable energy sources effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions in regions with flexible thermal plants, achieving displacement effectiveness as high as one hundred and two percent in the California Independent System Operator and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. However, in coal heavy areas such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland Interconnection, inefficiencies from ramping and cycling reduce carbon dioxide displacement to as low as seventeen percent and often lead to elevated nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions. These findings underscore the critical role of grid design, fuel mix, and operational flexibility in shaping the emissions benefits of renewables. Targeted interventions, including retrofitting high emitting plants and deploying energy storage, are essential to maximize emissions reductions and support the decarbonization of electricity systems.

This study explores the cobenefits of reduced nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter (PM), through net zero (NZ) climate policy in the UK. Two alternative NZ scenarios, the balanced net zero (BNZP) and widespread innovation (WI) pathways, from the UK Climate Change Committee's Sixth Carbon Budget, were examined using a chemical transport model (CTM). Under the UK existing policy, Business as Usual (BAU), reductions in NO2 and PM were predicted by 2030 due to new vehicle technologies but plateau by 2040. The BNZP and WI scenarios show further reductions particularly by 2040, driven by accelerated electric vehicle (EV) uptake and low-carbon heating in buildings, with the building contribution to PM reduction being 2–3 times greater than road transport. The results demonstrate that the NZ transition to EVs (cars and vans) reduces both exhaust and nonexhaust emissions, as well as reducing traffic volumes. O3 trends are complex with a small overall increase by 2030 and a decrease by 2040. Although uncertain, 2050 predictions of BNZP showed important additional air pollution benefits. Our findings highlight the efficacy of NZ strategies, providing insights for UK and international policymakers interested in the air pollution cobenefits of climate policy.

ABSTRACT As urban areas expand, energy demands are escalating, necessitating the development of urban energy systems (UES) to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction goals. Although small‐scale regional integrated energy supply technologies have reached a level of maturity, urban‐scale integrated energy supply solutions are still in development. In response, this study introduces an architecture for the UES and an economic and low‐carbon operation strategy. The approach begins by constructing a highly reliable and robust integrated energy system (IES) within each independent region to accommodate a variety of energy needs, followed by the establishment of an operational architecture for large‐scale urban energy systems. The study then examines the energy flow and the mathematical model of multiple energies within urban energy systems, simplifying the complex model for practical application. Subsequently, a multiobjective optimization model is developed to facilitate the large‐scale consumption of clean energy, with considerations for economic and low‐carbon operations, and is formatted into a linear programming model. The model's accuracy is empirically tested through numerical simulation in a city divided into three regions. The simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in clean energy consumption, a reduction in carbon emissions, and a decrease in operational costs. Specifically, the proposed strategy can boost the clean energy consumption rate to 96.41%, cut operational costs by up to 50.13%, and lower carbon dioxide emissions by up to 57.59% compared to traditional technologies. These findings robustly validate the methodology's effectiveness, paving the way for more sustainable urban energy management practices.

With the increasing concern about global warming and future climate change, attention has been drawn to the need to reduce building energy use through improving buildings’ energy efficiency. Existing residential buildings constitute the largest percentage of energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions, and hence, offer significant potential for energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This review aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of current research on improving the energy efficiency of existing residential buildings in Libya and neighbouring Mediterranean countries, with a focus on research methods and tools utilised in this domain. This helped to identify potential areas of intervention to improve the energy efficiency of existing residential stock in Libya. Under identified themes, this study systematically analysed 44 publications of high relevance to the subject area found in Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The results reveal that while energy retrofitting is a research area of interest in the region considered, studies in the Libyan context are limited. There is also limited attention to achieving net zero energy and embodied carbon reductions, specifically in the Libyan context. Moreover, some weaknesses were identified for most of the studies reviewed, including those in the Libyan context, related to the credibility and reliability of the energy models used in the various literature.

Power-to-X (P2X) pathways represent alternative storage technologies for utilization of surplus electricity from renewable energy sources (RES) and for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. These P2X pathways can be used to convert renewable surplus electricity and carbon dioxide from various sources into valuable products such as synthetic fuels and chemicals. Significant progress has been made in these processes towards replacement of conventional fossil fuel-based technologies in the recent years. In this paper the development of these novel technologies is reviewed, having a focus especially on the techno-economic analysis. Key performance indicators such as plant efficiency and production cost are discussed. Finally, knowledge gaps and future research outlook of P2X are highlighted.

Concrete stands as the world's second most widely used material, valued for its abundance, affordability, durability, versatility, and resilience—a crucial asset for both developed and emerging economies. In 2022, the cement industry made a significant contribution, releasing 2.4 GtCO₂, equivalent to 6.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the current concrete production rate at 14 billion m³ and the projected demand expected to reach 20 billion m³ by 2050, gaining a thorough understanding of concrete's carbon footprint is increasingly imperative.This study aims to determine the conditions required for concrete to achieve a net-negative emissions footprint throughout its entire cradle-to-grave life cycle. Taking a comprehensive approach, we explore the often-overlooked natural carbonation of concrete during its use and end-of-life stages. Our investigation encompasses three distinct carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) pathways: carbonation curing, carbon injection, and enhanced mineralization. Each pathway plays a unique role in reducing carbon footprint.In the case of carbon injection, reducing the cement content through enhanced compressive strength results in a decreased initial cement content in the mix, while also enabling concrete to uptake a minimal amount of carbon dioxide during its manufacturing stage. Enhanced mineralization involves substituting cement with other minerals like wollastonite to achieve the necessary strength and applying a cement substitution credit to assess the impact on carbon footprint reduction. Lastly, carbonation curing taps into the carbon uptake potential of concrete by utilizing existing carbon dioxide reactants in concrete. All these pathways have the potential to influence the natural carbon absorption by concrete, particularly during its service life and end-of-life stages, aspects often neglected in other studies.These pathways involve energy-intensive processes, such as the pre-treatment of minerals or carbonation curing of concrete, which counteract the goal of reducing the carbon footprint, while also avoiding other carbon-intensive processes often present in the life cycle of concrete such as steam curing. Recognizing the relevance of electricity grid carbon intensity in this context, we incorporate a sensitivity analysis. By evaluating results across various electricity grid scenarios with differing carbon intensities, we aim to assess the carbon footprint and viability of each pathway under different background conditions. This analysis looks to uncover the robustness of results in settings marked by both low and high levels of grid decarbonization, in addition to the baseline scenario. Our findings promise valuable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders navigating the complex landscape of sustainable concrete production. Also, for the carbonation curing pathway, as it is usually regarded as a method that increases the durability of concrete, we investigate the impact of changes in the service life of concrete.Business-as-usual and concrete produced via these pathways are investigated to uncover the service life carbon uptake and its changes due to the implementation of these pathways. Moreover, concrete's end-of-life carbon uptake, often ignored, is evaluated alongside its intrinsic carbon footprint to uncover the impact of the recycling rate on the reduction of concrete's total carbon footprint.In conclusion, concrete's paramount role in global construction demands a nuanced examination of its environmental impact. This study aims not only to identify pathways toward achieving a net-negative emissions footprint but also to shed light on the intricate interplay between innovative carbon capture methods and the inherent carbon sequestration capabilities of concrete. Through meticulous analysis and consideration of diverse scenarios, we aim to contribute valuable knowledge to the ongoing dialogue surrounding environmentally conscious concrete production.

Our reduction target is fossil fuel origin CO2 in exhaust gas from asphalt mixing plants. We have examined two methods (wet mineralization and direct mineralization) using recycled crusher-run (RC) in CO2 fixation. Wet mineralization has an advantage of creating pure CaCO3 but water extraction process to obtain Ca from RC needs much water and re-dry process of RC before selling. Compared to wet mineralization, direct mineralization seemed to be cost effective for CO2 reduction at asphalt plant. CO2 directly fixed on RC will be stored in the ground as roadbed material for a long period of time and contribute to reduce emission of CO2 to the atmosphere.

Objective Ecosystem services are the link between ecosystems and social systems. While effectively coordinating regional ecological, social and economic needs and promoting carbon sequestration and emission reduction, ecosystem services can be transmitted to surrounding areas to boost regional ecological space optimization. Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, clarifying the positive impact of ecosystem services on net carbon sink efficiency in metropolitan areas and the spillover effect of ecosystem services can effectively contribute to regional ecosystem service enhancement, and realize efficient carbon sequestration and reduction in ecological space. Methods Supported by multi-source panel data spanning the period from 2010 to 2020, this research takes the Shanghai Metropolitan Area as the research object and divides the research area into 40 research units. Based on the multiple benefits of ecosystem services in synergistically promoting urban sink enhancement and emission reduction, this research constructs a net carbon sink efficiency indicator system. Then, utilizing the undesirable slacks-based measurement (SBM) model, the research evaluates the net carbon sink efficiency of each unit during the period from 2010 to 2020, and further explores the distributional characteristics and spatial-temporal changes of carbon sinks, carbon emissions, and net carbon sink efficiency from the geospatial perspective. In combination with the guiding content of spatial synergistic planning for the Shanghai Metropolitan Area, four important ecosystem services, namely water retention, water purification, soil retention and biodiversity maintenance, are quantitatively characterized with the InVEST model. Subsequently, based on the spatial decomposition effects (direct, indirect and total effects) obtained with spatial econometric model, the influencing mechanisms of ecosystem services and their interrelationship on the net carbon sink efficiency of 40 research units are analyzed. In addition, the spatial spillover effects of ecosystem services are innovatively revealed according to ecosystem service flow conduction mechanisms. Results Research results are summarized as follows. 1) During the 11 years from the 2010 to 2020, the growth of carbon dioxide emissions in the Shanghai Metropolitan Area gradually slowed down, while the net primary productivity of vegetation continued to increase, and the areas with high carbon emissions and high carbon sinks were partially overlapped; in addition, the net carbon sink efficiency of some core nodes, such as Shanghai City, maintained a steady improvement, effectively driving neighboring cities to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sinks; meanwhile, the areas with improved net carbon sink efficiency have some similar characteristics and can be divided into 2 types: areas with high production value, high carbon emissions, and high carbon sinks, and those with medium-high production value, low carbon emissions, and medium-high carbon sinks. 2) The four ecosystem services have significant spatial heterogeneity and relatively stable changes over the 11-year period, with the high values mainly distributed in the southwestern part of the area with high vegetation cover and the area around the Taihu Lake with concentrated water resources, while the low values mainly distributed in the concentrated urban construction areas and near the regional traffic arteries, and the total amount of the four ecosystem services has shown fluctuating characteristics. 3) Regarding the spatial decomposition effects of ecosystem services on net carbon sink efficiency, there are differences in the coefficients, directions and significance of the spatial effects of different ecosystem services. For the ecosystem service trade-off index and relationship index, the direct effects are significantly positive, while indirect effects significantly negative. Conclusion The research clarifies that water-related ecosystem services such as water retention and water purification services can significantly affect carbon reduction and sink enhancement in the Shanghai Metropolitan Area, and attention should be paid to water network system and its coupling effects with green and grey spaces, so as to further stimulate the ecological vitality of Jiangnan water vein. As there are differences in the spillover effects of different ecosystem services, it is necessary to differentiate the optimization and enhancement strategies for each type of ecological space and its ecosystem services according to local conditions, and the conservation of important ecological spaces in the metropolitan area should be continuously strengthened, followed by joint protection and control of ecological red lines in neighboring areas, so as to promote territorial spatial carbon reduction and sink enhancement activities, thus contributing to the steady improvement of the net carbon sink efficiency of the Shanghai Metropolitan Area in general. The research clearly demonstrates the positive effects of enhancing water-related ecosystem services and conserving important ecological spaces on regional carbon sinks and reduction, and effectively reveals an effective path for synergistic carbon reduction in the region, which may provide certain reference for improving territorial spatial management.

Abstract Solar‐driven carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) provides an opportunity to produce value‐added chemical feedstocks and fuels. However, achieving efficient and stable photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO 2 RR into selective products is challenging owing to the difficulties associated with the optical and the electrical configuration of PEC devices and electrocatalyst properties. Herein, we construct an efficient, concentrated sunlight‐driven CO 2 RR setup consisting of InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple‐junction cell as a photoanode and oxide‐derived Au (Ox‐Au) as a cathode to perform the unassisted PEC CO 2 RR. Under one‐sun illumination, a maximum operating current density of 11.5 mA cm –2 with an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ~98% is achieved for carbon monoxide (CO) production, leading to a solar‐to‐fuel conversion efficiency of ~15%. Under concentrated intensity of 10 sun, the photoanode records a maximum current density of ~124 mA cm –2 and maintains ~60% of FE for CO production. The results demonstrate crucial advancements in using III–V based photoanodes for concentrated PEC CO 2 RR.

The Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C requires drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the balancing of any remaining emissions by carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Due to uncertainties about the potential and durability of many land-based approaches to deliver sufficient CDR, marine CDR options are receiving more and more interest. We present the current state of knowledge regarding the potentials, risks, side effects as well as challenges associated with technical feasibility, governance, monitoring, reporting and accounting of marine CDR, covering a range of biotic and geochemical approaches. We specifically discuss to what extent a comparison with direct injection of CO 2 into seawater, which had been proposed decades ago and is now prohibited by international agreements, may provide guidance for evaluating some of the biotic marine CDR approaches.

Designing catalysts for the selective reduction of CO2, resulting in products having commercial value, is an important area of contemporary research. Several molecular catalysts have been reported to facilitate the reduction of CO2 (both electrochemical and photochemical) to yield 2e–/2H+ electron-reduced products, CO and HCOOH, and selective reduction of CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ is rare. This is partly because the factors that control the selectivity of CO2 reduction beyond 2e– are not yet understood. An iron chlorin complex with a pendent amine functionality in its second sphere, known to selectively catalyze CO2RR to HCOOH with a very low overpotential from its formal Fe(I) state, can catalyze CO2RR from its formal Fe(0) state by 6e–/6H+, forming CH3OH as a major product with a Faradaic yield of ∼50%. Mechanistic investigations using in situ spectro-electrochemistry indicate that the reactivity of a low-spin d7 FeI–COOH intermediate species generated during CO2RR is crucial in determining the product selectivity of this reaction. In weakly acidic conditions, C-protonation of this FeI–COOH species, which is also chemically prepared and spectroscopically characterized, leads to HCOOH. The O-protonation, leading to C–OH bond cleavage and eventually to CH3OH, is ∼3 kcal/mol higher in energy and can be achieved in more acidic solutions. Hydrogen bonding to the pendent amine in the catalyst stabilizes reactive intermediates formed in the CO2RR and enables 6e–/6H+ reduction of CO2 to CH3OH.

However, the milling of titanium alloys often encounters engineering challenges such as severe tool wear and suboptimal surface integrity. This study aims to enhance the milling machinability of titanium alloys though the application of optimized supercritical CO2 (scCO2) cooling and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) conditions. A finite element calculation model for milling titanium alloy under various cooling/lubrication conditions (CLCs) was developed. The instantaneous flow behaviors and heat transfer characteristics of the auxiliary medium were rigorously analyzed. Based on the milling experiments of titanium alloy, the effects of operating parameters and CLCs on the process parameters, surface integrity, and tool wear were systematically investigated. A coherent scheme for matching the energy field parameters with milling parameters to achieve the low-damage cutting of titanium alloys was developed. The results indicate that the implementation of scCO2-oil on water based on MQL (scCO2-OoWMQL) can productively address the issue of oil film rupture and insufficient wear reduction observed with the sole use of MQL or scCO2 cooling. Additionally, this composite technique significantly improved surface integrity of titanium alloy and ensures excellent preservation of the cutting-edge condition. The average resultant cutting force (Fr) and maximum cutting temperature (Tmax) increase with cutting speed (vc), feed per tooth (ft), and radial depth of cut (ae), whereas surface roughness (Sa) decreases with vc. Within the range of experimental parameters, the optimal combination of machining parameter was found to be vc=60 m/min, ft=0.09 mm/z, ae=0.3 mm, and ap=3 mm. When scCO2-OoWMQL is applied in conjunction with this combination, a significant reduction of 21.65% in Sa is achieved compared to dry cutting.

The European Union aims to become carbon-neutral by 2050 and to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The buildings sector accounts for about 40% of its total energy consumption and is responsible for 36% of the total CO2 emissions. For this reason, decarbonising the heat consumed in buildings is key to meeting these targets. CO2 emission reduction in buildings typically involves upgrading heating facilities to enable heat supply at lower temperatures, or renovating buildings, both of which can be challenging for end users. This paper analyses reducing emissions from residential buildings using high-temperature or hybrid heat pumps that can produce water at the same temperature as condensing boilers. This enables a significant reduction in emissions from buildings for owners who cannot afford or do not want to undertake a full renovation or upgrade of their current hydronic facility. The methodology followed makes use of a simplified hourly energy model based on ISO 52016-1:2017. The results indicate that, depending on the EU region, reducing CO2 emissions in buildings through these types of systems is feasible, leading to CO2 emission reductions of 40% to 70%.

Traditional CO2 reduction systems often fail in an alkaline environment due to the interaction of CO2 with a high-pH electrolyte, where carbonate and bicarbonate ion formation results in potassium-containing salt precipitation. The presence of the salt crystals causes a reduction in the selectivity of the electrolyzer toward CO2 conversion. Here, the critical operational variables, which elicit the salting out process, are investigated (i.e., ion transport). When the electrolyzer exceeds a critical current density, H2 evolution dominates CO2 reduction due to salt formation, which is confirmed by postmortem cross-sectional SEM-EDS of the electrode. The critical current density decreases with an increasing membrane thickness or anolyte ionic strength. Cathode salt formation is mediated by the unmitigated crossover of cations from the anolyte to the cathode across an anion exchange membrane, through which cations are imperfectly excluded. It is likely that electric field-driven migration promotes an increase in concentration of potassium across the membrane, until, at the critical current density for that electrolyzer arrangement, the concentration of potassium and bicarbonate ions exceeds the solubility limit of KHCO3, leading to salt precipitation.

Compounds featuring bonds between mercury and transition metals are of interest for their intriguing/ambiguous bonding and scarcely explored reactivities. We report herein the synthesis and reactivities of the new compound [(POCOP)Ni]2Hg, [Ni2Hg], featuring a trinuclear Ni–Hg–Ni core (POCOP = κP,κC,κP´‐2,6‐(i‐Pr2PO)2C6H3). [Ni2Hg] reacts with CO2 to give the carbonate‐bridged complex [Ni2CO3]. Bubbling CO gas through a solution of [Ni2CO3] gave its μ−CO2 analogue [Ni2CO2], which itself reacts with CO2 to give back [Ni2CO3], indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of [Ni2CO3] from [Ni2Hg] and CO2 constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO2 into CO32‐ and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO2 insertion to give [Ni2CO2], followed by another CO2 insertion to give the second intermediate [Ni2C2O4], and the latter’s decarbonylation to give [Ni2CO3]. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a μ−carbonyl‐carbonate rather than a μ−oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation. Reduction of [Ni2CO3] with excess Na/Hg regenerates [Ni2Hg], establishing that the observed deoxygenation of CO2 in this system can, in principle, be catalytic in the presence of excess reductant.

Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) has been developing an indoor CO2 capture technology using dry sorbents since 2021 to improve indoor air quality and reduce Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) costs in various commercial buildings. Buildings account for approximately 40% of the world's carbon emissions, with heating and cooling being the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions as they account for the largest portion of building energy consumption. By integrating an indoor CO2 capture unit with an Air Handling Unit (AHU), this technology can efficiently capture CO2 from air and minimize the ratio of outdoor air supply, thereby reducing heating and cooling energy in buildings. The indoor CO2 capture technology employs a cyclic sorption and desorption process on a dry sorbent material. Considering that buildings are inhabited by people, inorganic materials such as K2CO3 were chosen as the indoor CO2 capture materials. The principle of the CO2 capture with K2CO3-based sorbents is the reversible reaction between K2CO3, CO2 and water vapor to form KHCO3 in a thermal-swing process. We evaluated the performance of the dry sorbent material, manufactured in pellet form at a kilogram scale, using the following procedures: 1) measuring the cyclic CO2 sorption capacity based on four sorption-desorption cycles through Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA); 2) assessing the CO2 sorption rate using a fixed-bed reactor; and 3) investigating the feasibility of our proposed new ventilation scheme in connection with an 8 m3 chamber and a 15 CMH-scale indoor CO2 capture unit experimental setup. The K2CO3-based sorbents (KCSB) consist of K2CO3 as the sorption material, activated carbon and silica as support and bentonite as an inorganic binder. In the TGA test, it showed a CO2 sorption capacity of 13.3 wt.% and a CO2 sorption rate of 0.05 mmol/g/min. In the fixed-bed test at approximately a 20-gram scale, the CO2 sorption rate is shown at 0.07 mmol/g/min. The results confirm that the KCSB sorbents show remarkably superior sorption capacity and sorption rate under indoor low CO2 concentration conditions.To investigate the feasibility of an energy-efficient ventilation scheme with an indoor CO2 capture unit, a 15 CMH-scale indoor CO2 capture unit was developed and integrated with an 8 m3 chamber. The test procedure consisted of four steps: 1) maintaining the CO2 concentration in the chamber at approximately 1,000 ppm; 2) starting the CO2 capture unit installed in the return air stream; 3) minimizing outdoor air intake; and 4) stopping the CO2 capture unit and proceeding to the desorption mode when the CO2 concentration in the chamber exceeded 800 ppm. In the 3rd cycle sorption mode, it showed a CO2 sorption capacity of 7.5 wt.% and a 65% reduction in outdoor air intake. From these results, it was confirmed that the introduction of indoor CO2 capture unit can lead to a reduction in outdoor air intake. Through the reduction in outdoor air intake, it is possible to achieve energy savings in heating and cooling systems. We plan to develop a dry-sorbent indoor CO2 capture unit as a modular system to scale up by increasing the number of modules.

This study analyzed the effectiveness of CO2 storage in basalt by simulating carbon mineralization during the injection of a CO2 solution into basalt cores. Porosity changes were assessed by modeling carbonate precipitation and basalt dissolution based on geochemical reactions. The correlation between the porosity and permeability was examined using the power-law equation to calculate the change in pressure during injection. The simulation results were validated by comparing the experimental data acquired from the Cheorwon region with respect to carbonate precipitation, porosity, permeability, and pressure difference. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effects of CO2 solution type and mineral composition on carbon mineralization using basalt samples from Cheorwon and Jeju as well as sandstone sample. The modeling and simulation methods used in this study can be applied to analyze the carbon reduction and mineralization trapping of the CO2 stored in basalt formations.

The capture and utilization of CO2 are critical for protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable development of society. Given the challenges in separating multiple C1 products with similar reduction potentials, achieving high selectivity for a single reduction product while maintaining high conversion efficiency is essential. In this study, a photocatalyst with NH2-MIL-125-Ti/Cu dual-metal active sites was developed by introducing Cu2+ in situ. The synergistic interaction between oxygen vacancies that capture CO2 and the Cu-Ti dual active sites formed by Cu-C-O-Ti intermediates preferentially facilitated the generation of CO. As a result, high CO selectivity was achieved during the CO2 photoreduction process. The experimental results indicate that NM-Cu5 achieves nearly 100% selectivity for CO under visible-light irradiation, with a CO2-to-CO conversion rate of 598.22 μmol g-1 h-1, representing a 108.28% improvement compared to NM. This study provides a novel strategy for designing and synthesizing more efficient and selective photocatalysts.

Catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol offers a promising avenue for recycling CO 2 , enhancing environmental sustainability. Cu/ZnO has long been identified as one of the most effective heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction, yet the detailed understanding of its reaction mechanism and active sites remains incomplete. Recent advances have highlighted the critical role of defects, such as ZnCu steps and stacking faults on Cu surfaces, in enhancing catalyst performance. Here this concept is explored through first‐principles surface simulations of six models, featuring diverse Cu–Zn combinations and specific coordination environments under realistic conditions. It is revealed that Cu/ZnO catalysts with kink defects, rather than surface ZnCu alloys, exhibit optimal activity for methanol synthesis. Specifically, the findings demonstrate how intermediate configurations and rate‐determining steps vary with changes in surface structure and reveal the role of the kink in promoting CO 2 reduction to methanol through electronic structure calculation. Moreover, it is found that the predominant synthetic pathway for CH 3 OH from CO 2 involves the reverse water gas shift and CO hydrogenation, rather than the formate route, on Cu/ZnO surfaces with kinks.

Understanding how TiO2 interacts with CO2 at the molecular level is crucial in the CO2 reduction toward value-added energy sources. Here, we report in-situ observations of the CO2 activation process on the reduced TiO2(110) surface at room temperature using ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We found that oxygen vacancies (Vo) diffuse dynamically along the bridging oxygen (Obr) rows of the TiO2(110) surface under ambient CO2(g) environments. This physical phenomenon exclusively occurs when the oxygen abstracted upon CO2 dissociation instantly occupies the Vo sites of Obr rows on the TiO2(110), whereas the TiO2(110) surface without the Vo only allows CO2 physisorption on five-fold-coordinated Ti4+ sites. Synchrotron-based ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also identifies the changes in surface oxidation states of TiO2(110) by the healing of Vo sites or the CO2 physisorption under ambient CO2(g) conditions. Density functional theory calculations propose a mechanism of the CO2-driven Vo diffusion and the physisorbed CO2 configurations. Our combined results unravel the critical role of defect sites on TiO2 in determining the elementary step of CO2 activation during chemical reactions.

The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) was studied in the presence of Keggin polyoxometalates (POMs) such as heteropolyacids H3PMo12O40 and H3PW12O40 and their Co(II) and Ni(II) salts. H3PMo12O40 supported on SiO2, TiO2 and γ-Al2O3 produced CO with 100% selectivity at 29–33% CO2 conversion at 600 oC and a CO2:H2 molar ratio of 1:1. These catalysts were more active than MoO3/SiO2 revealing a phosphorus enhancement effect on the activity of molybdenum species. This effect is attributed to the influence of phosphate on the dispersion of Mo oxide active phase. STEM shows different morphologies of Mo oxide species in H3PMo12O40/SiO2 and MoO3/SiO2 catalysts. Chemical looping and H2-TPR and XRD analysis of Mo catalysts show that the reaction occurs through the reverse Mars–van Krevelen mechanism involving Mo(VI) reduction to Mo(IV) with H2 followed by Mo(IV) reoxidation with CO2. Tungsten POMs, exhibited no RWGS activity. This can be attributed to their resistance to reduction.

Abstract Elevated atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) often enhances plant photosynthesis and improves water status. However, the effects of e[CO2] vary significantly and are believed to be influenced by water availability. With the future warmer climate expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme rainfall, the response of plants to e[CO2] under changing precipitation patterns remains uncertain. We examined the effects of e[CO2] and different irrigation regimes on perennial ryegrass in a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. Immediately after irrigation, the mean net photosynthetic rate was 21.2% higher under e[CO2] compared to ambient conditions. This benefit increased over time, reaching 31.3% higher as days since watering increased, indicating a substantial increase in photosynthetic benefit with longer intervals between watering. Mean stomatal conductance was 21% lower in ryegrass under e[CO2] immediately after irrigation compared to ambient plots. However, the reduction in stomatal conductance under e[CO2] decreased as the interval between irrigation events increased, showing no difference 7-10 days after an irrigation event. These results imply that plants benefit most from carbon fertilisation, assimilating relatively more carbon and losing less water, during periods with less frequent rainfall. These findings have significant implications for understanding leaf-level responses to climate change.

Renewable energy-driven electrochemical CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere-level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large-scale implementation of CO2 electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine-doped SnO2 nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three-dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO2 to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99% and a CO2 single-pass conversion rate of 93% at 2 A cm-2. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94% for 520 h at a current density of 3 A cm-2. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well-retained Sn4+ species and Sn-Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO2 conversion. The incorporation of chlorine into SnO2 enhances electron transport and CO2 adsorption, substantially lowering the reaction energy barrier for the crucial intermediate *OCHO formation, and boosting the formate production.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of injecting flue gas (CO2, N2, and O2) originating from coal-fired power plants into a coal seam on CH4 extraction and CO2 geological storage. To this end, a multifield thermal-fluid-solid-coupled mathematical model of flue gas injection extraction was established. The results showed that with the increase in time increase, the volume concentration of CH4 decreased, but the CO2, N2, and O2 increased. Compared with single extraction, the gas injection extraction brought about a significant reduction in the pressure and content of CH4, an increase in the CH4 extraction rate, and an increase in the effective radius of CH4 extraction. In the single extraction, the temperature of the reservoir decreased, and its permeability increased. In the gas injection extraction, the temperature near the gas injection hole increased, whereas the temperature near the extraction hole decreased, and the permeability decreased overall. A method of measuring the effective radius of gas extraction by temperature is presented. The storage and extraction times of CO2 exhibited a linear relationship, and the CO2 escape rate increased gradually. The longer the gas injection extraction time, the greater the risk of coal and gas (CO2) outbursts.

This study presents a refrigeration-based carbon capture system designed for shipboard integration, employing a modified reverse Brayton cycle to capture CO2 from turbine exhaust via desublimation. The system achieves CO2 capture by drying, compressing, cooling, and expanding exhaust gases to reach the temperatures required for CO2 desublimation, enabling efficient capture and storage of CO2 without complex chemical processes. The desublimation chamber, a central component, captures CO2 by phase change, allowing for streamlined storage and minimal energy footprint. A parametric analysis was conducted to assess the idealized performance of system components under varying exhaust gas compositions, compression ratios, and CO2 capture rates. Results indicate that desublimation temperature and cooling load requirements are strongly influenced by the initial exhaust gas CO2 concentrations, capture rates, and exhaust gas pressures. High capture rates require increased cooling loads and lowered desublimation temperatures, impacting overall system efficiency. Furthermore, the study introduces a comprehensive performance parameter that considers the balance between CO2 capture efficiency and energy demand, revealing an optimal threshold beyond which increased capture rates incur disproportionate energy penalties. This system meets the Navy's requirements for operational efficiency, waste heat recovery, and emissions reduction, offering a promising approach to sustainable shipboard operations.

Methane, one of the major greenhouse gases (GHGs) produced due to various anthropogenic activities, is on the rise with increasing population and urbanization. It is the second most important greenhouse gas which is 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone. It is the second largest contributor of climate change, accounting for about 16% of the warming effect. India is one of the major methaneemitting countries where methane emission is from human activities such as agriculture, livestock centric fermentation, and urban waste dumping in areas like urban wetlands. Though methane is a byproduct in the industrial process and despite new technologies being available for methane recovery, methane emission continues to grow without the use of circular economy owing to inadequate investment on the one hand and the growing population and urbanization on the other hand. Atmospheric burden due to methane emission can be reduced substantially with the practice of waste reduction, waste recycling and conversion of biowaste into energy. The paper suggests technological use, innovations and development needs to be relevant for both business success and environmental sustainability. The present paper takes a modest attempt to describe the production of methane based on different anthropogenic activities, its contribution to the GHGs and the possibilities of reducing methane through the practice of following circular economy.

The steel and fertilizer markets are predicted to grow in the decades to come, while they need to take actions to transform towards CO2 neutrality. These two industrial sectors are responsible for 30% of all industrial CO2 emission and >4% of annual global GDP (gross domestic product). In the H2020 INITIATE project, these two industrial sectors are coupled using a symbiosis approach: the steel works arising gasses are used as feedstock for the production of NH3 and urea. This directly contributes to the reduction of i) the CO2 emissions, ii) the energy requirement and iii) the raw material use. It concept shows that carbon capture, re-use and storage are sustained on the value generated for generation of added value products such as NH3 and urea. The roll-out of the concept is based on technology demonstration, for which the pilot plant construction nears completion, while the techno-economic and life-cycle assessments show the benefits in terms increased energy efficiency for CO2 removal, higher CO2 avoidance rates and lower costs for CO2 capture compared to amine-based reference cases. The burdens for climate change impact, damages to the eco-system as well as human life are significantly reduced compared to the reference cases. For the long term implementation plan, it is shown that the current positive business case has the potential to be further strengthened by the CBAM and ETS CO2 pricing mechanisms, although the related uncertainties are significant.

CO2‐based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace CO‐based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO2‐based hydroesterification is through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters. This route creates a net CO2‐based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate‐olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2‐bis(di‐tert‐butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO2, H2, methanol and 1‐octene in a single‐stage batch process. The CO2‐based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1‐octene reduction. Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two‐stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1‐octene, achieving a yield of up to 32%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to ca 75%. Preliminary studies indicate significant interplay between the two ligands employed in the molecular tandem catalytic systems and establish the first catalytic protocol for the selective CO2‐based hydroesterification of olefins via organoformates.

This study investigates the potential for emissions reductions in U.S. refineries through carbon capture technologies under various decarbonization scenarios. In 2019, the refining sector emitted over 220 million tons of CO2eq/year, primarily from fossil fuel combustion, with deep conversion refineries identified as the largest emitters. Using the Petroleum Refinery Lifecycle Inventory Model (PRELIM) and its integrated carbon capture module, the study evaluates emissions reduction strategies, incorporating future scenarios of transportation fuel demand, crude quality changes, and carbon pricing. Results indicate that declining fuel demand could reduce emissions by 51 million tons CO2 eq/year, while deploying carbon capture technologies under high demand scenarios could cut emissions by up to 126 million tons CO2 eq/year by 2035. By 2050, a combination of demand reduction and carbon capture could achieve a 77.4% reduction in annual emissions compared to 2019 levels. The Real Option Analysis highlights a 99.9% likelihood of hydroskimming refinery shutdowns by early 2030s, whereas medium and deep conversion refineries demonstrate resilience and are likely to adopt carbon capture early.

Permeability reduction due to salt precipitation near CO2 injection wells will reduce injectivity and may place the viability of large-scale CCS projects at risk of failure. Therefore, an understanding of the optimum injection conditions to mitigate the risk of deposition of halite and other salts is key. This study investigates the influence of continuous and intermittent CO2 injection on reservoir dynamics under two specific field conditions (one an offshore North Sea CCS project and the other an onshore North American project) by performing parametric sensitivity analyses.

Land Use Trade-offs under the 1.5°C Temperature Control Target: van and Haigh (2024) explored the land use competition situation under the 1.5°C climate stabilization scenario, proposed to jointly formulate strong policies and regulations to comprehensively promote the efficient use of land in fields such as food, energy, and nature conservation (doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2024.1379046).Precise Deconstruction of Natural Land Carbon Sinks: Qu et al. (2023) took the dominant position of forests in the absorption of carbon dioxide on land as the core basis, skillfully integrated the MIT carbon cycle model simulation with the Shell Energy Security Scenarios emission pathways, and constructed a precise analysis framework for national net-zero emission targets under different scenarios (https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1289531). In addition, there are also some new trends, such as digital empowerment to improve the emission reduction efficiency of resource-based cities: Qian & Luo (2024) found that digital transformation can significantly improve the land green use efficiency of resource-based cities through multiple paths such as driving technological innovation, promoting industrial structure upgrading, and alleviating the problem of land factor mismatch. (doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2024.1339928).Land systems possess both carbon sequestration and emission functions, and transitioning to carbon neutrality requires maintaining a delicate balance between these two roles. By making conscious and sustainable choices in land use, we can make significant progress in addressing climate change and creating a more resilient and low-carbon future for future generations.Protecting Natural Ecosystems: Improve the carbon storage capacity by protecting natural ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, farmlands and wetlands. This includes delimiting and managing ecological protection red lines and nature reserves to make effective use of the carbon sequestration capacity of natural ecosystems.Optimizing human activities space.: With the goal of low carbon emissions, the rational distribution of population and industries should be guided. By optimizing the quantitative structure and spatial pattern of land use, it will be beneficial to adjust the industrial layout, reduce the land use types mainly relying on fossil energy consumption, and improve energy utilization efficiency.Strengthening Land Use Regulation: Strictly control the expansion of construction land and deforestation to reduce carbon emissions from land use. It is crucial to monitor the carbon emissions and carbon emission intensity of major land use types and strengthen policy interventions in the process of carbon emissions from land use.Innovating Land Management Measures: Economic and policy incentives can be used to guide farmers to cultivate high-carbon sequestration crops, thereby increasing the carbon storage of farmland and grasslands.In general, this series of colorful, diverse, and in-depth studies in this issue reveals the complex relationships among land use, carbon emissions, and sustainable development. The various research results echo and closely connect with each other, just like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, jointly piecing together a magnificent blueprint for sustainable development. Achieving carbon neutrality and reaching peak emissions is a complex and long-term endeavor, with the dynamics of land use and carbon emissions being integral components of its success. Through measures such as scientific planning, rational layout, technological innovation, and policy guidance, we can promote a virtuous cycle between economic and social development and ecological environmental protection, contributing to the harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature.

A techno-economic analysis is performed on the negative CO2 emission gas power plant (nCO2PP) vs combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) with carbon capture and storage (CCS). In nCO2PP it can be distinguished following three islands: the fuel preparation, power generation and CO2 separation and capture, respectively. The nCO2PP and CCGT with CCS are modeled in commercial software. The CCGT power plant with amine capture has been used as reference to represent state-of-the-art power generation technology. Both CAPEX and OPEX as well as incomes from sewage sludge disposal and avoided CO2 emissions have been included in the techno-economic analyses. The boundary of the cost analyses includes the power plants, CO2 capture processes and conditioning. The results show that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the nCO2PP using exhaust gas gasifier is comparable to the reference CCGT with amine capture. Due to the high electrical energy consumption and equipment cost, the LCOE is much higher when the plasma gasifier is used. The LCOE strongly depends on the income from sewage sludge disposal and avoided CO2 emissions. Further reductions of LCOE are expected for the nCO2PP with the development of the technology maturity.

The conversion performance for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) relies on the affinity of CO2 molecules. Ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising platforms for CO2RR due to the accessible catalytic sites in the skeleton, high CO2 combination ability and the electronic conductivity. However, most ionic COFs are constructed via pre-functionalization of the monomers or post-modification of the skeleton, encountering incomplete loading or uneven distribution of the active sites. In this work, a cationic porphyrin-based COF using the (3-carboxypropyl)trimethylammonium and Co-porphyrin units is developed through the sub-stoichiometric bottom-up synthesis method to fine-tune the pore environment for modulating the binding ability of CO2. Compared to base COFs, the cationic COFs exhibit improved electronic conductivity, high CO2 adsorption uptakes and enhanced reducibility, further improving the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance. Notably, the cationic COF achieves a high CO selectivity of 93% and a partial current density of 24.6 mA·cm-2. This work not only offers considerable insights for improving the catalytic performance of COFs through the cationic groups but also provides a stoichiometry method to modulate the pore environment.

Global warming is an urgent problem that must be solved immediately, and it is said that the cause is CO2 emitted by human activities. DAC is a technology that directly captures CO2 from the air and can contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere. The DAC technology is required to reduce the cost by making the equipment compact as much as possible, and to realize practical use with energy saving. KHI is developing DAC technology using solid adsorbent. The solid adsorbent is an amine impregnated porous material. Moving bed technology has been developed for CO2 capture from flue gas. Therefore, moving bed technology is applied to the DAC to make the equipment compact and save energy. In this paper, the energy superiority of the moving bed process over the fixed bed process was verified using the laboratory scale test facility.Steam was introduced into the solid adsorbent which sufficiently adsorbed CO2 to desorb CO2, and the energy consumption was evaluated from the temperature change of solid sorbent. As a result of 4 cycles of the desorption process, it was confirmed that the desorption energy of the moving bed process could be reduced by 34% compared with that of the fixed bed process. It is expected that the energy consumption of the actual moving bed process can be further reduced. The commercialization of the DAC technology will be accelerated by adopting this moving bed system for commercial plant.

Abstract The construction industry is pursuing the reduction of CO2 emissions and the development of lowcarbon concrete. LOIKKA research project was initiated in Finland with the aim to reduce the CO2 emissions of concrete manufacturing by 50%. The use of blast furnace slag was seen as the most competitive way to significantly reduce CO2 emissions of concrete. However, incorporating slag in concrete can lead to durability complications, particularly concerning salt freeze-thaw resistance. This study investigates the effects of slag content, carbonation/ageing, and pre-curing conditions on the freeze-thaw and salt freeze-thaw resistance of concrete. Additionally, it evaluates the compressive strength development and porosity differences of test concretes. Slab tests were conducted to determine the surface scaling and internal damage resistance of concrete specimens. The results showed that high slag content and carbonation reduced salt freeze-thaw resistance. The incorporation of 50% slag content as the cement clinker replacement is considered critical. An increase in slag content led to a decrease in the compressive strength at 7 days due to the low reactivity of slag but achieved the highest compressive strength at 91 days with 70% slag content. These insights contribute to our understanding of the durability properties of concrete incorporating slag.

Ubiquitous nitrate (NO3−) in groundwater sources is considered a hazard compound for human health. Photo-catalytic reduction by Ag-TiO2/formic acid/visible light represents an emerging method for NO3− removal without secondary pollution. In this contribution, the removal of NO3− by photo-catalytic reduction and the selectivity of N2 were systematically investigated under varied conditions, including concentrations of Ag-TiO2, NO3−, and formic acid (HCOOH). The removal efficiency of NO3− reached 84.47%, 82.68% of which was converted to N2 under the optimal conditions: NO3− at 50 mg-N/L, Ag-TiO2 at 1.0 g/L, HCOOH at 20.05 mmol/L, and reaction time at 120 min. The removal of NO3− was enhanced mainly by CO2− rather than by photo-generated electrons or HCOO−. The results of this study indicated that the production of ·CO2− by Ag-TiO2 and HCOOH under visible light catalysis can achieve efficient NO3− removal.

Rural electrification is key to socio-economic development in developing countries like Nigeria. However, extending the national grid to remote rural areas is expensive and time consuming, and the traditional power supply method also involves utilization of a standalone renewable energy source such as Solar which have their associated drawbacks due to their unreliability in nature. Hence, this research carried out a techno-economic and environmental analysis of an off-grid hybrid renewable energy system for rural electrification using Kepler Optimization Algorithm (KOA). Feasibility study on electricity and hourly load demand assessment of Alayin village was conducted and village load profile was estimated. Mathematical modeling of each hybrid RES was formulated. A KOA technique was employed to carry out optimal sizing and check the cost efficiency of BG/ PHES/ Battery, PV/PHES/Battery, and the hybrid RES (PV/BG/PHES/Battery). Simulation of the model was done using MATLAB R2021a. The value obtained was validated with Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) for performance evaluation using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and CO2 reduction in manure management as performance metrics. The results of the analysis showed an appreciable reduction on the LCOE and CO2 with high reliability using KOA-hybrid RES compared with GSA-hybrid RES.

The purpose of this research article is to perform a greenhouse gas (GHG) impact assessment using a lifecycle analysis of a cold-ironing solution for vessels at anchorage in a retrofitted barge and a marine genset combusting biomethane in dual fuel mode. A lifecycle methodology is developed based on the 4th International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG study. Eleven impact scenarios are evaluated in terms of CO2 and harmful pollutants (SOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, NMVOC, and NOx). Vessels operated by Petronav Ship Management Ltd are examined, specifically M/T Alexandria and M/T Astraia. The scenarios reveal CO2 reductions of up to 21% and CO increases of up to 60% due to the combustion of biomethane in dual fuel mode, alongside SOx reductions of up to 20% with increasing biomethane energy substitution. Particulates and NOx decrease due to the utilization of biomethane. This article presents a pragmatic solution for cold ironing for vessels at anchorage with proven lower GHG emissions with the exception of increased CO emissions, therefore the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

Evidence is growing that insects may feel pain, suggesting that the precautionary use of pain reduction methods like anesthesia may be an important refinement for these species in laboratory research. Given that anesthetic use is not mandated for insects in research, this review aimed to determine if and how modern researchers working with ten model insect species use anesthetic agents. We searched Google Scholar for all papers published on each model species that contained a mention of anesthesia from 2019-2024; then, we confirmed whether anesthesia was used for putative pain reduction/loss of consciousness purposes in a laboratory setting (n = 93). Papers that met these criteria were found for five species: the western honey bee (n = 8), the migratory locust (n = 4), the house cricket (n = 3), the black soldier fly (n = 3), and the fruit fly (n = 75). Cold or freezing was reported for all five species; isoflurane, sevoflurane, carbon dioxide, desflurane, halothane, flyNap (triethylamine), dyclonine, etomidate, ketamine, 2,6-diisopropyl phenol, propofol, tricaine mesylate, chloroform, xenon, eugenol, alcohol, ether, and nitrogen gas were reported for a subset of species (with the vast majority of variance in anesthetic choice resulting from the fruit fly literature). The majority of studies did not report exposure procedure, anesthetic dose or exposure time; when reported, these details varied widely, suggesting a lack of standardization in anesthesia protocols among insect researchers that may harm reproducibility. Further, 24.4% of studies reported the use of an anesthetic (cold) not recommended by invertebrate veterinarians, suggesting a lack of integration between the insect research and veterinary communities on refining experimental procedures. Overall, our review suggests there is a need to develop standardized, species-specific anesthesia protocols that improve scientific reproducibility and support welfare in model insects.

The iron and steel industry represents one of the largest CO2 emitters, accounting for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions. Therefore, solutions for the reduction of this enormous amount of CO2 emissions must be implemented. This work investigates the possibility of integrating pre-combustion and post-combustion innovative carbon capture technologies, named CASOH and DISPLACE in the layout of a conventional BF-BOF steel plant. A techno-economic assessment is carried out, considering different levels of integration of the above mentioned technologies for a deep decarbonization. Dedicated models have been built in Aspen Plus which served for finding the optimal operating conditions of the carbon capture technologies and to compute their energy demands. A carbon avoidance equal to 72% can be achieved in a renewable scenario when CASOH processes part of the BFG and BOFG available in the steel mill and DISPLACE technology is utilized to decarbonize the flow gas originating from hot-stoves, reheating ovens and the sinter plant. The adoption of oxy-fired units was investigated with the aim of having exhaust gases with an higher concentration of CO2, thus facilitating the carbon capture process in the post-combustion units.

This study examines corn stalk biochar (CSB)-enhanced mortar as an innovative material for carbon capture and CO2 sequestration. CSB, a renewable agricultural byproduct, was incorporated into cement mortar at varying concentrations (2.5% to 75%), and its effects on the mortar’s physicochemical properties, its ability to support algal growth, and the CO2 absorption capacity of the algae were analyzed. Characterization of CSB showed a high carbon content (62.3%), significant porosity, and a large surface area (680.3 m2 g−1), making it ideal for gas capture. At low concentrations (2.5%), CSB slightly improved the mortar’s compressive strength and density. However, higher CSB levels (5% to 75%) led to significant reductions (p < 0.05) in strength and density, while water absorption increased. CO2 sequestration monitored from algal growth studies revealed that both Chlorella sp. (TISTR 8262) and Scenedesmus sp. (TISTR 9384) thrived on CSB-enhanced mortars. At a 75% CSB concentration, Scenedesmus sp. achieved a 24.2-fold increase in biomass by day 12, outperforming Chlorella sp., which showed a 26.6-fold increase. CO2 absorption also improved with biochar. Mortars with 75% CSB achieved an 86% CO2 absorption ratio without algae, while adding algae boosted this to nearly 100%, highlighting the synergistic effect of biochar and algal photosynthesis. Higher CSB levels accelerated CO2 absorption stabilization, reaching saturation by day 8 at 75% CSB. Scenedesmus sp. showed slightly higher CO2 absorption efficiency than Chlorella sp., reaching peak absorption earlier and maintaining greater efficiency. Higher CSB concentrations accelerated CO2 absorption, indicating that biochar–mortar mixtures, particularly when combined with algae, provide a promising solution for enhancing carbon capture and sequestration in green infrastructure.

In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2‐containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C‒O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1‐2 mol% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60 °C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco‐friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in‐situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]‐H as an active catalyst.

Importance There is growing awareness of the US health sector’s substantial contribution to the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exacerbating the health threats from climate change. Reducing health care’s environmental impact requires understanding its carbon emissions, but there are few published audits of health systems and fewer comprehensive emissions analyses at the clinic or department level. Objective To quantify the annual GHG emissions from a large outpatient dermatology practice, compare relative sources of emissions, and identify actionable targets. Design and Setting This quality improvement study involving a comprehensive carbon footprint analysis (scopes 1-3) of a large (nearly 30 000 visits/y), outpatient medical dermatology practice within the University of Pennsylvania’s academic medical complex was conducted following the GHG Protocol Corporate and Corporate Value Chain reporting standards for fiscal year 2022 (ie, July 2021 through June 2022). Data were obtained through energy metering, manual audits, electronic medical records, and administrative data. Exposure Data were converted into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e), allowing comparison of global-warming potential of emitted GHGs. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were tCO 2 e by scope 1 (direct emissions), scope 2 (indirect, purchased energy), and scope 3 (indirect, upstream/downstream sources), as well as by individual categories of emission sources within each scope. Results Scope 3 contributed most to the clinic’s carbon footprint, composing 165.5 tCO 2 e (51.1%), followed by scope 2 (149.9 tCO 2 e [46.3%]), and scope 1 (8.2 tCO 2 e [2.5%]). Within scope 3, the greatest contributor was overall purchased goods and services (120.3 tCO 2 e [72.7% of scope 3]), followed by patient travel to and from the clinic (14.2 tCO 2 e [8.6%]) and waste (13.1 tCO 2 e [7.9%]). Steam and chilled water were the largest contributors to scope 2. Clinic energy use intensity was 185.4 kBtu/sqft. Conclusions and Relevance In this quality improvement study, the composition of emissions at the clinic level reflects the importance of scope 3, paralleling the health sector overall. The lower-resource intensity of the clinic compared to the average energy requirements of the total clinical complex led to a relatively large contribution from scope 2. These findings support efforts to characterize high-yield emissions-reduction targets and allow for identification of actionable, clinic-level steps that may inform broader health system efforts.

This study aimed to determine the effects of elevated carbon dioxide (eCO 2 ) and temperature (eT) on the phytochemical and nutritional parameters of legumes. Field experiments were conducted using black gram ( Vigna mungo L.), green gram ( Vigna radiate L.), and pigeonpea ( Cajanus cajan L.) genotypes under the Free Air Temperature Elevation (FATE) facility, with three treatments (Ac, eT, and eCO 2 + eT) at ICAR-CRIDA, Hyderabad. The results revealed that the negative impact on both phytochemical and nutritional quality was greater under eT compared to eCO 2 + eT. Specifically, protein content decreased by 25.6% under eT + eCO 2 , while the ash content increased by 38.19%. Carbohydrate levels also decreased by 5.53% under these conditions . The reduction in micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu) was more pronounced than in macronutrients (P, Ca, and Mg) across the three crops. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the major contributors to PC1 were Mg, crude fiber, cooking time, phosphorus, hydration capacity, ash content, and Mn. The primary contributors to PC2 included swelling capacity, Cu, Mn, carbohydrate, hydration capacity, and Zn. In contrast, the major contributors to PC3 were Ca, Fe, Zn, protein, carbohydrate, swelling index, and ash content. The eigenvalues of principal components, calibrated through different parameters, ranged from 1.052 to 4.755 in black gram and from 1.073 to 6.267 in green gram. This study provides insights into nutritional quality under changing global climate conditions.

The injection of pulverized coal into blast furnaces has alleviated the demand for metallurgical coke, and co-injection technology combining natural gas and pulverized coal with high oxygen enrichment has the potential to further reduce coke use and hence CO2 emissions. This work presents a steady-state operational model for the co-injection of natural gas and pulverized coal into blast furnaces developed based on mass and energy balance. With the support of industrial data from the commercial blast furnace, the matching relationship between natural gas rate, pulverized coal injection rate, and oxygen enrichment is quantitatively examined under the constraints of raceway adiabatic flame temperature and top gas temperature. The effect of natural gas rate on coke rate and CO2 emission reduction is investigated. The results show that increasing natural gas injection rate, lower pulverized coal rate and higher oxygen enrichment maintains a constant raceway adiabatic flame temperature and coke rate. Under the optimal operating conditions, the pulverized coal, coke rate, and CO2 emissions are reduced by 30.2%, 7.3% and 6.2%, respectively. The model and its results are expected to be helpful for a better understanding co-injection of natural gas and pulverized coal into blast furnaces, as well as contribute to reducing coke rate, pulverized coal rate, and CO2 emissions.

However, the current state of this technology is hindered by low selectivity and productivity, primarily due to limited understanding of the atomic‐level active sites involved in ethanol formation. Herein, we identify that the interfacial oxygen vacancy‐neighboring Cu (Ov‐Cu) pair sites are the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. A linear correlation between the density of Ov‐Cu pair sites and ethanol productivity is experimentally evidenced. Moreover, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5% and a partial current density of 344.0 mA cm‐2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst with a high density of Ov‐Cu pair sites in acid. Mechanistic studies that combine density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic techniques propose an Ov‐involved mechanism where interfacial Ov sites directly activate and dissociate CO2 into *CO in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner, thus favoring the subsequent *CHO formation and asymmetric CHO‐CO coupling. Besides, the asymmetric Ov‐Cu pair sites could preferentially stabilize the *CH2CHOH intermediate, resulting in the favorable formation of ethanol over ethylene. Our findings provide new atomic‐level insights into CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, paving the way for the rational design of future catalysts.

The global rising temperatures has been a climate crisis and needs an urgent significant reduction of CO2 emission. The government of Canada has set the target for net-zero emission by 2050. Along with approaching utilizing renewable energy sources, the usage of fossil fuel is still inevitable for major industries such as power generation and steel. Among all techniques with the potential of achieving the goal, the approach of storing CO2 safely in the geological subsurface is essential for permanent removal of the CO2 from the atmosphere. This concept is well-known as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to remove a huge volume of emitted CO2 from the industries 'flue stack. Geological characterization is the key factor for finding a safe location with the proper geological features to store the captured CO2. Saskatchewan has been the home of the first commercial deep CCS project in Storing CO2 from Unit 3 of the Boundary Dam Carbon Capture facility at SaskPower, Estevan, Saskatchewan. Since April 2015, 580,000 tonnes of CO2 have been stored at the Aquistore site to the Deadwood Formation saline aquifer. This real-life project has shown the complete confidence in the geological proprieties of the formation. Western Canadian Sedimentary basin (WCSB) overlies all southern Saskatchewan. The thickness of the sediments is over 2-3 km in the Williston sub-basin from central Saskatchewan to the south. Williston basin is a geologically unique basin comprised of "Pre-Cambrian basement". Two major aquifers of Deadwood and Winnipeg Formations which are called "Basal Clastic Unit" almost completely cover Williston Basin in Saskatchewan. These two formations have given Saskatchewan a remarkable geological superiority. This study focuses on taking advantage of the same formation for having a CO2 injection well at the central Saskatchewan. The targeted spot is between Regina and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The top of the Winnipeg Formation at this spot reaches 2062 m while the thickness of Deadwood Formation in the Basal Clastic Unit is about 152 m. The model is built for the area of 55 ×15 km to include as many as well data available surrounding the target location. The formations maps were exported from the Saskatchewan Geological Mapping. There are injection wells in the studied area where their well log data (geoSCOUT) were helped to import the formations properties including porosity into the model. The radius of CO2 migration at the perforated section of the well for the total injection of 5-10 tonnes/day was studied and predicted over 25 years by considering the effect of continuous water injection from the surrounding wells to the same formation. The results showed that the maximum distance of the CO2 migration is about 500 m. The outcome is assuring the efficiency of CO2 storage for this particular location in the central of Saskatchewan province. Besides, it can give enough confidence to think about having CO2 storage hub for this part of the province with the great history and lessons learnt we have from the Aquistore injection well.

NH3, as one of the carbon-free fuels, is emerging as a new energy source for power generation. NH3 is being partially introduced into thermal power plants, accelerating its practical application as a fuel. In this study, experiments are conducted to apply NH3 in circulating fluidized bed(CFB) boilers. The objective of this research is to investigate fundamentally the effects of NH3 co-firing ratios(0-50%) and the stoichiometric ratio(SR) on combustion and various exhaust emissions to derive the optimal conditions for NH3 co-firing with coal using a bubbling fluidized bed(BFB) reactor. Results indicate that as the NH3 co-firing ratio increased, the emission values of CO2 and SO2 generated from coal combustion decreased. as the NH3 co-firing ratio increase up to 30~40%, the NOx gradually increase while higher co-firing ratio result in lower NOx value because unburned NH3 remaining in the reducing zone contribute to NOx reduction by selective non-catalytic reduction(SNCR) reactions. Furthermore NH3 should be injected into an appropriate reducing zone with a low SR for effective NOx reduction.

Depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs are often considered as suitable candidates for geological CO2 storage due to their proven injectivity (e.g., permeability and thickness), known storage capacity (e.g., pore volume), and established containment characteristics (e.g., presence of geological cap rocks). In addition, they offer existing injection infrastructures and comprehensive information from the geological formations that will be targeted for the CO2 storage operation. However, the injection of CO2 at high pressure into such low-pressure reservoirs is affected by the well-known Joule-Thomson cooling effect. The expansion of high-pressure CO2 into a depleted reservoir results in a localized temperature reduction in the wellbore region. This significant cooling effect may induce thermal fractures within the reservoir and cap rock; it can freeze the irreducible water, lead to formation of hydrates, and result in salt precipitation. While induced fractures can benefit the well injectivity, they might pose a risk to the integrity of the wellbore and the containment of reservoir. Additionally, formation of hydrates due to temperature drop near well may lead to the wellbore blockage, permeability reduction, and ultimately, injectivity impairment. Therefore, understanding the Joule-Thomson effect and associated parameters that can affect the degree of cooling in the near-wellbore region is crucial prior to the design phase of any CO2 injection projects into depleted reservoirs.In this study, we employ the TOUGH2-ECO2M simulation tool to assess the significance of the Joule-Thomson cooling effect in underground CO2 storage. Initially, the simulation model was verified using a classic Joule-Thomson expansion experiment with pure CO2, yielding its coefficients with less than 3% difference against the available published references and experimental data. This provided confidence in our analysis to perform further investigation of complex interplay between injected CO2 and reservoir dynamics. Key parameters, including injection rate, bottomhole temperature, reservoir permeability, and initial reservoir pressure, were studied to understand how these factors would influence the strength of the Joule-Thomson cooling effect in depleted gas reservoirs.In practice, the bottomhole temperature depends on various parameters, including the injection rate, well depth, wellhead temperature, tubing properties, and the geothermal gradient. In the current simulation, the wellbore flow is not explicitly modelled, and therefore, it is treated as a variable parameter. The impact of permeability and injection rate is examined independently in a sensitivity analysis. Despite their analogous influence on pressure drop, as dictated by Darcy's law, it is essential to recognize that alterations in temperature can make changes in the viscosity of CO2, subsequently exerting an indirect influence on the pressure drop within the system and amount of cooling effect.Simulation results indicated that more pronounced cooling can be experienced due to higher injection rate, lower reservoir permeability, elevated bottomhole temperature, or lower reservoir pressure. Interestingly, the bottomhole temperature drop near the wellbore exhibited notable behaviour. It deviated significantly from the theoretically calculated values, which is due to the residual heat from the underground formations. Temperature drop occurred gradually over time, and it was extended beyond the immediate wellbore region, propagating deep into the reservoir.To further explore the impact of bottomhole temperature on the Joule-Thomson cooling effect, we assumed a base case scenario in which the injection bottomhole temperature was equal to the initial reservoir temperature of 75 °C and reservoir initial pressure was 50 bars. Simulation results indicated that a maximum observed temperature-drop of 28 °C was caused by the Joule-Thomson cooling effect. In another scenario, the bottomhole temperature (20 °C) was significantly lower than the initial reservoir temperature (75 °C). In this case, the observed temperature drop due to the Joule-Thomson effect was only 4 °C. A comparison of these scenarios suggests that when CO2 is injected at lower temperature than reservoir temperature, the Joule-Thomson cooling effect would likely not promote formation of hydrates.While Joule-Thomson cooling effect may present other challenges (e.g., induced fractures), based on the current simulation results it does not seem to pose significant concerns regarding hydrate formation in the context of underground CO2 storage. This study is of significant practical considerations for the design of effective CO2 injection strategies into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs.

ConspectusSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) represent a transformative advancement in heterogeneous catalysis, offering unparalleled opportunities for maximizing atomic efficiency and enhancing performance. SACs are characterized by isolated metal atoms uniformly dispersed on suitable supports, ensuring each metal atom serves as an independent catalytic site. This dispersion mitigates metal atom aggregation, a common issue in conventional nanocatalysts, thus enabling superior activity, selectivity, and stability. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as an ideal platform for SAC synthesis due to their structural diversity, tunable coordination environments, and high surface areas. MOFs provide well-defined coordination sites that facilitate the precise stabilization of single metal atoms, presenting significant advantages over traditional supports like metal oxides and metal materials. Carbonization of MOFs yields MOF-derived carbon materials that retain key structural characteristics while offering enhanced electrical conductivity and stability, making them suitable for various catalytic applications.Recent advances in the rational design and controlled synthesis of MOF-derived SACs have significantly improved their performance in electrocatalytic processes such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, challenges remain, including maintaining structural integrity during high-temperature carbonization, enhancing mass and electron transport and ensuring the stability of isolated metal atoms under reaction conditions. To address these challenges, strategies such as using structure-directing agents to stabilize MOF frameworks, forming high-energy porous carbon networks, and optimizing support morphologies have been developed to maximize active site exposure and accessibility. On the other hand, the interplay between active metal sites and their coordination environments is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity of SACs. Advanced computational modeling, coupled with experimental validation, has provided insights into the electronic structure of SACs and the interactions between metal atoms and supports. These insights have enabled researchers to fine-tune local atomic coordination, leading to significant enhancements in performance. For instance, modifying the coordination environment of metal atoms optimizes the binding strength of reaction intermediates, thereby improving both activity and selectivity. This account highlights our group's contributions to MOF-derived SACs, focusing on innovative design, functionalization, and synthesis approaches that enhance catalytic activity. Notable strategies include using structure-directing agents to maintain pore connectivity during carbonization, preserving high surface areas, and enhancing mass transport. We also discuss the design of high-energy MOF-derived porous carbon networks that facilitate continuous electron transport and improve the interaction between active sites and reactants, ultimately boosting catalytic efficiency. Techniques such as electrospinning have also been employed to create hierarchical porous structures and one-dimensional nanofibers, enhancing mass transport and electron transfer. The rational design of SACs requires a comprehensive understanding of the microenvironment surrounding active sites, and by leveraging computational and experimental tools, researchers can precisely control these microenvironments to achieve desired outcomes.MOF-derived SACs hold substantial promise for energy conversion and chemical synthesis. Continued research is essential to optimize their design, improve scalability, and explore new applications, ultimately advancing sustainable catalysis. This account provides an overview of the latest advancements in MOF-derived SACs, highlighting their potential as next-generation electrocatalysts and their role in sustainable energy technologies.

Introduction Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are emerging treatment options. This study aimed to estimate the potential health system and associated environmental impacts of DMTs by modeling future bed-days and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions for the UK population under various scenarios for access to and efficacy of DMTs. Methods A cohort Markov model was developed to predict the UK population distribution from 2020 to 2040 across five health states—cognitively unimpaired and four stages of AD (mild cognitive impairment, and mild, moderate, severe dementia). These distributions were estimated using national population projections, AD prevalence data, and stage-specific transition rates. Annual bed-days per person for each state and associated CO 2 e emissions from published literature were applied to estimate total bed-days and emissions. Modeled scenarios combined ranges of DMT efficacy estimates (20 to 30%) and access levels (25 to 58% eligible patients receiving treatment) elicited from expert opinion to explore the extent of potential DMT impacts. Results Without DMT access, annual bed-days across the four AD stages were projected to increase from 5.5 million to 8.6 million from 2020 to 2040, with cumulative bed-days totaling 140 million. Associated annual emissions increased from 0.7 Mt to 1.1 Mt CO 2 e, reaching 17 Mt CO 2 e cumulatively from 2020 to 2040. Under the various high-access (58% eligible patients treated) DMT efficacy scenarios, relative to no DMT access, annual reductions of 430 thousand to 650 thousand bed-days and 54 kt to 81 kt CO 2 e were estimated by 2040, and cumulative emissions decreased by 419 kt to 633 kt CO 2 e. Decreasing DMT access to 25 percent, assuming 25 percent DMT efficacy, reduced annual bed-days by 230 thousand by 2040, and annual emission savings decreased to 29 kt CO 2 e. Conclusions DMTs for AD may contribute to efforts by healthcare systems to reduce the carbon emissions from hospital inpatient care. Environmental sustainability should be considered as part of a holistic value proposition when assessing the benefits of new medicines.

To reduce the energy consumption and the total annual cost (TAC) of the conventional extractive distillation (CED) process, this study focuses on the process intensification by the combination of salt-based DESs entrainers, partial heat-integrated and intermediate reboilers for 2-propanol + water separation process. The vapor-liquid equilibrium experiments showed that (ChCl:U:CaCl2)1:2:0.36 is the most promising for the separation of 2-propanol and water among all of the entrainers investigated. Based on the thermodynamic study, the conceptual process design for CED was created to examine the competitiveness of the recommended entrainer in separating 2-propanol and water. When compared to the entrainer glycerol, the CED process using (ChCl:U:CaCl2)1:2:0.36 entrainer can reduce the total annual cost (TAC) by about 69.54%, the total energy consumption (TEC) by 70.66% and the CO2 emissions (ECO2) by 67.92%. To achieve the further energy saving, partial heat-integrated (PHI) scheme and partial heat-integrated combined with intermediate reboilers (PHI-IR) scheme are researched based on the CED process. For the most energy saving design, PHI-IR, it has 74.61% thermodynamic efficiency enhanced, 72.79% energy-saving, 70.25% reduction in total annual cost (TAC) and 74.47% reduction in CO2 emissions with the comparison of the CED process using glycerol entrainer. The results show that the PHI-IR scheme is energy-efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly for separating 2-propanol and water mixtures, with great industrial application potential.

This paper studies the intra-day impacts of wind power on wholesale electricity prices and carbon emissions in Great Britain. Exploiting hourly variations across years from 2008 to 2019, we differentiate the longer-term impact of wind power, largely due to capacity increases, and the short-term impact driven by weather conditions. The results show that the expansion of wind energy significantly decreases wholesale electricity prices in most hours, although the effect is not uniform. The prices decrease more during peak hours than during off-peak hours, with no significant effect during the ramping-up and ramping-down hours. However, over the sample period, the negative effects of wind expansion and load reduction on wholesale electricity prices are more than offset by the increases in carbon and fuel prices. Wind expansion, load reduction, and increases in carbon prices all contributed to the significant reduction in CO2 emissions.

Breathing relies on unrestricted movement of the chest wall to maintain oxygen and carbon dioxide balance. Understanding the effects of chest and abdominal restrictions on respiratory function is critical for studying conditions such as respiratory diseases, extreme environments, and load-induced impairments. However, existing methods to simulate these restrictions are limited, lacking the ability to provide both static and dynamic conditions or precise load control. To address these gaps, we developed a novel chest wall and abdomen restriction device capable of independently applying and measuring static and dynamic loads with adjustable and reproducible force levels. Separate bands for the chest and abdomen enable targeted restrictions, with constant force springs providing resistance during dynamic conditions and immobilization during static conditions. Integrated sensors quantify applied loads and respiratory mechanics. To validate the device, healthy participants underwent pulmonary function testing and respiratory analysis under baseline, static restriction, and dynamic restriction conditions. Significant reductions in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were observed under restrictions compared to baseline. Other respiratory metrics, including inspiratory volume, inspiratory time, and peak inspiratory airflow, also showed significant differences, highlighting distinct effects of static and dynamic restrictions. Pressure variability tests confirmed the reproducibility and adjustability of applied loads, while displacement data from linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs) validated the device's ability to distinguish static and dynamic effects. This device addresses prior limitations by enabling precise, reproducible loading and independent control of chest and abdominal restrictions. Its versatility supports research into respiratory diseases, extreme environments, and respiratory mechanics. The results demonstrate the device's potential to advance respiratory function research and expand its clinical and experimental applications.

This study aims to explore the impact of implementing the Milk Run method in supply chain of plastic industry in PT RPI. By reducing the distance of 48 km per day, equivalent to 1,200 km in a month of deliveries, the research highlights significant changes in logistics’ efficiency, cost savings, and carbon emission reduction. More connected travel patterns allow trucks to combine pick-ups or deliveries of multiple sources in single trip to enhance the overall logistics’ efficiency. Reducing the distance contributes to saving transportation’s cost by lowering fuel consumption and maintaining vehicle expenses. Reducing a 1,200 km distance, assumed that a fuel consumption rate of 7 km per liter and a carbon emission rate of 2.68 kg CO2 per liter, could result in a substantial carbon emission reduction. This study provides a foundation for further research, including route and scheduling optimization, in-depth environmental impact analysis, and Milk Run implementation in other industries. The findings offer a comprehensive overview of Milk Run effectiveness in the plastic industry, emphasize operational advantages, economic impact, and commitment to sustainability.

ABSTRACT Bio-based materials, including wood, non-woody plants, marine materials, and biochar resources, have attracted interest for use in cement and concrete composites in recent years. This review investigates the diverse resources of bio-based materials and their functionalities in different aspects of concrete composites, such as mechanical properties, carbon capture, sound absorption, and self-healing. The results show that plant-based materials play an important role in reinforcement fillers and present functionalities for carbon capture, energy storage, and crack self-healing. By incorporating 0.1–4% of various types of bio-based materials, it demonstrates that there is no adverse effect on the mechanical properties of concrete composites. This incorporation also results in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions through C-capture, thereby offering greener construction products. There is limited documentation on the concrete self-healing functionality of seashells, eggshells, and biochar-based materials. However, plant-based materials exhibit good self-healing functionality, making it possible for the advancement of functional bio-based materials in the construction industry. These advantages include good mechanical properties, good self-healing functionality, and reduced CO2 emissions.

Recent estimates put the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and Ethereum at an average of 64 and 26 million tonnes of CO2 per year, respectively. To address this growing problem, several possible approaches have been proposed in the literature: creating alternative blockchain consensus mechanisms, applying redundancy reduction techniques, utilizing renewable energy sources, and employing energy-efficient devices, etc. In this paper, we follow the second avenue and propose an efficient approach based on reinforcement learning that improves the block broadcasting scheme in blockchain networks. The analysis and experimental results confirmed that the proposed improvement of the block propagation scheme could cleverly handle network dynamics and achieve better results than the default approach. Additionally, our technical integration of the simulator and developed RL environment can be used as a complete solution for further study of new schemes and protocols that use RL or other ML techniques.

Biomass ironmaking is crucial for carbon reduction in the ironmaking industry. To understand this process better, the iron production capacity and energy requirements of biomass were studied. A thermodynamic equilibrium model and energy consumption model for the biomass and iron oxide reduction system at 100–1300 °C was established by the minimum free Gibbs energy method. The effects of factors such as biomass type, temperature, and initial amount of iron oxide on the system were analyzed. The research results indicated that the maximum ironmaking capacity of biomass was determined by the element content of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in biomass and temperature. The equilibrium H2/(H2 + H2O) and CO/(CO + CO2) at the maximum iron yield were affected not by the biomass species and element content, but by temperature. The reduction capacity of the ten selected biomass types decreased with a temperature increase from 700 °C to 1300 °C. For the 1 kg of pine sawdust and iron oxide system, the maximum equilibrium state amount of metallic iron was 23.05 mol at 718 °C, and the minimum system energy consumption per ton Fe was 1.16 GJ at 800 °C and 1.18 GJ at 900 °C. These research results will provide a key basis for a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanism of biomass ironmaking.

This paper presents a flexible heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modeling framework developed for building digital twin implementation. The framework is showcased for the modeling and simulation of four ventilation systems in a 8500 m2 university building. The developed model includes multiple objective model predictive control (MPC) with three objectives: electricity cost, indoor air quality and CO2 emission attributed to electricity consumption. A control strategy comparison is conducted between several MPC solutions with different objective weightings and a rule-based control strategy, which emulates the current system control. A novel approach for air quality evaluation is proposed and used for the MPC modeling and strategy comparison in this study. In this comparison, a “balanced” MPC strategy reduces energy costs by 18% compared to rule-based control while also providing significantly better air quality. An economic strategy achieves 24% savings with some air quality reduction, while an air-quality-focused strategy provides nearly “perfect” air quality with 11% savings. Finally, an environmental strategy shows the potential for prioritizing CO2 emissions over electricity costs. In this way, the strategy comparison illustrates the potential of MPC for the efficient operation and flexible objective prioritization according to stakeholder interests.

Energy shortage and greenhouse gas emission have become bottlenecks in current society development. Improving the efficiency of energy conversion and utilization systems through waste heat recovery and reduction of greenhouse gas through CO2 capture/conversion are important solutions. Both can be achieved simultaneously by utilizing high-temperature flue gas or CO2 in flue gas for organic matter gasification, which is called the flue gas chemical recuperative cycle. This paper provides a meaningful review of the latest advancements in the flue gas chemical recuperative cycle system, focusing on its application in diverse gasification systems for organic matters such as methane, sludge, etc. Additionally, this paper reviews methods for the integration of flue gas gasification into energy conversion and utilization systems under the application scenarios of gas turbine flue gas, air combustion flue gas, and oxy-fuel combustion flue gas. Subsequently, in order to improve the conversion efficiency of the chemical recuperative cycle, the applications of emerging gasification technologies in the field of the flue gas recuperative cycle, such as microwave gasification, plasma gasification, etc., are briefly summarized, offering an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms by which new methods enhance the process. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the field are discussed, and a comprehensive outlook is provided to guide future research.

In reviewing the literature related to risks of leakage or seepage of CO2 into the near surface, it can become challenging to evaluate what the material risks and consequences might be. This is particularly the case for policy makers, regulators, stakeholders and the general public. IEAGHG commissioned a study to help present some of the well-known canon (to long-term researchers of CCS) in measurement, monitoring and verification of CO2 in the subsurface, and how leakage might result in any material consequences to the environment or public health in the shallow subsurface and surface environments. This was done using a causal network approach to illustrate/review various aspects of what could happen during leakage events and evaluate the likelihood and consequences of those potential events in a consistent manner. The basis of this work was a comprehensive review of previous research related to the environmental impacts of CO2 leakage including natural analogues, controlled-release field trials, geochemical laboratory experiments and numerical modelling studies. Critical aspects for describing and quantifying consequences include CO2 leakage pathways, rates and volumes, sensitivity of environmental receptors, animals and humans, and general climate risks, limits of detection using state of the art equipment and what mitigation options might be available. Causal networks are an effective approach to demonstrating the chain of effects, risks and mitigation strategies for specific target locations for onshore gas developments. A simplified offline tool was developed that uses many of the same workflows to summarize/review different aspects of CCS before highlighting risks, consequences and mitigation strategies that are currently described in the literature. A series of nodes make up the flow path from the major driving force, that is emissions reduction, through to endpoints or impacts. Definitions and detailed reviews underpin each node, and a systematic assessment concludes each nodal section. This allows the reader to consider aspects that are of interest, rather than following a linear and traditional reporting format. The broad conclusion from this work is that while many of the processes are possible, they only have material impacts in rare instances that mostly can be mitigated. It should be noted that this is a global evaluation and that the same workflow may result in a different risk assessment locally for a specific geographic area and project. This key message is important to communicate in a clear, facts-based approach to help the deployment of CCS projects.

In patients with acute brain injury (ABI), optimizing cerebral perfusion parameters relies on multimodal monitoring. This include data from systemic monitoring–mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2 ), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ), hemoglobin levels (Hb), and temperature–as well as neurological monitoring–intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities. We hypothesized that these parameters alone were not sufficient to assess the risk of cerebral ischemia. We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of patients admitted in our ICU between 2015 and 2021. Patients with ABI and multimodal neuromonitoring were included. ABI included traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The relationship between jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO 2 ) and cerebral perfusion parameters was analyzed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on SjvO 2 , with a threshold of 60% used to define cerebral ischemia. We compared the parameters used to optimize cerebral perfusion between groups and their diagnosis accuracy for cerebral ischemia was evaluated. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association between the guideline-recommended therapeutic targets and the risk of cerebral ischemia. 601 evaluations from 96 patients with simultaneous ICP, SjvO 2 and TCD were analyzed. Poor relationships were found between SjvO 2 and the parameters of cerebral perfusion. TCD flow velocities and PaCO 2 were lower in the cerebral ischemia group while MAP, ICP and CPP were not different between groups. Most ischemic episodes occurred despite ICP < 22 mmHg and CPP ≥ 60 mmHg. For the diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, only TCD parameters and PaCO 2 were associated with an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.5 but with a low accuracy. In multivariable analysis, the only guideline-recommended therapeutic target associated with a reduction of cerebral ischemia was a diastolic flow velocity (FV) > 20 cm.s −1 .

The recovery of natural resources has become a major challenge; in recent years, many economic players have focused on reusing herb residues to formulate a new generation of innovative eco-friendly construction materials. In this study, the incorporation of Needle Grass Residue powder (NGP) derived from crushing herb that originates from the "stipa tenacissima Plant as a partial replacement for coarse aggregates in the precast concrete was explored to assess its economic, environmental, mechanical, and physical impacts. Various NGP replacement levels (0%, 10%, 25%, and 50%) were analyzed. Economic assessments showed a significant reduction in concrete production costs with increasing NGP content, indicating potential cost savings. Environmentally, NGP's addition contributed to substantial reductions in CO2 emissions and improved resource conservation, highlighting its potential for enhancing sustainability. Mechanical properties such as compressive and tensile strengths decreased with higher NGP percentages, suggesting a trade-off between cost and structural performance. Physically, the concrete mixtures with higher NGP content exhibited increased porosity and water absorption, affecting the durability. The results demonstrate that while NGP incorporation offers economic and environmental benefits, it also necessitates careful consideration of its impacts on precast concrete's mechanical and physical properties. This comprehensive analysis underscores the need for a balanced approach to optimize NGP usage in concrete for sustainable and functional construction applications.

The International Energy Agency(IEA) predicts that by 2050, hydrogen and ammonia will account for approximately 19% of the global energy demand. Ammonia, with a high hydrogen content and a higher boiling point than hydrogen, presents itself as a favorable energy storage medium. This study investigates the effects of ammonia injection position and coal grade on combustion characteristics and emissions in coal-fired power plants as part of the transition towards carbon neutrality. ADTF(Ammonia Drop Tube Furnace) experiments were conducted to assess NOx, CO2, N2O, and NH3 slip emissions under low-load conditions. The findings from ADTF experiments indicate that ammonia injection position significantly impacts combustion characteristics and emissions. Coal B, a lower grade coal with high volatile matter, exhibited better combustion characteristics and lower UBC emissions compared to Coal A. NOx emissions were influenced by the ammonia injection position, with a low injection position leading to NOx reduction due to the effect of ammonia as a reducing agent in the combustion environment. Mixed coal showed trends similar to Coal A, but it could serve as a solution for utilizing high-grade coal and exhibited better emission levels in some aspects compared to single coal cases. So, underscores the potential of ammonia-coal co-firing in achieving significant emission reductions and enhancing the combustion efficiency of coal-fired boilers.

The Philippines aspires for a clean energy future but has become increasingly reliant on imported fossil fuels due to rising energy demands. Despite renewable energy targets and a coal moratorium, emissions reductions have yet to materialize. This study evaluates the potential of offshore wind (floating and fixed), floating solar PV, in-stream tidal, and nuclear power to contribute to a Net-Zero energy plan for the Philippines, utilizing the Open-Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS). Seven scenarios were analyzed, including least-cost, renewable energy targets; Net-Zero emissions; and variations in offshore wind growth and nuclear power integration. Floating solar PV and offshore wind emerged as key decarbonization technologies, with uptake in all scenarios. Achieving Net-Zero CO2 emissions by 2050 proved technically feasible but requires substantial capital, particularly after 2037. Current renewable energy targets are inadequate to induce emissions reductions; and a higher target of ~42% by 2035 was found to be more cost-effective. The addition of nuclear power showed limited cost and emissions benefits. Emissions reductions were projected to mainly occur after 2038, highlighting the need for more immediate policy action. Recommendations include setting a higher renewables target, offshore wind capacity goals, a roadmap for floating solar PV, and better incentives for private investment in renewables and electric transport.

This study evaluates three CO₂ point sources to establish criteria for recommending demonstration sites through a Techno-Economic Assessment (TEA). Using uniform design criteria, the analysis examined key process configurations, including flue gas treatment, CO₂ capture, solvent regeneration, compression, and liquefaction. The study was based on a capture capacity of 1 million tons of CO₂ annually (1 MTPA) at 90% efficiency, utilizing a commercially available CO₂ absorbent (30 wt% monoethanolamine, MEA). The resulting design packages provided key economic and operational metrics such as utility consumption, footprint, CAPEX, and OPEX for comparative analysis.Key findings reveal the significant influence of flue gas CO₂ concentration on process performance and costs, assuming the same CO2 capture capacity (1 MTPA). The results indicate that as the CO₂ concentration in flue gas decreases, the capture cost tends to increase. Consequently, coal-fired power plants were identified as the most suitable candidates for an initial large-scale demonstration project due to their high CO₂ concentration and relatively lower costs. An additional analysis evaluated the potential improvements of applying an advanced solvent, developed domestically for CO₂ capture in coal-fired power plants. The advanced solvent demonstrated a 44% reduction in regeneration energy, leading to a significant reduction in overall OPEX by up to 23%. These findings provide valuable insights for early-stage assessments of large-scale CCS demonstration projects, supporting South Korea's efforts to achieve its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).

Ammonia has emerged as a carbon-free fuel to replace conventional fossil fuels for CO2 emission reduction. However, it has a low flame speed, low flame temperature, and potential for high NOx emissions compared to conventional fuels. Computation fluid dynamics(CFD) can play a key role in developing industrial ammonia-fueled burners to achieve stable ignition and suppress NOx-forming reactions. However, the large computational domain restricts the use of advanced models such as eddy dissipation concept(EDC) for consideration of the detailed reaction mechanism with turbulence-chemistry interaction. In this study, the performance of the steady and unsteady diffusion flamelet models(S/UDFM) for ammonia combustion was evaluated in a 80 kWth non-premixed swirl burner. Although S/UDFM overestimated N2O emissions, it effectively captured NOx and ammonia emission trends similar to that of EDC under different combustion conditions. When compared to experiments, S/UDFM predicted NO and NH3 emission trend effectively, making it a computationally efficient reaction model for CFD applications to design evaluation of industrial ammonia combustion systems.

To address the pressing demand for hyphenated in situ characterization of the electrode–electrolyte interfaces at the molecular level, we report herein a technical note to demonstrate the hyphenation of in situ electrochemical surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS). The core setup incorporates a top-down configured Raman optic fiber head loaded on a 3-dimension positioning module and a bottom-up configured attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) spectroelectrochemical cell accommodated in a custom-designed optical accessory. The feasibility of this integrated design is initially validated by the simultaneous measurement of two model systems, namely, potential dependent adsorption of pyridine on a Au film electrode and the CO2 reduction reaction on a Cu film electrode by in situ SEIRAS and SHINERS, yielding distinct and complementary spectral information.

Silica is generally regarded as an inert support in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, including hydrogenation-dehydrogenation catalysis, on which hydrogen spillover is debated. Since supported hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts are generally activated in H2 as reducing gas at medium-high temperatures (350–500 °C), we suspected that hydride formation could occur during such catalyst pretreatments. In this work, we investigated silicon oxyhydride (SiHxOy, SiHx for brevity) formation during the reduction pretreatment of a set of Ni/SiO2 catalyst materials using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). We observed two distinct vibrational bands located at ~ 2275 and ~ 2257 cm−1, which we assigned to SiH and SiH2 species, as supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Since these vibrational bands are absent after hydrogenation of pure silica, we propose that the formation of hydrides was caused by hydrogen spillover from Ni metal nanoparticles supported on silica. The decrease in the band areas with rising temperature was used in a van t ‘Hoff plot to yield enthalpy values of ~ 26 and ~ 42 kJ/mol for the apparent reaction of hydride species, suggesting an equilibrium with IR-inactive or very mobile species. The reactivity of the SiHx species was also investigated, by dosing methanol, water and CO2 as probe molecules on the pre-reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Methanol reacted the fastest with the hydride species, followed by water, while CO2 did not show any interaction with the hydrides. We anticipate this work will contribute to changing the view of silica as an inert support material, and to the understanding of H spillover in more general.

CO2 conversion technologies utilizing solar light have garnered significant attention for establishing sustainable societies. Despite the extensive investigation of photothermal approaches, the effect of direct light irradiation on oxygen carriers on the reverse water gas shift chemical looping (RWGS-CL) reaction has not yet been explored. In this study, we investigated the effects of light irradiation on the activity of Pt-loaded metal oxides in the RWGS-CL reaction at 473 K. The Pt/MoO3–x material exhibited remarkable activity for the photo-assisted RWGS-CL reaction, which was attributed to its high concentration of oxygen vacancies and photothermal property. Moreover, it is notable that the light-induced heating was more effective than uniform heating in the exothermic H2-reduction step due to the preferable temperature gradient in the material. This study opens up new potentials for the photothermal-assisted CL method, including the separation of the endothermic and exothermic processes of reactions and the strategic use of light-induced temperature gradients.

An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron‐donating anion, naphthoxide, and electron‐accepting cation, acridinium, has been synthesized. It is in equilibrium between a folded conformer having a smaller permanent dipole moment with visible light absorption and a twisted conformer having a larger permanent dipole moment with NIR light absorption. The overcrowded ethylene shows multiple NIR chromisms, such as solvatochromism, thermochromism, mechanochromism, vapochromism, halochromism, and amphoteric electrochromisms, which are caused by the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers or by controlling the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor moiety and the LUMO of the acceptor moiety. The small difference between the HOMO energy level of naphthoxide moiety and the LUMO energy level of acridinium moiety, and their weak interaction are crucial for NIR absorption and large dipole moment in the twisted conformer. The drastic change in the ratio of folded and twisted conformers by changing the polarity of solvents, the detection of CO2, and the disappearance of NIR absorption by electrochemical oxidation and reduction are noteworthy for this new type of organic dye.

Background/Objectives On March 11, 2020, our hospital adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic by becoming a temporary COVID facility, leading to the suspension or delegation of non-COVID services. Among the international IBD community, there were significant concerns regarding the neglect of immunocompromised IBD patients and their increased vulnerability to COVID-19. To address these challenges, the COVID-19 ECCO Taskforce recommended the implementation of telehealth. Following this recommendation, our hospital&#039;s IT department integrated audiovisual hardware and software solutions to facilitate virtual consultations. This approach enabled patients and their local physicians to receive formal reports comparable to those issued during standard in-person care. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis who participated in telemedicine consultations. Average distances and time saved were calculated using Google Maps, while carbon emissions and carbon footprint reductions were determined using tools from CarbonFootprint.com and CO2Meter.com. Results Between August 11, 2021, and June 15, 2023, 107 telehealth consultations were completed. Patients benefited from reduced travel distances, with an average saving of 168.28 km per consultation and a total reduction of 18,006 km. Travel time savings averaged 2 hours and 22 minutes per consultation, amounting to a total of 252 hours saved. The reduction in carbon emissions was calculated at 3.26 tons, equivalent to the annual absorption capacity of 109 fully grown trees, considering an individual tree absorbs approximately 21.77 kg of CO2 annually. These findings underscore telemedicine’s role in reducing environmental impact while enhancing patient convenience. Conclusions The adoption of telehealth has successfully optimized outpatient clinic operations, maintaining high-quality patient outcomes while contributing to environmental sustainability.

Water and wastewater infrastructure is a major energy consumer and an important source of global greenhouse gas emissions: on average, 10.6 kg CO2/m3 of water is consumed. The European Environment Agency in 2019 estimated these emissions from wastewater treatment operations in Europe alone at over 25 MtCO2eq. Increased demand (in terms of volumes and quality) in the water sector raises expectations of future increases if appropriate measures will not be undertaken. Many water companies and utilities associations have been or are developing plans to achieve net zero on an industry-wide basis by 2050, and some have cut emissions by 50% in the last ten years. About half of energy-related emissions from water sector facilities could be significantly abated by applying existing technologies, and close to 95% of this objective could be achieved at zero or negative cost with proper innovation strategies. This paper examines and discusses issues, possibilities, and technologies that could be considered in planning the reduction of water and WW-related GHG emissions with a holistic view of the entire water sector, based on a recent literature review.

GLJ will deliver a comprehensive update on the current status of policies and incentives supporting economically viable Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) deployment in Canada and in the United States (U.S.). Key components of the paper include a comparative analysis of the incentives in each jurisdiction; deterministic economical modelling of theoretical CCS projects based on public data sources; scenario analysis of the CCS economic models based on different assumptions of incentives eligibility; and the application of stochastic modelling techniques to assess the impact of project cost uncertainties under the varying scenarios of incentive eligibility. The analysis will begin with a description of relevant CCS policies and incentives in both the U.S. and Canada as to contextualize the functionality and potential economic impact that each policy has on eligible CCS projects. Canadian policies and incentives that will be described and subsequently considered for inputs into project economic modelling scenarios include:1) Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Carbon Pricing2) Federal CCUS Investment Tax Credit (CCUS-ITC)3) Alberta Carbon Capture Incentive Program (ACCIP)4) Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD)U.S. policies and incentives that will be described and subsequently considered for inputs into project economic modelling scenarios include:1) Inflation Reduction Act Section 45Q Carbon Capture Tax Credits (45Q Credits)2) California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits (LCFS Credits)3) Voluntary carbon market credits (i.e., American Carbon Registry Credits)Following the description of relevant policies and incentives for both Canada and the U.S., a deterministic economic cash flow model will be presented. The economic model will be based on a hypothetical CCS project that will inject at a flat rate of 1.0 million tons per annum (MTPA) into a subsurface saline aquifer at approximately 2,000 meters depth over an assumed operational project life of 25 years. Real-world cost estimates, including capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX), will be derived from existing CCS projects that publish publicly available cost and operations data. The physical scope of the model will encompass costs and operations related to the development and operation of only the CO2 Transportation and Storage (T&S) infrastructure, as to run the economics from the perspective of an open access CO2 T&S Hub Operator (i.e., "CCS Hub" or "CCS-as-a-service" business model). GLJ includes an important step in its modelling and evaluation process by applying ranges of uncertainty to median project cost estimates through stochastic modelling techniques. Stochastic modelling integrates probabilistic distributions for key input variables, such as capital expenditures, fixed/variable operational costs, service tolls and fees, and the varying levels of funding eligibility where appropriate. This methodology generates a spectrum of potential economic outcomes across a range of logically distributed input parameters, providing a comprehensive understanding of economic possibilities associated with the CCS project scope as described above (CO2 T&S hub, 1 MTPA injection rate, 25-year life, etc.). The findings of the analysis will shed light on the intricate economic dynamics of CCS projects under varying policy and incentive scenarios. The results will be presented through the comparison of project specific economic outputs such as Net Present Value (NPV), Profit-to-Investment Ratio (PIR), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and breakeven cost per tonne sequestered ($/tCO2) for both the American and Canadian CCS project scenarios. This will provide a strong visual to show the comparative economics of CCS investment between the two jurisdictions. Understanding these complex dynamics is crucial for policymakers, investors, and industry stakeholders as they navigate the path towards sustainable and economically viable CCS solutions.

Reservoir simulation has been a primary tool in the oil and gas industry for decades, to model the fluid (oil-gas-water) transport in porous media to eventually predict hydrocarbon production. However, with the growing concerns over climate change and greenhouse gases emissions, flow simulation is being adapted with new features to account for CO2 storage and GHG reduction options. The new challenges associated with gas storage simulations - such as monitoring the gas migration and studying the risk of leakages - require the use of large models (i.e., regional aquifers) and large timescale simulations (1000 years). Moreover, new physical phenomena associated with gas injection, such as trapping mechanisms, gas solubility and mobility, should be accounted for. These new challenges require advanced numerical methods and high-performance computing to achieve reliable and efficient results. In this work, we present the new functionalities developed, such as the implementation of new equations of state, along with the applications of these new developments on operational studies for gas injection and storage. The main objectives of this work are to demonstrate the benefits of using a novel reservoir simulator for gas storage applications, and to illustrate the impact of the different parameters on the forecast of gas injection.

Batch-cell provides a quick way to test the performance of an electrochemical catalyst. A fundamental understanding of physics behind the batch-cell operation could shed light on parameters that either could be fine-tuned to get the desired performance, or by careful optimization, overall performance of the batch-cell could be improved. Therefore, a one-dimensional numerical model is developed to study the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction in a batch-cell with three different working electrode configurations: solid electrode, glassy carbon electrode, and gas diffusion layer electrode. Experimental results of two Cu-based catalysts are used to obtain the electrochemical kinetic parameters, and to validate the numerical model. Simulation results demonstrate that both gas diffusion layer electrode, and glassy carbon electrode with porous catalyst layer have a superior performance over solid electrode in terms of total current density. Furthermore, we studied the impact of key parameters of batch-cell with glassy carbon electrode such as boundary layer thickness, catalyst layer thickness, catalyst layer porosity, electrolyte nature, and strength of an electrolyte on total current density at a fixed applied cathodic potential of -1.0 V vs RHE.

The current linear mode of production and consumption generates high environmental impacts at its final stage. In Mexico, urban waste is managed by local authorities, which is a relevant challenge considering the continuous increase of waste generation, the low efficiency in waste collection, and the high investment needed for a proper final disposal. Organic waste in Mexico is estimated at 56,427 TPD. Anaerobic decomposition of municipal solid waste generates mainly methane, a toxic gas that pollutes the air and has a global warming potential of 22 CO2 eq. At disposal sites, it is important to manage waste properly to control, manage, exploit, and/or mitigate GHG emissions. The use of biogas for power generation can be an alternative to valorize it, reducing GHG emissions to meet the international GHG reduction commitments, considering the importance of this sector in the national emissions inventory. This 50chapter presents an overview of the problem of air emissions related to the waste sector in Mexico and the challenges related with biogas management faced by Mexican municipalities throughout the case study of the generation and energy potential of biogas in San Luis Potosí, a Mexican municipality, analyzing social, legal, and technological barriers obstructing progress and proposing proper solutions.

This research aimed to investigate the potential of using alkali activation technology to valorize steel slag and bauxite residue for the production of high-performance pavement blocks. By utilizing these industrial by-products, the study seeks to reduce their environmental impact and support the development of sustainable construction materials. Lab-scale testing showed that bauxite pavers showed a decrease in mechanical strength with increasing replacement of ordinary Portland cement. Partial replacement up to 20% still exceeded 30 MPa in compressive strength. Steel slag-based pavers achieved the 30 MPa threshold required for the application with selected mix designs. Pilot-scale production-optimized formulations and standards testing, including freeze–thaw resistance, confirmed the technical viability of these products. Life cycle analysis indicated a 25–27% reduction in CO2 emissions for slag-based tiles compared to traditional concrete tiles. Moreover, using industrial residue reduced mineral resource depletion. This study examined the properties of the resulting alkali-activated binders, their ecological benefits, and their performance compared to conventional materials. Through a comprehensive analysis of these applications, our research promotes the circular economy and the advancement of sustainable construction products.

This paper explores the future of manufacturing plants in large vehicle manufacturing through the lens of a single large European vehicle manufacturing complex. An example of a plant that originally massmanufactured a single line of products, the complex is currently navigating a shift to more complex mixed model production and the production of electric vehicle powertrains. Using innovative datasets generated through a year-long stakeholder co-design process, a diverse set of partners collectively formed a project to design new, data-driven approaches to the challenge. The project collected and explored diverse data sources, including product bills of materials, facility layout data, current manufacturing system capabilities, energy usage and carbon generation, machine uptime and failures, factory control strategies, planning processes, and product quality data. The paper provides a summary of the explored data, key analyses, feedback from the stakeholders, early technical project interpretations, as well as broader project reflections and contextual descriptions of the factory-particularly of its goals and current challenges.

This study aims to explore the explosive behaviors of CO/H2/CO2/air premixed gases in a narrow-gap disk burner, focusing on the effects of volume fraction of hydrogen (γ) and equivalence ratios (Φ) on flame evolution and pressure characteristics. The results show that the folding of the flame front is enhanced as the Φ decreases. However, the change in fold degree is negligible when the Φ decreases from 1.6 to 1.2. Pmax increases with Φ initially then decreases, reaching a peak value of 308 kPa at Φ = 1.2. Pmax is positively correlated with γ. Increasing the Φ and γ significantly reduces the time to reach Pmax and the propagation time, with a maximum reduction of 53.2%. Regardless of variations in Ф or γ, the flame stretch rate exhibits two peaks when the flame front reaches approximately 17 mm and 80 mm, indicating that this trend is independent of the gas composition. Analysis of the effective Lewis number, thermal expansion rate, and flame thickness reveals that thermo-diffusive instability plays a key role in the formation of flame folds in lean combustion conditions. This study provides new insights into the explosion characteristics of premixed gases and flame instabilities, contributing to improved burner design and combustion safety control.

Abstract Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with neuroinflammation and heightened production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain from overactive NADPH Oxidase 2 (NOX2). The current study examines whether administration of a novel, brain‐penetrant NOX2 inhibitor (CPP11G & CPP11H) reduces amyloid plaque load and improves AD‐associated vascular dysfunction in a male APP‐PS1 mouse model of AD. Method Intraperitoneal injections of CPP11G (n = 1) or CPP11H (n = 2) three times per week began at 9‐10 months of age in the treatment APP‐PS1 group (15 mg/kg). The control group of age‐matched APP‐PS1 mice received no treatment (n = 7). All mice were implanted with a 5mm cranial window for awake optical imaging at least 2 weeks prior to onset of treatment. Two‐photon microscopy was performed to assess longitudinal changes in amyloid plaque deposition after weekly Methoxy‐04 administration (1 mg/kg). Changes in plaque load were quantified weekly and averaged monthly. Additionally, wide‐field optical imaging at 620nm was performed with a 90s, 8% CO2 hypercapnic challenge. This imaging wavelength is sensitive to changes in blood oxygenation (OIS‐BOLD) to capture changes in vascular reactivity over time. Result Treatment with CPP11G/H shows a trend toward reduction in cortical plaque load when compared to an untreated cohort (Fig. 1). OIS‐BOLD results for vascular reactivity studies show a slight trend of improved vascular function over time with CPP11G/H treatment (Fig. 2). Conclusion Our preliminary findings show a strong trend in amyloid plaque reduction with ongoing CPP11G/H treatment in older‐aged AD mice and improved vascular function. Ongoing studies to increase the size of the treated cohort will reveal the reliability and statistical significance of CPP11G/H’s therapeutic benefits. We are also examining the impact of treatment on microglia activation and gliosis in APP‐PS1::CX3CR1‐GFP mice (Fig. 3).

The article analyzes current problems of improving the rules of law of the EAEU aimed at greening the transport systems of the member states. The research was carried out using general and special methods of scientific knowledge, including formal-logical, comparative law, etc. The features of the development of world transport systems in connection with the global energy transition are analyzed, and the lack of alternative to the transition to green technologies in transport, in particular, the electrification of transport systems, is emphasized. The expediency of taking collective measures at the level of an integration association is substantiated, allowing to minimize costs and increase the efficiency of greening the transport systems of the member states. Contains proposals for improving the legal norms of the EAEU, such as the First Package of Measures (Road Map) for cooperation between the EAEU member states within the framework of the climate agenda and Appendix No. 24 to the Treaty (Protocol on Coordinated (Agreed) Transport Policy. The feasibility of forming a specialized structure in the EEC is substantiated, the functions of which would include calculating optimal target indicators for the transition to environmentally friendly transport technologies. In general, according to the author, the development of the most promising directions of transport policy in the EAEU, taking into account the energy transition and reduction of CO2 emissions, should be carried out not only by the EAEU bodies and representatives of relevant ministries (transport, environmental protection, energy, etc.), but also with the involvement of a wide range of specialists and experts, as well as members of the business community represented by transport companies, environmental non-governmental organizations and representatives of the public. The results of the study can be applied in the legislative and law enforcement practice of the EAEU, the Republic of Belarus and other member states of the EAEU.

Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is a universal issue of significant concern in the petroleum industry, with the potential for enormous economic losses and casualties. This study focused on the effect of temperature on MIC and the corrosion mechanism. The corrosion rate, morphology, corrosion products, and microbial community composition of produced fluid samples from the Zhanjiang oilfield were measured after anaerobic culture at 30 and 60 °C for 14 days. The corrosion rate of the Z1 and Z2 samples decreased with increasing temperature, while the corrosion rate of the Z3 sample changed from light corrosion to heavy corrosion. The Z1 sample was dominated by pitting corrosion, the Z2 sample had a relatively smooth surface, and the Z3 sample was observed to have one dimensional wormhole corrosion at 60 °C. The microbial community composition by 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) sequence showed that the bacterial communities were dominated by Pseudomonas and Bacillus, and the archaeal communities were mainly composed of Methanothermobacter, Methanosaeta, and Candidatus Nitrosotenuis, which was prevalent in Z3 samples at 60 °C. It suggested that MIC could be caused by extracellular electron transfer and reduction of nitrate or nitrite to N2 and NH4+ by bacteria, and utilization of CO2 to produce CH4 by archaea. Overall, the results of this study can provide comprehensive data and new insights into corrosion management strategies for oil fields.

Copper slag and tire char are both large-scale industrial solid wastes, which pose a huge threat to the environment if not treated appropriately. Copper slag has 41 wt.% iron content, which can meet the growing demand of iron and solve its handling problem. Tire char has 97 wt.% fixed carbon thus can be used as a reductant along with CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 as additives in carbothermal reduction process. Results showed that 0.11 moles of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 at 900 oC for 60 minutes give 98.9% and 95.4% iron recovery respectively. Microstructural evaluation of the product demonstrated that fayalite was converted to metallic iron through tire char reductant, along with CO2 from CaCO3 and H2 from Ca(OH)2 also played their parts for the reducing, decomposing, grain growing processes and releasing of iron from complex iron-hosting mineral i.e., fayalite. Aspen plus simulation indicated 0.69 mole ratio of calcium salts recovers 99% Fe from copper slag which is quite similar to the experimental investigation. By offering a new and environmental friendly approach for detailed investigation of iron recovery from copper slag, this study provides a technical route for handling copper slag waste.

The building sector accounts for 30% of worldwide final energy usage and 26% of global energy-linked emissions. In construction, innovative materials and systems can offer flexible, lightweight, energy-efficient solutions to achieve more efficient buildings. This study addresses the energy analysis and environmental impacts of retrofitting residential buildings in Monterusciello, Italy, using an innovative second-skin façade system design that incorporates 3D-printed and fabric modules. The purpose is to enhance energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of residential buildings originally constructed with prefabricated elements that have degraded over time. This research employed TRNSYS modelling to simulate energy consumption and environmental impacts at the single-building and whole-district levels, analysing the system’s effectiveness in reducing cooling and heating demands and using different materials for optimal performance. The results show that retrofitting with the second-skin façade system significantly reduces cooling energy demand by 30.2% and thermal energy demand by 3.84%, reaching a primary energy saving of 16.4% and 285 tons of CO2 emissions reduction for the whole district. The results highlight the potential of second-skin façade systems in improving energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, suggesting future research directions in material innovation and adaptive system development for district-wide applications.

Bioethanol-blended gasoline fuel is one of the alternatives for reducing CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. Since its production is still dependent on demand fluctuations and feedstock availability, an optimal supply chain design needs to be evaluated. A two-stage stochastic optimization model with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) was developed for designing the optimal bioethanol supply chain under the constraints of multi-feedstock second-generation biomass based on seasonal availability and demand uncertainty. Two optimization models were implemented. The goal of the first model was to maximize the expected profits of the supply chain based on the optimal combination of biomass type, plant location and biomass-bioethanol pathways. The second extension model focused on maximizing expected profits of the supply chain with the least amount of impact on the environment via the reduction of net emission to result in an optimal supply chain. The validation process was then performed by comparing the stochastic and deterministic models in terms of plant location and operating decisions. The first model was applied to actual data of a Thailand case study involving 26 existing plants and agricultural residue availability. The optimization result illustrates that the stochastic model is 16% more profitable than the deterministic model for all random data sets. Furthermore, the extension model shows that carbon credit can contribute to around 5% of the total profit earned. Thus, the proposed models can address demand uncertainty in supply chain design and can be implemented by policymakers to achieve sustainable bioethanol production.

The demand for high-speed, multi-functionality, and miniaturization of devices increases with a general acceptance of mobile communication devices such as smartphones and smartwatches in the next-generation 5G and IoT era. Undoubtedly, the semiconductor package of the mobile communication devices needs to be downsized with keeping function. One of the solutions is embedded die substrate technology, which is able to integrate passive components and active components with the minimum volume in the same body to implement heterogeneous integration. However, in the conventional embedded die substrate, the embedded die is fully covered by the substrate materials. This fact results in the generation of significant residual stress in the embedded components. Accordingly, the stress-sensitive components such as micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) sensor, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonator, and surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter are regarded unsuitable for embedding. In our previous study, we newly developed an embedded die substrate structure having a hollow chamber at both sides of the die to mitigate a severe limitation for the stress-sensitive devices [1]. Measurements of stress in a sensor chip embedded in substrate have indicated a significant reduction in stress achieved by the formation of the hollow chamber. The results have also suggested technology options for further reduction of stress. This paper will report the formation of slots in the resin material at the periphery of the die, which is newly developed for stress-free embedded die. The manufacturing flow of embedded die substrate with a hollow chamber starts from the formation of the cavity core frame using a conventional PCB process. The through-hole cavity is formed on an FR4 core frame by a router. The single-sided adhesive tacky tape, which enables to hold the die, is laminated by a roll laminator at the bottom side of the frame. The die is placed into the cavity with a face-down using a flip-chip bonder. After that, the cavity filling material is laminated by a vacuum laminator from the opposite side of the tacky tape. The die into the cavity is completely covered by filling material and proceed the cure at 190 °C for 60 min. After die embedding, the thin layer of the filling material on the die is removed by CO2 laser ablation. After that, the tacky tape is peeled off at room temperature. Accordingly, both side of the die is exposed into the air, and the die is only held at the peripheral by the filling material. After embedding the die, a 6-um-thick copper redistribution (RDL) layer is formed by a semi-additive process (SAP) to connect the IO pads on the die. Then, the hollow chamber at both sides was formed by using cavity prepreg and FR4 core as a cap layer. Finally, laser via, 2nd copper RDL, solder mask, and singulation proceed, then the embedded die substrate is finalized. As a result, cavities are formed at the topside and bottom side of the die, and the die is mechanically held by the filling material only at the periphery. The above process was applied to embedding a piezo-resistance gauge chip, which is able to measure the stress and its distribution generated at the chip surface and evolution of the stress with the progress of the fabrication steps. After completing the packaging, the measurement was extended to the temperature dependency from -60°C to 100°C. The results clearly showed a significant reduction of residual die stress. They also revealed the effects of the material properties of the filling resin. However, even with low modulus filling material, the residual stress remained more than 22 MPa at 50°C environments. To further reduce stress on the die for stress-free packaging, we newly introduce slits in the filling material at the periphery of the die. CO2 laser pulses were applied around the die to make a through-hole via or a through-hole slit in the filling material. We report a change in stress with the ratio of the slit from zero up to 80% as measured with the piezo-resistance gauge chip. Moreover, the effects of the position of the slit are discussed by taking stress concentration at the corner of the die into consideration. To summarize, this paper reports a newly developed fabrication process of embedded die substrate technology for mechanical stress-free packaging. The characteristic of the laser ablation is fully utilized to form a stress-releasing structure around the embedded die. This new technology will enable heterogeneous integration of stress-sensitive components in an embedded die substrate.

This study investigated the physio-biochemical and antioxidative responses in different salt-sensitive sunflower genotypes: GP-4030 and BARI Surzumukhi 2 as newly identified tolerant genotypes, PS-2 as sensitive and Hysan 33 as standard tolerant. Salt stresses caused higher reduction in relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll (Chl) content, K+ and K+/Na+ ratio, photosynthetic rate (pN), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), and intercellular CO2 concentration rate (Ci) in salt-sensitive genotype. This genotype had higher Na+, superoxide (O2.-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid peroxidation (MDA) and proline (Pro) content than the tolerant genotypes. The tolerant genotypes maintained higher Pro content than the salt-sensitive genotypes under salt stress. All the tolerant genotypes had higher increment of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities under salinity (12 dS m-1) than the salt-sensitive genotype. Similarly, increment of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity was higher in the tolerant genotypes, but glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was higher in salt-sensitive genotype. However, both monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) activities decreased with salinity level. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity increased in all the genotypes under salinity and was higher in the tolerant genotypes. Higher accumulation of Pro, along with improved physiological and biochemical parameters in the tolerant genotypes, can confer tolerance by reducing oxidative damage through up-regulating antioxidant defense under salinity.

This study explores the impact of sodium silicate on wood ash blended cement concrete, which contributes significantly to CO2 emissions. This research holds great potential for the construction industry by aiding in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, conserving natural resources, and promoting waste minimization. The specific research objectives are Characterizing sand, granite, and wood ash, Producing concrete mixes with wood ash and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) replacements of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%, and determine their compressive strength, workability, density, and water absorption, and Developing a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to determine optimal proportions of cement, w/c ratio, wood ash, and sodium silicate to achieve target compressive strength, workability, water absorption, and density in concrete mixes. Concrete specimens were tested for compressive strength, workability, density, and water absorption. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model is significant because it is designed to capture historical information of time series data and is suitable for predicting long-term nonlinear series. The LSTM predicted compressive strength based on inputs of cement, water/cement ratio, sodium silicate, and wood ash. Results indicated that sodium silicate significantly enhanced early compressive strength and workability, making this blend a viable option for sustainable construction where early strength is essential.

Approximately 20% of CO2 emissions from Japanese households are attributed to heating usage. Consequently, as part of its climate change policy, the Ministry of the Environment has promoted the “WARM BIZ” campaign, which encourages setting room temperatures to about 20 °C during heating, through practices such as layering clothing. However, according to the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of clothing, the environmental impacts of clothing production, washing, and drying are significant. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate heating usage within the clothing lifecycle to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction effect of practicing WARM BIZ. In this study, we calculated the household heating energy consumption in four regions of Japan, and, by incorporating these data, estimated the GHG emissions over the clothing’s lifecycle, from production and use to disposal. The results showed that those practicing WARM BIZ had approximately 9 to 26% lower GHG emissions over the entire lifecycle than those who were not. Furthermore, by using the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index, it was shown that by adding a light long-sleeved shirt (0.18 clo), light long pants (0.18 clo), and a cardigan (0.37 clo) to the standard clothing scenario, the room temperature could be set 3.1 °C lower than the current setting, potentially reducing GHG emissions over the entire lifecycle by approximately 18%.

Adapting to climate change and controlling carbon emissions have emerged as significant challenges faced by the international community. The high-quality pedestrian space system of TOD blocks, as an important means for carbon reduction and carbon sink increase in cities, showcases the effect of green intensification and low-carbon sustainable urban space development. In this study, by combining the research on low-carbon block creation and urban microclimate, focusing on the technical process of the three stages of pre-treatment, core calculation, and post-treatment, comprehensively considering the three elements of microclimate, namely wind, heat, and carbon, and their influencing parameters, and introducing a CFD simulation method for porous media, a CFD simulation technology framework for microclimate improvement in urban design is constructed. Through the spatial visualization of the software solution calculation results and the correlation and comparative analysis of the measured data, we quantitatively analyze the coupling relationship between the block morphology and the comprehensive environment of wind, heat, and carbon. The research results indicate that by rationally adjusting indicator elements such as the height-to-width ratio of streets and entrance forms, it is possible to effectively facilitate cooling, ventilation, and air circulation within blocks and dilute the CO2 concentration. Finally, from the urban design element systems at the micro, meso, and macro levels, the adaptive planning strategies in the three dimensions of the spatial form, constituent elements, and planning guidelines of TOD blocks are summarized and refined, with the aim of achieving the low-carbon transformation of cities through the creation of a healthy microclimate environment.

Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a widely used arc quenching medium in the power industry, has been designated as a greenhouse gas, necessitating its reduction and replacement. Identifying eco-friendly alternatives to SF6 is a complex and expensive process, particularly since these alternatives often consist of gas mixtures that may function at varying pressures. In this work, we propose an efficient method for evaluating the arc quenching performance of gases or gas mixtures using the time-dependent Elenbaas–Heller and Boltzmann equations, which circumvents the computational costs associated with traditional 2D or 3D magnetohydrodynamic arc models. We segment the arc quenching process into four distinct stages: the thermal recovery stage, pre-dielectric recovery stage, post-dielectric recovery stage, and residual-gas cooling stage. To quantitatively assess arc quenching performance, we introduce two key parameters: recovery rate and recovery strength. The recovery rate is defined as the harmonic mean of thermal, pre-dielectric, and post-dielectric recovery rates. The recovery strength is characterized by the harmonic mean of the average recovery voltage, maximum critical electric field strength, and room-temperature dielectric strength. Our method is validated using several SF6 alternatives, including SF6 mixtures, C4F8, C4F7N, C5F10O, and their mixtures with CO2, N2, and O2. The results demonstrate that the coupling of the time-dependent Elenbaas–Heller and Boltzmann equations well describes the arc decaying process. Moreover, the proposed recovery rate and recovery strength metrics effectively quantify the arc quenching ability, enabling a systematic and efficient evaluation of various gas mixtures for arc interruption performance.

Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles ranging from 1000 to 5000 µm in diameter, posing a growing environmental and health risk. Composting is an excellent way to add nutrient-rich humus to the soil to boost plant development, but it also pollutes agricultural soil with MPs. Previous research has shown that MPs can threaten plant development, production, and quality, hence they must be studied. This study examined how a mixture of three MP types—polyethene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polypropene (PP)—affected greenhouse tomato plant development. MP types were spiked at 1% w/w (MPs/soil) in tomato pots, whereas non-spiked growth medium was the control. Statistical analysis was conducted using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test (95% confidence) to compare treatments and controls. Soil spiked with MPs increased chlorophyll content (SPAD), transpiration rate, photosynthetic rate, and stomata conductance by 5.16%, 16.71%, 25.81%, and 20.75%, respectively, compared to the control but decreased sub-stomata CO2 concentration by 3.23%. However, MPs did not significantly affect tomato plant morpho-physiological features (p > 0.05). Biochemical analysis of tomato fruits showed significant (p < 0.05) reduction effects of MPs on carotenoid, total flavonoid, and sugar but increased protein, ascorbate, and peroxidase activity. However, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the effects of the combined MPs on total phenolic content. These data imply that whereas MPs did not influence tomato plant physiological and morphological properties, tomato fruit biochemistry was reduced. This raise concerns that an increase in MPs in soils may reduce antioxidant content and negatively affect human health contributing to a decrease in food security.

The global consumption of fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline represent a considerable per-centage of global emissions, it is important to know for sure the percentage and type of gas emitted, there are many alternative energies that mitigate the production of emissions in different sectors such as the transport sector and the energy sector. The percentage use of hydrogen mixed with gasoline in internal combustion engines is a viable alternative because it helps the com-bustion process, but it is necessary to know the behavior of the engine and determine the carbon footprint, to quantify the benefit of these actions it is necessary to design and implement a network of low-cost sensors that monitor the emissions produced during the combustion processes and provide reliable data that can be used to make a statistical comparison between vehicles. This research proposes two software systems of an architecture (client-server) working in a synchro-nized manner in order to collect and store information in a database. The first software works as the client and runs on an IoT development board called ESP32 in conjunction with esp32 ttgo and communication between both devices is done through the esp now protocol, this software estab-lishes the connection with the physical sensors to detect and collect gas information, the data is sent wirelessly to the web server, the second software works as a server in addition to providing a graphical interface for user control and data visualization from a ground station. The tests were carried out using 100% Mexican gasoline (G100) and a mixture of hydrogen fuel with gasoline (GH) for the hydrogen cell a concentration of 0.0211 ml / gal of electrolytes (80 ml) was used, the same route and vehicle were used at an average acceleration of 40 and 60 km / h, the data obtained are taken every 30 seconds, the process was repeated 3 times and an average emission reduction of 5% and 10% of CO and CO2 respectively was obtained with GH fuel.

Climate change is a global issue affecting communities in different parts of the world. Climate change is associated with extreme weather and climate patterns that affect the general health of the environment and humanity. The causes of climate change are both natural and anthropogenic. The human induced climate change has accelerated the emission of greenhouse gases that in turn cause global warming and climate change. The international community have initiated various interventions to minimize emission of greenhouse gases in order to maintain a healthier environment for sustainable development. One such initiative and/or interventions is the energy transition strategy that involves transition from a purely fossil fuel based to renewable energy-based economy. This paper therefore looks at the energy transition in Kenya. Specifically, the paper covers energy demand and supply, Mt CO2 emission; energy transitions process; constraints and opportunities. Kenya is going through a transition period in the energy sector and at the same time the country is striving to industrialize by the year 2023 being guided by the Country’s 2010 Constitution and the Vision 2030 which aims at transforming the country into a middle level economy. It is important that as the country strives to industrialize, the energy that drives the economy should be clean to enhance cleaner energy production. The country is a signatory to the landmark agreement of COP21 held in Paris, France in 2015. The country committed to observe the requirements of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to ensure the reduction of emission of greenhouse gases and has put in place various institutional and legal frameworks towards this end. One of the most recent frameworks is the Climate Change Amendment Act, 2023. The main objective of the study is to assess the energy transition process and associated challenges. The study uses an exploratory design and employed descriptive statistics in data analysis. Data was presented in the form of tables, graphs, and themes. The result indicates that energy transition in Kenya is ongoing through specific processes and technologies. The results also confirm existing challenges and recommends sustained effort for sustainable development.

Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) represent an innovative approach to thinking and designing cities sustainably, in compliance with the European Union energy strategy. This strategy integrates sectors such as urban planning, energy, and construction to synergistically address energy and environmental challenges. Studies on sustainability assessment systems applied in PEDs evidenced that they focus mostly on energy aspects, while few include a comprehensive life cycle assessment of equivalent CO2 emissions, considering the building component and the impacts of the materials used. Additionally, most assessments are conducted on the urban and district scale, such as Neighborhood Sustainability Assessments (NSA), which begin to correlate PEDs with the dynamics of selecting sustainable materials for green-certified projects, analyzed throughout the entire life cycle, relying on the adoption of Green Building Rating Systems (GBRS) at the building scale. To explore the impact of environmentally friendly (i.e., ‘green’) GBRS certifications in the selection of building materials and products according to sustainability criteria, and to encourage their use in projects explicitly referring to PEDs, this study analyzes the technical solutions implemented in two significant residential building renovation projects in Italy from a PED perspective. It proposes a classification system based on the required targets of energy efficiency, energy production, and energy flexibility. The results include the definition of an expandable portfolio of technical solutions, an analytical comparison between the materials used in the energy renovation projects of the case studies examined, and the sustainability criteria provided by voluntary ’green’ certification tools (GBRS). The collected evidence offers an operational framework that confirms the positive impact of GBRS certifications and the related selection of materials on sustainable urban development, contributing to the scientific debate on PEDs. Furthermore, the use of voluntary ’green’ certifications at the building scale can be encouraged in the context of the transition towards PEDs, aiming to identify specific criteria and indicators for the selection of building materials to be integrated into future PED certifications. This aims to contribute to creating energy self-sufficient urban areas, focusing on sustainability, efficiency, and innovation, in line with global emission reduction and climate change mitigation goals.

CO IR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for probing catalyst surfaces and is used to identify single-atom catalysts, estimate metal surface availability to the gas phase, and measure catalyst Lewis acidity. However, the interpretation of CO IR spectra on metal surfaces is not trivial and is influenced by dipole–dipole interactions among CO molecules at medium to high coverage. Such a phenomenon results in spectral distortions, such as intensity transfer among IR bands, the appearance of spurious bands, and shifts in band position. Dipole–dipole interactions were widely investigated and understood from the 1950s to 1990s, but the implications for operando spectroscopy have been seemingly overlooked in the literature, with a few exceptions. Inspired by seminal studies in the field, I propose here the use of mixed isotopic streams, such as diluted 13CO in 12CO, to reduce dipole coupling effects and retrieve more information from operando IR spectra in reactions involving CO, such as CO oxidation or hydrogenation reactions. Similarly, mixed 13CO2/12CO2 streams may be applied in CO2 hydrogenation, where adsorbed CO is commonly observed. The proposed name of the technique is Mixed Isotope Operando IR Spectroscopy, MIOIRS. In this Perspective, I will first summarize the nature of dipole–dipole interactions in adsorbed CO layers and their effects on CO IR spectra. Then, I will briefly describe how diluted isotopic mixtures of CO can partially break the coupling among adsorbates and reduce spectral distortion. In both sections, I will give a few showcases of the implications of vibrational coupling in the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts. Finally, I will discuss the possible implications of MIOIRS for the detection and quantification of defect and surface sites on metal nanoparticles, the characterization of bimetallic nanoparticles surfaces, and the kinetics of CO intermediates adsorbed on different active sites. Notably, MIOIRS may be expanded to other reactions in which adsorbates have strong permanent dipoles, such as in self-catalytic reduction for NOx abatement.

Исследования, посвященные изучению химического состава, особенно фенольных соединений, использованию хурмы как сырья для производства различных пищевых продуктов, а также методы хранения мало изучены. Одной из причин ограниченного потребления плодов хурмы связано с ее сезонностью и неусовершенствованными методами хранения. Плоды хурмы с высокой пищевой ценностью в свежем виде употребляют только в течение 1–2 мес. Бόльшая часть их остается на верхушке дерева, портится и выбрасывается как отход. С точки зрения здорового образа жизни, население должно использовать этот ценный пищевой продукт не сезонно, а в течение всего года. Поэтому использование в каждодневном рационе свежих плодов хурмы, а также определение оптимального режима хранения является актуальной проблемой. Для повышения устойчивости организма к различным заболеваниям важно в рацион питания добавлять плоды хурмы, обладающие антиоксидантными, антивирусными, антимутагенными и противомикробными свойствами. Поскольку плоды хурмы богаты фенольными соединениями, которые играют важную роль в регуляции процесса кровообращения, выведении радиации из организма, в прекращении деятельности микроорганизмов, вызывающих некоторые инфекционные заболевания. Объектом исследования являются процессы сохранности фенольных соединений и уменьшение их потерь при хранении. Предмет исследования – широко распространенные на территории Азербайджанской Республики сорта хурмы Хачиа и Хиакуме. Сорта хурмы Хачиа и Хиакуме хранились в холодильной камере в 5 вариантах. Фенольные соединения были определены методом эффективной высокожидкостной хроматографии. В результате исследований в сорте Хачиа было обнаружено 15, а в сорте Хиакуме 14 представителей фенольных соединений. Сохранность качественных показателей плодов хурмы, в том числе фенольных соединений, обладающих антиоксидантными и антимикробными свойствами, зафиксирована при хранении хурмы в холодильной камере при температуре –2...–3 °С в условиях РГС, с содержанием газов 3–4 % CO2, 2–3 % O2. Research devoted to the study of the chemical composition, especially phenolic compounds, the use of persimmon as a raw material for the production of various food products, as well as storage methods have been poorly studied. One of the reasons for the limited consumption of persimmon fruits is due to its seasonality and unimproved storage methods [6]. Fresh persimmon fruits with high nutritional value are consumed only for 1–2 months. Most of it remains at the top of the tree, deteriorates and is thrown away as waste. From the point of view of a healthy lifestyle, the population should use this valuable food product, not seasonally, but throughout the year. Therefore, the use of fresh persimmon fruits in the daily diet, as well as determining the optimal storage mode, is an urgent problem. The object of the study is the preservation processes of phenolic compounds and the reduction of their losses during storage. To increase the body's resistance to various diseases, it is important to add persimmon fruits, which have antioxidant, antiviral, antimutagenic and antimicrobial properties, to the diet. Because persimmon fruits are rich in phenolic compounds, which play an important role in regulating the blood circulation process, removing radiation from the body, and stopping the activity of microorganisms that cause some infectious diseases. The subject of the study is the persimmon varieties Khachia and Khiakume, widespread in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Persimmon varieties Khachia and Hiakume were stored in the refrigerator in 5 variants. Phenolic compounds were determined by performance high-liquid chromatography. As a result of research, 15 representatives of phenolic compounds were discovered in the Khachia variety, and 14 in the Hiakume variety. The preservation of the quality indicators of persimmon fruits, including phenolic compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, was recorded when persimmons were stored in a refrigerator at a chamber temperature of –2...–3 °C under RGS conditions, with a gas content of 3–4 % CO2, 2–3 % O2.

A novel water-lean solvent technology, developed by Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International and being commercialized by SLB, achieved low energy demand which is represented by its low specific reboiler duty (SRD) values at carbon capture rates beyond 90%. This technology demonstrated an SRD of 2.55 GJ/t-CO2 at 95% capture, using one partial intercooler for absorber and five degrees Centigrade (50C) temperature approach in the lean/rich solvent cross exchanger at the Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM) pilot plant (two hundred tonnes per day of carbon capture capacity). Prospective adopters of this technology requested different target capture rates for the FEED (Front End Engineering and Design) studies based on their location and their company's emission reduction targets. These requests demanded an optimization model that minimizes energy demand for a target carbon capture rate. Also, the model needs to determine optimal operating parameters for carbon capture process based on frequently fluctuating flue gas conditions and flowrate, to be used for real time optimization and advanced process control applications. RTI and SLB previously developed an Aspen Plus process simulation model, which matches the TCM plant data. However, that model was prohibitively slow to be used as a tool for real time optimization and advanced process control applications. The model slowness is because of the default "Sequential Modular (SM) strategy" adopted by Aspen Plus in the presence of recycle streams and tight heat integration commonly found in solvent-based carbon capture processes. The equation-oriented (EO) modeling strategy is more suitable for optimizing these processes. However, the adoption of the EO strategy might have been hindered by the following reasons: (1) Feature availability: Aspen Plus EO mode does not have all the features available in SM mode. E.g., Balance blocks (commonly used in legacy carbon capture models) are not supported. Also, specifications are not always consistent between SM and EO modes. (2) User-friendliness: Aspen Plus EO feature forms are not user-friendly, such as forms for identification of the correct EO variables and solving the recycle loops. (3) Troubleshooting: Troubleshooting model convergence problems is complex as one cannot associate the source of the error to a particular block, unlike in SM mode. (4) Initial Values: EO model needs good initial values. This paper discusses the methodology used to build this optimization model, addressing the above issues.

In the context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, straw returning plays a significant role in improving soybean yield and achieving sustainable agricultural development. However, the combined effects of straw returning and biogas slurry on farmland greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon and nitrogen characteristics, and soybean yield remain unclear. Therefore, this study conducted field experiments in the black soil region of Northeast China for 5 consecutive years from 2020 to 2024, and studied the full amount of soybean straw returning (deep ploughing, surface covering) and biogas slurry ratio (R0: 100% CF; R1:25% Bs+75% CF; R2:50% Bs+50% CF; R3:75% Bs+25% CF; R4:100% Bs; Bs is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the biogas slurry, kg/ha; CF is the recommended nitrogen application rate, 80 kg/ha) on soil nitrogen and carbon indicators, greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, yield, greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) and global warming potential (GWP). The results showed that soybean yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) increased initially with the biogas slurry ratio, then declined at higher dosages. Compared to the nitrogen fertilizer treatment (R0), soybean yield significantly increased by 2.16–13.31%. Additionally, SOC, MBC, DOC, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and MBN were enhanced by 10.52–25.72%, 3.52–10.52%, 1.36–5.58%, 10.41–24.10%, 9.27–24.16%, and 2.46–5.69%, respectively. Under the same biogas slurry application, deep ploughing significantly reduced CO2 (4.29–16.27%), N2O (3.28–11.01%), and CH4 (4.21–18.63%) emissions, as well as GWP (8.96–17.63%) and GHGI (9.26–16.29%) compared to surface covering. The yield of 75% biogas slurry ratio (R3) increased significantly by 4.24–18.36%, and the yield increased by 2.16–18.36% with the experimental year, alongside increases in SOC (10.52–25.72%), MBC (3.52–10.52%), DOC (1.36–5.58%), NO3--N (11.47–25.27%), NH4+-N (10.04–22.74%), and MBN (2.12–5.74%). Mantel test results indicated that deep turning combined with biogas slurry application promoted yield and reduced GHGs emissions by increasing SOC, DOC, and NO3--N in the soil. Therefore, replacing nitrogen fertilizer with 75% biogas slurry is an effective strategy for achieving higher yield, carbon sequestration, and emission reduction in soybean production, contributing to the sustainable development of agriculture.

Introduction. Traditional methods of knee arthroplasty are based on mechanical alignment, which ensures long-term component survival but does not always meet patients’ functional needs. Recent studies indicate that personalized alignment approaches, such as kinematic and functional alignment, can improve functional outcomes and reduce complication rates. These methods consider the natural axes of movement and the anatomy of the knee joint, contributing to the restoration of joint anatomy and function. Individualized navigation systems represent a modern approach to knee arthroplasty using three-dimensional preoperative models based on CT or MRI. This method improves the accuracy of fitting the prosthesis components, considering the patient’s individual anatomical features and biomechanical parameters. Objective. The objective of this literature review is to analyze the literature on using advanced navigation systems and evaluate their effectiveness, advantages, and prospects in personalizing knee joint arthroplasty. Material and Methods. Using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, we reviewed 22 scientific studies on various navigation systems for knee joint arthroplasty. Studies were selected based on patient numbers, statistical significance, clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, and availability of objective treatment outcome data. This allowed for a detailed analysis and comparison of different navigation methods. Results. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most effective surgical treatments for knee osteoarthritis. However, the accuracy of prosthesis implantation remains a critical factor for the long-term success of the surgery. Deviations in placement can lead to increased wear of components and a higher risk of complications. Traditionally, standard tools and techniques based on anatomical landmarks are used for prosthesis placement. In recent years, individualized navigation systems (INS) based on preoperative three-dimensional modeling of the patient’s individual anatomy have been introduced. INS aim to improve the accuracy of knee joint component placement, reduce time of surgery, and lower the risk of complications. Conclusions. The use of patient-specific surgical instruments and resection tools in primary and revision knee joint arthroplasty improves surgical and rehabilitation outcomes. This development allows for a 30% improvement in implant positioning accuracy and a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions. Standardizing research methods and increasing surgeon experience may contribute to a better understanding of the long-term benefits of individualized navigation systems in knee joint arthroplasty. Despite the identified advantages of INS, further research is needed to determine the long-term clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these systems. The application of INS is especially important in cases of significant deformities and bone defects.

Recent U.S. federal investments (e.g., 2021 Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Law), enhancements to the IRS section 45Q tax credit (via the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act), and state legislative activities along with a continuum of research efforts have provided a backstop to de-risk carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects for developers. As a result, historic interest and investments in CCUS have been observed and a series of highly ambitious projects have been announced throughout the U.S. Even with these tailwinds, public opposition to these projects is on the rise, with notable examples in the Midwest and Louisiana. Further complicating this matter is the general lack of available data surrounding public sentiment as it relates to CCUS. Public comments submitted in response to Louisiana's Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI state primacy application, an act that awards the state regulatory oversight over CO2 injection wells, provide an opportunity to capture timely information from the public as it relates to CCUS in an effort to understand sentiment and critical messaging priorities. Importantly, this dataset may inform future engagement efforts and similar methodologies may support the development of project-specific strategies. An application programming interface (API) with www.regulations.gov was established to retrieve public comments from the Louisiana UIC Program; Class VI Primacy docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2023-0073). Individual letters with corresponding metadata (name, organization, location where provided) were saved and individual statements from each letter were extracted. Deduplication ensured that matching statements were included in the dataset only once. Unique themes and subthemes were identified, and text analytics was utilized to identify specific recommendations. A large language model was used to summarize key public comment patterns, and sentiment analysis was used to identify high-priority topics. Over 41,000 comments were received in response to Louisiana's UIC Class VI state primacy application. Of these, 727 were identified as unique, substantive, comments while the remainder represented mass mailer campaigns or duplicate text. Even still, this represents a significant increase in public interest when compared to the North Dakota and Wyoming UIC Class VI primacy applications which received a total of 15 and 7 unique comments, respectively.Of the 727 unique comments 400 included attachments and 327 did not. Comments that included no content or letters that were not machine readable were removed from the dataset, bringing the number of analyzed comments down to 683. In total, 537 comments were submitted by private citizens, 122 were submitted by companies or organizations, 17 were submitted by state government officials, with the remainder categorized as mass mail campaigns, local government officials, members of congress, or other. The 683 analyzed comments included over 12,000 separate statements that were examined for general sentiment. Here, positive sentiments are those with a sentiment score > 0.53, negative sentiments are those with a sentiment score < 0.46, and neutral statements are those with a sentiment score between the two. Individual statements were used in aggregate to determine the sentiment of each submitted comment. In total, 28% of the comments were positive, 56% were negative, and 16% were neutral. For the mass mailer campaigns, 25.5% were positive, while 74.5% were negative. Key words for positive and negative comments were captured to provide insight into the topics associated with each comment type. Similarly, key themes summarizing the positive and negative comments were extracted to evaluate specific topics that represent the broader dataset. In general, positive themes relate to existing competencies in subsurface activities and economic benefits, regulatory oversight by state agencies, and the incorporation of environmental justice into regulatory requirements. Negative themes generally relate to the safety and efficacy of CO2 storage, the oversight capabilities of the cognizant state agency and clarifications around existing regulations, and the need for appropriate consideration of environmental justice. Positive themes represent topics that may inspire confidence from stakeholders, while negative themes represent the types of questions or concerns that can be anticipated. The need for the widespread adoption of CCUS technologies as part of the energy transition is well documented. Simultaneously, the social environment within which new infrastructure projects are expected to operate is becoming increasingly challenging. While legacy wrongs or project-specific missteps are in part responsible for public perception challenges, a lack of real data to understand public sentiment and inform engagement strategies has further complicated matters. Here, text analytics and natural language processing is introduced as an important tool for the CCUS community, particularly as it relates to proactively identifying public concerns and developing messaging priorities. Importantly, a similar methodology can be applied to other datasets such as news media, meeting minutes, or survey data. In the project development context, this methodology may increase transparency and provide an opportunity to prioritize engagement and community-based strategies. Similarly, community sentiment can be tracked against project schedule and milestones, allowing for an objective assessment of community engagement and investment strategies.

EDITORIAL In 2024, Science, Engineering and Health Studies (SEHS) collaborated with the Thai Institute of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry International Conference (TIChE) to provide a platform for researchers to publish their work in the field of chemical engineering. The conference focused on the theme “Smart Solutions to Environmental Sustainability for a Better World,” emphasizing the development and implementation of intelligent and innovative technologies to address environmental challenges. The theme highlighted the integration of advanced scientific research and technical solutions into practical applications to tackle pressing issues such as environmental pollution, resource depletion, and climate change. The focus was on promoting sustainability across various sectors to improve global environmental health and ensure a sustainable future. As a result of this collaboration, seven selected research papers were published in 2024, showcasing groundbreaking contributions to environmental sustainability and innovative problem-solving in chemical engineering. Akkawong et al. (2024) proposed a novel framework that combines deep learning with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to improve prediction models based on small datasets, addressing issues such as overfitting and underfitting due to limited experimental data. By applying this integrated framework to predict the size of silver nanoparticles, the study demonstrates improved prediction performance with R2 values of 0.924 and 0.918 for the validation and test datasets, respectively. The LHS technique was employed to augment the dataset, enabling the development of a more accurate and robust prediction model. Models trained on the expanded dataset exhibited significantly higher accuracy in predicting silver nanoparticle sizes compared to those trained on limited data. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in delivering precise predictions even with small experimental datasets. To improve energy efficiency in chemical processes, particularly in distillation columns, Puangto et al. (2024) explored the design of an internally heat-integrated distillation column (HIDiC) using an economic-based column energy profile approach. The study introduced the concept of maximum energy saving per additional investment (MESAI) profiles, demonstrating the economic and energy-saving advantages of HIDiC designs over conventional methods. Using Aspen Plus simulations and economic evaluations, the research highlighted the effectiveness of MESAI profiles in optimizing heat loads and balancing additional investments, resulting in more cost-effective HIDiC configurations. The findings showed that HIDiC designs incorporating multiple side exchangers achieved lower operational costs and significantly enhanced energy efficiency. This work provides valuable insights into HIDiC design methodologies, emphasizing the economic feasibility and sustainability advantages of advanced distillation technologies. Another application model focused on developing a two-stage stochastic optimization model for a sustainable bioethanol supply chain under demand uncertainty and multi-season biomass. Fahrullazi and Siemanond (2024) considered multiple feedstocks such as rice residue, sugarcane residue, cassava residue, and palm residue, as well as varying biomass supply over the seasons. The model aimed to maximize profits by optimizing biomass type, plant location, and pathways. An extension model included environmental performance, specifically carbon credits, to enhance profit margins. The stochastic model outperformed the deterministic model by 16% in terms of profitability across various demand scenarios. In addition, the incorporation of carbon credits contributed around 5% to the total profit, showcasing the potential for sustainable bioethanol production with reduced CO2 emissions. The reduction of emitted CO2 was also addressed by New et al. (2024). They compared the life cycle impacts of conventional hydrogen production methods (methane steam reforming) with two zero-carbon emission technologies: proton exchange membrane electrolysis and methane pyrolysis. The analysis focused on five impact categories, with methane pyrolysis proving to have the lowest overall environmental impact. Despite relying on hydrocarbon feedstock, methane pyrolysis demonstrated significantly lower global warming potential and reduced toxicity impacts compared to steam methane reforming and proton exchange membrane electrolysis. The study highlighted the potential of methane pyrolysis as a sustainable hydrogen production method, emphasizing its role in promoting a circular carbon economy and reducing the scarcity of fossil resources. Two research were focused on the bio-circular-green economic model (BCG). Padettaku et al. (2024) investigated the effect of glycerol concentration on enhancing the fracture resistance of dried lotus leaves when used as a bio-coating agent. By incorporating glycerol, beeswax, and chitosan into the coating, the study aimed to improve the elastic properties of lotus leaves. The optimal ratio of glycerol in the bio-coating was determined based on the recovery percentage of lotus leaves post-coating, indicating improved elasticity. Results showed a 27% increase in recovery when using specific concentrations of chitosan, glycerol, and acetic solution. The coated lotus leaves exhibited increased moisture content and thickness, decreased contact angle, improved mechanical properties with reduced Young's modulus but increased elongation, and enhanced thermal stability compared to untreated leaves. Incorporating chitosan in the coating formulation reinforced the structure and improved water resistance. Sangjun et al. (2024) proposed the recovery of light cycle oil (LCO) discarded from the petroleum process. They focused on the hydrogenation reaction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in LCO using NiMo-based catalysts to produce higher value-added chemicals. Different catalyst supports such as γ-alumina, KIT-6, and β-zeolite were studied. The NiMo/KIT-6 catalyst had the highest efficiency in PAHs removal (77.4%) and selectivity towards alkylbenzenes, decalins, and tetralins. The acidity of the catalyst was found to be crucial for performance, with NiMo-zeolite exhibiting the highest total acidity. The study provided an alternative method for converting petroleum refinery by-products into valuable chemicals, contributing to sustainable development, and addressing environmental concerns related to PAHs in LCO. Singhyakaew and Rueangjitt (2024) investigated the effects of alkali treatment time and the SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratio on the structural modification of commercial and synthesized ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. The study focused on introducing mesopores into the ZSM-5 structure to enhance catalytic performance in cracking and reforming processes. The results showed that increasing alkali treatment time promoted the formation of mesopores in both commercial and synthesized ZSM-5 catalysts, leading to an increase in mesopore surface area and pore volume. However, excessive treatment time reduced mesoporosity in synthesized ZSM-5 samples, particularly at higher SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratios. The optimal conditions were achieved with synthesized ZSM-5 treated in a 0.2 M NaOH aqueous solution for 1 h at a SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratio of 140, resulting in a high mesopore surface area and volume while maintaining the integrity of the MFI structure.

As the demand for innovative and effective skin treatments grows, the field of dermatology continues to evolve, integrating cutting-edge technologies with new biological insights. Among the most impactful advances in recent years are medical laser therapies, widely used to treat skin. While the immediate effects of laser treatments are well-documented, research has begun to reveal that their benefits go deeper, potentially triggering long-lasting changes at the molecular level. At the heart of this molecular transformation is epigenetics, focusing on changes in gene expression that do not alter the underlying DNA sequence. Unlike permanent genetic mutations, epigenetic changes can be reversible and are heavily influenced by environmental and external factors, including therapeutic interventions like laser treatments. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation, control many of the key biological processes involved in skin health, aging, and repair [1, 2]. Recent research suggests that medical lasers induce epigenetic modifications that enhance skin regeneration and repair, offering longer lasting results than previously understood [3]. This commentary aims to explore how lasers trigger long-lasting regenerative effects through epigenetic mechanisms and how this knowledge could shape future advancements in dermatological care [4]. By understanding how lasers can tap into these epigenetic pathways, we open the door to more personalized and effective skin treatments that go beyond superficial improvements. The concept of epigenetics has revolutionized our understanding of how gene expression is modulated by external influences, including environmental exposure, stress, and injury. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic changes leave the DNA sequence intact but modify the way genes are expressed. These changes are reversible, offering a tantalizing avenue for therapeutic interventions in dermatology. In skin biology, epigenetic mechanisms play a critical role in processes like wound healing, inflammation, and aging [5]. Studies have shown that aging skin is associated with increased DNA methylation, which silences genes involved in collagen production and skin elasticity. Histone modifications, another key epigenetic mechanism, regulate the accessibility of chromatin, the structural framework of DNA, influencing gene transcription [3, 6]. In aging skin, histone acetylation and methylation patterns become dysregulated, contributing to reduced cellular repair and regeneration. Non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), have also emerged as important players in skin health. These small RNA molecules regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation into proteins. Specific miRNAs have been linked to the regulation of inflammation, collagen synthesis, and keratinocyte differentiation, all of which are critical for maintaining youthful, healthy skin [7, 8]. Laser treatments could modulate these epigenetic pathways by reprogramming molecular processes, resulting in more effective, longer lasting rejuvenation and improved overall skin health [9, 10]. The epigenetic changes triggered by laser treatments contribute to the long-term clinical improvements observed in skin rejuvenation, pigmentation correction, and scar reduction. For instance, fractional lasers, which create microthermal zones of injury surrounded by untreated skin, have been shown to improve the appearance of acne scars by promoting collagen production and tissue remodeling [11-13]. It is hypothesized that the regenerative effects of fractional lasers are partially due to epigenetic modifications, such as changes in histone acetylation that enhance the expression of collagen-related genes [14]. In treating pigmentation disorders like melasma, which is characterized by hyperpigmentation due to the overproduction of melanin, laser treatments targeting melanocytes can modulate epigenetic pathways [15]. By influencing DNA methylation and histone modifications, lasers reduce the expression of genes involved in melanogenesis, leading to a more balanced and long-lasting reduction in pigmentation. Laser-induced epigenetic changes also offer promising results in the treatment of aging skin. Considering that in aging skin, there is a considerable dysregulation of the expression of collagen-related genes and inflammation, ablative lasers stimulate a wound-healing response that resets this dysregulation [12, 14]. Epigenetic modifications induced by the laser treatment can restore a more youthful gene expression profile, increasing collagen production and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Medical lasers are widely used in dermatology for a range of indications, from scar treatment to wrinkle reduction and skin resurfacing. Lasers work by delivering controlled energy to specific layers of the skin, causing microthermal damage that stimulates the body's natural repair processes [16]. The most commonly used lasers in skin rejuvenation include ablative (e.g., CO2 and Er:YAG lasers) and non-ablative lasers, each varying in the depth and type of tissue injury they produce. What makes laser treatments particularly interesting from an epigenetic perspective is their ability to induce cellular stress [17]. This stress activates a cascade of repair processes in the skin, some of which are regulated by epigenetic modifications [18]. For example, the microdamage caused by laser treatment stimulates the inflammatory response, which in turn influences the expression of genes associated with wound healing, collagen production, and extracellular matrix remodeling. One of the primary epigenetic mechanisms influenced by lasers is DNA methylation, which involves the addition of a methyl group to the DNA molecule, typically at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands [3]. Laser-induced inflammation leads to changes in DNA methylation patterns, silencing genes involved in the skin's aging process and promoting the expression of genes that regulate tissue repair. Histone modifications, particularly acetylation and methylation, are also affected by laser treatments. These modifications determine how tightly DNA is wound around histones, which in turn regulates gene accessibility [8, 13]. Studies have shown that histone acetylation is associated with active gene transcription, including genes that promote collagen synthesis and cell proliferation [19]. By inducing controlled injury, lasers would activate histone acetyltransferases, enzymes that add acetyl groups to histones, thus facilitating the expression of genes involved in skin repair. Additionally, laser treatments can impact the expression of non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs. Research has demonstrated that certain miRNAs are upregulated following laser treatments, where they play a role in reducing inflammation and fibrosis while promoting epidermal regeneration [3]. The molecular changes induced by lasers, particularly in collagen synthesis, elastin production, and gene expression modulation, directly intersect with epigenetic processes. Lasers not only affect the physical structure of the skin but also influence gene activity by inducing epigenetic modifications that enhance cellular repair mechanisms and skin regeneration. For example, the activation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes leads to changes in the expression of key genes involved in collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix remodeling, closely tied to epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. The reduction in matrix metalloproteinases and heat shock proteins after laser treatment indicates a shift in the cellular stress response, potentially through epigenetic pathways that regulate protein expression during skin repair [20]. This highlights how lasers can "reprogram" the skin's cellular environment for long-term regenerative outcomes, offering new insights into how medical lasers can enhance skin health through both physical and epigenetic changes. Recent studies have further explored the multifaceted role of laser treatments, not only in skin rejuvenation but also in preventing carcinogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms. Fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) has demonstrated significant potential in preventing actinic neoplasia by re-establishing IGF-1 signaling in aged skin, thereby reducing UVB-induced DNA damage and suppressing the formation of new actinic keratoses and non-melanoma skin cancers [21]. Similarly, no ablative fractional lasers have shown promising prophylactic effects in patients with a history of keratinocyte carcinoma, where fibroblast activation and increased IGF-1 expression contribute to a reduced recurrence rate [21-23]. In a pivotal randomized controlled trial by Spandau et al. 48 individuals aged 60 years and older with considerable actinic damage were treated with FLR. The study revealed that a single FLR treatment was durable in restoring appropriate UVB response in geriatric skin for at least 2 years, providing long-term protection. Notably, FLR resulted in a sustained reduction in the number of actinic keratosis and a dramatic decrease in non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) on the treated arm (2 NMSCs) compared to the untreated arm (24 NMSCs) after 36 months [23]. This evidence suggests that laser therapies would act through epigenetic pathways, enhancing fibroblast function and keratinocyte repair while influencing collagen production and reducing matrix metalloproteinase activity [20]. The study by Pedersen et al. found that combining ablative fractional laser with the topical treatment vismodegib led to distinctive transcriptomic changes in early-stage basal cell carcinomas in murine models. This combination treatment showed promise in modulating gene expression patterns associated with tumor growth inhibition, indicating that laser-based interventions might enhance the efficacy of topical therapies in treating early carcinogenic lesion [24]. By modulating the skin's molecular environment, these treatments offer a protective and preventive role against carcinogenesis, highlighting the intersection of epigenetics, molecular biology, and advanced laser technologies in dermatological treatments. In addition to skin rejuvenation, medical lasers play a crucial role in managing pigmentary and vascular skin disorders through epigenetic regulation, complementing their established role in enhancing skin structure and resilience. Lasers targeting pigmentary conditions like melasma influence melanin synthesis by altering gene expression through DNA methylation and histone modifications. By suppressing genes responsible for melanin overproduction, these treatments reduce hyperpigmentation and restore skin tone [15, 25]. Similarly, vascular lasers targeting conditions such as rosacea and hemangiomas modulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promoting healthy angiogenesis while minimizing abnormal blood vessel formation. These effects demonstrate the versatile potential of lasers in regulating different skin pathologies via epigenetic mechanisms [26-28]. The therapeutic effects observed in treating pigmentary and vascular skin disorders align with the broader potential of lasers to modify cellular environments [29]. For example, DNA methylation can silence overactive pigment-producing genes in melanocytes, while histone acetylation promotes the expression of genes involved in vascular stability and repair [30, 31]. Such interventions offer long-lasting clinical benefits by reprogramming the skin's molecular landscape, highlighting the dual capability of lasers to address both aesthetic and pathological conditions [16]. As research in epigenetics continues to progress, the potential for personalized laser treatments based on individual epigenetic profiles is becoming increasingly feasible [32]. By analyzing a patient's unique epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation patterns or miRNA expression, dermatologists can tailor laser therapies to optimize clinical outcomes and predict treatment responses. The development of laser technologies that can selectively modulate epigenetic pathways also holds significant promise for enhancing regenerative effects while minimizing adverse outcomes, such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into this field is expected to further accelerate progress. AI's ability to process large data sets of genetic and epigenetic information will enable the identification of complex patterns and correlations, facilitating the development of predictive models for patient-specific laser treatment responses [33]. This integration of precision dermatology and AI-based analytics is poised to redefine clinical practice, offering unparalleled customization in laser-based interventions [34]. The intersection of epigenetics and medical lasers presents a new frontier in dermatology, with the potential to significantly enhance clinical outcomes in skin regeneration, aging, and pigmentation disorders. By influencing gene expression through controlled cellular stress, lasers can tap into the skin's innate regenerative processes, offering long-lasting improvements in skin health and appearance. As research into the epigenetic effects of laser treatments continues, the future holds more personalized, precise, and effective therapies that leverage the body's own epigenetic machinery to achieve optimal results. Incorporating an epigenetic perspective into laser therapy not only deepens our understanding of how these treatments work at a molecular level but also paves the way for innovations in skincare tailored to each individual's genetic and epigenetic profiles. This convergence of technology and biology has the potential to redefine dermatological care in the years to come. D.H. contributed to the conception, drafting, and writing of the manuscript.
