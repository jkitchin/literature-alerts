Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), which is driven by electricity generated from renewable energy sources, is a promising technology for sustainably producing carbon‐based chemicals or fuels. Several CO 2 RR catalysts have been explored to date, among which copper‐based electrocatalysts are the most widely known for electrochemical CO 2 RR and are extensively studied for their ability to generate an array of products. Their low selectivity, however, hinders their possibility of being used for practical purposes. In this work, a microwave‐assisted one‐pot synthesized Cu x O/N‐doped carbon demonstrates the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into multiple C 1 products (mainly formate and methanol), with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 95% in 0.10 m KHCO 3 aqueous solution at a moderately low applied potential of −0.55 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). The in‐depth theoretical study reveals the key contribution of pyridinic N‐based N‐doped carbon sites and Cu 2 O clusters in CO 2 adsorption and its subsequent conversion to formate and methanol via an energetically favorable formate pathway. The electrocatalyst continued to demonstrate CO 2 reduction to valuable C 1 products when a simulated flue gas stream containing 15% CO 2 along with 500 ppm SO x and 200 ppm NO x is used as an inlet feed.

Abstract Benefiting from the synergism between adjacent bimetallic atoms, in comparison with single atom catalysts, the dual atom catalysts have displayed great potential in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). However, the further modulation of the electronic structure of dual atom sites to enhance CO 2 RR performance still remains a challenge. Herein, an atomically dispersed oxygen‐bridged Ni 2 N 6 O/NC catalyst with unique Ni‐O‐Ni sites is successfully synthesized through the microwave pyrolysis of the supported mixture containing the dinuclear nickel phthalocyanine and glucose on N‐doped carbon nanosheets. Experiments and density functional theory calculation reveal that the Ni‐O‐Ni sites can adsorb H + from the KHCO 3 electrolyte to in situ‐form the unique Ni‐OH‐Ni sites without Ni─Ni bonding interaction, which effectively lowers the energy barrier towards the formation of *COOH from CO 2 . As a result, the Ni 2 N 6 OH/NC catalyst exhibits a 99.4% of CO Faradaic efficiency with a 32.4 mA·cm −2 of CO partial current density at −0.7 V versus RHE in H‐cell, much superior to the Ni 2 N 6 /NC with a Ni‐Ni bonding interaction prepared by a similar procedure to that for Ni 2 N 6 O/NC but replacing microwave pyrolysis by a traditional heating process.

This article introduces three significant ways of producing methane by electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide. Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide can efficiently convert CO2 molecules into various high-energy fuels under ambient conditions. Methane gas, among them, stands out due to its relatively high calorific value, chemical stability, ease of storage and transportation. Therefore, research on electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to generate methane is crucial. Common methods include adjusting catalyst morphology to expose more active sites, building nanoscale catalysts results in smaller-sized nanostructured copper and combining copper with other metals to form alloys, creating multi-metal catalysts. By optimizing these catalysts, we can efficiently reduce carbon dioxide into methane.

Abstract The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to the reduced chemical compounds offers substantial environmental benefits through minimizing the emission of greenhouse gas and fostering sustainable practices. Recently, the unique properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) make them attractive candidates for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), providing many opportunities to develop efficient, selective, and environmentally sustainable processes for mitigating CO 2 emissions and utilizing CO 2 as a valuable raw material for the synthesis of fuels and chemicals. Here, the recent advances in MOFs as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic CO 2 RR are summarized. The detailed characteristics, electrocatalytic mechanisms, and practical approaches for improving the electrocatalytic efficiency, selectivity, and durability of MOFs under realistic reaction conditions are also clarified. Furthermore, the outlooks on the prospects of MOF-based electrocatalysts in CO 2 RR are provided.

Background: The study addresses the importance of reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change, focusing on replacing paper use with electronic processes in a public institution. Paper usage significantly contributes to CO2 emissions, while electronic management can reduce these emissions. The study is a proposal that encouraged the electronic processing of administrative tasks to ensure speed. Decree 8.539/2015 made the electronic processing of documents in federal public administration mandatory. The Judiciary branch was a pioneer in implementing electronic processes in Brazilian public institutions. For this article, the Systems Dynamics (SD) methodology was used, and a simulation model was developed to assess the environmental impact of process automation at the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM). Key results highlighted the reduction of CO2 emissions and cost savings. The implementation of digital processes resulted in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, and the adoption of electronic processes generated financial savings. Therefore, System Dynamics modeling is a useful tool for institutions to plan scenarios and promote environmental sustainability. The transition to electronic processes in public institutions can bring significant environmental and economic benefits.

The Cool Roof concept, known for its efficiency in summer due to high temperatures during this period, employs a light coating that covers the roof to prevent the absorption of heat and maintain lower indoor temperatures. This study integrates a chemical component with biomaterials to enhance performance and reduce CO2 emissions. The composition investigated in this research is recognized for its durability and ability to lower outside temperatures, thereby mitigating the urban heat island effect. This experimental study evaluates the sustainability of CoolRoofs in a cold room located in Signes, France. Temperature measurements are conducted from 25 September 2023 to 27 July 2024, both with and without the coating, to assess energy performance and CO2 emissions. The selection of the building type ensures optimal performance in both summer and winter. Results show that the maximum outside and inside surface temperatures for a Cool Roof are 48.7 °C and 25.6 °C, respectively, compared to 72.9 °C and 32.2 °C for an uncoated roof. Additionally, implementing a CoolRoof reduces thermal load through the cold room by 56%, while CO2 emissions can be reduced by up to 27.31 kg CO2/m2 over a 20-year period. This study presents a solution for enhancing energy and environmental performance year-round using a resilient composite.

We demonstrate an electrostatic confinement‐induced charge transfer pathway in a supramolecular photocatalyst comprising of an ionic covalent organic framework (COF) and cationic metal complexes. The dynamic electrostatic interactions not only attract cations around the COF to accept photogenerated electrons, but also allows for a retention of homogeneous catalytic characters of complexes, making a subtle balance. Accordingly, the electrostatic confinement effect facilitates the forward electron transfer from a photoexcited COF to cationic Co complex, realizing a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Its catalytic efficiency is far superior to the supramolecular counterparts with Van‐der‐Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions. This work presents an insight for enhancing charge transfer in supramolecular systems, and provides an effective approach for construction of highly efficient photocatalysts.

Direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture species, i.e., carbamate and (bi)carbonate, can be promising for CO2 capture and conversion from point-source, where the energetically demanding stripping step is bypassed. Here, we describe a class of atomically dispersed nickel (Ni) catalysts electrodeposited on various electrode surfaces that are shown to directly convert captured CO2 to methane (CH4). A detailed study employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy (EM) indicate that highly dispersed Ni atoms are uniquely active for converting capture species to CH4, and the activity of single-atom Ni is confirmed using control experiments with a molecularly defined Ni phthalocyanine catalyst supported on carbon nanotubes. Comparing the kinetics of various capture solutions obtained from hydroxide, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines provide evidence that carbamate, rather than (bi)carbonate and/or dissolved CO2, is primarily responsible for CH4 production. This conclusion is supported by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of capture solutions as well as control experiments comparing reaction selectivity with and without CO2 purging. These findings are understood with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing that single-atom nickel (Ni) dispersed on gold (Au) is active for the direct reduction of carbamate, producing CH4 as the primary product. This is the first example of direct electrochemical conversion of carbamate to CH4, and the mechanism of this process provides new insight on the potential for integrated capture and conversion of CO2 directly to hydrocarbons.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical technology used for mitigating climate change by capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources and storing them underground to prevent their release into the atmosphere. Despite its potential, optimizing CCS systems for cost-effectiveness and efficiency improvement remains a significant challenge. In this paper, the optimization of CCS systems through the development and application of two mathematical optimization techniques is introduced. The first technique is based on using a superstructure optimization model, while the second technique relies on applying a goal programming optimization model. These models were solved using LINGO software version API 14.0.5099.166 to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of CCS systems. The first model, seeking to maximize the exchange of CO2 flowrate from sources to sinks, achieved a CO2 capture rate of 93.36% with an annual total cost of USD 1.175 billion. The second model introduced a novel mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) approach for multi-objective optimization, targeting the minimization of total system cost, alternative storage, and unutilized storage while maximizing CO2 load exchange. The application of the second model, when prioritized to maximize CO2 flowrate exchange using the goal programming technique, resulted in a cost reduction of 36.46% and a CO2 capture rate of 75.87%. In contrast, when the second model prioritized minimizing the total annual cost, a 48% cost reduction was achieved, and the CO2 capture rate was decreased by 68.37%. A comparison of the two models’ results is presented. The results showed that the second model, with the priority of maximizing CO2 capture, provides the best economic–environmental objective balance, which offers notable cost reductions while keeping an efficient CO2 capture rate. This study highlights the potential of advanced mathematical modeling in increasing the feasibility of CCS as one of the very important strategies of mitigating climate change and reducing global warming.

Abstract: The oil and gas industry plays a significant role in the release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately gauge and minimize its carbon footprint which requires the thorough measurement of emissions and the identification of the primary sources of carbon emissions. By doing so, we can then determine the most effective methods for reducing these emissions. This study aims to precisely quantify and decrease the carbon footprint associated with drilling operations. To achieve this, we evaluated the diesel and petrol consumption from an onshore drilling project in the Niger Delta and used an emissions model to assess carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a drilling rig, thus gaining a comprehensive understanding of current emission levels and the potential for reduction. The data collected included the daily fuel consumption for power generation, transportation, and handling vehicles. The CO2 emissions resulting from fuel consumption were calculated and measured to be 103.5 metric tonnes. Our analysis determined that the primary contributor to the emissions was the energy generation on the site, primarily from the generators. Additionally, it was found that the circulating system on the rig was the main source of CO2 emissions. The study underscores the necessity for long-term impact assessments of drilling fluids and new technologies, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to further decrease emissions.

In mining, the traditional system of operation relies on equipment that consumes large amounts of energy. In mine operations, trucks are widely used due to their flexibility, loading ca-pacity, and adaptability to various terrain conditions. However, they have high diesel oil consump-tion and high emission rates of smoke, particulate matter, and mainly carbon gas from diesel en-gines. This article offers a comprehensive view on the effect of hydrogen added to the diesel engine in the search for renewable energy alternatives that are in tune with the reduction of the environ-mental impact arising from the use of petroleum-derived fuels. The article presents an overview about the challenges in reducing the diesel fuel consumption of trucks employed in mining. It ap-proaches the effect of controlled hydrogen addition on diesel engine performance, consumption reduction, and greenhouse gas emissions. Followed by a discussion of the main technologies used to manufacture hydrogen and their production costs. The results of the studies show that hydrogen is a promising alternative for reducing operational, energy, and emissions costs, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), but it faces barriers in production, storage, and supply costs. We highlight the “green hydrogen”, carbon-free, which contributes to the decarbonization process in mines, as open pit or underground ones.

The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C‐C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon‐circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water‐gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite‐based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small‐pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one‐pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in‐depth for Rh‐catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.

To limit the impacts of climate change, the carbon dioxide CO2 emissions (CE) correlated with the energy sector must be decreased. Reduction of CE will have a positive effect on the atmosphere by avoiding the adverse impact of global warming. To attain an eco-environment, the initial energy resource needs to move from traditional fossil fuels to unpolluted renewable energy (RE). Thus, enhancing the utilization of RE actively decreases air pollution and adds secure sustainable energy allocation to ensure future energy needs. Integrating sources of RE not only drops CE but also decreases fuel consumption, leading to significant economic savings. This paper presents the transition of global energy that will have a largely positive impact on the growth and future stability of economies with cost-effective and more sustainable all over the world. Significant reductions can be accomplished by using applicable policies and technologies. In the context of current discussions about climate change and the reduction of CE, this paper critically analyses some policies, technologies, and commonly discussed solutions. Technologies like digital twin (DT), transfer learning (TL), Edge Computing (EC), Distributed Computing (DC), and some other technologies with their work for the reduction of CE are discussed thoroughly in this paper. The given techniques in this survey paper present the best optimal solutions for CE reduction.

The growing adoption of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy systems has intensified the need for sustainable management at the end of their life cycle. This study introduces an innovative method for recycling lithium from spent LiFePO4 batteries and repurposing the recovered lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) as a carbon dioxide (CO2) absorber. The recycling process involves dismantling battery packs, separating active materials, and chemically treating the cathode to extract lithium ions, which produces Li2CO3. The efficiency of lithium recovery is influenced by factors such as leaching temperature, acid concentration, and reaction time. Once recovered, Li2CO3 can be utilized for CO2 capture in hydrogen purification processes, reacting with CO2 to form lithium bicarbonate (LiHCO3). This reaction, which is highly effective in aqueous solutions, can be applied in industrial settings to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The LiHCO3 can then be thermally decomposed to regenerate Li2CO3, creating a cyclic and sustainable use of the material. This dual-purpose process not only addresses the environmental impact of LiFePO4 battery disposal but also contributes to CO2 reduction, aligning with global climate goals. Utilizing recycled Li2CO3 decreases the demand for virgin lithium extraction, supporting a circular economy. Furthermore, integrating Li2CO3-based CO2 capture systems into existing industrial infrastructure provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for lowering carbon footprints while securing a continuous supply of lithium for future battery production. Future research should focus on optimizing lithium recovery methods, improving the efficiency of CO2 capture, and exploring synergies with other waste management and carbon capture technologies. This comprehensive strategy underscores the potential of lithium recycling to address both resource conservation and environmental protection challenges.

The buses have an irreplaceable role in the public transport system, regardless of city size. Buses powered by internal combustion engines (diesel, CNG) are still the most common concept of city buses, but in the last few years, the use of fully electric buses (E-buses) has been growing. One of the reasons for the increasing use of electric buses is their environmental advantages over conventional buses: zero emissions at the local level (Tank-To-Wheel) emission, more favourable carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the regional or national level (Well-To-Wheel), and higher energy efficiency. The EKO1 line (Vukov Spomenik-Belvil) has operated in Belgrade since 2016, with five full electric buses. The paper will present the environmental aspects of using electric buses on line EKO1 compared to diesel and CNG buses. The environmental aspects of E-buses were researched through the effects of reducing the emission of harmful exhaust gases caused by eliminating the use of diesel-powered or CNG-powered buses and introducing E-buses. Within the ecological suitability of the using E-buses, the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) that occurs indirectly during electricity production was researched and a comparison was made with the emissions of CO2 caused by the combustion of diesel fuel and CNG in buses with conventional propulsion. The paper also examined the energy efficiency of buses with different drive systems on the line EKO1, based on the analyzed energy consumption. As a result of the analysis, the introduction of electric buses on the EKO1 line was justified from the point of view of improving the environment through the reduction of harmful gas emissions and decarbonization as well as better energy efficiency.

Environmental protection and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are getting increasingly high priority in the area of mobility. Several regulations, goals and projects have been published in recent years that clearly encourage the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, the adoption of green alternatives and the use of renewable energy sources. The study compares CO2 emissions between conventional diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), and furthermore investigates the main influencing factors of GHG emissions. This study was carried out in a test–track environment, which supported the perfect reproducibility of the tests with minimum external influencing factors, allowing different types of measurements. At the results level, our primary objective was to collect and evaluate consumption and emission values using statistical methods, in terms of correlations, relationships and impact assessment. In this research, we recorded CO2 and pollutant emission values indirectly via the fleet management system (FMS) using controller area network (CAN) messages. Correlation, regression and statistical analyses were used to investigate the factors influencing fuel consumption and emissions. Our scientific work is a unique study in the field of HDVs, as the measurements were performed on the test track level, which provide accuracy for emission differences. The results of the project clearly show that gas technology can contribute to reducing GHG emissions of HDVs, and LNG provides a reliable alternative way forward for long-distance transportation, especially in areas of Europe where filling stations are already available.

Hypertrophic scars arise from aberrant wound healing and can lead to functional and aesthetic impairments. One of the common interventions for treating hypertrophic scars is fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, which employs narrow laser beams to stimulate dermal collagen deposition. Recent studies and reports have suggested that combining laser therapy with other interventions such as botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and topical growth factors may enhance treatment outcomes. Here, we examine the efficacy and safety of a sequential combination of BTX-A, fractional CO2 laser, and topical growth factors, referred to as combined therapy, for treating hypertrophic scars compared with only using fractional CO2 laser and topical growth factors, referred to as monotherapy. Our retrospective study includes 128 patients with hypertrophic scars (56 underwent monotherapy and 72 underwent combined therapy), which were followed-up for up to 15 months after the initiation of treatment to collect demographic and clinical data. Our analysis showed that the combined therapy significantly outperformed monotherapy in improving Vancouver scar scale scores (P < 0.05) and in the reduction of scar thickness (P < 0.05), without increasing adverse complications. Repeated treatments further augmented the efficacy of the combined therapy. Subgroup analysis revealed that combined therapy was notably more effective in reducing Vancouver scar scale scores and scar thickness in early-stage scars compared to late-stage (P = 0.023 and P = 0.045, respectively). Our study suggests that including BTX-A treatment before fractional CO2 laser and topical growth factors offers superior efficacy in reducing hypertrophic scars. We encourage early intervention and repeated treatments for optimal treatment outcomes.

The paper discusses the growing environmental issues caused by vehicle emissions, leading many countries to tighten their emission standards to reduce the harmful gases released by motor vehicles. This is especially important as urbanization has increased, leading to more consumption of petroleum products. As a result, there is a growing need for cleaner, more sustainable fuel alternatives. Biodiesel has been recognized as a potential solution since it is renewable, non-toxic, and less environmentally harmful than traditional diesel. The study in question explores how adding biodiesel and nanoparticles affects diesel engine performance, particularly in terms of noise and particulate matter emissions (small particles of pollution). The research was carried out using a compression ignition engine (like those found in diesel vehicles) under constant RPM (revolutions per minute) and variable loads (changes in engine stress or power requirements). The results showed that when biodiesel was blended with nanoparticles and used as fuel, there was a noticeable reduction in noise levels, carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter emissions compared to regular diesel. This suggests that biodiesel, especially when enhanced with nanoparticles, can effectively lower the harmful effects of diesel engines on the environment, offering a greener and quieter alternative.

The benefits of low-pressure laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LPLC) in patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and pulmonary effects of LPLC in patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities. This was a multicenter, parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients included patients with cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities, who were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo LPLC (10 mmHg) or standard-pressure laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC) (14 mmHg). The primary outcome was postoperative partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2). Surgical safety variables, patient recovery, pulmonary function parameters, and surgeon comfort were also compared between groups. This study enrolled 144 participants, with 124 participants extracted for the final analysis (62 in LPLC and 62 in SPLC group, respectively). The median postoperative PaCO2 was similar in the LPLC (43.3 mmHg) and SPLC (43.0 mmHg) groups (p = 0.988). Pulmonary parameters including postoperative pH, PaCO2, HCO3, and lactate levels were similar between the two groups. Postoperative base excess was significantly higher in the LPLC group (− 0.6 mmol/L [− 6.9 ~ 7.5] vs. −1.9 mmol/L [− 6.6 ~ 5.4]; p = 0.031). There was no between-group difference regarding intraabdominal operative time, rate of intraoperative bile spillage, blood loss, surgeon comfort during surgery, and conversion rate. Moreover, postoperative major complication rates, the median time to the first flatus, postoperative hospital stay, or mean postoperative visual analog scale score for pain were similar in both groups. This study found no reduction of partial pressure of CO2 with LPLC compared with SPLC for patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities. LPLC with a pneumoperitoneum pressure of 10 mmHg may be safe and feasible for these patients when performed by experienced surgeons, although it does not improve pulmonary parameters. The trial is retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04670952) on December 17, 2020.

This research aims to analyze the influence of the application of bioclimatic criteria in buildings to obtain integral well-being, energy efficiency and reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) to the environment. The growing trend for the use of sun-exposed glass in buildings, which causes the greenhouse effect, increases the interior temperature of the building and causes glare, promoting artificial cooling by inefficiently using energy; heating a room naturally and then cooling it artificially is a bad practice and stimulates the closing of the curtains, which causes the lighting of luminaires; with which the building emits carbon dioxide (CO₂) to the environment, contributing to global warming. It has been developed, with a methodological approach based on the principles of bioclimatic architecture, the analysis of the variables that allow to study this influence, in the office buildings in Miraflores (Lima, Peru), considering the AMOF building under adverse thermal and light conditions. With the results obtained, it is verified that the solution with solar geometry proposed for the AMOF building solves problems of thermal wellbeing, lighting and decreases the emission of carbon dioxide (CO₂) by 74.07 %. Therefore, it is concluded, that these considerations that were not regarded, influence the conditions of habitability and well-being of users, making the window the weakest point of the building to achieve human well-being, energy efficiency and reduction of pollution to the environment.

This study conducted a thorough analysis of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production of hot mix asphalt. The primary sources of energy usage in asphalt mixes are the heating of aggregates, asphalt, and burners, with aggregate heating accounting for a remarkable 97% of the total energy consumption. The results indicate that low-temperature asphalt mixes offer significant benefits over conventional hot mix asphalt in terms of energy efficiency and GHG emissions, with reductions in carbon dioxide emissions ranging from 18% to 36% and energy savings between 15% and 87%. Additionally, the use of recycled asphalt pavement led to a 12% decrease in carbon dioxide emissions and a 15% reduction in energy consumption. The study further explored the effects of various fuel types on emissions, revealing that replacing fuel oil with natural gas can effectively diminish the carbon footprint of the production process. By optimizing production temperatures and selecting cleaner fuel alternatives, this research highlights the potential for considerable energy savings and emission reductions within the asphalt production sector. These strategies not only promote sustainable road construction practices but also play a vital role in environmental protection and climate change mitigation, advocating for the adoption of innovative technologies in asphalt pavement production.

The use of non-fired materials with additives of vegetable waste instead of traditional building ceramics reduces the energy input and the carbon footprint in the construction sector. This applies to one- and two-story buildings due to the lower load-bearing capacity of non-fired bricks. A possibility for substitution of the fired ceramics with non-fired clay bricks with additives of straw at the building of the walls of a single-family house is analyzed. The subsequent reductions of the embodied energy, carbon dioxide, and thermal losses of the buildings are determined.

Today, most of the world’s electric energy is generated by burning hydrocarbon fuels, which causes significant emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere by thermal power plants. In world practice, flue gas cleaning systems for removing nitrogen oxides, sulfur, and ash are successfully used at power facilities but reducing carbon dioxide emissions at thermal power plants is still difficult for technical and economic reasons. Thus, the introduction of carbon dioxide capture systems at modern power plants is accompanied by a decrease in net efficiency by 8–12%, which determines the high relevance of developing methods for increasing the energy efficiency of modern environmentally friendly power units. This paper presents the results of the development and study of the process flow charts of binary and trinary combined-cycle gas turbines with minimal emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere. This research revealed that the net efficiency rate of a binary CCGT with integrated post-combustion technology capture is 39.10%; for a binary CCGT with integrated pre-combustion technology capture it is 40.26%; a trinary CCGT with integrated post-combustion technology capture is 40.35%; and for a trinary combined-cycle gas turbine with integrated pre-combustion technology capture it is 41.62%. The highest efficiency of a trinary CCGT with integrated pre-combustion technology capture is due to a reduction in the energy costs for carbon dioxide capture by 5.67 MW—compared to combined-cycle plants with integrated post-combustion technology capture—as well as an increase in the efficiency of the steam–water circuit of the combined-cycle plant by 3.09% relative to binary cycles.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">With all the environmental concern of diesel fuelled vehicle, it is a challenge to phase out them completely specifically from Heavy duty application. Most pragmatic solution lies in solutions which improves the fuel economy and reduce the carbon emission of existing diesel fuelled vehicle fleet and retain the economic feasibility offered by present diesel fuelled vehicle fleets. With implementation of Bharat Stage IV (BS VI) emission norms across country from April 2020, supply of BS VI complaint diesel fuel started and BS VI complaint vehicles with upgraded engine technologies and after treatment devices started to come which made present vehicle fleets heterogeneous with substantive number of BS IV vehicle. Beside improvement of engine technologies, existing BS IV vehicle fleet performance can be enhanced through improved fuel and lubricants solutions. The present research work is a step towards improving the fuel economy of existing BS IV diesel vehicles through the intervention of differentiated diesel fuel and dedicated state of the art lubricants combinations.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">Developed through modification &amp; up-gradation of BS VI diesel fuel, Differentiated Diesel fuel is having excellent injector cleaning properties, improved combustion, low soot formation etc which intern improve the combustion result in fuel economy improvement and reduce carbon emissions. Further, efforts were made to comprehensively review the lubricant requirement of vehicle. Green combo lubricants have been designed &amp; developed with state-of-the-art lubricants combination comprising engine oil, transmission oil and axle oil which reduce the friction from engine and drivelines and results in further fuel economy benefit. To evaluate the actual fuel economy improvement and emission reduction credentials, comprehensive field trials of Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo lubricants were undertaken in fleet of heavy-duty diesel buses deputed at state transport. State transport was selected due to availability of BS IV complaint diesel fuelled buses of varied vintage from 50,000 km to 200,000 km and nearby vicinity to have better field trial supervision. Field trials were designed in such a way that combined effect of Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo Lubricants and then effect of Green Combo lubricants alone can be evaluated. Fleet of buses were charged with Green Combo lubricants after proper flushing and put new engine oil filter. After charging the Green Combo lubricants, buses were fuelled with Differentiated Diesel and sent to their routine routes for actual running for evaluating the combined effect of differentiated diesel and Green Combo lubricants for initial field trials and buses covered in the range of 25,000 km to 40,000 km each. Afterwards, field trial buses were fuelled with normal BS VI diesel and completed the field trials for evaluation the effect of Green Combo lubricants only. Used engine oil samples and idle emissions through portable emission measurement system as per field trial protocol were taken during the field trials.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">120,000 km field trials were successfully completed, and it demonstrated that Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo Lubricant together improved the fuel economy by 8% - 9% and emission reduction in Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Total Hydrocarbon (THC) are 4.5%, 10%, 4% and 5 % respectively. Green Combo lubricants alone improved the fuel economy by 4% - 5%. Used engine oil analysis confirmed the satisfactory performance of Green Combo lubricants during field trials. Based on theoretical assessment of implementation of this combination together at throughout state transport leads to saving of ~ 350 Kilolitre's (KL) Diesel annually and thus ~ 925 Tonne CO<sub>2</sub> annually which shows the immense potential of saving the precious diesel fuel and reduced the carbon emission.</div></div>

Abstract Carbon reduction during the operational phase of buildings is a critical component in achieving global carbon neutrality objectives. Current methods for estimating carbon dioxide emissions in this phase predominantly focus on national or city-level scales, often ignoring the heterogeneity in building types and functions. This oversight limits the precision with which low-carbon management technologies can be applied to retrofit existing buildings effectively. To address this gap, we develop a building-based emissions accounting approach at city-scale that considers building type, function, floor area, and floor height of individual building. Additionally, we integrate point source data from facility-level power plants to characterize the structure of the energy supply sector. We then propose a suite of emission reduction technologies tailored for the operational phase of buildings, constructing baseline, regulatory, and blueprint scenarios to analyze the emission reduction pathways from 2020 to 2050. The demand-side pathways primarily target two key areas of emission reduction, such as modifying energy consumption behaviors by replacing conventional lighting with energy-efficient alternatives. On the supply-side, three major technological categories are addressed, including the conversion of coal-fired power plants to coal-biomass co-firing systems to enhance power generation efficiency. We applied the methodology to a global city of Nanjing, encompassing 534,000 individual buildings across 101 streets. Our analysis reveals that the carbon intensity of terminal energy use in commercial buildings in Nanjing is approximately 3.9 times higher than that in residential buildings. Enhancing energy efficiency in end-use sectors such as HVAC systems, commercial lighting, and electrical equipment emerges as the most effective strategy for reducing carbon emissions during the operational phase of commercial buildings. From a supply-side perspective, the early retirement of coal-fired power plants offers the most significant contribution to emission reductions. This approach accelerates the transition to a more efficient energy structure by phasing out outdated capacities before 2045 and optimizing the deployment of advanced power generation technologies, such as solar, wind, nuclear. Our findings offer targeted pathways for emission reduction during the operational phase of buildings and provide valuable scientific insights for policymakers.

Abstract This study explores a new approach in modeling explicit targets for decarbonization of the electricity and transport sectors combined with separate targets for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) based on the current plans and strategies put forward or expected by countries. Additionally, we examine an equitable "fair share" scenario that aligns sectoral decarbonization timelines and CDR liabilities with the respective capabilities of countries. In this "capability" burden-sharing principle, developed countries with the financial means to support their climate change mitigation efforts undertake faster energy transition while developing countries with lower incomes are allowed an extended timeline for decarbonization and are exempted from excessive CDR obligations. Here, we modify a technology-rich multi-sector model in a manner where explicit sectoral emission reduction and CDR targets can be modeled. Our analysis reveals that adopting this sector-specific strategy shows a potential reduction in residual emissions by up to 35%, and a 35-45% decrease in carbon removal requirement. Furthermore, sector-specific decarbonization and carbon removal targets not only help mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change but also promote sustainability by supporting food security and reducing the global demand for water, land, and fertilizer necessary for energy production and negative emissions.

Although EVs offer environmental and economic advantages, battery performance challenges such as electrode degradation and electrolyte decomposition hinder their widespread adoption. This paper investigates the use of nanomaterials in battery coatings and membranes to improve EV battery performance and lifespan. Conductive polymers like Polyaniline (PANI), carbon-based materials such as g-C₃N₄/CNTs, and α-Fe₂O₃@C are explored for their capacity to enhance electrode stability, electrical conductivity, and specific capacity. Additionally, the paper addresses how nanocoatings mitigate issues like electrode degradation, parasitic reactions, and thermal management, ultimately extending battery life and improving safety. By integrating nanotechnology, significant advancements in battery efficiency, longevity, and safety can be achieved, making EVs a more viable and sustainable transportation option. These developments are essential for achieving global carbon reduction goals and supporting a cleaner future.

ABSTRACT It has been a long‐standing challenge to cultivate capable and resilient oxygen electrocatalysts with higher activity, low price, and long lifetime to replace the commonly used platinum group metals, i.e., Pt for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and RuO 2 /IrO 2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work presents a promising approach to address the challenges associated with oxygen electrocatalysis by introducing a cobalt phosphide/metallic cobalt (Co 2 P/Co) core wrapped in a nitrogen‐doped conductive carbon (CN) nano‐shell, demonstrated as Co 2 P/Co@NC. The strong chemical bonding between metallic cobalt and phosphorus, nitrogen and conductive carbon contributes to the enhanced conductivity and stability of the electrocatalyst. The nitrogen doping in the carbon shell provides additional Co–N active sites, which are crucial for ORR activity. Co 2 P/Co@NC demonstrates promising activity and stability compared to noble metals such as Pt for ORR in an alkaline medium. This suggests its potential as a cost‐effective alternative to Pt‐based catalysts. Further, due to factors such as strong cobalt‐phosphide bonding, high cobalt oxidation states and excellent conductivity of the nitrogen‐doped carbon shell, the Co 2 P/Co@NC outperforms noble metal oxides like iridium dioxide (IrO 2 ) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) for OER. Co 2 P/Co@NC exhibits a low potential difference of 0.63 V, which is among the lowest reported for bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of both ORR and OER. Overall, the described strategy offers a promising avenue for developing efficient, low‐cost and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reactions, which are crucial for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries.

Abstract The most of Sub‐Saharan African (SSA) countries have been affected by climate change and food insecurity problems due to the reduction of production and productivity of cereal crops in the continent. The purpose of this research was to examine the short‐run and long‐run effects of climate change on agricultural productivity in 24 selected SSA countries. In the study, a systematic Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) Model was used with recent data from 24 SSA countries from 2001 to 2020. The panel regression result revealed that temperature and precipitation showed positive significant effects whereas carbon dioxide emission had negatively influenced the cereal crop productivity in the region. Specifically, the empirical result indicates that a one percent increase in precipitation increases cereal crop productivity by 0.27%. The empirical result of the GMM model revealed that political stability, temperature, GDP per capita, trade openness, carbon dioxide emission, fertilizer consumption, and precipitation have both short‐run and long‐run effects, while precipitation has only a short‐run effect on agricultural productivity in the study area. A key implication of this work is the realization of the lagging effects of climate change in determining cereal crop production and productivity. This study was unable to include all SSA countries because the excluded countries did not have sufficient data on the selected variables in the study. Hence, adopting high‐temperature and drought‐resistant types of enhanced cereal crops is advised to combat the negative effects of climate change in the study area.

Abstract To address the bottle‐neck carbon‐carbon coupling issue during electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (eCO 2 RR) to multicarbon (C 2+ ) products, this work develops an anion‐directed strategy (Cl − , NO 3 − , and SO 4 2− ) to regulate interatomic distance of Cu diatoms. In comparison to pristine Cu (with a typical Cu‐Cu distance of 2.53 Å), Cu‐boroimidazole frameworks (BIF)/SO 4 , NO 3 , and Cl material shows elongated diatomic distance of 3.90 Å, 4.21 Å, and 3.30 Å, respectively. Among them, the Cu‐BIF/Cl exhibits an outstanding eCO 2 RR performance with a Faradaic efficiency of 72.12% for C 2+ products and an industrial‐level current density of 539.0 mA cm −2 at −1.75 V versus RHE. Significantly, according to theoretical and in situ experimental investigation, the highly electronegative Cl − ion lifts d‐band center of Cu sites of Cu‐BIF/Cl, facilitating *CO adsorption with a low Gibbs free energy and its later dimerization overcoming a small energy barrier. In addition, this strategy to manipulate interatomic distance for diatomic catalysts, can also be adaptable to other reactions involving intermediate coupling and following the Langmuir‐Hinshelwood mechanism, such as carbon‐nitrogen coupling, nitrogen‐nitrogen coupling, etc.

The energy sector is the largest contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions. To address the current climate emergency however, energy market actors (e.g., energy providers, nongovernmental organizations, policy makers) try to make individual consumers take responsibility for achieving an overall net balance of zero greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this research is to understand this process of responsibilization and its implications. The research method is a narrative discourse analysis of hundreds of public documents by energy market actors. The findings show that market actors try to shape ordinary consumers into “net-zero heroes” with responsibility for emissions reduction but end up creating a tragedy when they translate their collective agenda. These findings have implications for consumer responsibilization specifically and the conversion of agendas into action more generally. Theoretically, this research shows (1) the influence of the translation stage in the agenda-to-action chain, (2) the way market actors attempt to form net-zero heroes, and (3) the limited usefulness of the hero narrative. Practically, the research explains the implications of making consumers solely responsible for the emissions reduction problem.

Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food security, which is significantly affected by climate change, primarily driven by human activities that increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accounting for approximately 13% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions, agricultural practices-such as livestock rearing, rice cultivation and synthetic fertilizer use which contribute substantially to global warming. Emissions from nitrous oxide (N₂O), methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) exacerbate this issue, with N₂O being particularly concerning due to its high global warming potential. Mitigation strategies within the agricultural sector are essential, including improved nutrient management, the use of nitrification inhibitors and innovative fertilizer application technologies. Organic farming demonstrates lower N₂O emissions compared to conventional practices, emphasizing the importance of sustainable agricultural methods. Additionally, conservation tillage and practices like zero-tillage help reduce CO₂ emissions by minimizing soil disturbance and enhancing carbon sequestration. Biochar application further supports soil health and GHG reduction by enhancing carbon storage. To mitigate methane emissions from rice fields, reduced tillage and the introduction of electron acceptors can effectively inhibit methanogenesis. As CO₂ constitutes about 72% of total GHG emissions, agricultural practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) are critical for effective carbon sequestration. Overall, the agricultural sector holds significant potential for GHG mitigation, with studies suggesting that 89% of the mitigation potential can be achieved through carbon sequestration. Therefore, adopting these strategies is crucial not only for reducing emissions but also for ensuring sustainable agricultural productivity in the face of climate change challenges.

CO2 electroreduction is a potential pathway to achieve net-zero emissions in the chemical industry. Yet, CO2 loss, resulting from (bi)carbonate formation, renders the process energy-intensive. Acidic environments can address the issue but at the expense of compromised product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs), particularly for multi-carbon (C2+) products, as rapid diffusion and migration of protons (H+) favors competing H2 and CO production. Here, we present a strategy of tuning the 2-position substituent length on benzimidazole (BIM)-based copper (Cu) coordination polymer (CuCP) precatalyst – to enhance CO2 reduction to C2+ products in acidic environments. Lengthening the substituent from H to nonyl enhances H+ diffusion retardation and decreases Cu-Cu coordination numbers (CNs), favoring further reduction of CO. This leads to a nearly 24× enhancement of selectivity towards CO hydrogenation and C-C coupling at 60 mA cm−2. We report the highest C2+ product FE of more than 70% at 260 mA cm−2 on pentyl-CuCP and demonstrate a CO2-to-C2+ single-pass conversion (SPC) of ~54% at 180 mA cm−2 using pentyl-CuCP in zero-gap electrolyzers. Acidic CO2 electroreduction suffers poor selectivity for multi-carbon products. Here, the authors report that lengthening the 2-position substituents of benzimidazole-based copper coordination polymer precatalysts retards H+ diffusion, reduces Cu-Cu coordination numbers, and promotes C-C coupling.

The research and development of resin concrete in Japan have evolved in tandem with various regions and international activities. It is a common and indispensable material for infrastructures in the world at present. On the other hand, there are so many different Acts of God, such as earthquakes, typhoons, and torrential rains, that occur in Japan, and disaster measures are an important issue. In this paper, the current status and practical application of resin concrete mainly applied for sewage products in Japan were investigated and discussed. Based on the regional characteristics of Japan, a resin concrete manhole of high quality to compensate for the defects of cement concrete was developed. Furthermore, the future trends in the research and development of resin concrete including environmental issues such as carbon dioxide emissions reduction, application of recycled materials and bioplastics to replace natural aggregates and petroleum-derived resin for concrete are proposed and discussed. A homogenization analysis method is introduced particularly to bring out the ability of resin concrete as composite materials and to carry out material development efficiently.

Looking at pasture-based beef cattle production systems, there needs to be more pasture management and low zootechnical indexes, which culminate in low productivity and environmental impact. In this sense, cattle farming has been labeled as harmful to the environment due to the emission of gases that can contribute to the excessive increase in the greenhouse effect. These gases are methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide, which come from ruminal fermentation, manure fermentation, and biomass management. The objective was to simulate eight scenarios: the first occurred in areas of degradation and desertification of pastures induced by livestock farming, the second occurred with the recovery of degraded pasture areas, the third occurred with the improvement of pasture management, the fourth occurred with the implementation of integrated production systems, the fifth occurred with the improvement in diet quality, the sixth occurred with the association of supplementation strategies for grazing cattle with fattening in confinement, the seventh occurred with the reduction in the feeding cycle production of beef cattle and the eighth occurred with the intensification of land use. It is concluded that the adoption of more intensive production systems proves to be more efficient, both productively and environmentally, by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and improving zootechnical indices, guaranteeing the supply of animal protein in the face of growing demand globally.

A series of development technologies of "horizontal well plus volume fracturing" have been established to achieve an annual output of one million tons of crude oil in 7 the Mahu tight conglomerate reservoir. However, such oil fields generally face problems such as rapid pressure drop, rapid production decline, difficulty in water injection, and gas channeling, seriously affecting the beneficial development of tight conglomerate reservoirs. To solve these problems, in this study, we carried out the feasibility experiment of different gas injection developments and the potential evaluation of enhanced oil recovery based on the combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulation. The results show that CO2, rich gas, and dry gas can be miscible with crude oil in X oilfield under the original formation conditions. Both CO2 and hydrocarbon gas have expansion and viscosity reduction abilities. Under the same mole fraction of injected gas, the volume expansion ability and viscosity reduction ability of CO2 to crude oil are 2.14 and 2.25 times that of hydrocarbon gas, respectively. Numerical simulation results show that the well pattern suitable for gas injection and energy supplement is a vertical well injection and horizontal well production, and the angle between the horizontal well direction and the horizontal maximum principal stress direction is between 0° and 30°. Both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations show that the CO2 injection medium has the best recovery effect, which can increase the recovery rate by 13.8% compared with the depletion development. This research provides insights into the effective development of tight conglomerate reservoirs.

Maintaining indoor environmental quality in residential buildings is essential for occupants’ comfort, productivity, and health, with effective mechanical ventilation playing a key role in removing or diluting indoor pollutants. A two-week experimental campaign was conducted in an apartment in Lyon, France, known for its poor urban air quality, assessing temperature, relative humidity, CO2, and PM2.5 concentrations. A model verification study was performed to compare experimental measurements against numerical modeling in the living room and bedroom, leading to errors in the accuracy of the sensors. In addition, this study also investigates the impact of different ventilation strategies on indoor air quality. This research evaluates a baseline mechanical exhaust-only ventilation approach with constant air volume against two innovative smart ventilation approaches: mechanical exhaust-only ventilation with humidity control and mechanical exhaust-only ventilation with room-level CO2 and humidity control. A key contribution of this research is the novel coupling of multizone simulation models (DOMUS and CONTAM) with a CFD tool to refine pressure coefficients on the building façade, which enhances the accuracy of indoor air quality predictions. The smart ventilation strategies showed improvements, including a 20% reduction in CO2 concentration and a 5% reduction in the third-quartile PM2.5 concentration, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing ventilation and pollutant dilution. This research provides valuable insights into advanced ventilation strategies and modeling techniques in urban environments.

Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3‐ under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy‐intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre‐incorporating [V10O28]6‐ into NH2‐MIL‐101‐Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL‐n can efficiently drive co‐reduction of NO3‐ and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4 mmol h‐1 gcat‐1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with ‐NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3‐ and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO4 nanocluster within a NH2‐framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O2/N2.

Biodiesel is a promising alternative fuel that represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source. Due to its complete carbon cycle, it reduces dependence on fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. However, the use of biodiesel in diesel engines is associated with several challenges, including an increase in nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions, incompatibility with cold climates, and lower calorific value. By using nanoparticles as fuel additives, there is a potential to improve the properties of biodiesel and address its shortcomings. In this work, the characteristics of biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil have been enhanced using nanoparticle additives, which result in the usage of a higher percentage of the biodiesel in diesel engines. Nanoparticles of cerium oxide, silicon dioxide, and aluminum oxide have been investigated in different concentrations as biodiesel additives. Two mathematical models are introduced in this work and solved by LINGO optimization software (version 18); the first one seeks to predict the characteristics of biodiesel with nanoparticles in any blend of diesel–biodiesel–nanoparticles, while the second model aims to maximize the biodiesel ratio in a biodiesel–diesel–nanoparticles blend. The application of the combined two models aids in the selection of the optimal nanomaterial that improves the properties of biodiesel and permits an increase in the biodiesel mixing ratio in the fuel. The results show that the best nanoparticle type is cerium oxide at a concentration of 100 ppm, and the optimal mixing ratio of biodiesel blended with CeO2 nanoparticles is 24.892%. An unmodified diesel engine is operated and evaluated with the optimum blend (24.892% biodiesel + 75.108% petrol diesel + 100 ppm CeO2 nanoparticles). It is found that significant improvements in engine performance and emissions compared with the conventional diesel are achieved. The reductions in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), smoke opacity, and carbon monoxide emissions are 24%, 52%, and 30%, respectively.

Achieving mode shift in the transport sector will help Australia to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, although robust data on its effectiveness have previously been limited. This analysis provides valuable new information on mode shift impacts on emissions in Australia and demonstrates some recently developed assessment tools. The analysis considers the potential of a shift from road to rail to reduce well-to-wheel (WTW) emissions (as CO2-equivalents, CO2-e) in 2019, 2030, and 2050, specifically for a case study involving the transport of passengers and freight between Brisbane and Melbourne. The analysis provides emission intensities (EIs) in grams per passenger-km (g/pkm) and grams per tonne-km (g/tkm), as well as annualized emissions, and considers the variability and uncertainty in the estimates using a probabilistic approach. The transfer of passengers and freight from road to rail has the potential to significantly reduce emissions. Electric rail delivers the largest and least uncertain emission reductions. For passenger transport, the EI of electric rail (12 g CO2-e/pkm in 2030; 6.5 g CO2-e/pkm in 2050) is considerably lower than that of road transport (143.2 g CO2-e/pkm in 2030; 58.9 g CO2-e/pkm in 2050), and the uncertainty is lower. For freight transport, the EI of electric rail (8.6 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 5.0 CO2-e/tkm in 2050) is also substantially lower than that for road transport (48.3 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 29.5 g CO2-e/tkm in 2050). The EI for diesel rail freight (27.0 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 26.1 g CO2-e/tkm in 2050) is around half of the value for road transport in 2030, but road transport becomes more competitive by 2050. The complete transfer of passengers between Brisbane and Melbourne from road to electric rail would reduce annual WTW emissions for passenger transport by 75 &ndash; 90%, depending on the year. The complete transfer of freight from road to diesel rail would reduce annual emissions by 45% in 2019 and 2030 and by 10% in 2050. The study and tools will help researchers, policymakers, transport/land-use planners, and network operators to quantify, design, and implement mode shift measures to reduce emissions.

Abstract Carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage (CCS) is essential in achieving the net-zero target. Despite this increasing recognition, current CCS deployments are far behind targeted ambitions. A key reason is that CCS is often perceived as too expensive. While assessments of the costs of CCS have traditionally looked at impact at the plant level, the present study seeks to understand the costs and environmental benefits that will be passed to consumers via end-products and services. In particular, nine end-products/services (bridge construction, electricity from onshore wind power, electricity from offshore wind power, transport of a container via ship, a magazine, the production and transport of an avocado, a beer can, waste treatment via waste-to-energy, and long-distance air travel) connected to ten potential areas of application for CCS (cement production, iron and steel production, oil and gas production, natural gas processing, refining, ship propulsion engines, pulp and paper production, urea production, waste-to-energy, and direct air capture).&#xD;The evaluations highlight that significant emission reductions (beyond 50 %) could be achieved at marginal costs for end-users in six end-products/services: bridge construction, electricity from onshore wind power, electricity from offshore wind power, transport by ship, magazine, and waste treatment. Moderate emission reductions (between 11 and 37%) could be achieved in two cases at virtually no cost (increase below 1%): beer can and avocado production. Finally, only the case of using direct air capture to compensate for emissions from air travel was found to raise the cost for end-users significantly.&#xD;Although more research is still needed in this area, this work broadens our understanding of the real cost and benefits of CCS and provides useful insights for decision-makers and society.

For presentation at the 70th AVS International Symposium and Exhibition. In this work, we show that the activity of Ag electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 to CO conversion is improved when supported on sulfur-doped (S-doped) carbon materials. S-doped carbon support was created by treating the heavily sputtered, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in H2S at elevated temperatures, as confirmed by the S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peak. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images indicated that Ag nanoparticles supported on S-doped HOPG had similar size distributions as those supported on sulfur-free (S-free) HOPG. While both catalysts reached > 90% CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) at E = -1.3 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), Ag catalysts supported on S-doped HOPG demonstrated 70% higher CO turnover frequency (TOFCO = 3.4 CO/atomAg/s) than those supported on S-free HOPG (TOFCO = 2.0 CO/atomAg/s). Preliminary calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) indicated a more favorable energetic pathway of CO2-to-CO at the C-S-Ag interface, tentatively consistent with experiments. These results hint at a new approach to design active and selective electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion.

To achieve carbon neutrality in 2050, Thailand has focused on reducing CO2 emissions in the energy sector. Small modular reactors (SMRs) and renewable energy such as wind and solar represent an interesting alternative for the decarbonization of the energy sector. This study aims to investigate the possibility of establishing a grid-connected hybrid energy system (Grid/Solar PV/Wind Turbine/BESS/SMRs) to fulfill the energy demand of Phuket Island in Thailand and to minimize net present cost (NPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions. A grid-connected hybrid renewable generation system was simulated using HOMER. Four combinations of grid-connected and renewable energy sources were developed based on the electricity demand and renewable resources available at the site. The simulation results indicate that the most optimal scenario is the Grid/PV/WT/SMR system, which offers a 28% reduction in NPC and LCOE compared to the grid-only system and reduces CO2 emissions by over 58% compared to the total emissions from the utility grid. The simulation results demonstrate that the grid-connected and hybrid energy system is the most viable option to meet electricity demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on Phuket Island.

The object of this study is a hybrid energy system that integrates the processes of recycling used tires with the use of alternative energy sources to design a sustainable and environmentally safe power generation system. The problem addressed in this study is to find effective methods for recycling waste tires for electricity generation, as traditional recycling methods are energy-intensive and lead to the loss of valuable resources. Three methods of tire processing have been considered: pyrolysis, thermal degradation, and mechanical grinding. The method of electricity generation using pyrolysis has demonstrated high environmental performance due to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a high rate of renewable energy (80 %). According to the results of the study, the use of 5 MW pyrolysis furnaces in combination with 500 kW solar panels provides a reduction in dependence on fossil sources, reducing CO2 emissions to 50.0 kg/year. The method has high capital costs (NPC USD 4.2 million), but the cost of energy production (COE USD 0.18/kWh) makes this method competitive in the long run. Thermal degradation provides a balanced approach in terms of energy efficiency (75 %) and environmental performance. Although its CO2 emissions are higher than in pyrolysis, the method makes it possible to obtain additional products that could be used in other industries, thereby increasing economic efficiency. Mechanical shredding has the lowest average energy costs (USD 0.12/kWh) and the lowest CO2 emissions (30.0 kg/year), making it ideal for cost-conscious businesses. The study confirms the possibility of effective integration of renewable sources with tire recycling methods. The practical use of the research results is possible during the implementation of grant projects for the recycling of used tires, and in the work of relevant government structures for devising a policy for the disposal of used tires

The use of renewable solar energy for the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has garnered significant interest owing to its dual benefits: reducing the greenhouse effect and producing high-energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Transition metals play a crucial role in catalyzing the CO2RR; however, their scarcity and high cost pose challenges in achieving sustainable chemistry. In this study, we developed a metal-free CO2RR catalytic system using triazolium, a small and structurally simple compound, as the key catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of a solution containing a carbazole photosensitizer and triazolium salt under 1 atm pressure of CO2 afforded formate in high yield at room temperature. No other reduced products of CO2 were detected. The turnover number of the catalyst exceeded 2300, indicating high catalytic activity and durability. Mechanistic studies revealed that the triazolium salt serves as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst, with a carbon-centered radical as the catalytically active species. A study on the relationship between the chemical structure and the catalytic activity of various triazolium analogs elucidated the essential structural properties required for carbon-centered HAT catalysts. The results provide valuable insights for future research on CO2RR utilizing transition metal-free organic molecules as catalysts, which could contribute to environmentally friendly and sustainable methods.

Environmental degradation remains a significant global challenge, particularly in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries. This study primarily examines the impact of Islamic finance, proxied by two indicators, namely Islamic financial assets and Islamic banking financing, and other variables including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), urbanization, renewable energy adoption, and forest area, on CO2 emissions. This study revealed that Islamic financial assets had a negative impact on CO2 emissions, highlighting their importance in supporting green investments and sustainability. However, Islamic banking financing has little influence on emissions reduction, most likely due to carbon-intensive initiatives. Furthermore, GDP growth increases emissions, although FDI, urbanization, and forest areas help to lower them. These findings underscore Islamic finance's critical role in fostering sustainable development, as well as the necessity for better green Islamic financing policies in OIC member nations. The findings also provide important insights for policymakers working to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability in Islamic finance.

This research proposes a framework for modeling and comparing two electricity scenarios for Nigeria by 2050, focusing on the inclusion and exclusion of electricity storage technologies. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to generate a design matrix for data collection, with EnergyPLAN software used to create energy system simulations on the CCD data for four outputs: total annual cost, CO2 emissions, critical excess electricity production (CEEP), and electricity import. Three machine learning algorithms, support vector regression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were tuned using Bayesian optimization to develop models mapping the inputs to outputs. A genetic algorithm was employed for multi-objective optimization to determine the optimal input capacities that minimize the outputs. Results indicated that incorporating electricity storage technologies (EST) leads to a 37% increase in renewable electricity sources (RES) share, resulting in a 19.14% reduction in CO2 emissions. EST such as battery energy storage systems (BESS), pumped hydro storage (PHS), and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) storage allow for the storage of the critical excess electricity that comes with increasing RES share. Integrating EST in Nigeria's 2050 energy landscape is crucial for incorporating more renewable electricity sources into the energy system, thereby reducing CO2 emissions and managing excess electricity production. This study outlines a plan for optimal electricity production to meet Nigeria's 2050 demand, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that combines fossil fuels, renewable energy, nuclear power, and advanced storage solutions to achieve a sustainable and efficient electricity system.

Global CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have reached unprecedented levels, driven primarily by anthropogenic emissions. This alarming rise in greenhouse gases (GHGs) presents a significant challenge to global climate stability, with CO2 being the primary contributor to climate change. Industrial activities are major sources of these emissions, highlighting the urgent need for innovative and sustainable solutions. Plasma technology emerges as particularly promising, which creates a highly reactive environment through the presence of high-energy electrons. By leveraging such processes, CO2 can be transformed into useful chemicals, contributing to both emissions reduction and resource circularity. One interesting reaction, which can be carried out in a plasma environment, is the dry reforming of methane (DRM), a process that utilizes CO2 and methane (CH4) to produce a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). These are valuable intermediates for further chemical synthesis, which can be used to synthesize a variety of chemicals and fuels. Through chemical kinetics modelling a wide range of conditions is explored to better understand the core chemical kinetics of DRM in warm plasmas. Thereby examining the performance of the process across a wide temperature range and highlighting the limitations of various gas mixtures. The findings demonstrate where plasma-specific kinetics diverges from thermal gas-phase chemistry, offering new insights into the unique behaviour of plasma-driven reactions. Also, the effect of nitrogen (N2) on plasma-based DRM is investigated through computational modelling to support experimental results and demonstrate the role of N2 in the conversion process within a gliding arc plasmatron (GAP) reactor. Revealing a small fraction of N2 can improve the process. Furthermore, after the plasma has converted the gas molecules, further chemical changes can still occur, influencing the overall efficiency and product distribution. The model demonstrates that quenching the gas temperature does not generally improve performance, except in CO2-rich mixtures where certain reactions are influenced by the cooling process, leading to notable changes in the product distribution. The benefits of combining the hot plasma effluent with unconverted gas are also explored, as the residual heat from the plasma can be reused to drive additional reactions, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the process. The findings presented improve the understanding of plasma-based DRM technology, forming a foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies, and contribute to the broader goal of reducing GHG emissions and supporting the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future.

This study aims to assess the capability of using a specially designed device to monitor changes in gas concentration (CO2, NH3, H2S, and O2) in the atmosphere above the minced beef meat, during storage at refrigerated temperature. With its array of sensing channels, the multi-gas detector device facilitates the detection of precise gas concentrations in sensitive environments, enabling the monitoring of various processes occurring within stored meat. To delve into the connection between microbial activity and gas emissions during storage, fluctuations in microbial populations in the meat were observed, focusing on prevalent meat microbiota such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Enterobacteriaceae. A significant reduction of O2 content in the stored samples was observed after seven days (p < 0.05), while a significant release of CO2 was detected on the fourth day of storage. Significant changes (p < 0.05) in the gas content were tracked until the 11th day of storage followed by intensive microbial growth. NH3 and H2S levels remained undetectable throughout the experiment. The results showed a correlation between an increase in gas content in the headspace and an increase in the number of LAB and Enterobacteriaceae in meat. Modern multi-gas detector devices can indirectly determine microbial contamination in closed meat packaging.

Abstract. Across the last deglaciation, the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (pCO2) increased from ~180 to ~280 ppm. However, the impact of pCO2 changes on vegetation across the last deglaciation remains poorly understood. Under full glacial low pCO2, plants experienced constraints on photosynthesis. Therefore, a significant reduction in pCO2 limitation should have impacted local and regional vegetation dynamics across deglaciation. We hypothesise that deglacial pCO2 rise could have (1) led to a gradual reduction of the physiological constraint promoting forest response when moisture availability was sufficient, despite low temperatures; and (2) amplified the response of forest development to warmer and wetter conditions. The high-resolution analysis of terrestrial (pollen, C29:C31 organic biomarker) and marine (alkenone-derived Sea Surface Temperature, C37: 4%, and long-chain n-alkanes ratios) indicators, using a direct land-sea direct comparison, in the Iberian margin site Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) U1385 ("Shackleton site") throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and last deglaciation allowed us to track and compare the changes with shifts in global pCO2. The LGM is characterised by a grassland-heathland mosaic type ecosystem, triggered by cool and moderately humid conditions but low pCO2 levels may have exacerbated physiological drought and suppressed forest development. During Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)the coldest and most arid conditions combined with sustained low pCO2 values precluded forest development and resulted in the dominance of Mediterranean steppe or semi-desert vegetation. The Bølling-Allerød (BA) is characterised by a temperature optimum (warmest SSTs and forest development) and variable moisture condition, while increasing pCO2 which contributed to the highest levels of forest development. Within the BA, significant SW Iberian forest development occurred at ~15 cal kyr B.P. associated with an increase in pCO2 above 225 ppm. During the Younger Dryas (YD), cool temperatures combined with sufficient moisture availability allowed the maintenance of a grassland-forest mosaic, the increasing values of pCO2 in this period should have offset the low temperature as well as the moisture levels and allow the forest to persist. The overlooked role of pCO2 could explain an intriguing feature observed in Site U1385 and other Iberian margin records, namely the near absence of forest during the LGM and HS1 but relatively high forest cover during the YD. Our study aims to shed light on the influence of climatic factors (temperature and moisture availability) together with pCO2 as thresholds on forest response to deglacial climate changes across the Iberian Peninsula.

The increasing environmental challenges posed by the widespread use of fossil fuels and the fluctuating nature of renewable energy have driven the need for more efficient and sustainable energy solutions. Current research is actively exploring hybrid energy systems as a means to address these issues. One such area of focus is the integration of Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) with gas and steam turbines, utilizing both natural gas (NG) and solar parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) as energy sources. This study examines the performance of a hybrid system implemented in Kirkuk, Iraq, a region known for its substantial solar radiation. Previous research has shown that hybrid systems can effectively enhance energy conversion efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, but there is still a need to assess the specific benefits of such systems in different geographical and operational contexts. The analysis reveals a thermal efficiency of 59.32% and an exergy efficiency of 57.28%. The exergoeconomic analysis highlights the optimal energy cost at USD 71.93/MWh when the compressor pressure ratio is set to 8 bar. The environmental assessment demonstrates a significant reduction in CO2/emissions, with a carbon footprint of 316.3 kg CO2/MWh at higher compressor pressure ratios. These results suggest that integrating solar energy with natural gas can substantially improve electricity generation while being both cost-effective and environmentally sustainable.

With renewables growing at an unprecedented pace and critical carbon budget deadlines approaching, research is shifting to the new frontier of Paris aligned 1.5 °C mitigation pathways for hard-to-abate sectors, including the chemical industry sector. This is a significant challenge with chemical products such as plastics, fertilizers and many more products intertwined with today's society and with CO2 emissions originating both from energy and from chemical conversions. This paper presents a detailed bottom-up production-based energy and emission calculation to make a 1.5 °C compatible scenario for the chemical industry based on three main measures compared to a business-as-usual scenario. This research found that the holistic combination of demand and supply measures is critical to reduce the different types of emissions in the sector (energy and non-energy process emissions). An overall reduction of 82% of CO2 emissions in 2050 is calculated with a decrease in base chemical production growth (− 21%), 100% renewable energy for heat and electricity (− 50%) and the introduction of novel electrical-based and biomass-based production technologies for ethylene, propylene, methanol and ammonia (− 10%). Critical system developments include slowing chemical demand growth with recycling and circularity best practices, advanced electrification of heat supply and the substantial market penetration of the current most advanced sustainable production technologies for methanol, ammonia, and ethylene based on their reasonable technology maturation trajectories. Here, green methanol and ammonia will require 381 TWh in 2030 and 3232 TWh in 2050 for green hydrogen electrolysis, which will represent 1% and 4% of global electricity demand.

As global climate change accelerates, the need for precise and high-resolution carbon emission inventories becomes increasingly urgent, particularly in rapidly developing regions. This study introduces an advanced methodology for constructing regional-scale gridded anthropogenic CO2 emission inventories, integrating the latest energy consumption data and remote sensing technologies. By systematically calculating emissions across various sectors and energy types, and utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS) for spatial distribution, we have generated a high-resolution emission map with a 1 km × 1 km grid. The accuracy of the map was validated through regression analysis with the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) dataset, ensuring its reliability. This work provides critical insights for targeted emission reduction strategies, contributing to the formulation of sustainable development policies that align with global climate objectives.

The impact of urban form on carbon emissions has become a crucial issue for sustainable socioeconomic development and the advancement of low-carbon cities. Transportation is a significant source of urban carbon emissions, highlighting the need for comprehensive research to aid China in achieving its carbon peak and neutrality goals. Currently, there is a lack of quantitative studies exploring the effects of urban form on transportation-related carbon emissions. This paper seeks to quantify the effect of urban form on the spatial and temporal patterns of transportation carbon emissions, utilizing panel data from 27 cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China, covering the years 2000 to 2020. First, CO2 emissions from transportation are estimated following IPCC guidelines, with Moran’s I utilized to analyze spatial autocorrelation. Next, urban form indicators are quantified based on landscape ecology theory. Finally, econometric models are employed for regression analysis of the panel data. The findings reveal that urban complexity, compactness, and expansion influence transportation carbon emissions to varying degrees, with urban expansion and complexity associated with increased emissions, while compactness contributes to their reduction. This study offers theoretical support and a scientific basis for low-carbon urban spatial planning and development, underscoring the importance of urban form in emissions reduction strategies.

While there is not agreement on whether CO2 electroreduction will be broadly deployed, there has been consistent interest from the field of energy researchers. The shift I noticed is not from one chemistry to another (although the specific products of interest have evolved) but a switch in the perspective of researchers.To look into this shift in perspective, I searched all papers published by ACS Energy Letters since 2018 with the keyword "CO2 reduction" and focused on papers examining electrochemical reactions, processes, and systems. I categorized the papers as focusing on one of the following aspects of CO2 electroreduction technology:1.Catalyst: At the active site, often presenting new catalyst materials, new synthetic methods for catalysts, characterization of the active site, surface reaction mechanisms, etc.2.Environment: The environment where the chemistry occurs, discussing the role of pH, electrolyte, additive layers, flow rates, temperatures, chemical potentials, etc.3.Process: A process systems perspective focusing on how to assemble electrochemical reactors, flow patterns, bulk resistance losses, scale up viability, overall performance, etc.These classifications fall in the areas of catalyst, reaction, and process or systems science and engineering that are common to the scale up of chemical conversion processes.The compiled group of 167 papers results from the publication of ∼20–30 papers per year in ACS Energy Letters over 7 years, demonstrating consistent interest in the field (see Supporting Information). After categorizing the papers, the shift in perspective I sensed became clear, as seen in Figure 1. From 2018 to 2024, the number of papers focused on studies of the catalyst in CO2 electroreduction decreased from 18 to 4, or from 75% to 18% of the total papers published on the topic. Alternatively, the number of papers focused on the environment where the chemistry occurs increased from 2 to 9, or from 8 to 40% of the papers. The data in Figure 1 suggests that this change in topical focus occurred steadily over the past 6 years. Papers focused on the CO2 electroreduction process have remain consistent.Figure 1Figure 1. % of published papers on CO2 electroreduction published in ACS Energy Letters categorized based on their topical focus: Process, Catalyst, Environment, or Mixed (see text for explanations) since 2018. The papers were identified by searching all papers published in ACS Energy Letters for "CO2 reduction" and only categorizing those that focus on electroreduction.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe shift in perspective of researchers on CO2 electroreduction from the active catalyst site to the environment where the reaction occurs is apparent from the data. It is interesting to consider what may have driven this change. The U.S. Department of Energy published a document in 2017 that summarized Basic Research Needs in Catalysis Science and highlighted the role of catalyst design "beyond the binding site"─this seems consistent? (1) It is also reasonable to consider that early discoveries of electrocatalysts that enabled high selectivity for specific products at low current densities motivated studies at higher current densities where mass, heat, and electron transport can dictate performance. Clearly, this would also shift the focus of researchers to the environment around the binding site. Perhaps this trend is just the natural development of new energy technologies where a physical/chemical process is envisioned, initial material discovery is performed, and then analysis of increasing system time and length scales is performed in attempts to scale up. But it is interesting to wonder if the focus on active site design will push the field forward further than the design of the environment around the site.So, what did I learn from this retrospective analysis? My editorial is not meant to comment on the potential viability of CO2 electroreduction, but instead to try to learn from how an intensely studied research topic evolves. The results seem to suggest that researchers who can think broadly about a topic area, who do not follow the common approach of the field and instead focus efforts from a different perspective, may end up having the longest lasting impact on the field. However, this can be hard as funding agencies, journals and referees may not recognize a new perspective as useful if it is not the current norm. But it seems that research papers that bring new viewpoints to problems of broad interest are likely to be the most impactful and have the potential to shift the perspective of the field.Supporting InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.4c02907.Focus on electroreduction of CO2 (and CO), excluding photo- and thermochemical approaches – original articles and perspectives (XLSX)nz4c02907_si_001.xlsx (27.17 kb) Terms & Conditions Most electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

Greenhouse gas and NH3 emissions are exacerbated by the inappropriate timing and excessive application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers in wheat cultivation in China. In this study, the impacts on N2O, CO2, and NH3 emissions of a delayed and reduced N application regime on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were investigated. The treatments comprised the control (N0), conventional N at 270 kg N ha−1 (N270) and optimized N application of 180 kg N ha−1 (N180), N180 + biochar at 7.5 t ha−1 (N180B7.5), N180 + biochar at 15 t ha−1 (N180B15), N180 + DMPP (a nitrification inhibitor; N180D), N180D + biochar at 7.5 t ha−1 (N180DB7.5), and N180D + biochar at 15 t ha−1 (N180DB15). Reduced N application (N180) lowered N2O and NH3 emissions. Biochar application resulted in a 4–25% and 12–16% increase in N2O and NH3 emissions, respectively. Application of DMPP significantly decreased N2O emissions by 32% while concurrently inducing a 9% increase in NH3 emissions. Co-application of DMPP and biochar significantly reduced the activity of nitrification enzymes (HAD, NOO), resulting in a reduction of 37–38% in N2O emissions and 13–14% in NH3 emissions. No significant differences in CO2 emissions were observed among the various N treatments except the N0 treatment. Application of DMPP alone did not significantly affect grain yield. However, biochar, in combination with DMPP, effectively increases grain yield. The findings suggest that the N180DB15 treatment has the potential to reduce emissions of N2O and NH3 while concurrently enhancing soil fertility (pH, SOC) and wheat yield.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Combustion in conventional and advanced diesel engines is an intricate process that encompasses interaction among fuel injection, fuel-air mixing, combustion, heat transfer, and engine geometry. Manipulation of fuel injection strategies has been recognized as a promising approach for optimizing diesel engine combustion. Although numerous studies have investigated this topic, the underlying physics behind flame interactions from multiple fuel injections, spray-flame-wall interaction and their effects on reaction zones, and NO<sub>x</sub>/soot emissions are still not well understood. To this end, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study is performed to investigate the effects of pilot and post injections on in-cylinder combustion process and emissions (NO<sub>x</sub> and soot) formation in a heavy-duty (HD) diesel engine. A full-sector CFD model of the HD engine employing detailed chemistry is validated against experimental data for in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion phasing, and engine-out NO<sub>x</sub>/soot and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions at five load points. The validated CFD model is further leveraged to gain insights into the complex pilot-main and main-post injection interactions at low load (20%) and mid load (60%) conditions, respectively. The 20% load point consists of four fuel injections (two pilots, one main and one post injection), whereas 60% load point has three injections (one pilot, one main and one post). It is observed that pilot injections significantly alter the main flame structure by shifting reaction zones contributing to heat release from combined rich premixed + non-premixed + lean premixed zones to primarily non-premixed zones. Presence of pilot injection decreases NO<sub>x</sub> concentration (while shifting the contribution of NO<sub>2</sub> towards NO<sub>x</sub> from 50% to 14%) and increases soot concentration. The local consumption of oxygen and less time available for main fuel-air mixing due to reduction in ignition delay (ID) caused by the pilot injection are the major reasons behind increase in soot. The investigation on post injection reveals that although post injection increases soot formation, it also increases soot oxidation, with soot oxidation dominating soot formation. This results in an overall reduction in soot emissions. Hydroxyl (OH) radicals play an important role in enhancing the soot oxidation rate. Furthermore, as the post start-of-injection (SOI) timing is retarded, both soot formation and oxidation decrease, with an overall increase in net soot emissions.</div></div>

Purpose. The purpose of this work is to assess the pollution of atmospheric air in Dnipro city as a result of dust entrainment from the ash-disposal areas of Prydniprovsk TPP. The methods. Assessment of atmospheric air pollution in the city of Dnipro as a result of dust entrainment from the ash-disposal areas of Prydniprovska TPP was carried out as follows: physical and chemical characteristics of the stored fly ash were determined; specific dust entrainment from the surface of dry beaches of ash-disposal areas under the most favorable conditions was determined; mathematical modeling of the spread of atmospheric air pollution of Dnipro city by suspended particles was carried out using UPCAP "ECO Center"program; a comparative assessment of dust entrainment reduction due to the gradual processing of the deposited fly ash was carried out. Findings. Almost 100% of the total mass of ash consists of particles smaller than 80 μm, the content of particles smaller than 10 and 2.5 μm is 27.7 and 8.2%, respectively. The main chemical compounds contained in ash are silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, iron (III) oxide and carbon. The gross entrainment of substances in the form of suspended fine-grained solid particles from the surface of the dry beaches of the Prydniprovska TPP ash-disposal facilities is 18,654 tons per year. The area of atmospheric air pollution of Dnipro city by suspended particles is about 850 km2 and covers Samarskyi, Sobornyi, partly Industrialnyi and Shevchenkivskyi Districts. As a result of the implementation of a waste-free technology for the processing of fly ash with the utilization of the iron-containing fraction, the area of pollution can be reduced by 13.5 times up to 63 km2, the contamination zone in this case will cover underpopulated part of Samarskyi District of the city of Dnipro. Scientific novelty. A refined dependence of the particle size distribution of the mature Prydniprovsk TPP fly ash particles was determined for the further assessment of potential dust entrainment. For the first time, modeling of the distribution of fine-grained particles of fly ash of the Prydniprovsk TPP in the atmospheric air of the city of Dnipro was carried out, taking into account meteorological conditions, conditions of dust formation and particle size distribution. Practical implementation. The results of the research can contribute to reducing the level of atmospheric air pollution in the city of Dnipro. This will improve the quality of life of the local population and protect the natural environment from negative impacts. Research results can also be a basis for the development and implementation of technological solutions for the waste-free processing of stored fly ash with marketable products obtaining.

Iron-sulfur clusters are desirable targets for bioinspired synthesis due to their versatility in promoting a range of catalytic reactions (N2 reduction to NH3, CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons, and selective C–H functionalizations) and ability to serve as model systems for the systematic interrogation of structure and mechanism. However, a challenge in replicating the activity of clusters remains their instability outside of the protein scaffold. Previous efforts to mitigate this challenge include incorporation into polymeric and aerogel networks and artificial metalloenzymes or installation of bulky, strong-field ligands, but none of these retain both the native weak-field primary ligand sphere and capacity for molecular-level tuning of the cofactor and second coordination sphere. Herein, we present a new strategy for stabilizing weak-field synthetic clusters and conferring second coordination sphere functionality via encapsulation inside molecular cages. Thus, clusters [Fe4S4(SR)4]2– ([1a-c]2–: R = Ph, CH2CH2OH, tBu) are encapsulated inside tetrahedral naphthalene diimide (NDI)-functionalized cages [M4L6]8+ (M = Fe, Ni, Zn) via a robust and generalizable electrostatic binding strategy. 1H and DOSY NMR, ESI-MS, and 57Fe Mössbauer studies confirm immediate and quantitative binding and suggest the cluster electronic structure is minimally perturbed by the cage. At the same time, the cage’s redox-switching ability is demonstrated in CV and 57Fe Mössbauer studies demonstrating that NDI reduction renders the encapsulated cofactors [1a-b]2– significantly more reducing, consistent with their effective charge donation to the cofactor via pi-pi stacking and H-bonding interactions. Importantly, cofactor reactivity is maintained as demonstrated in diphenylacetylene reduction trials, showing that the encapsulated clusters are not only structural but also functional cofactor models. Combined, these results demonstrate that molecular cages can function as protein-like encapsulants to site isolate, tune, and deliver substrate to functional weak-field models of bioinorganic cofactors, and support the use of molecular host-guest complexes as functional enzyme mimics for both catalytic and structure-function studies.

Abstract Decarbonising industrial clusters is critical to achieving the UK’s net-zero industrial strategy. This study focuses on Teesside, an industrial cluster in Northeast England, analysing its transition through the framework of the Sociology of Expectations (SoE). The research investigates the role of public and private stakeholders in driving decarbonisation efforts, concentrating on a limited set of technologies and large-scale megaprojects, especially carbon capture, hydrogen production, CO2 and hydrogen transport. The study highlights the challenges of deploying these first-of-a-kind technologies, which are not yet commercially viable in the UK. Our analysis identifies both opportunities and significant risks in Teesside’s approach, particularly the potential over-reliance on a narrow range of technologies. The findings raise concerns about the assumed reductions in costs and carbon emissions, questioning the feasibility of scaling these technologies for long-term industrial sustainability. The main implication is that, should the technologies currently favoured by incumbent industry fail to perform, the expectations could play a double and contradictory role in net-zero transitions—by both motivating actors to legitimise decarbonisation technologies, yet blinding others to the significant challenges that lie ahead.

The study evaluates the energy and environmental performance of Ecuador's upstream oil facilities between 2015 and 2020, focusing on major extraction blocks. By analyzing data on oil, gas, and water production, fossil fuel consumption, and electricity usage, key performance indicators were developed to assess efficiency and environmental impact. The findings revealed disparities in energy efficiency, with Block 43-ITT being the most efficient at 7.82 kWh per barrel, while Block 57-LB was the least efficient at 31.41 kWh per barrel. The study emphasizes that maturing oil fields require more energy and emit more greenhouse gases, underlining the necessity for sustainable energy practices. EP Petroecuador’s initiatives, such as substituting fuel and integrating renewable electricity, led to a reduction of approximately 540 kTons of CO2 emissions by replacing 163.32 million gallons of diesel with low-carbon fuels and renewable electricity. These findings serve as a baseline for optimizing energy use and reducing emissions, offering valuable insights for policymakers and industry leaders to adopt data-driven strategies that enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental impact in Ecuador's oil sector.

Coal-fired power plants are a main source of energy in Poland. In the rapidly growing demand for the reduction of CO2 emission in the energy industry, the use of biomass for energy purposes has increased significantly. The combustion of biomass results in the generation of fly ash, with higher levels of CaO, K2O, P2O5, in contrast to the fly ash derived from the combustion of coal. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of phosphate compounds on fly ash-based geopolymer mortars. Geopolymers were made by mixing two types of fly ash—one from the combustion of wood biomass and the second from the combustion of coal in a heat and power station. Basic activators (NaOH and Na2SiO3) were used for the alkali activation. The maximum level of tetraphosphorus decaoxide addition was established at 5% of the total mass of the aluminosilicate precursors mass. The results showed that the phosphate oxide concentration within the specimens demonstrated a positive correlation with flexural and compressive strength across all temporal intervals (7, 28, and 56 days). The porosity, however, for samples with a 5% addition of P4O10, increased more than twofold in comparison to reference samples (from 4.26% to 9.98%).

This paper explores the development of positive energy communities using Eordaia, Greece, as a case study. The approach combines building and district-level energy analysis to achieve nearly zero energy performance through retrofitting, district-level storage systems, and renewable energy technologies. A parametric analysis utilizing RETSCREEN Expert and EnergyPlan software determines the optimal mix of technologies based on technical and financial parameters, with Eordaia, a region in energy transition and part of the RESPONSE Horizon project, illustrating the practical benefits. It includes a neighborhood of 105 mixed-use properties and two municipal buildings where a range of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures are applied. Insulation, photovoltaic systems, LED lighting, predictive thermostats, and windows coated with nanotechnology are some of the key interventions considered. The findings show considerable reductions in CO2 emissions and energy use, with payback periods ranging from 8.7 to 9.6 years. This study underscores the value of district-level strategies over individual building retrofits, highlighting cost savings and improved energy performance. These findings offer valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers aiming to transform urban areas into sustainable, positive energy districts, supporting the EU’s 2050 net-zero emissions goals.

The European Climate Law mandates a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, intending to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. To meet these targets, there is a strong focus on reducing energy consumption in buildings, particularly for heating and cooling, which are the primary drivers of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the demand for energy-efficient and sustainable buildings is increasing, and thermal insulation plays a crucial role in minimizing energy consumption for both winter heating and summer cooling. This review explores the historical development of thermal insulation materials, beginning with natural options such as straw, wool, and clay, progressing to materials like cork, asbestos, and mineral wool, and culminating in synthetic insulators such as fiberglass and polystyrene. The review also examines innovative materials like polyurethane foam, vacuum insulation panels, and cement foams enhanced with phase change materials. Additionally, it highlights the renewed interest in environmentally friendly materials like cellulose, hemp, and sheep wool. The current challenges in developing sustainable, high-performance building solutions are discussed, including the implementation of the 6R principles for insulating materials. Finally, the review not only traces the historical evolution of insulation materials but also provides various classifications and summarizes emerging aspects in the field.

The coordinated optimization of energy conservation, efficiency improvement, and pollution reduction in the sintering production process is vital for the efficient and sustainable development of the sintering department. However, previous studies have shown shortcomings in the multi-objective collaborative optimization of sintering systems and the quantification of pollutant impacts. To address these, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization method integrated with the NSGA-III algorithm and establishes an integrated system optimization model for sintered ore production and high-temperature waste heat recovery. The results demonstrate significant improvements: energy utilization efficiency increased by 0.67%, energy consumption decreased by 17.3 MJ/t, production costs were reduced by 11.45 CNY/t, and the emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx were reduced by 0.464 kg/t, 0.034 kg/t, and 0.008 kg/t, respectively. Additionally, the study identified optimal configuration parameters and analyzed the quantitative impact of several key factors on multiple indicators. The results also show that reducing the water content of the mixture, decreasing the middling coal content in the fuel, and increasing the thickness of the material layer are effective strategies to reduce energy consumption and pollutant emissions in the sintering process. Overall, implementing these optimizations can bring significant economic and environmental benefits to the steel industry.

ABSTRACT In nuisance or vector mosquito management, effective sampling is a stepping stone to efficient use of resources, targeted control efforts, and successful reduction of disease transmission. Experimental evidence indicates that there are species biases for certain traps, which in turn implies that the traps used will influence the species make-up of samples collected. A comparative study between 3 CO2-baited light traps and 2 hay-infusion baited gravid traps—Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap, American BioPhysics Company (ABC) light trap, Reiter-Cummings (RC) gravid trap, and a convertible gravid/light trap with a novel design—was conducted to test for species specificity of each trap type. It was found that different species of mosquitoes are more likely to be collected in greater numbers with certain traps compared to others, even between the different light traps or gravid traps. In particular, Coquillettidia perturbans tended to be collected in greater numbers with CDC light traps, Culex salinarius tended to be collected in greater numbers with the experimental convertible light traps, and Culex pipiens tended to be collected in greater numbers with the Reiters-Cummings gravid traps over the other traps included in the study (P ≤ 0.05). The overall species richness of samples was comparable among trap types, with similar performance of the new trap designs as established designs (P ≤ 0.05).

In recent research on building materials, researchers have increasingly focused on replacing cement with agricultural waste. This approach offers significant advantages in terms of reducing global CO2 emissions and promoting the sustainability of building materials. In this paper, the use of the agricultural waste walnut shell ash (WSA) to partially replace cement in sustainable green mortars is explored. Specifically, equal amounts of WSA (5%, 10% and 15%) were used to replace cement. To offset the reduction in strength caused by the partial replacement of cement with WSA, basalt fibers were added to the mortar mixture. The effect of these fibers on the mechanical properties of the WSA-reinforced mortar was examined in compression tests, split tensile tests, and flexural fatigue cycle tests. In the flexural fatigue tests, the parameter and length of basalt fibers were varied and different stress levels (0.85, 0.8 and 0.75) were applied. The fatigue equations were developed using the Weibull model and p–s–n curves with a survival probability of 0.5 were derived. The results showed that the compressive strength and split tensile strength of the specimens increased with the addition of basalt fibers, with maximum values of 34.7 MPa and 3.8 MPa, respectively, and maximum increases of 8.78% and 21.95%, respectively. In addition, the average fatigue life of WSA mortar was 247,541 cycles, which increased by 139.26% when the stress level was 0.75, fiber length was 9 mm, and dosage was 0.3%. The linear regression fitting showed good correlation and provided valuable insights for practical engineering applications.

Professor Zhou is a pioneer in the field of lithium–oxygen batteries, proposed a comprehensive mechanism for oxygen anion redox energy storage, and designed new high-energy-density lithium batteries. (5−9) Zhou and his team creatively introduced the "Li2O–Li2O2" oxygen anion redox process for charge storage, offering advantages such as high coulombic efficiency, good reversibility, and mild stability for the battery system. (6) He also discovered the critical role of trace amounts of H2O in enhancing the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) processes in organic electrolytes, proposing a synergistic catalytic mechanism between H2O molecules and Ru/SP/MnO2 cathodes, leading to breakthrough in lithium–air batteries. (7) Building upon the oxygen anion redox energy storage mechanism, he designed various highly efficient catalysts (e.g., Ir and Ni) to expand the reversible capacity of the cathode and suppress oxygen evolution. (6,8) Professor Zhou also proposed a concentrated dual-salt LiFSI–LiNO3/DOL electrolyte to improve the high-rate performance of lithium metal anodes, delivering stable operation for 240 cycles at 8.0 mA cm–2 and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.14%. (9) He also invented a closed lithium–oxygen battery with a lithium metal anode and high-capacity Li2O cathode, achieving a practical specific energy of 513 Wh kg–1 and a charge–discharge cycle life exceeding 200 cycles. (8) Professor Zhou summarized the essential criteria for redox mediators (RMs) to function as catalysts in lithium–air batteries and revealed the catalytic mechanism of these soluble catalysts during the charging process: (1) 2RM– + 2e– = 2RM+ and (2) 2RM+ + Li2O2 = 2Li+ + O2 + 2RM. (10) This theory led to his pioneering use of trichloroethyl chloroformate (TCCF) as a soluble catalyst for not only significantly reducing the overpotential of the OER but also greatly enhancing the reaction rate of the oxygen electrode. (11) The innovation improved the rate performance of lithium–oxygen batteries by over 10 times, with the cathode achieving a discharge specific capacity of 2005 mAh g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1.Professor Haoshen Zhou has also made groundbreaking contributions to the study of lithium–carbon dioxide (Li–CO2) batteries, high-energy-density batteries without lithium anodes, and development of new battery systems. He introduced in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to the study of CO2 electrode reactions, proposing the reaction mechanism for the reversible reduction and evolution of CO2 at the air electrode interface: 3CO2 + 4e– + 4Li+ = 2Li2CO3 + C. (12) He further introduced molten salt electrolytes, which verified the reversible reaction pathway of CO2 at the air electrode, reduced the electrode overpotential, and significantly improved the energy storage efficiency of the battery. (13) Professor Zhou and his team were the first to propose a lithium supplementation mechanism based on the OER of Li2O, successfully addressing the issue of capacity degradation caused by lithium loss during charge and discharge cycles. (14) A prototype anode-free lithium-ion battery with a layered transition metal oxide cathode was designed and operated, achieving a specific energy of 320 Wh kg–1 and a cycle life of 300 cycles. Professor Zhou also creatively introduced the concept of a combined electrolyte, constructed from "organic electrolytes", "lithium-ion solid electrolytes", and "aqueous electrolytes", integrating the characteristics of two or more electrolytes to design multiple energy conversion systems, leading to the invention of a high-capacity lithium–air battery and a technology for directly extracting elemental lithium from seawater. (15) The pioneering concept of combined electrolytes further led to the demonstration of an electrolytic cell system that has achieved both lithium extraction from seawater (or brine) and conversion of electrical energy into the chemical energy of lithium as a new energy storage solution. (16)Professor Zhou and his team further expanded the concept of combined electrolytes to integrate molecular sieves or framework compounds with organic electrolytes for successfully mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions on the anode surface, enhancing the stability of high-capacity lithium secondary batteries at high voltages (greater than 5.2 V versus Li/Li+) and elevated temperatures (100 °C). (17) This achievement is significant for expanding the application scenarios of electrolytes in high-output voltage systems and improving the energy density of various battery configurations. Professor Zhou then introduced the Cu3(BTC)2 metal–organic framework (MOF) as a selective electrolyte in lithium–sulfur battery systems for effectively preventing polysulfide ions from shuttling to the lithium metal side, significantly reducing capacity loss with an average capacity decay of only 0.019% over 1500 cycles. (18) He also invented a polypropylene ultrathin membrane modified with MOFs that greatly enhances the cycle life of lithium metal battery systems while increasing energy density, achieving a specific energy of 354 Wh kg–1 and 80% retention of its initial capacity after 200 cycles.

(26) It is a huge challenge to overcome the dissolution problem for cathode materials, especially for small-molecule organic cathode materials (SMOCMs). Song et al. investigated a commercially available vat dye, namely, flavanthrone, directly as a novel SMOCM for rechargeable lithium batteries. It possesses a low solubility benefiting from the extensive aromatic system and a high theoretical capacity based on the four electroactive C═O/C═N groups.

(37)Zinc-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 3 papers (1 review and 2 articles) are on zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). ZIBs are viewed as promising grid-level energy storage solutions due to their high theoretical specific capacity (820 Ah kg–1 and 5855 Ah L–1), low electrochemical potential, ample geological resources, and compatibility with water. Zhang et al. comprehensively overviewed the functional role of the electrolyte additive in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs), including regulating the solvation structure, altering the H-bond network, forming an adsorption layer, generating an electrostatic shielding effect, and constructing a solid electrolyte interphase. The development prospects and existing problems of additives are also presented. (38) Wang et al. introduced certain MnSO4 into the ZnSO4 + K2SO4 hybrid electrolyte (Zn0.5K0.25) to improve the AZIBs.

Abstract Introduction An NHS community trust was commissioned in February 2023 to deliver a MOCH service to about 15,000 care home residents across an Integrated Care System (ICS). Pharmacists in the MOCH service undertake Structured Medication Reviews (SMRs) to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy, working closely with care homes, General Practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacies. Pharmacy technicians undertake medication reviews to reduce low clinical value medicines. A patient-centred approach means medicines are stopped or changed following shared-decision making with the resident, carer or family. Aim To find out the impact of the MOCH service on reducing inappropriate polypharmacy, reducing medicines-related harm for residents, and to report financial savings and the environmental impact through reduction of CO2 emissions. Methods This service evaluation was approved by the Trust. No ethics approval was required. Quarterly and 6- monthly data sets covering one week reported by the MOCH service in the financial year 2023/2024 were used. These data sets were extrapolated to a full year. This service reported the number of medicines stopped, started and changed over one week of each quarter for SMRs and, pharmacy technicians reported every six months. Cost savings were calculated using the drug tariff based on continued use of medicines for one year. Pharmacists reported reduction in harm from medicines every six months based on a health interventions risk assessment scoring tool, assessing how many residents had potentially avoided moderate to serious harm following a SMR. The carbon savings were calculated based on financial savings from medicines stopped or changed using the DEFRA SIC 2020 Greenhouse Gases emission factor 0.621(kgCO2e/£) for pharmaceuticals1. Results In the first year the MOCH service completed SMRs for 11,363 residents (75% of care home residents in the ICS). Around 20,000 medicines for residents were stopped (one to two medicines per resident). Pharmacists predicted moderate to high-risk harm from medicines was reduced in approximately 4,200 residents. The cost savings from medicines stopped or changed was approximately £2.8 million, which translated to carbon savings of 1,773,340 kgCO2e, the equivalent of removing 644 cars from the road for one year. Discussion and Conclusion Reducing inappropriate polypharmacy resulted in a reduction of treatment burden, potential harm to residents2 and financial savings. Social impacts include reducing workload for care homes, GPs and community pharmacies, ultimately increasing the capacity of this stretched workforce (less dispensing, reduced risk of error, shorter medicine rounds and more time for residents). The environmental impact goes beyond carbon savings from pharmaceuticals to include reduction in workload, consumables, delivery and cost of waste disposal and prevention of hospital admissions.3 The limitations of this evaluation are that data collected over one week and then extrapolated may not be representative of all the other weeks in terms of cost savings and reduction of harm to residents, however MOCH pharmacists undertake peer reviews of reduction in harms to mitigate this. Costs incurred in making the financial savings were excluded. As the demographic of older people rises in the next 20 years a medication review is increasingly important to residents, the health economy, workforce, and our environment. References 1.

IntroductionModern acid-producing diets in patients with stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) can cause severe acid accumulation with metabolic acidosis and less severe accumulation causing eubicarbonatemic acidosis in stages G2-G3, each with kidney injury. The impact of these diets on acid accumulation in those with CKD but normal eGFR (G1) is unclear.MethodsWe assessed whether acid accumulation occurs in patients with CKD and normal eGFR, and if added base-producing fruits and vegetables (F&V) or oral NaHCO3 (HCO3-) reduces acid accumulation and/or lowers kidney injury. We randomized 153 macroalbuminuric, non-diabetic, G1 (mean eGFR = 101 ml/min/1.73 m2) participants with hypertension-associated CKD to receive F&Vs in amounts to reduce dietary acid intake 50% (F&V, n=51), oral NaHCO3 to match alkali intake of F&V (HCO3-, n=51), or usual care (UC, n=51) for five years. We assessed acid accumulation by comparing observed to expected increase in plasma total CO2 in response to retained bicarbonate (dose minus urine bicarbonate excretion) two hours after an oral NaHCO3 bolus.ResultsBaseline acid accumulation, eGFR, urine excretion of albumin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, and angiotensinogen were not different among groups. Five-year acid accumulation [mean(SD)] was lower in F&V [-1.2 (11.0) mmoles] and HCO3- [-1.7 (10.8) mmoles] than UC [5.2 (10.3) mmoles, p<0.003)], consistent with lower acid accumulation in F&V and HCO3-. Five-year urine excretion of albumin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, and angiotensinogen were lower in F&V and HCO3- than UC, consistent with less kidney injury.ConclusionsDietary acid reduction reduces acid accumulation and kidney injury in patients with CKD and normal eGFR.

Abstract Members of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 states committed to achieving the emissions reductions outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, are considering policy options for inclusion of forest carbon in climate mitigation plans. These initiatives are generally limited by a lack of relevant data on forest carbon stocks and fluxes past-to-future. Previously, we developed a new forest carbon modeling system that combines high-resolution remote sensing, field data, and ecological modeling to estimate contemporary above-ground forest carbon stocks, and projected future forest carbon sequestration potential for the state of Maryland. Here we extended this work to provide a consistent geospatial approach for monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks over time. Utilizing the same data and modeling system developed previously for planning, we integrated historical input data on weather and disturbance to reconstruct the history of vegetation dynamics and forest above-ground carbon stocks annually over the period 1984-2016 at 30 m resolution and provided an extension to 2023. Statewide, forested land had an average annual net above ground carbon sink of 1.37 TgC yr-1, comparable to prior estimates. However, unlike the prior estimates, there was considerable variation around this mean. The statewide net above ground flux ranged interannually from -0.65 - 2.77 Tg C yr-1. At the county scale, the average annual net above ground flux ranged spatially from 0.01 - 0.13 Tg C yr-1 and spatiotemporally from -0.43 - 0.24 Tg C yr -1. Attribution analyses indicate the primary importance of persistent and regrowing forests, vegetation structure, local disturbance, and rising CO2 to the mean flux, and the primary importance of weather to the large-scale interannual variability. These results have important implications for state climate mitigation planning, reporting and assessment. With this approach, it is now possible to monitor changes in forest carbon stocks spatiotemporally over policy relevant domains with a consistent framework that is also enabled for future planning.

Background: Container terminal congestion is often measured by the average turnaround time for external trucks. Reducing the average turnaround time can be resolved by controlling the yard crane operation and the arrival times of external trucks (truck appointment system). Because the truck appointment system and yard crane scheduling problem are closely interconnected, this research investigates synchronization between the approaches used in truck appointment systems and yard crane scheduling strategies. Rubber-tired gantry (RTG) operators for yard crane scheduling operations strive to reduce RTG movement time as part of the container retrieval service. However, there is a conflict between individual agent goals. While seeking to minimize truck turnaround time, RTGs may travel long distances, ultimately slowing down the RTG service. Methods: We address a method that balances individual agent goals while also considering the collective objective, thereby minimizing turnaround time. An agent-based simulation is proposed to simulate scenarios for yard crane scheduling strategies and truck appointment system approaches, which are centralized and decentralized. This study explores the combined effects of different yard scheduling strategies and truck appointment procedures on performance indicators. Various configurations of the truck appointment system and yard scheduling strategies are modeled to investigate how those factors affect the average turnaround time, yard crane utilization, and CO2 emissions. Results: At all levels of truck arrival rates, the nearest-truck-first-served (NTFS) scenario tends to provide lower external truck turnaround times than the first-come-first-served (FCFS) and nearest-truck longest-waiting-time first-served (NLFS) scenario. Conclusions: The decentralized truck appointment system (DTAS) generally shows slightly higher efficiency in emission reduction compared with centralized truck appointment system (CTAS), especially at moderate to high truck arrival rates. The decentralized approach of the truck appointment system should be accompanied by the yard scheduling strategy to obtain better performance indicators.

Abstract. The carbon cycle plays a foundational role in the estimation of the remaining carbon budget. It is intrinsic for the determination of the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions and the zero-emissions commitment. For the terrestrial carbon cycle, nutrient limitation is a core regulation on the amount of carbon fixed by terrestrial vegetation. Hence, the addition of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in land model structures in Earth system models is essential for an accurate representation of the carbon cycle feedback in future climate projections. Therefore, the estimation of the remaining carbon budget is impacted by the representation of nutrient limitation in modelled terrestrial ecosystems; however, it is rarely accounted for. Here, we estimate the carbon budget and remaining carbon budget of a nutrient-limited Earth system model, using nitrogen and phosphorus cycles to limit vegetation productivity and biomass. We use eight Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (hereafter SSP) scenarios and idealized experiments with three distinct model structures: (1) carbon cycle without nutrient limitation, (2) carbon cycle with terrestrial nitrogen limitation, and (3) carbon cycle with terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus limitation. To capture the uncertainty in the remaining carbon budget, three different climate sensitives were tuned for each model version. Our results show that, overall, nutrient limitation reduced the remaining carbon budget for all simulations in comparison with the carbon cycle without nutrient limitation. Between nitrogen and nitrogen–phosphorus limitation, the latter had the lowest remaining carbon budget. The mean remaining carbon budgets obtained from the SSP scenario simulations for the 1.5 °C target in the non-nutrient-limited, nitrogen-limited, and nitrogen–phosphorus-limited models were 228, 185, and 175 Pg C, respectively, relative to the year 2020. For the 2 °C target, the mean remaining carbon budget values were 471, 373, and 351 Pg C for the non-nutrient-limited, nitrogen-limited, and nitrogen–phosphorus-limited models, respectively, relative to the year 2020. This represents a reduction of 19 % and 24 % for the 1.5 °C target and 21 % and 26 % for the 2 °C target for the respective nitrogen- and nitrogen–phosphorus-limited simulations compared with the non-nutrient-limited model. These results show that terrestrial nutrient limitation constitutes an important factor to be considered when estimating or interpreting remaining carbon budgets and that it is an essential uncertainty in the remaining carbon budgets from Earth system model simulations.

Herbicides are chemicals used to manage unwanted plants (terrestrial or aquatic) called weeds.Over a long period, there has been a continuous effort to develop more selective herbicide compounds.However, the introduction of new herbicides with either a new mode of action or novel chemical classes has slowed in the last 30 years. For example, relatively few herbicides with new modes of action (MOAs) have been discovered in the past two decades (Qu, 2021). Farmers prefer chemical herbicides as they are the most effective and practical way to control weeds due to their high efficacy, specific mode of action, affordable cost, and better profitability (Abouziena et al., 2016). Herbicides can enter a plant through roots, shoots, stems, foliage, or buds. To be effective, contact herbicides must adequately contact plants, while plants must then absorb systemic herbicides, move within the plants to the site of action without being deactivated and reach the site of action at toxic levels. Herbicide selectivity is based on differential absorption, translocation, and metabolism of herbicides in plants.Overall, herbicide performance largely depends on its application rate, environmental impacts, and spray technology.In the wake of climate change, rising CO2 could alter yield losses due to competition from weeds, and weed control will be crucial in realizing any potential increase in the yield of C3 crops (Kaur et al., 2020). Climate variability also directly affects herbicide efficacy by altering the absorption and translocation of herbicides within the plant. Climate change leading to altered environmental conditions increases the risk for metabolism-based reduction in herbicide efficacy for weed control. distinct variation in efficacy of 2,4-D was found in Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. 33Watson) grown at high temperature low temperature enhanced 2,4-D metabolism at high 34 temperature resulted in reduced herbicide to control of the resistant A. palmeri population (Rudell et 35 al., 2023). Besides the physicochemical properties of herbicides, environmental factors such as 36 temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil physicochemical properties may significantly impact the 37 performance of herbicides. Knowledge of soil phase characteristics and the mechanisms involved in 38 herbicide transformation can help to understand the fate of herbicides in soil. Therefore, current 39Research Topic was initiated for this purpose and includes five research papers on application timing, 40 herbicide rotation, integrated use of herbicides with non-chemical measures and evaluation of herbicide 41 efficacy. 42 Annual/rigid ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) has evolved resistance to herbicides of multiple 43 modes of action groups in many parts of the world (Heap, 2024); probably the worst-case scenario is 44 evolved in many cropping regions in Australia. Dose-response studies are helpful in evaluating 45 herbicide efficacy for weed control, crop safety, putative herbicide resistance, and herbicide persistence 46 production. feasible integrated weed management systems, including herbicide 65 programs with herbicides and crop rotations, may be designed for diverse production situations 66 can reduce weed infestations and environmental impacts, and prolong the use of (Kaur 67 et al., 2023b). Another manuscript by Vulchi et al., (2023) corroborate the above statements. This 68 manuscript highlights that, when crop rotations were integrated with dicamba-based herbicide 69 programs and residual herbicides, it helped in effective management of Palmer amaranth across tillage 70 types and environments. 71In conclusion, this special Research Topic on Herbicide Efficacy explored the relevant aspects 72 for sustainable weed management with herbicides. Creating a novel herbicide is a significant challenge 73 for the industry; therefore, good stewardship practices must be maintained to increase the herbicide 74 life. The high costs, regulatory hurdles and eventual resistance make new discoveries daunting. 75Recently, herbicide-tolerant crops (and genetically modified organisms in general) are considered an 76 agro-business opportunity, potentially allowing the use of one and the same herbicide across many 77 crops. The increasing world population seems to be a major driver for the need to increase food 78 production output per area. The high impact of weed competition on yields makes weed control 79 mandatory. To secure crop yields, herbicides for weed management will continue to be the preferred 80 choice for the foreseeable future. However, herbicides should persist long enough to check weeds until 81 the end of the critical period of weed competition but should not persist beyond the crop harvest. 82 Moreover, the physicochemical properties of herbicides affect their behaviour in soil and regulate their 83 interaction mechanisms with organic and inorganic soil phases. Predicting herbicide movement and 84 fate in soils is an important strategy in limiting their environmental impact. The non-sustainable use of 85 pesticides, low efficacy, faster evolution of resistance in weeds, pollution and biomagnification of 86 pesticides in agroecosystems and food chains are questioning the success of chemical weed control. 87As one of the future trends, these adverse effects of herbicides would be addressed with the novel 88 developments in nanotechnology. However, the road to finally accepting nanoherbicides in current 89 cropping systems is not a short one; several obstacles need to be overcome including the regulating 90 framework for their approval. 91
