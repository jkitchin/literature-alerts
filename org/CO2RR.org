Since the turn of the twenty-first century, the need to find new energy sources to create a low-carbon society has grown urgently due to the ongoing rise in greenhouse gas emissions, which are mostly caused by CO2. The technique that uses solar energy to convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels can produce high-value hydrocarbon fuels like methane, methanol, formic acid, or C2+. This is a promising method of achieving global carbon balance. One of the key elements influencing the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is the presence of materials having photocatalytic properties. Therefore, exploring and developing efficient photocatalytic functional materials is the main direction of research today. This article first introduces the development history of photo-functional materials and analyzes their mechanisms in photocatalytic reactions. Then, different types of optical functional materials were classified and introduced in detail. Finally, the development trend of photo-functional materials in the catalytic reduction of CO2 was emphasized.

Abstract The electrochemical co‐reduction of CO 2 and NO 3 − to urea is an alternative to traditional urea synthesis. However, the significant difference in the energy barriers and reaction rates for CO 2 and NO 3 − reduction restricts the efficiency of the CN coupling. Herein, we report a strategy to coordinate the CN coupling intermediates by unilaterally increasing the efficiency of CO 2 reduction to match that of facile NO 3 − reduction. We demonstrate this strategy using an electrochemical reaction system consisting of a Cu 2 O‐loaded ordered gas‐diffusion electrode, which offers a high urea yield rate of 1373.5 μg h −1 mg cat. −1 at a low applied potential of −0.6 V versus RHE. This work not only provides a feasible strategy to coordinate the reductive coupling of CO 2 and NO 3 − , but also brings new insight into the reaction mechanism of urea electrosynthesis.

It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF‐based supported low‐nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three‐dimensional (3D) microporous Cu‐based MOF, that achieves a single‐product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at −1.0 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm−2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi‐site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C−C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2‐to‐ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2‐to‐EtOH.

With the advance of The Times, people's demand for fossil energy has greatly increased, and it is the main energy for people to develop economy and science and technology. However, the large-scale exploitation of fossil energy has led to environmental pollution and energy crisis, and the concentration of CO2 in the air continues to rise, and the greenhouse effect is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the conversion of CO2 into the high value-added fuels and chemicals we need will be a major measure to solve environmental problems. So, converting CO2 into fuels or high value-added chemicals using CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2RR) technology is an effective way to alleviate the current problems of energy and environment. In this paper, we summarize the research progress in reaction systems, electrolyte effects, and catalyst development in CO2RR experiments, focusing on the electrocatalytic aspects of CO2. Finally, we provide an outlook on the CO2 electrocatalysis industry.

The technology of carbon dioxide reduction has become a focus of research in the fields of environmental protection and sustainable development. With the exacerbation of global warming and energy crises, the issue of carbon dioxide emissions has become increasingly severe, exerting immense pressure on human society and the natural environment. In this context, carbon dioxide reduction technology has emerged as one of the important approaches to addressing climate change and energy demands. This technology involves the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen or other reducing agents to produce organic compounds or fuels. Its advent not only promises to reduce carbon dioxide emissions but also to convert carbon dioxide into useful organic compounds or fuels, thereby facilitating the recycling of resources. The development of carbon dioxide reduction technology holds significant implications for addressing climate change and energy demands. By employing this technology, discarded carbon dioxide can be transformed into valuable products, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and providing new energy sources for sustainable development. Furthermore, carbon dioxide reduction technology has the potential to integrate with other fields such as photocatalysis and electrochemistry, further expanding its application scope and reducing costs. This paper aims to provide reference and guidance for further research and industrial application of carbon dioxide reduction technology, promoting its sustainable utilization and environmental friendliness in practical production.

Photocatalytic technology, which is regarded as a green route to transform solar energy into chemical fuels, plays an important role in the fields of energy and environmental protection. An emerging S-scheme heterojunction with the tightly coupled interface, whose photocatalytic efficiency exceeds those of conventional type II and Z-scheme photocatalysts, has received much attention due to its rapid charge carrier separation and strong redox capacity. This review provides a systematic description of S-scheme heterojunction in the photocatalysis, including its development, reaction mechanisms, preparation, and characterization methods. In addition, S-scheme photocatalysts for CO2 reduction are described in detail by categorizing them as 0D/1D, 0D/2D, 0D/3D, 2D/2D, and 2D/3D. Finally, some defects of S-scheme heterojunctions are pointed out, and the future development of S-scheme heterojunctions is proposed.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO−) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO­2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal‐doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high‐purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal‐doped Bi catalysts, Co‐doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90% HCOO− selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0 V at a current density of 200 mA cm‐2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co‐doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72% after a 100‐hour operation under a current density of 100 mA cm‐2, generating 0.1 M HCOOH at 3.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co‐doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.

Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction (CO2RR) presents a transformative approach for the sustainable synthesis of fuels and chemicals to address pressing environmental challenges. The efficiency and selectivity of the CO2RR largely depend on the catalyst. Among which, Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs) have surfaced as a prominent design for this reaction, offering exceptional activity and selectivity. This paper delves into the progress and perspectives of SACs in CO2RR, tracing their historical evolution, unique advantages, and underlying mechanisms. The superior atomic utilization, distinct electronic configurations, and enhanced product specificity of SACs over traditional catalysts have opened novel pathways for more efficient conversion of CO2 to potent resources. However, challenges particularly concerning the stability, scalability, and product diversity of these catalysts constitutes as major impediments. Recent innovations, from advanced characterization techniques to novel synthesis methods, are spotlighted, showcasing the strides the scientific community has made. Looking forward, this paper underscores the potential of SACs in bridging sustainable energy sources with green chemical production and discuss prospective strategies to overcome existing limitations.

The rapid development of the battery industry has brought about a large amount of waste battery pollution. How to realize the high-value utilization of waste batteries is an urgent problem to be solved. Herein, cobalt and titanium compounds (LTCO) were firstly recovered from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using the carbon thermal reduction approach, and plasmonic attapulgite/Co(Ti)Ox (H-ATP/Co(Ti)Ox) nanocomposites were prepared by the microwave hydrothermal technique. H-ATP had a large specific surface area and enough active sites to capture CO2 molecules. The biochar not only reduced the spinel phase of waste LIBs into metal oxides including Co3O4 and TiO2 but also increased the separation and transmission of the carriers, thereby accelerating the adsorption and reduction of CO2. In addition, H-ATP/Co(Ti)Ox exhibited a localized surface plasmon resonance effect (LSPR) in the visible to near-infrared region and released high-energy hot electrons, enhancing the surface temperature of the catalyst and further improving the catalytic reduction of CO2 with a high CO yield of 14.7 μmol·g−1·h−1. The current work demonstrates the potential for CO2 reduction by taking advantage of natural mineral and spent batteries.

This study proposes CO2 gasification of biochar as a potential carbon utilization pathway for greenhouse gas emission reduction. It aims to evaluate the effects of CO2 concentration on carbon and CO2 conversion and output CO yield. It also performs kinetic analysis, using the volume reaction model, to determine the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. The operating conditions utilized include gasification temperatures of 700, 800, and 900 °C; inlet CO2 concentrations of 15%, 30%, 45%, and 60% by volume (N2 balance); and a CO2 flow rate of 5 L/min. Carbon dioxide gasification of biochar was performed in a fixed bed batch reactor, and the composition of the output gases was analyzed. Increases in the temperature and inlet CO2 concentration both resulted in an increase in carbon conversion, with the maximum carbon conversion of 57.1% occurring at 900 °C and a 60% inlet CO2 concentration. The results also showed that CO2 conversion increased against temperature but decreased with an increasing inlet CO2 concentration. The maximum CO2 conversion of 76% was observed at 900 °C and a 15% inlet CO2 concentration. An activation energy in the range of 109 to 117 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor in the range of 63 to 253 s−1 were determined in this study.

Carbon neutrality or net zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases, refers to limiting emissions and eliminating greenhouse gases, thereby preventing their upsurge in the stratosphere that causes worldwide warming. Acute climate changes that could threaten the species' existence on earth. It is estimated that the sea level has augmented by 0.24 m and will be in the range of 0.3-1.5 m by 2100 due to global warming. The only way we can stop sustained and long-term sea level rise is to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to levels close to pre-industrial levels. This requires more than maintaining carbon levels. The carbon reduction would be the first big step for humanity to prevent the rapid destruction of the environment. The paper presents the issue of global warming due to greenhouse gases and necessary actions by Heating Ventilation Air-conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) industries for net zero emissions, which is the demand of the future and is a must for business growth without any harm to the environment.

The increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) have a huge environmental impact, and CO2 emission reduction is already a common view in our society. Recently, selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has attracted much attention because the process can effectively mitigate CO2 emissions and simultaneously produce high‐value‐added chemicals and fuels. The catalysts play a very important role in achieving high efficiency of CO2 to methanol. As one promising alternative, the alloy catalysts have demonstrated high performance in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol due to their unique geometry and electronic properties. Herein, we review the recent advances in alloy catalysts, including solid solution alloys and intermetallic compounds (mainly Cu‐based, In‐based, Ga‐based, and other alloy catalysts) for heterogeneous catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Moreover, the research ideas and development prospects of alloy catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol are overviewed to provide the ideas and references for the subsequent research on alloy catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation.

The research explored how air pollution, particularly high ozone levels, negatively impacts sensitive crops like wheat, rice, and soybeans, posing significant threats to global food security. It emphasized the long-overlooked destructive effects of ozone and emphasized the immediate need for strategies to counter these impacts amid climate change. Furthermore, the study examined the crucial role of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on C4 crops, essential for global food security and biofuel production. Contrary to expectations, it challenged the belief that C4 crops inherently benefit from elevated CO2 levels in terms of enhanced photosynthesis. The study urged more experiments under changing climate conditions to refine predictions regarding crop yields. It emphasized the importance of focusing on ozone reduction, understanding how C4 crops respond to increased CO2, and assessing aerosol effects on specific crops. These insights aim to inform policies and strategies that can safeguard food security amidst rapid global economic growth and the challenges posed by climate changet.

Urban areas contribute to over 80% of carbon dioxide emissions, and considerable efforts are being undertaken to characterize spatiotemporal variations of CO2 (carbon dioxide) at a city, regional, and national level, aiming at providing pipelines for carbon mission reduction. The complex underlying surface composition of urban areas makes process-based and physiology-based models inadequate for simulating carbon flux in this context. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to develop and investigate their viability in estimating carbon flux at the ecosystem level. All the data used in our study were derived from the long-term chronosequence observations collected from the flux towers within urban complex underlying surface, along with meteorological reanalysis datasets. To assess the generalization ability of these models, the following statistical metrics were utilized: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Our analysis revealed that the RF model performed the best in simulating carbon flux over long time series, with the highest R2 values reaching up to 0.852, and exhibiting the smallest RMSE and MAE values at 0.293 μmol·m−2·s−1 and 0.157 μmol·m−2·s−1. As a result, the RF model was chosen for simulating carbon flux at spatial scale and assessing the impact of urban impervious surfaces in the simulation. The results showed that the RF model performs well in simulating carbon flux at the spatial scale. The input of impervious surface area index can improve the performance of the RF model in simulating carbon flux, with R2 values of 84.46% (with the impervious surface area index in) and 83.74% (without the impervious surface area index in). Furthermore, the carbon flux in Fengxian District, Shanghai, exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity: the CO2 flux in the western part of Fengxian District was less than in the eastern part, and the CO2 flux gradually increased from the west to the east. In addition, we creatively introduced the diurnal impervious surface area index based on the Kljun model, and clarified the influence of impervious surface on the spatiotemporal simulation of CO2 flux over the complex urban underlying surface. Based on these findings, we conclude that the RF models can be effectively applied for estimating carbon flux on the complex underlying urban surface. The results of our study reduce the uncertainty in modeling carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, and make the variety of models for the carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems more diverse.

There is a consensus on the need to reduce the emissions of carbon compounds. The increase in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the maritime industry poses a serious challenge to environmental sustainability, climate change, and the operating costs of ships. This article shows how hybrid versus diesel propulsion technology for ships can help reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption, and how these changes can be achieved. The need to reduce exhaust emissions and the increasing need for the shipping industry to seek alternative fuels means that existing regulations for marine engines and engine emissions are being updated almost constantly and new regulations are being formulated. The cost implications of the new regulations may lead to an increase in emissions as engines with lower fuel consumption are chosen, i.e., larger marine engines. Alternative approaches are needed to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption, which could ultimately lead to hybrid propulsion for ships. This paper examines the current state of greenhouse gas emissions in shipping by analyzing the CO2 emissions and operating costs of two ships of the same type with similar technical and technological characteristics and different propulsion systems to gain insight into the problem. This paper compares the reductions in CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and fuel costs for two suction hopper dredgers with standard diesel and hybrid propulsion. The technical characteristics, CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and price of the two ships were analyzed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each propulsion system. The novelty of this study is that two suction hopper dredgers from the same company with similar technical–technological characteristics but different propulsion systems were used for the case study and a mathematical procedure for calculating CO2 and other greenhouse gasses was presented in comparison, all to determine to what extent and in what way the hybrid propulsion system of a ship can contribute to reductions in CO2 emissions and fuel costs at the ship and company levels compared to a standard diesel propulsion system. This comparative analysis shows how much lower CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and fuel cost savings can be expected when using a hybrid propulsion system compared to a standard diesel propulsion system. Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the efficiency and environmental compatibility of the two systems.

To meet Greece’s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), it’s crucial to dissect the primary influencers of its greenhouse gas emissions. This study utilized the logarithmic mean Divisia index method in its additive form to delve into the main drivers behind carbon dioxide emissions in Greece from 1996 to 2020. The analysis revealed that the primary catalyst for the rise in CO2 emissions was the growth in GDP. Conversely, advancements in energy efficiency, as indicated by a decrease in energy intensity, played a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions. While population growth contributed to an increase in emissions, a decline in emissions intensity showcased a reduction in emissions per unit of output or consumption. The period from 1996 to 2020 witnessed a 38% change in emissions, demonstrating the effectiveness of Greece’s environmental policies. These findings highlight the pressing need for a sustained focus on enhancing renewable energy sources (RES) penetration and ensuring comprehensive attention across all sectors to further reduce emissions.

Transportation infrastructure plays a significant role in exacerbating climate change as it contributes to a substantial increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The sole economic sector in which European countries have not succeeded in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions is the transportation industry. Therefore, reducing transport-related emissions is a primary focus of emphasis in the European Union's efforts to meet its climate targets. Accordingly, this study analyzes the impact of renewable energy use, patent development, and energy taxes in the transport sector on the three different modes of transport-related emissions (aviation, road, and rail) in the 10 highest-income countries of the European Union over the period 2008–2020. The study uses the novel half-panel jackknife estimator for this analysis. The results of the estimation show that patents contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in aviation and rail transportation, while renewable energies are only effective in rail transportation. In the context of road transportation, energy taxes are effective in mitigating CO2 emissions. Based on these findings, it is recommended that European Union policymakers promote the use of electric vehicles and eco- friendly means of transportation in road transport through energy taxes, increase the use of renewable energy sources such as biodiesel in rail transport, and reduce CO2 emissions by supporting patents that promote green innovations in the aviation sector.

In the past, the research related to green building energy conservation and carbon reduction had mostly focused on the technical level, but lacked a fundamental institutional analysis of the relevant carbon reduction potential and impact brought by the current evaluation indicator system. In addition, the green building evaluation indicator system is rarely combined with practical cases for demonstration and comparison to clarify the effect of the evaluation indicator system in practice, which easily leads to the overall evaluation indicator system becoming a formality. Therefore, this study investigates the relative carbon reduction potential relationship of each evaluation indicator items in Taiwan’s current green building evaluation indicator system through systematic induction and analysis by means of expert questionnaires; meanwhile, this study also uses analysis results of expert questionnaires to clarify the carbon reduction potential circumstances that residential green buildings may have under the current evaluation indicator system. First, through literature review, this research defines the relevant content of the evaluation indicator items of Taiwan’s &quot;EEWH-RS 2015&quot; as four indicator orientations, nine indicator groups and thirty-one evaluation items. Then, use the AHP expert questionnaire to obtain the relative weight value of the carbon reduction potential of each indicator item under the consensus of experts and scholars, and understand that the indicator group such as &quot;Daily Energy Saving&quot;, &quot;CO2 Reduction&quot; and &quot;Greenery &quot; and their related evaluation items are regarded as more carbon reduction potential. In addition to the current threshold indicators of the residential evaluation manual, evaluation items such as &quot;ground greening&quot;, &quot;structural rationalization&quot;, &quot;building lightweight&quot;, &quot;roof greening&quot; and &quot;direct penetration design&quot; are suggested to be standardized as priority or necessary evaluation indicator items in the future based on the viewpoint of energy conservation and carbon reduction. Finally, this study believes that in the future, under the active move towards net zero emissions, when selecting green building evaluation indicators, &ldquo;in addition to selecting more indicators, you must choose right ones, and must choose more precisely.&rdquo; In order to implement and promote the overall green building energy conservation and carbon reduction development, it is effective by encouraging the concentrated selection of items with higher carbon reduction potential, and improving the relevant planning and design content for promoting the evaluation scores of each item.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

In order to estimate the effective storage capacity of carbon dioxide in geological storage, it makes great significance to understand the seepage mechanism of flowing carbon dioxide fluid and its influence on the occurrence state in micropore. In this paper, the molecular simulation method was used to obtain the optimal configuration of kaolinite micropore and carbon dioxide molecules. The molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the flow characteristics of carbon dioxide fluid in kaolinite pores in differential depth of burial under constant pressure drop. The results show that the adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide fluid on the wall of kaolinite decreases with the increase of burial depth, the fluid density in the center of the micropore increases with the increase of burial depth, the diffusion capacity of the fluid changes significantly when the burial depth is greater than 2 km; when a constant differential pressure is applied, the flow of carbon dioxide fluid in the pore conforms to the classical poiseulle flow, the diffusion ability of the fluid increases with the increase of burial depth, nearly doubling, and the slip length also increases with the increase of burial depth; the flow behavior significantly reduces the total amount of carbon dioxide in kaolinite micropore, where the density of the first adsorption layer near the wall decreases by at least 20%, and its effect on fluid is greater than that caused by the increase of burial depth. Therefore, when estimating the effective storage capacity of carbon dioxide in geological storage, the influence of pressure drop and burial depth on the total reduction of geological sequestration should be considered at the same time. The purpose is to provide more detailed theoretical basis for carbon dioxide geological sequestration.

This review paper addresses the growing challenges and developments in frequency control within power systems influenced by increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. It evaluates the advancements and limitations of renewable-based control technologies and explores the critical role of diverse energy storage technologies in providing fast frequency response ancillary services. Through a comprehensive analysis of global literature, this paper categorizes energy storage solutions according to their efficacy in meeting fast frequency response demands and potential for revenue generation. It reveals significant gaps in current research, which predominantly focuses on battery energy storage systems and microgrid applications, with insufficient attention to grid-scale storage solutions and innovative energy storage technologies. This analysis identifies a lack of detailed technical simulations and hybrid storage models for frequency control, as well as a minimal exploration of the environmental benefits, particularly in terms of carbon dioxide emission reductions, associated with deploying new energy storage technologies in ancillary service markets. The paper concludes by highlighting the necessity for further research incorporating detailed techno-economic evaluations and carbon dioxide reduction potential of modular, scalable energy storage technologies, facilitated by advanced network simulation models and comprehensive market analysis.

Abstract Traditional DID models overlook variations in policy intensity, causing estimation deviations from the actual situation and a limited understanding of the influence mechanism. In response, the Intensity Modified SDID Model is built to examine the influence mechanism of ETS's carbon reductions. Moreover, through model extensions, the study explores the spatiotemporal characteristics and heterogeneities of ETS’s effects. Results show that: (1) "Dual-circulation" influence mechanism is confirmed, where ETS directly contributes to carbon reductions (2.70% to 10.0% impact) through external pathways, and internal pathways continuously strengthen reduction effects, comprehensive mechanisms are thereby formed and enhanced based on interaction among internal and external pathways. (2) Reasonable ETS levels are estimated and proposed to achieve "Dual Carbon Target", constraining nationwide carbon quotas by 20 billion tons/year, increasing carbon trading volumes by 80 thousand tons/year, and elevating the carbon trading prices by 100 RMB (14 USD) per ton. (3) ETS's carbon reduction effects are identified with temporal and spatial characteristics, temporally, effects peak in the 4th period ( Event + 4 ) but diminish in the 5th period ( Event + 5 ), spatially, effects peak in areas distancing around 1000 km but disappear beyond 1500 km. (4) ETS also has synergistic effects with atmospheric pollution reduction, including industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide and smoke (dust), but are insignificant to industrial emissions of wastewater and solid waste.

As the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ) celebrates its 10th anniversary, it is crucial to examine the impact of the FTZ's construction on regional carbon emissions under the dual carbon targets of carbon neutrality and carbon peaking. Based on panel data from 282 prefecture-level cities between 2006 and 2021, this article aims to provide insight into the impact of the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) pilot policy on urban carbon dioxide emissions levels. By constructing a difference-in-differences (DID) model, this study aims to investigate the effects of the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) policy on carbon emission reduction. In order to perform a mechanism test, two more mechanistic variables—namely, technical advancement and upgrading of the industrial structure—are incorporated. According to the findings from experiments, the policy of free trade zones can effectively reduce carbon emissions from urban areas. This is primarily achieved by optimizing the industrial structure and scientific and technological mechanisms.

Abstract Under the "dual carbon" goal, the new productive forces in the industrial energy sector will become an important force in promoting the green and high-quality development of the economy and society in Hubei Province. The article comprehensively applies the Tapio decoupling model and LMDI decomposition method, and uses panel data of the industrial industry in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2021 to empirically analyze the decoupling effect of industrial carbon emissions in Hubei Province and its driving factors. Our research has found that the industrial economic growth and carbon emissions in Hubei Province roughly exhibit a complex process of changes from strong decoupling to weak decoupling, then to strong decoupling, and finally to recessive decoupling. For a considerable period of time in the future, the industrial economic growth and carbon emissions in Hubei Province will still be weakly decoupled. From the decomposition results, it can be seen that the changes in the energy intensity index and carbon intensity index are basically consistent. The decrease in energy intensity has the greatest contribution to carbon dioxide reduction, becoming a key factor driving the reduction of industrial carbon intensity in Hubei. However, the dividends brought by structural effects are still not significant. On this basis, the article proposes relevant policy recommendations, providing theoretical basis and policy basis for the high-quality development of Hubei's industry and the construction of new productive forces in the post epidemic era.

Global warming is one of the key issues attracting international concern. The carbon dioxide emission produced by energy combustion is the main cause of the greenhouse effect, and reducing carbon emissions is considered the most effective way to deal with the greenhouse effect. The extensive production mode characterized by high energy consumption, high emission, and low efficiency in China’s construction industry intensifies the contradiction between economic development and resources and the environment, and the growth under this mode is at the expense of consuming a lot of resources and energy. The improvement of carbon emission efficiency is an effective means of achieving the goal of economic growth and carbon emission reduction simultaneously, making it necessary to accurately measure the carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry in each province, determine the influencing factors, and formulate reasonable emission reduction policies for this industry. In this study, an input-output index system of carbon emission efficiency of China’s construction industry was constructed, the carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry in each province was evaluated using the super-efficiency SBM model, and the factors affecting the carbon emission efficiency of this industry were analyzed via the Tobit model. The results showed that the average value of carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry generally showed a rising trend in a fluctuating way during the study period. From 2014 to 2022, the average carbon emission efficiency of the national construction industry presented an upward trend, from 1.122 in 2014 to 1.148 in 2022; the regional economic level (p= 0.020 < 0.05) and human capital level (p= 0.000 < 0.01) exerted obvious promoting effects on the carbon emission efficiency of China’s construction industry, while the urbanization development (p= 0.049 < 0.05) generated evident negative effects on carbon emission efficiency of this industry. The research results have important reference values for making cross-provincial emission reduction plans for the construction industry, promoting its carbon emission efficiency, and driving the research and development of green building materials and clean energy.

Carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) constitute vital measures for achieving net emissions reduction in China. Against the backdrop of the “dual carbon” initiative in China, this paper meticulously examines and analyzes the key technological principles, merits and demerits, and bottlenecks associated with CCUS carbon capture in the country’s thermal power plants at the current stage. It combines the prevailing industrial application status and the future development trajectory of pertinent technologies with considerations of industrial economic benefits and business models. Building upon this analysis, the paper summarizes the application status of CCUS technology in China’s thermal power plant industry and presents future prospects. On the technological front, the three capture methods grapple with the challenge of high costs. Therefore, there is a need to intensify efforts in developing low-cost and efficient carbon capture materials, as well as researching and practically applying low-cost oxygen generation technology. Economically, CCUS technology currently faces high costs, low returns, and certain commercial barriers, placing China in a demonstrative business model stage. To overcome these challenges and realize the economic benefits of CCUS technology, government incentives and technological innovation are imperative. These measures aim to reduce the overall cost of CCUS technology, stimulate the scale development, and foster commercialization, ultimately contributing to the achievement of China’s carbon emission reduction targets.

Abstract. The Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT, ca. 40–33 Ma) marks a transformation from a largely ice-free to an icehouse climate mode that is well recorded by oxygen-stable isotopes and sea surface temperature proxies. Opening of the Southern Ocean gateways and decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been considered as factors in this global environmental transformation and the growth of ice sheets in Antarctica during the Cenozoic. A more comprehensive understanding is still needed of the interplay between forcing versus response, the correlation among environmental changes, and the involved feedback mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the spatio-temporal variation in export productivity using biogenic Ba (bio-Ba) from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites in the Southern Ocean, focusing on possible mechanisms that controlled them as well as the correlation of export productivity changes to changes in the global carbon cycle. We document two high export productivity events in the Southern Ocean during the late Eocene (ca. 37 and 33.5 Ma) that correlate to proposed gateway-driven changes in regional circulation and to changes in global atmospheric pCO2 levels. Our findings suggest that paleoceanographic changes following Southern Ocean gateway openings, along with more variable increases in circulation driven by episodic Antarctic ice sheet expansion, enhanced export production in the Southern Ocean from the late Eocene through early Oligocene. These factors may have played a role in episodic atmospheric carbon dioxide reduction, contributing to Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene–Oligocene transition.

Abstract Energy audits directly provided the industrial sector with reduced energy costs and avoided emissions. Still, they also lead to far-reaching indirect and induced local, regional, and national benefits. This paper aims to present the techno-economic-environmental analysis to achieve decarbonization through implementing industrial energy efficiency at micro and macro levels. An integrated techno-economic-environmental methodology is developed. Case studies of micro-level carbon reduction efforts through industrial energy efficiency technologies are presented. The broader macroeconomic and environmental effects of technology on society are analyzed using data from 206 energy audits of industrial compressed air systems conducted over 13 years. The impacts show that energy-efficient improvements lead to direct cost savings for manufacturers, boost economic activity across sectors, and affect carbon dioxide emissions both short-term and long-term in the region. Given their extensive benefits, energy audits significantly influence policymaking. We devised a methodology to link micro-level energy audit data with macroeconomic and environmental analyses to quantify these cascading benefits. The economic scenario analysis shows that $228 M has been saved from direct industrial energy savings from implementing all compressed air recommendations in the studied periods and the region. In addition, the investment made through manufacturers would create 2,025 jobs and $383 M annually, cascading regional economic impacts. The environmental analysis shows that the regional manufacturers have directly avoided about 2.8 M metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

The integration of biotechnology in green building represents a cutting-edge approach that harnesses biological processes to enhance sustainability and efficiency in construction practices. This abstract explores modern strategies and provides examples of how biotechnology is revolutionizing green building. Biotechnology offers innovative solutions to traditional challenges in green building, leveraging biological systems to optimize resource utilization, energy efficiency, and waste reduction. By integrating living organisms, biomaterials, and biological processes into building design and construction, biotechnology enables the development of structures that are not only environmentally friendly but also adaptive and resilient.One modern approach involves incorporating living organisms such as algae, bacteria, and fungi into building materials to enhance their performance. For example, algae can be used in bio-facades to capture carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, contributing to improved indoor air quality and reducing the building's carbon footprint. Similarly, bacteria can be embedded in concrete to repair cracks autonomously, increasing the durability and lifespan of structures while minimizing maintenance needs.

Abstract An expanding body of literature discusses the importance of sufficiency for sustainable development. However, conceptual vagueness stands in the way of the practical application of sufficiency as a sustainability strategy. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the concept of relations of enoughness , building on the general notion of ‘enough’, which is prevalent in sufficiency literature. Relations of enoughness will be explained based on the widespread use of sufficiency advocating for changes and reductions of individual consumption with the goal to reduce environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide emissions. Diverse uses and understandings of sufficiency can be united in a shared structure of ‘enough/too much/too little of X regarding Y’. Relations of enoughness can be connected to sustainability by expanding them into chains of enoughness , which serve as a conceptual foundation for the sustainable consumption corridor approach. Finally, the premises of sufficiency and potential for further research are discussed.

The quality of in situ XAS of electrochemical systems is highly sensitive to electrode disturbances, such as gas evolution and gas consumption at an electrolyte / catalyst interface. A novel in situ spectro‐electrochemical X‐ray absorption spectroscopy cell is presented as a new tool for the characterisation of gas evolving and consuming electrocatalysts at high overpotentials. By utilising a thin, porous membrane with efficient electrolyte and gas circulating loops, an improved three phase interface that enabled efficient gas supply and minimised the interference from bubble formation. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted in fluorescence mode with three experiments selected to demonstrate the cell’s performance. The first two reactions; an in‐situ study of a highly active amorphous iridium oxide catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction and an in‐situ study of copper oxide during the carbon dioxide reduction reaction are used to exemplify the XAS data quality achieved under operational conditions. Thirdly, a detailed XAS investigation of a highly dispersed platinum catalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction is presented, along with comparative data in nitrogen. These measurements show the retention of oxygen on the surface of the platinum metal particles down to 0.48 V (vs. RHE), well below the platinum oxide reduction peak.

Hydrogen as a potential future energy source provides a number of benefits in terms of sustainability, high energy density, and zero emissions. The production of hydrogen via water splitting is regarded as the cleanest and sustainable process. In contrast, fossil fuel combustion causes significant environmental problems through the production and release of secondary gases such as NO x , SO 2 , and CO 2 . It is vital to focus on reducing these harmful gases. CO 2 , a major pollutant produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and various human activities, plays a central role in the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. It is therefore imperative to actively eliminate and mitigate CO 2 levels to preserve the global environment. MXenes and MXene‐based catalysts exhibit both outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and CO 2 reduction. In this review, recent progress is systematically examined and discussed in the preparation and utilization of MXenes as catalysts for HER and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The discussion begins with a concise overview of the fabrication and characteristics of MXenes, followed by a comprehensive exploration of their efficacy as catalysts for HER and CO 2 RR.

Abstract Stormwater ponds are common features in urbanized landscapes because they enhance flood reduction and nutrient retention. With shallow depths and high inputs of organic matter, these systems can be highly productive with rapid oxygen depletion when thermally stratified or ice‐covered. However, most of our understanding of the biogeochemistry of stormwater ponds comes from the open water period. We explored under‐ice oxygen dynamics in 20 stormwater ponds in Madison, WI (USA) that were ice covered from late December to early March to investigate the drivers of bottom water oxygen saturation and the impact on the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ). Winter anoxia was driven by ice transmissivity, winter nutrient concentrations, and precedent summer productivity. Oxygen depletion led to overall higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in pond surface waters. This research enhances our understanding of winter pond biogeochemistry and its links to summer productivity.

In wine technology, the on-line measurement of redox potential is a fast, accurate, and reliable measurement that provides insight into the metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its microbial activity, and the oxidation and reduction state of wine, as well as insight into its quality and stability. The significance of the redox potential measurement and control in wine technology as well as the maintenance and regulation of fermentation redox potential using temperature and carbon dioxide fluxes are discussed. Redox potential levels from Eh 100 to 180 mV are typical for non-oxidized wine that is bottling-ready, while levels of Eh 270 to 460 mV represent oxidized wines with typical failures. The relevance of redox potential measurement during the 2-year maturation of Blau Fränkisch wine in 225 L oak barrels at six levels at a temperature 15 °C is presented. The measurement of the redox potential, expressing heterogeneity in redox layers during wine maturation in oak barrels, is represented in various oxido-reductive fermentation zones. On the contrary, the end of the maturation process is indicated by the homogeneity of redox zones, where the matured wine shows no differences in redox measurement on all levels. Using redox potential as a key scale-up criteria ensures comparable and reproducible amounts of the final product even in geometrically non-similar fermenter systems.

Fermentation is a complex process that involves molecular oxidation or reduction mechanisms driven by selective microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. This transformative process results in the production of various bioactive molecules, which offer significant health benefits. The fundamental principle of fermentation technology entails cultivating organisms under ideal conditions, providing them with essential raw materials like carbon, nitrogen, salts, trace elements, and vitamins. The primary function of fermentation lies in the conversion of NADH back into the coenzyme NAD+, allowing it to be utilized again in glycolysis. During fermentation, an organic electron acceptor (e.g., pyruvate or acetaldehyde) interacts with NADH to produce NAD+, yielding by products such as carbon dioxide and ethanol (as seen in ethanol fermentation) or lactate (in lactic acid fermentation). The metabolically derived end products, formed over the life span of microorganisms, are released into the surrounding medium. These products are then extracted for various human applications, holding significant commercial value. Based on the specific end product generated, fermentation can be categorized into four types: lactic acid fermentation, alcohol fermentation, acetic acid fermentation, and butyric acid fermentation. To facilitate the fermentation process, a fermenter or bioreactor is employed. This device is designed for the cultivation of microorganisms and contains all the necessary components for the large-scale synthesis of various compounds, including antibiotics, enzymes, and beverages across different industries. The microorganisms within the fermented are cultivated in a manner that maximizes the yield of the product while minimizing the required resources.

The results of the researching process of obtaining composition powder material B 4 C–TiB 2 by carbide reduction of titanium dioxide, using carbon reducing agent – carbon nanofibers, are presented. Furthermore, the results of studying of some properties of ceramics made using the synthesized powder are presented. The synthesis of composite materials was carried out in an induction crucible furnace for 20 min in the temperature range of 1200–1900 °C in an argon atmosphere. It has been established that the optimum temperature of the synthesis is 1650 °C, irrespective of the batch composition. The characteristics of the composite powders containing 10–30 mol. % of the TiB 2 phase have been studied. X -ray electron microscopy has revealed that the particles of the powder are predominantly aggregated. There are two peaks in the particle size distribution histograms. The part of the histogram with a smaller particle size mainly characterizes the B 4 C phase. The part of the histogram with a larger particle size characterizes the TiB 2 phase. The average particle size of the B 4 C phase is in the range of 5.3–5.5 µm, and that of the TiB 2 phase is in the range of 33.6–41.9 µm. The average size of 50 % of composite powder’s particles for these contents does not exceed 13.4 μm. The surface area of the samples does not exceed 5 m 2 /g. The oxidation of the composite powder materials by atmospheric oxygen begins at a temperature of approximately 500 °C. At the same time, when the temperature reaches 1000 °C, no more than 45 wt. % of the studied powders is oxidized. Ceramics made with the synthesized powder mixture B 4 C + 30 mol. % TiB 2 by hot pressing has shown rather high values of relative density (99.0±1.1 %) and fracture toughness (5.0±0.2 MPa∙m 0.5 ).

An investigation has been conducted to determine whether or not novel nanocomposite electrolytes have the potential to improve the efficiency and longevity of fuel cell technology. In this investigation, nanocomposite electrolytes were manufactured by using a methodical methodology. The nanoparticles were included into polymer matrices in order to enhance the ion conductivity and mechanical strength of the electrolytes developed. The composition of nanocomposite electrolytes was improved by altering the amount of nanoparticles and polymers that were present. When compared to traditional electrolytes, the introduction of nanoparticles resulted in considerable improvements in the characteristics of the material. These enhancements included a 15% increase in ion conductivity and a 10% increase in mechanical strength. Fuel cell devices that make use of nanocomposite electrolytes have showed improved performance, with a 10% increase in power density and a 15% gain in efficiency when compared to fuel cell devices that make use of traditional electrolytes. In addition, the environmental impact assessment found that the use of nanocomposite electrolytes resulted in a two percent drop in the amount of energy used, a fifteen percent reduction in the amount of waste generated, and a twenty-five percent reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. As a result of these discoveries, the potential ofnanocomposite electrolytes to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of fuel cell technology has been brought to light. This opens the door for the creation of next-generation fuel cells that have increased performance and decreased their effect on the environment.

Governments worldwide are actively committed to achieving their carbon emission reduction targets, and one avenue under exploration is harnessing the potential of hydrogen. Blending hydrogen with natural gas is emerging as a promising strategy to reduce carbon emissions, as it burns cleanly without emitting carbon dioxide. This blending could significantly contribute to emissions reduction in both residential and commercial settings. However, a critical challenge associated with this approach is the potential for Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE), a phenomenon wherein the mechanical properties of pipe steels degrade due to the infiltration of hydrogen atoms into the metal lattice structure. This can result in sudden and sever failures when the steel is subjected to mechanical stress. To effectively implement hydrogen-natural gas blending, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of how hydrogen affects the integrity of pipe steel. This necessitates the development of robust experimental methodologies capable of monitoring the presence and impact of hydrogen within the microstructures of steel. Key techniques employed for this assessment include microscopic observation, hydrogen permeation tests, and tensile and fatigue testing. In this study, samples from two distinct types of pipeline steels used in the natural gas distribution network underwent rigorous examination. To induce hydrogen absorption, an electrochemical charging process is employed in a solution rich in H+ ions. This charging process, accomplished by a potentiostat applying a constant current, prompts the hydrogen evolution reaction at the steel specimen, acting as the cathode of the charging cell. Immediate tensile and fatigue testing following the charging process enables the evaluation of mechanical properties in comparison to non-charged samples. Different charging current densities are employed to simulate various hydrogen blend scenarios. The findings from this research indicate that charged samples exhibit a discernible decline in fatigue and tensile properties. This deterioration is attributed to embrittlement and reduced ductility stemming from the infiltration of hydrogen into the steel matrix. The extent of degradation in fatigue properties is correlated not only to the hydrogen content but also to the hydrogen permeability and diffusion rate influenced by steel&rsquo;s microstructural features, with higher charging current densities indicating a more significant presence of hydrogen in the natural gas pipeline blend.

The urgent need for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation sector is driving research into novel energy carriers that can meet the high energy density requirements of heavy‐duty vehicles without exacerbating the climate change. This concept article examines the synthesis, mechanisms, and challenges associated with oxymethylene ethers (OMEs), a promising class of synthetic fuels potentially derived from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. We highlight the importance of OMEs in the transition towards non‐fossil energy sources due to their compatibility with the existing Diesel infrastructure and their cleaner combustion profile. The synthesis mechanisms, including the Schulz‐Flory distribution and its implications for OME chain length specificity, and the role of various catalysts and starting materials are discussed in depth. Despite advancements in the field, significant challenges remain, such as overcoming the Schulz‐Flory distribution, efficiently managing water byproducts, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the OME synthesis. Addressing these challenges is crucial for OMEs to become a viable alternative fuel, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a sustainable energy future in the transportation sector.

It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF‐based supported low‐nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three‐dimensional (3D) microporous Cu‐based MOF, that achieves a single‐product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at −1.0 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm−2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi‐site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C−C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2‐to‐ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2‐to‐EtOH.

Abstract A substantial amount of the world’s annual CO 2 emissions are attributable to the continued consumption of electricity from the grid that is generated from burning fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources could strengthen grid reliability and lessen their effect on the environment, especially in high-demand regions prone to power failures. Investigating the viability of erecting solar power plants in a subtropical area to provide the necessary electricity for an educational building that operates mainly during daylight hours is the main intent of the present study. The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate and validate a model for enormous-scale commercial HRES applications (such as an educational institution) utilising the HOMER programme to figure out the optimal size. Minimising emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas responsible for accelerating global warming, is also of the utmost importance. Based on the simulation findings, the optimal system configuration consisted of a 120 kW converter and 400 PV arrays (each with 320 Wp = 128 kWp). For regional power generation, the most cost-effective choice is still a combination of solar panels and the grid. Findings show that a HRES can be economically feasible for installation in educational institutions at an initial capital cost of USD $0.068 million with annual operating expenses of USD $0.0447 million—a reduction of 44.11% compared to the existing system. The expected payback for this endeavour is five years. Other locations with identical climates could benefit from these results when considering the deployment of comparable technology. In order to help achieve a zero-carbon target, financial rewards could encourage governments to adopt similar schemes.

This paper examines the environmental consequences of man-made hazards in India and proposes strategies to mitigate their effects and prevent future disasters. While the country is no stranger to natural calamities, man-made incidents such as nuclear power plant accidents, industrial pollution, and environmental degradation due to deforestation have become increasingly prevalent. As per the WHO (World Health Organization) annual report of 2020, over seven million people die annually from air pollution caused by hazardous chemicals, while another one million perish due to waterborne diseases, primarily in developing countries with high population density. Global warming fueled by excessive fossil fuel consumption and deforestation, contributes to climate change and weather-related disasters such as droughts and floods. To address this issue the paper advocates for a reduction in fossil fuel dependency and transmission to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. The paper also highlights how we can mitigate the effect of such hazards and what measures must be taken to avoid this kind of disaster. The paper highlights the benefit of large-scale afforestation efforts, particularly in tropical rain forests, to increase Earth’s green cover and counteract the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. By implementing these mitigation measures, India can move towards a more sustainable and environmentally resilient future.

Under the background of the “dual carbon” target, exploring the pathway of efficient geological storage and high energy utilization of CO2 is a hot issue in CO2 emission reduction research. Under the coupling effect of high geopathic stress in deep rock layers and thermal stress generated during the geological sequestration of CO2, CO2 infiltration into coal rock changes the ambient temperature around the rock, while thermal diffusion effects cause damage to the rock and influence fracture expansion. In the present study, CO2-water–rock coupling test system and characterization of fissure surface roughness were conducted to analyze the rock’s mechanical properties, damage, and fracture evolution. Modeling of the equivalent fissure was employed to reveal the heat transfer mechanism between the rock matrix and CO2. The results obtained illustrate that the rock samples coupled with CO2 exhibited remarkable changes in mechanical properties. These changes include an increase in the number of pores, enhanced inter-pore connectivity, and a planar type of surface roughness in the fissures, ultimately resulting in an increase in conductivity. Conversely, the remaining rock samples displayed poor mechanical properties and surface fracture connectivity. As pressure decreased, the heat transfer coefficient decreased from 86.9 W/m2·K to 57.5 W/m2·K, accompanied by a temperature drop from 33.6 °C to 30.6 °C, demonstrating a proportional relationship between pressure and the heat transfer coefficient. Furthermore, the flow rate gradually increased with the rise in CO2 pressure, indicating denser flow lines with faster flow rates. At 15 MPa, CO2 exhibits enhanced mobility.

Formic acid (HCOOH) is a highly energy‐efficient product of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Bismuth‐based catalysts have shown promise in the conversion of CO2 to formic acid, but there is still a great need for further improvement in selectivity and activity. Herein, we report the preparation of Bi nanosheets decorated by cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeOx) with high Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio and rich oxygen vacancies. The CeOx nanoparticles affect on the electronic structures of bismuth, enhance the CO2 adsorption, and thus promote the CO2RR properties of Bi nanosheets. Compared with elemental Bi nanosheets, the hetero‐structured CeOx/Bi nanosheets exhibit much higher activity over a wide potential window, showing a current density of 16.1 mA cm−2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 91.1% at −0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.

ABSTRACT The use of CO2 sensors has been reported as an effective tool in the early detection of signs of deterioration, allowing good accuracy in decision-making about the quality of stored grains. The objective of this study was to quantify the CO2 levels produced by maize grains stored at ambient temperature in a prototype silo, with initial moisture contents of 14, 16 and 18% w.b., and to evaluate the quality of the product over time and the technical breakage. Analyses of moisture content, ash, proteins, lipids, Hue Angle (color), germination and electrical conductivity were performed. Inside the silos, the amount of CO2, relative air humidity and temperature were monitored every hour. Grain quality evaluations were carried out at four storage times (0, 30, 60 and 90 days). A completely randomized design in a 3 × 4 factorial scheme with six replicates was used. Grains with higher moisture contents showed higher technical breakage and losses associated with CO2 emissions. Moisture content, protein, lipids, germination, bulk density, lightness and chroma decreased over time, while the electrical conductivity increased, resulting in greater damage to membranes and loss of quality of maize grains. Monitoring of CO2 in the grain mass is a good tool to assess the quality of grain, and higher initial moisture content caused greater level of CO2 emission and reduction in quality of maize grains.

Abstract Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. With an atmospheric lifetime of around a decade, methane mitigation starting immediately has the potential to avoid substantial levels of additional warming by mid-century. In addition to the methane emissions reductions that are necessary to limit warming, we address the question of whether technological methane removal can provide additional benefits by avoiding global mean surface temperatures exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial---the high-ambition Paris Agreement climate goal. Using an adaptive emissions methane removal routine in a simple climate model, we successfully limit peak warming to 1.5°C for overshoots of up to around 0.3°C. For substantially higher overshoots, methane removal alone is unable to limit warming to 1.5°C, but in an extreme scenario could limit peak warming by an ensemble median 0.7°C if all atmospheric methane was removed, requiring huge levels of net removal on the order of tens of petagrams cumulatively. The efficacy of methane removal depends on many emergent properties of the climate system, including climate sensitivity, aerosol forcing, and the committed warming after net zero CO$_2$ (zero emissions commitment). To avoid overshooting 1.5°C in the low-overshoot, strong-mitigation SSP1-1.9 scenario, a median cumulative methane removal of 1.2 Pg CH$_4$ is required, though this may be much higher if climate sensitivity is high or the zero emissions commitment is positive, and in these cases may require ongoing methane removal long after peak warming in order to stabilise warming below 1.5°C.

The European “Horizon 2020” LEILAC and DESTINY projects are two examples of electrification in the cement industry. LEILAC shows how resistance heating can be applied as a substitution of an existing gas-supplied process. The use of microwave heating in the DESTINY project illustrates the downscaling of the production paradigm towards small on-site-of-demand cement production, allowing a further reduction in CO2 emission.

Governments in many countries have announced their own emission targets and launched several measures to mitigate transport-sourced air pollution, including policies to promote the use of electric vehicles (EVs). However, electrifying a fleet of vehicles requires high investment and it is difficult to fully implement all at once. Therefore, this research aims to develop a framework to help prioritize locations to promote EVs using motorcycle taxis in Bangkok as a case study. The surveyed data was collected from 406 motorcycle taxi drivers around Bangkok. The proposed framework is based on two aspects. One is the impact on CO2 emission reduction while another is the difficulty of EV deployment. The study's findings yield a potential matrix for EV deployment, which classifies locations into four priority groups. The study concludes that prioritizing locations with high CO2 reduction impact and low deployment difficulty is crucial for efficient EV promotion. Subsequently, recommendations are offered to assist authorities and automobile firms in effectively allocating resources for EV promotion. Policy recommendations highlight the significance of targeted interventions and enhancing public awareness to facilitate the widespread adoption of electric motorcycle. Implications from this study will help the authorities and automobile firms to prioritize areas and allocate budgets for promoting EVs efficiently.

This study aims to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from China&#039;s sludge treatment industry and explore the potential of novel technologies to mitigate these emissions, promoting sustainable sludge management practices. Using a life cycle assessment approach, the total GHG emissions from sludge treatment in 2017 were estimated at 18.54 Mt CO2-eq, with significant regional variations. Incineration contributed the highest emissions (1,011.53 kg CO2-eq/t dry sludge), followed by landfill (717.51 kg CO2-eq/t) and land application (276.41 kg CO2-eq/t). The uneven distribution of emissions across cities highlights the need for targeted mitigation strategies that consider local sustainability challenges. Principal component analysis revealed that economic factors and treatment scale significantly influence emissions, emphasizing the importance of integrating sustainability goals with economic development. To reduce the carbon footprint of sludge treatment and enhance sustainability, the mitigation potential and costs of various technologies were evaluated, including thermal conversion, anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal processes, and wet oxidation. These technologies offer GHG emission reductions ranging from 0.09 to 0.46 t CO2-eq/t dry solids compared to conventional methods, while also promoting resource recovery and circular economy principles. However, further optimization is necessary to enhance their environmental and economic performance, ensuring long-term sustainability. By implementing these technologies and adopting optimization strategies, China&#039;s sludge treatment industry can significantly contribute to achieving the country&#039;s carbon neutrality goal and fostering sustainable development.

Steel is one of the most manufactured materials in modern society, with 1.9 billion metric tons produced annually for use in building materials, vehicles, wind-turbines, and appliances, among many other applications. As you might expect for something so ubiquitous, the technology used to manufacture steel is also quite mature, having been first identified over 4,000 years ago and heavily industrialized in the 19th century. The general approach is to mine iron ore from the earth’s crust and refine that ore to metallic iron (i.e., ironmaking) which is then combined with carbon and other elements to make steel products (i.e., steelmaking). However, conventional steel manufacturing relies primarily on carbon-based fuels, such as coal, to create the high temperatures (≈ 1600°C) required for the process and can emit as much as 2.2 tons of CO2 per ton of crude steel produced.1 The iron ore reduction step accounts for 90% of CO2 emissions associated with steel production. The heightened effort to decarbonize industrial process and reverse climate change is putting pressure on this 600+ year-old technology to shift to lowcarbon alternatives, especially considering that the steel industry is responsible for ≈ 7% of all global CO2 emissions annually.

Aqueous solutions containing both the strong oxidant, peroxydisulfate (S2O82‒), and the strong reductant, oxalate (C2O42‒), are thermodynamically unstable due to the highly exothermic homogeneous redox reaction: S2O82‒ + C2O42‒ ® 2 SO42‒ + 2 CO2 (DG0 = −490 kJ/mol). However, at room temperature, this reaction does not occur to a significant extent over the timescale of a day due to its inherently slow kinetics. We demonstrate that the S2O82‒/C2O42‒ redox reaction occurs rapidly, once initiated by the Ru(NH3)62+-mediated 1e– reduction of S2O82‒ to form S2O83•‒ at a glassy carbon electrode. Theoretically, the mediated electrochemical generation of a single molecule of S2O83•‒ is capable of initiating an autocatalytic cycle that consumes both S2O82‒ and C2O42‒ in bulk solution. Several experimental demonstrations of S2O82‒/C2O42‒ autocatalysis are presented. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements demonstrate that CO2 is generated in solution for at least 10 minutes following a 30-s initiation step during which S2O83•‒ is generated. Quantitative bulk electrolysis of S2O82‒ in solutions containing excess C2O42‒ is initiated by electrogeneration of immeasurably small quantities of S2O83•‒. Capture of CO2 as BaCO3 during electrolysis additionally confirms the autocatalytic generation of CO2. First- principles density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and finite difference simulations of cyclic voltammetric responses are presented that support and provide additional insights into the initiation and mechanism of the S2O82‒/C2O42‒ autocatalytic reaction. Preliminary evidence indicates that autocatalysis also results in a chemical traveling reaction front that propagates into the solution normal to the planar electrode surface.

Ecopetrol, based on the results obtained in the study "The Effect of Diesel Properties on the Emissions of Particulate Matter" (Bello et al., 2000), reformulated the diesel fuel distributed in Bogotá, becoming it lighter and with a lower sulfur content. In order to evaluate the environmental benefits that the reformulation of diesel fuel generate in Bogotá, Instituto Colombiano del Petróledo (ICP), with the assistance of Emissions Research and Measurement Division (ERMD) from Environment Canada, arranged a research project to determine the changes in CO, THC, NOx, CO2 and Particulate Matter emissions. The research program was developed in two steps. First one, developed in Bogotá, involved a fleet test with 15 public service buses that normally operate in Bogota’s Savannah, using a portable emissions sampling technology developed for ERMD (DOES2) and following a representative transient driving cycle. Second step, carried out in ERMD’s Heavy-Duty Engine Emissions Laboratory in Ottawa, tested a 1995 caterpillar 3406E 324,5 kW (435 HP) diesel truck engine on the same samples of Colombian diesel fuels used in the fleet tests performed in Bogotá, baselining the tests with a Canadian Commercial Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel. The two commercial Colombian diesel fuels used had the following properties: High Sulfur Diesel (HSD), with 3000 ppm (0,3 wt%) of sulfur and a Final Boiling Point (FBP) of 633 K and the new reformulated diesel fuel, with 1000 ppm (0,1 wt%) of sulfur and FBP of 613 K, which is currently been distributed in Bogotá. Fleet test show small reduction on CO, THC and TPM, and small increments on CO2 and NOx, but with not statistically significant results, while engine testing shows an strong reduction of 40,8% in TPM when you use the new reformulated diesel fuel (0,1wt% of sulfur) instead of high sulfur diesel.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">For battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), the climate control and the driving range are crucial criteria in the ongoing electrification of automobiles in Europe towards the targeted carbon neutrality of the automotive industry. The thermal management system makes an important contribution to the energy efficiency and the cabin comfort of the vehicle. In addition to the system architecture, the refrigerant is crucial to achieve high cooling and heating performance while maintaining high efficiency and thus low energy consumption. Due to the high efficiency requirements for the vehicle, future system architectures will largely be heat pump systems.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">The alternative refrigerant R-474A based on the molecule R-1132(E) achieved top performance for both parameters in various system and vehicle tests. An own-built energy efficiency tool was used to determine the possible energy reduction of R-474A in comparison to refrigerant alternatives that can be translated in a CO2 reduction of the thermal management as part of the overall vehicle CO2 footprint reduction.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">The results served as the basis for an efficiency study comparing the refrigerant R-474A against systems with pure R-1234yf and R-744 in a BEV in both cooling mode (AC mode) and heating mode (HP mode). The analysis was carried out with a focus on the performance and efficiency of thermal management under different climatic conditions and considering different driving cycles. The results of the most recent investigations and the study will be presented in this paper.</div></div>

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the ﬁeld, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today’s limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy eﬃciency when pulsing between ‐1.85 and ‐1.05 V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by diﬀusion and not from pH‐induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83 % compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.

Background: This multicentric prospective study was carried out at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio Medico and Ospedale di Stato of St. Marino Republic. Between 1 January 2019, and 31 December 2022, all pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent, post-coital, and interstitial cystitis at both centers were included in the study. The main aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of vaginal CO2 laser treatment, alone or combined with intravesical hyaluronic acid instillations, in managing cystitis symptoms, such as dysuria, pollakiuria, and urgency, across the entire patient cohort. The secondary objective was to investigate the reduction in number of annual cystitis episodes post-treatment. Methods: Each woman underwent three to four sessions of micro-ablative CO2 vaginal laser treatment. A follow-up examination was conducted 12 months after the final laser session (up to December 2023), during which a post-treatment VAS assessment evaluated dysuria, daily pollakiuria, and urgency. The enrolled patients recorded the number of cystitis episodes experienced during the 12-month pre- and post-treatment period. Results: Results indicated the laser’s efficacy in reducing the total number of cystitis episodes per year and an improvement in symptoms up to one year post-treatment. Greater efficacy of the CO2 laser treatment, particularly when combined with intravesical hyaluronic acid instillation, was observed in both pre- and post- menopausal women. Conclusions: Fractional CO2 laser therapy represents a safe and efficacious, non-hormonal approach for pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent, post-coital, and interstitial cystitis

Abstract Adopting rooftop solar PV systems in various domestic and non-domestic sectors (including commercial, industrial, and agricultural) exhibits their commitment to green energy ventures. This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of a grid-connected solar system that has been installed so far: a 6.9 MW p photovoltaic (PV) system implemented at University Tun Hussein Onn (UTHM) in Batu Pahat, Johor. This green energy system was installed as a part of the Self-Consumption (SELCO) program utilizing a Supply Agreement for Renewable Energy (SARE) contract. To assess the mounted energy system's efficiency, performance monitoring was carried out between December 2021 and November 2022. By evaluating the enactment of the 6.9 MW p solar system at UTHM, this present work has attempted to compile the achievement of implementation of self-consumption in terms of performance analysis and financial benefits to consumer. Based on International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61724 standard, this study also investigates several performance characteristics of the PV system, such as final yield, clearness index (CI), array yield, PV module efficiency, inverter efficiency, reference yield, and capacity factor (CF) performance ratio (PR). Moreover, an assessment of Carbon Dioxide ( $${CO}_{2})$$     CO  2   )    avoidance was also conducted to quantify the amount of $${CO}_{2}$$    CO  2   reduction achieved. In addition, the self-consumption ratio and self-sufficiency ratio pattern for solar power plant in UTHM has been assessed. The monthly clearness index at the project location from December 2021 to November 2022 ranges from 0.63 to 0.66. The PV system was monitored throughout this time and generated 8529 MWh of energy. The installed PV system has shown an efficiency of 11.86%, a final yield of 108.28%, and a PR of 0.78, respectively. Further, the installed 6.9 MW p PV system at UTHM will cut $${CO}_{2}$$    CO  2   emissions by 5450 tons annually. The 6.9 MWp solar PV system is also estimated to reduce 25.1 RM mil in 25 years. Making the system larger to 6.9 MW p would reduce the consumption from the grid during the week, makes it possible to achieve self-consumption levels of up to 100% and self-sufficiency of this solar plant is relatively low ranges from 22 to 35%. The research finding bridges the gap between policy makers, investors, and the public regarding acceptance of the large-scale Self-Consumption (SELCO) and strengthen the strategic collaborations between solar service provider and educational bodies to support of the government’s agenda to achieve carbon emission intensity reduction in Malaysia.

The purpose of the evaluation of the Peruvian energy generation system is to project the electricity generation and demand until the year 2050. To achieve this, three alternative scenarios have been defined and analyzed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) software. The scenarios are as follows: the first one, Business-as-Usual scenario, based on normal trends according to historical data and referencing projections made by Peruvian state entities; the second one is focused on Energy Efficiency, the highlighted characteristic is taking into consideration the efficient conditions in transmission and distribution of electric energy; and the third one, centered on Geothermal Energy, focused on the development of this type of energy source and prioritizing it. The primary purpose of this analysis is to identity advantages and disadvantages inherent in each scenario in order to get the best of each one. In this way, the intention is to propose solutions based on Peru&rsquo;s national reality or possible uses of the country&rsquo;s energy potential to supply its energy demand. Currently, Peru&rsquo;s energy demand relies on fossil fuels, hydraulic, and thermal energy. However, there is the possibility of transforming this system into a sustainable one, by strengthening existing and growing energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and new technologies for hydraulic and thermal energy, in addition to considering geothermal energy as the main energy source in the third scenario. The new system mentioned satisfactorily indicate that the CO2 equivalent emissions decrease significantly in the third scenario, with a 15.8% reduction compared to the first scenario and a 9.7% reduction in comparison to the second. On the other hand, the second scenario shows a 5.6% decrease in CO2 emissions compared to the first, resulting from improvements in technology and energy efficiency without requiring significant modifications or considerable investments, as in the third scenario.

Simply expressed, the circular economy implies that the people living on Earth should reuse and recycle the products that are currently in use as long as possible and reduce the waste produced, thus reducing CO2 emissions. The latter goal is fundamental from the perspective of mitigating the well-known greenhouse effect and the consequent global warming observed at the planetary scale. Under these conditions, advanced electrodeposition processes can play a fundamental role in the optimization of materials use and in the reduction of the energetic footprint for a wide variety of industrial processes. The aim of the present paper is precisely to suggest how this is possible, showing readers the potential that electrodeposition holds for efficient manufacturing of many different products that have a huge significance for industry.

Copper (Cu)‐based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value‐added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O‐containing organic species (squarate (C4O4) and cyclohexanhexanone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu‐O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6‐Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7% at ‐1.0 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4‐Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu‐atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C‐C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10 h with a high current density of 205.1 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.0 VRHE, i.e. is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu‐based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.

Carbon emission intensity is an important index reflecting an entity’s low-carbon competitiveness. This paper presents an extended logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model to dissect carbon intensity within China’s civil aviation from 1998 to 2019, revealing a significant reduction in CO2 emissions per air transport revenue. It attributes this decrease to technological advancements, optimized fleet structures, and improved operational efficiencies, highlighting the impact of larger, more efficient aircraft and enhanced load factors. The study also explores economic factors influencing carbon efficiency, suggesting a comprehensive approach encompassing technological innovation and strategic operational improvements for sustainable aviation development.

Increased demand for decarbonization and renewable energy has led to increasing interest in engineered subsurface storage systems for large-scale carbon reduction and energy storage. In these applications, a working fluid (CO2, H2, air, etc.) is injected into a deep formation for permanent sequestration or seasonal energy storage. The heterogeneous nature of the porous formation and the fluid–rock interactions introduce complexity and uncertainty in the fate of the injected component and host formations in these applications. Interactions between the working gas, native brine, and formation mineralogy must be adequately assessed to evaluate the efficiency, risk, and viability of a particular storage site and operational regime. This study reviews the current state of knowledge about coupled geochemical–geomechanical impacts in geologic carbon sequestration (GCS), underground hydrogen storage (UHS), and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems involving the injection of CO2, H2, and air. Specific review topics include (1) existing injection induced geochemical reactions in these systems; (2) the impact of these reactions on the porosity and permeability of host formation; (3) the impact of these reactions on the mechanical properties of host formation; and (4) the investigation of geochemical-geomechanical process in pilot scale GCS. This study helps to facilitate an understanding of the potential geochemical–geomechanical risks involved in different subsurface energy storage systems and highlights future research needs.

Increasing the product selectivity and decreasing the cost of product separation is critical for large scale application of electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R). We hypothesize that highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes can tune the microenvironment of the catalyst/electrolyte interface and improve product selectivity. Compared to a conventional electrolyte concentration of 1 M HCOOK, the use of a 7.1 M HCOOK electrolyte increases the FE ratio of C2H4/CO from 2.2 ± 0.3 to 18.3 ± 4.8 at -1.08 V vs RHE on a Cu gas diffusion electrode. Based on electrochemical analysis and AIMD simulation, the identity and concentration of the cation and anion play more important roles in controlling the CO2R reaction pathway than the bulk CO2 solubility and the bulk pH of electrolytes. In-situ ATR-SEIRAS suggests that, unlike 1 M HCOOK, the *CO-bridge binding mode on Cu is dominant in 7.1 M HCOOK electrolyte, which potentially results in less CO release and higher yield of C2H4. This study demonstrates that while we can tailor the electrolyte composition to shift product selectivity, the factors that control the product selectivity are numerous and cannot be distilled down into one correlated property-reactivity relationship. Thus, when CO2R conditions are changed, care must be taken to understand their effects on the bulk electrolyte properties and the electrode-electrolyte interface.

Copper (Cu)‐based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value‐added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O‐containing organic species (squarate (C4O4) and cyclohexanhexanone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu‐O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6‐Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7% at ‐1.0 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4‐Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu‐atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C‐C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10 h with a high current density of 205.1 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.0 VRHE, i.e. is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu‐based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.

Abstract. Gigatonne-scale atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will almost certainly be needed to supplement the emission reductions required to keep global warming between 1.5–2 °C. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is an emerging marine CDR method with the addition of pulverised minerals to the surface ocean being one widely considered approach. A concern of this approach is the potential for dissolution products released from minerals to impact phytoplankton communities. We conducted an experiment with 10 pelagic mesocosms (M1–M10) in Raunefjorden, Bergen, Norway, to assess the implications of simulated silicate- and calcium-based mineral OAE on a coastal plankton community. Five mesocosms (M1, M3, M5, M7, and M9) were enriched with silicate (∼ 75 µmol L−1 Na2SiO3), alkalinity along a gradient from 0 to ∼ 600 µmol kg−1, and magnesium in proportion to alkalinity additions. The other five mesocosms (M2, M4, M6, M8, M10) were enriched with alkalinity along the same gradient and calcium in proportion to alkalinity additions. The experiment explored many components of the plankton community, from microbes to fish larvae, and here we report on the influence of simulated mineral based OAE on diatom silicification. Macronutrients (nitrate and phosphate) limited silicification at the onset of the experiment until nutrient additions on day 26. Silicification was significantly greater in the silicate-based mineral treatment, with all genera except Cylindrotheca displaying an increase in silicification as a result of the increased concentration of dissolved silicate. In contrast to the effect of differences in dissolved silicate concentrations between the two mineral treatments, increases in alkalinity only influenced the silicification of two genera, Pseudo-nitzschia and Nitzschia. The four other genera (Arcocellulus, Cylindrotheca, Skeletonema, and Thalassiosira) investigated here displayed no significant changes in silicification as a result of alkalinity increases between 0 and 600 µmol kg−1 above natural levels. In summary, our findings illustrate that the enhancement of alkalinity via simulated silicate- and calcium-based methods has limited genus-specific impacts on the silicification of diatoms. This research underscores the importance of understanding the full breadth of different OAE approaches, their risks, co-benefits, and potential for interactive effects.

One of the urgent problems today is the increased energy consumption in the industrial sector. This negatively affects the ultimate cost of the product and also leads to increased anthropogenic impact on the environment. Industrial-territorial clusters have extensive utility networks, which transfer heat between plants, so the development of methods to reduce their energy consumption will solve this problem. This paper presents a systematic approach to assessing the possibility of direct process integration of plants belonging to the same industrial-territorial cluster to maximize heat recovery. The determination of process flows used for direct process integration can be made based on the territorial location of plants and the availability of space for new heat exchange equipment and piping, and the maximum potential for heat recovery can be estimated using a composite curve graph. The study analyzes monomer production and assesses the potential for reducing energy consumption through direct process integration of pyrolysis and gas separation units, which amounted to 7.3 MW and can only be achieved with process integration. The total reduction in energy consumption with joint intraand direct process integration is 66.7 MW. This also leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 140,152 t/year.

The core problem of a multimodal transportation system is integrating various transportation modes into a cohesive, efficient, and user-friendly network. This study introduces a novel centralized load concentration approach for regions facing geographic challenges. The principal aim is improving multimodal transportation systems by mitigating CO2 emissions and improving operational efficiency. This will significantly reduce high logistics costs and the environmental impact caused by greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in land transportation, aligning with the global sustainable development goals and offering a promising path towards a more sustainable future. The proposed method implicates direct cargo transportation from its origin to the export ports without passing through intermediate centers. The mathematical model determines the most efficient means of transportation for each route, considering variables such as distance, volume, and type of cargo. Research results indicate that multiple hubs may not be necessary in scenarios with high freight concentration, which could streamline transportation and logistics operations. The modal preferences vary depending on regional dynamics and cargo characteristics, with rail and sea transport emerging as preferable options in specific circumstances, outperforming road transport. The proposed model shows reductions in logistics costs and CO2 emissions compared to road-focused scenarios. This study provides an adaptable framework for optimizing multimodal transportation systems in regions with similar geographic and logistical attributes. It offers a versatile solution to various contexts and needs. Lastly, the strategic integration of multiple modes of transportation is fundamental to improving efficiency and sustainability.

This work explores technical challenges and potential methodologies for understanding electrochemical Reactive CO2 Capture (RCC) mechanisms. RCC offers potential energy cost advantages by directly converting captured CO into fuels and chemicals, unlike traditional carbon capture and utilization (CCU) processes that require sequential capture, concentration, and compression. However, direct conversion of captured CO introduces complexity due to additional equilibrium buffer reactions, making it challenging to identify active species for reduction in electrochemical studies. This work discusses methods to integrate transport, thermodynamics, and kinetics concepts to identify active carbon sources in RCC. Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) and transport models are validated against experimental results obtained in a gastight rotating cylinder electrode reactor and are shown as useful tools for studying RCC in heterogeneous electrocatalysts across different capture agents, solvents, and temperatures. This work establishes an experimental framework for advancing research in electrochemical RCC.

The unused garbage which is accumulating the landfills, such as raw materials, could be reused for synthetic gasoline production. This study presents the multiple’s effect technique, which is based on the reusage of different non, party and sorted municipal solid wastes (MSW), or biogas for syngas, converted into synthetic gasoline. The novelties of this technique include a basic multiple’s effect parameter (MUW), which present a level of waste sorting, an effect of oxygen inhibition into different wastes, a simplified mathematical model and simulation with an Aspen Plus® simulator using the retrofitted methanol plan converted into the synthetic gasoline production. This technique includes a circular economy by using a circulated purified flue gas as raw material, co-products of hydrogen and water. This technique was tested on an existing methanol process, replacing natural gas with different alternatives of wastes or biogas for the synthetic gasoline production. The best alternative was the sorted MSW, which could generate an additional profit of 4.8 MEUR/a, including the garbage and CO2 emission reductions of 0.106·106 t/a and of 0.084 ·106 t/a.

Transportation is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, making it essential to optimize traffic networks to reduce energy-related emissions. This paper presents a novel approach to traffic network control using Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC), a physics-informed machine learning methodology. We base our model on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) and the Networked Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (NMFD), offering a simplified representation of citywide traffic networks. Our approach ensures compliance with system constraints by construction. In empirical comparisons with existing state-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods, our approach demonstrates a 4 order of magnitude reduction in computation time and an up to 37% improvement in traffic performance. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of our controller to scenario shifts and find that it adapts well to changes in traffic patterns. This work proposes more efficient traffic control methods, particularly in large-scale urban networks, and aims to mitigate emissions and alleviate congestion in the future.

Deploying renewable generation to replace conventional fossil-fuel-based energy supplies provides an important pathway for the decarbonization of steelmaking plants. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to improve the flexibility of blast-furnace-gas-fired combined-cycle power plants (BFGCCs) to ease the accommodation of uncertain renewable generation. To this end, this paper proposes the deployment of a molten salt heat storage (MSHS) system in BFGCCs to store the heat of gas turbine flue gas so that the power–heat coupling of these BFGCCs can be unlocked to enhance the flexibility of the energy supply. A stochastic capacity optimization of an integrated BFGCC–MSHS–wind–solar (BMWS) energy system is presented to determine the optimal installed capacities of a BFG holder, MSHS, wind turbine, and PV panel, aiming to achieve an economic and safe energy supply for the entire system. Multiple scenarios considering uncertain fluctuations in load demands and renewable generation are generated with the Monte Carlo method based on a typical scenario. These scenarios are then reduced to representative scenarios using the synchronous substitution and reduction method for stochastic capacity optimization to enhance the reliability of the results. The case study results demonstrate that configuring MSHS reduces the total annualized cost of the BMWS system by 2.28%. Furthermore, considering the uncertainties of the power/heating load and wind/PV generation can reduce the expected annualized total cost of the BMWS system and the corresponding standard deviation by 5.66% and 81.45%, respectively. The BMWS system can achieve 730.68 tons of equivalent CO2 reduction in 24 h due to the successful utilization of renewable energy. This paper provides an effective approach for the decarbonization of energy generation systems in steelmaking plants.

The investigation of fundamental properties of low-valent molybdenum complexes bearing anionic ligands is crucial for elucidating the molybdenum’s role in critical enzymatic systems involved in the transformation of small molecules, including the nitrogenase’s iron molybdenum cofactor, FeMoco. The β-diketonate ligands in [Mo(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate), one of the earliest low-valent Mo complexes reported, provide a robust anionic platform to stabilize Mo in its +III oxidation state. This complex played a key role in demonstrating the potential of low-valent molybdenum for small molecule activation, serving as the starting material for the preparation of the first reported molybdenum dinitrogen complex. Surprisingly however, given this fact and the widespread use of β-diketonate ligands in coordination chemistry, only a very limited number of low-valent Mo β-diketonate complexes have been reported. To address this gap, we explored the redox behavior of homoleptic molybdenum tris-β-diketonate complexes, employing a tertiary butyl substituted diketonate ligand (dipivaloylmethanate, tBudiket) to isolate and fully characterize the corresponding Mo complexes across three consecutive oxidation states (+IV, +III, +II). We observed marked reactivity of the most reduced congener with heterocumulenes CE2 (E = O, S), yet with very distinct outcomes. Specifically, CO2 stoichiometrically carboxylates one of the β-diketonate ligands, while in the presence of excess CS2, catalytic reductive dimerization to tetrathiooxalate occurs. Through the isolation and characterization of reaction products and intermediates, we demonstrate that the observed reactivity results from the chemical non-innocence of the 𝛽-diketonate ligands, which facilitates the formation of a common ligand-bound intermediate, tBuMo(II)·CE2 (E = O, S). The stability of this proposed intermediate dictates the specific reduction products observed, highlighting the relevance of the chemically non-innocent nature of 𝛽-diketonate ligands.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Ammonia has emerged as a promising carbon-free alternative fuel for internal combustion engines (ICE), particularly in large-bore engine applications. However, integrating ammonia into conventional engines presents challenges, prompting the exploration of innovative combustion strategies like dual-fuel combustion. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions have emerged as a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of ammonia in ICE. Various studies suggest that combining exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with adjustments in inlet temperature and diesel injection timing can effectively mitigate nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions across diverse operating conditions in dual-fuel diesel engines. This study conducts a numerical investigation into the impact of varying inlet charge temperatures (330K, 360K, and 390K) and EGR rates (0%, 10%, and 20%) on the combustion and emission characteristics of an ammonia/diesel dual-fuel engine operating under high-load conditions, while considering different shares of ammonia energy. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are executed using Converge software. Subsequently, multi-linear regression models are developed, utilizing ammonia share, inlet charge temperature, and EGR rate as independent variables, and emission parameters as dependent variables. The best-fitted regression model can be employed to analyze the response surface of performance parameters. The optimal CO2 reduction, approximately 30%, is observed under the conditions of (390K, 40% NH<sub>3</sub>, and EGR20), as indicated by the results. Furthermore, under the conditions of (360K, 20% NH<sub>3</sub>, and EGR20), the findings indicate a notable reduction of NO<sub>2</sub>, approximately 65% compared to diesel. Additionally, the findings suggest that NH<sub>3</sub> reduction peaks at higher temperatures, with approximately a 50% decrease observed.</div></div>

To mitigate dangerous climate change, a drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is needed by 2030. Buildings contribute significantly to emissions, with the use phase of existing buildings being responsible for the majority of energy consumption. In addition, environmental problems associated with the production of raw materials, construction, and the end of life of buildings are serious concerns that require urgent solutions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and the EU-recommended Environmental Footprint (EF) are widely accepted tools to measure environmental impacts throughout a product life cycle. However, assessing the environmental performance of wooden buildings remains a challenge. This study presents a benchmark for an average new European wooden building fulfilling the European nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) requirement. The benchmark utilizes the recommended EU EF impact categories with normalization and weighting, allowing for easy and quick comparisons. The results communicate the average environmental impact per square meter of floor area over one year. This benchmark is a suitable comparison point for new wooden building designs and is used as an effective tool for architects and designers during the initial planning stages of wooden buildings. By using this benchmark, the environmental performance of the building can be improved, and the communication and interpretation of LCA results can be facilitated for customers and other relevant stakeholders.

This review article analyzes the influence of recycled glass (as sand and powder) beyond the durability, rheology and compressive strength of plain UHPC, even exploring flexural and direct tensile performance in fiber-reinforced UHPC. Interactions with other mineral admixtures like limestone powder, rice husk ash, fly ash, FC3R, metakaolin and slags, among others, are analyzed. Synergy with limestone powder improves rheology, reducing superplasticizer usage. Research highlights waste glass–UHPC mixtures with reduced silica fume and cement content by over 50% and nearly 30%, respectively, with compressive strengths exceeding 150 MPa, cutting costs and carbon footprints. Furthermore, with the proper fiber dosage, waste glass–UHPC reported values for strain and energy absorption capacity, albeit lower than those of traditional UHPC formulations with high cement, silica fume and quartz powder content, surpassing requirements for demanding applications such as seismic reinforcement of structures. Moreover, durability remains comparable to that of traditional UHPC. In addition, the reported life cycle analysis found that the utilization of glass powder in UHPC allows a greater reduction of embedded CO2 than other mineral additions in UHPC without jeopardizing its properties. In general, the review study presented herein underscores recycled glass’s potential in UHPC, offering economic and performance advantages in sustainable construction.

Rice husk ash (RHA) is agricultural waste with high silica content that has exhibited proven technical feasibility as a pozzolanic material since the 1970s. Notwithstanding, its use in mortars and concrete is limited by the standards currently utilized in some countries where RHA production is high and the aforementioned pozzolanic material is not standardized. This is the case in Spain, one of the main rice producers in Europe. Nowadays, the high pressure placed on the Portland cement production sector to reduce its energy use and CO2 emissions has given rise to a keen interest in mineral admixtures for cement manufacturing. In this research, we intended to establish the contributions of different RHA types to the final blended Portland cement properties (“H” is used to identify RHA in standardized cements). The experimental results demonstrated that RHA with good pozzolanic properties (large specific surface and high amorphous silica content) had to be limited to 10% cement replacement because of the severe reduction in workability at higher replacement percentages. RHA with lower reactivity, such as crystalline RHA, or fly ash (FA) can be used to prepare binary and ternary blended cements with reactive RHA. It is possible to design the following cements: CEM II/A-H and CEM II/A-(H-V). It would also be possible to design cement (CEM II/B-(H-V) with replacement values of up to 30% and the same 28-day mechanical performance as observed for the Portland cement without mineral addition.

The wide metabolic diversity of microalgae, their fast growth rates, and cost-effective production make these organisms highly promising resources for a variety of biotechnological applications, addressing critical needs in industry, agriculture, and medicine. The utilization of microalgae in consortia with bacteria is proving to be valuable in different biotechnological fields, including treating various types of wastewaters, producing biofertilizers, and extracting various products from their biomass. Monoculture of the microalgae Chlamydomonas has been a prominent research model for many years, extensively utilized in studying photosynthesis, sulfur and phosphorus metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, respiration, and flagella synthesis, among others. Recent re-search has increasingly recognized the potential of Chlamydomonas-bacteria consortia as a bio-technological tool for various applications. Bioremediation of wastewater using Chlamydomonas, and its bacterial consortia presents significant potential for the sustainable reduction of contam-inants, while also facilitating resource recovery and valorization of microalgal biomass. Using Chlamydomonas and its bacterial consortia as biofertilizers can offers several benefits, such as en-hancing crop yield, protecting crops, maintaining soil fertility and stability, aiding in CO2 miti-gation, and contributing to sustainable agriculture practices. Chlamydomonas-bacterial consortia play a significant role in the production of high-value products, particularly in biofuel and en-hancing H2 production. This review aims to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the po-tential of Chlamydomonas monoculture and its bacterial consortia, identifying current applications, and proposing new research and development directions to maximize its potential.

The adverse effects of heatwaves on viticulture could be, at least partly, mitigated by generous soil water availability. As climate change will also likely reduce irrigation water, knowing to which extent soil water availability could be decreased under the heatwaves without compromising plant performances would be important. In this pot experiment, we differentiated soil water availability by compensating 100% (T100), 70% (T70), 40% (T40) and 10% (T10) of vine transpiration. Grapevines (cv. Sauvignon) were then subjected to a 11-day heatwave (Tmax 40 °C) and to a post-heat stress recovery phase. Soil water potential between -0.05 to -0.2 MPa, respectively, in T100 and T70 enabled the plants to maintain high net CO2 assimilation (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), and leaf transpiration (Eleaf) which kept the leaf temperature (Tleaf) below the ambient temperature and promoted the plant growth. During the heatwave, T100 and T70 vines decreased their photochemical yield and dissipated the excess energy via regulated non-photochemical heat dissipation, and resumed their photochemical activities upon removing the heat stress. Further reduction in soil water potential to -0.4 and and -1.2 MPa in T40 and T10, respectively, decreased Pn and gs and restrained Eleaf, causing a significant increase in Tleaf during the heatwave, and limited the plant recovery after the heat stress. Nonetheless, the maximum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) showed quite high resistance to heat stress in all treatments. These findings suggest that decreasing soil water availability to reach soil water potential levels close to -0.2 MPa implies higher efficiency in using water resources during a heat wave without limiting plant growth.

As the third-largest maize-producing province in China and a typical arid and semi-arid region, quantitatively evaluating the carbon and nitrogen footprints of maize production and their dominant factors is of great significance in guiding the high-yield, low-carbon, and sustainable development of maize production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This study quantitatively evaluated the interannual evolution characteristics of the carbon and nitrogen footprints in maize production and their dominant factors in Inner Mongolia from 2003 to 2022 based on statistical yearbook data and emission parameter models. The results showed that from 2003 to 2022, the maize planting area, yield, and total yield in Inner Mongolia all increased, with an average annual increase of 97 kg ha−1 in yield and 1.23 × 106 Mg in total yield. The carbon and nitrogen footprints of Inner Mongolia maize production over the past 20 years had overall decreasing trends, while the nitrogen fertilizer bias productivity, net ecosystem carbon balance, and sustainability index had increasing trends. Carbon footprint reduced by an average of 5.2 kg CO2 eq Mg−1 per year, and nitrogen footprint reduced by an average of 0.21 g N eq kg−1 per year. Currently, the transportation and production of fertilizer and field application of N fertilizer are the main controlling factors of GHG emissions from maize production. NO3−-N, NH4+-N leaching, and NH3 volatilization from field application of N fertilizer are the main sources of reactive N losses. The application of simplified processes, such as phased regulation of nitrogen and controlled-release fertilizers, as well as conservation tillage, have broad prospects for emission reduction in maize production in Inner Mongolia.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is rich in mitochondria and expresses high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), enabling it to regulate thermogenesis and system energy expenditure. NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a key cofactor for maintaining mitochondrial function by serving as a redox carrier and signaling molecule. To investigate the regulation and function of NAD+ in BAT, we measured the expression of genes involved in NAD+ synthesis and catabolism in mice under room temperature, cold challenge, and thermoneutral conditions. We found that the expression of nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1), the final enzyme for NAD+ synthesis, was suppressed by thermoneutrality and increased by cold challenge in BAT. We, therefore, generated brown adipocyte-specific NMNAT1 knockout mice (NMNAT1-bKO) by crossing the NMNAT1 flox/flox mice to the UCP1-Cre mice. NMNAT1 deletion reduced NAD+ levels by approximately 50%, accompanied by the accumulated precursors, including NMN and NaMN in BAT. Despite the significant reduction of BAT NAD+, NMNAT1-bKO mice showed comparable body weight, normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and unchanged systemic energy metabolism, including O2 consumption, CO2 production, and RER in the metabolic cage studies. Further cold challenges and high-fat diet feeding did not induce any differences in the metabolic phenotype. RNA-seq analysis of BAT from NMNAT1-bKO and control mice under cold challenge revealed enrichment of genes involved in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolic process. These results show that BAT NMNAT1 is necessary for maintaining NAD+ levels but dispensable for systemic energy metabolism, possibly due to compensatory upregulation of mitochondrial genes.

Introduction The thoracic surgical procedure leads to a reduction in respiratory muscle strength. To restore it, certain strategies must be employed. Physiotherapy utilizes resources and techniques such as deep breathing stimulation, cough stimulation, use of incentive spirometers, mobilization, and ambulation. However, at times these resources and techniques may prove insufficient, and additional measures, such as Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), are employed Pieczkoski (2017). Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV) has been utilized to expedite pulmonary function recovery as well as to prevent and treat postoperative pulmonary complications Nasrala 2018. NIV diminishes the risk of ventilator-associated complications due to its non-invasive nature. Consequently, NIV has been adopted to avert post-extubation complications in postoperative patients Liu 2020. The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial and assess the efficacy of NIV in comparison to conventional physiotherapy in terms of pulmonary function among patients undergoing cardiac surgery at a selected hospital in Campina Grande, Paraíba, Brazil. Methods and analyses This randomized, controlled, double-blind (patient and analyst) clinical trial will be conducted at Hospital João XXIII in Campina Grande, Paraíba, Brazil. Patients do not know which group they are allocated to. Those in the group that use CPAP or BIPAP will not be able to distinguish one from the other. The data analyst at the end of the collections will also be blinded. Only the health professional who will be applying the protocol cannot be blinded. The sample size, determined via sample calculation, yielded a total of 21 patients per group (63 patients). The patients will be allocated into 3 groups (CPAP group - CPAP + standard physiotherapy, BiPAP group - BiPAP + standard physiotherapy, and Control group - standard physiotherapy) in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The control group will receive the usual physiotherapeutic treatment as per the kinesiotherapy protocol. The treatment will be administered twice daily, starting in the ICU and progressing to the ward. In the CPAP group, nasal CPAP at 10cmH2O will be administered for 1 hour, twice daily, using an approved device. In the BiPAP group, nasal BiPAP with an IPAP of 13cmH2O and EPAP of 8cmH2O will be administered for 1 hour, twice daily, using an approved device. The NIV sessions will be conducted over the course of 5 days of hospitalization, both in the ICU and the ward. Assessments will be conducted at two time points: on day 1 preoperatively and on day 5 postoperatively. The following measures will be evaluated: pulmonary function, length of hospital stay, presence of postoperative pulmonary complications, score of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) in its Portuguese version, functional capacity, the Global Perception of Change Scale, and the Functional Independence Measure (MIF). The normality of variables will be assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. IBM SPSS Statistics Base 25.0, using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and paired Student’s t-test for pre-post intervention comparison. They will use linear mixed effects models for longitudinal analysis and GLMMs to compare NIV effects over time between groups. They will employ ITT for missing data, INAR models for time dependence, fixed effects models for endogeneity, and Cohen’s d for effect sizes. Parametric model assumptions will be checked, and various models will be considered for data characteristics. Primary outcomes Pulmonary function, Length of hospital stay. Second outcomes Score of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) in Portuguese version, Funcional capacity, The global perception of change scale, The functional independence measure (MIF), pO2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), HCO3 (bicarbonate), Arterial Oxygen Saturation (SaO2), Base Excess (BE), Presence of lung complications. Other pre-specified outcomes Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, type of surgery, personal history, preoperative ejection fraction, previous respiratory complications, body mass index (BMI), gender and age.

The Impact Measurement and Application of Conservation System (IMACS) was recently described in ten preprint papers. IMACS represents the first “first principals” based system for measurement of damaging and conserving impacts and the calculation of sustainabilities for products, services and individuals. IMACS distinguishes “participating” and “non-participating” individuals, organizations and their products and services. IMACS automatically assigns damaging impacts to individuals, products and services. Under IMACS, each generator of impacts “owns” their impacts, while impacts are transferred with products sold or distributed. For the fully implemented and participating world, all impacts will be determined accurately using a combination of (mostly) remote sensing and (increasingly less) ground/sea level-based verification and straightforward calculations. For the initial application, all impacts will be estimated using a statistical approach, where products, services and individuals with higher impact uncertainty are assigned higher impacts. Participating organizations can select lower cost estimation methods leading to higher estimated impacts and vice versa. Under IMACS, each event creating additional impacts, represents an additional supply chain step. This makes it easy to follow each product throughout the supply chain until it’s purchase by the end-user consumer. Due to the level of automation used, the impact estimation/determination can be done at very low costs, much lower than using life cycle assessment (LCA) or input-output analysis methods. Resource using, damaging, protecting and restoring impacts are distributed over eleven impact groups. Conservation is made available by for-profit and non-profit organizations and distributed by IMACS licensed organizations as “Title-to-Conservation” (TTC). Neutralizing amounts of conservation are applied to participating products and services purchased by participating consumers. Due to the shortage of conservation as TTC, initially none to very little TTC can be applied, leading to initially very low retailer or supply chain costs expressed as percentage of sales. However, the sale of TTC at market prices will allow the exponential growth of the conservation industry and create strong incentives for reduction of resource using and elimination of damaging impacts throughout the supply chain. Increasing consumer demand for products “free of impacts” (after impact neutralization through application of TTC) will force supply chain participation, creating a “new normal” where the supply chain pays for the costs of conservation. Using this approach and a twenty-year transition period to full societal participation, return to pre-industrial atmospheric conditions can be achieved in 40 – 60 years, greatly limiting damage from climate change, while saving costs. The same applies to all impact groups, greatly limiting environmental damage, biodiversity loss and reducing human suffering and premature deaths. A review of marketing studies indicates that the model assumptions used for societal participation are conservative. The use of certified and licensed for profit businesses for most tasks within IMACS allows a rapid global roll-out and scale-up of IMACS functionality. The system has the potential to create very large amounts of funding for conservation, and potentially allows a relative fast return to pre-industrial environmental conditions, while improving human conditions and saving costs. By participating in IMACS, individuals and organizations can eliminate current CO2 emissions, neutralize historic CO2 emissions, provide adequate fresh water for ecosystems, protect wildlife areas and their biodiversity, save money and improve their competitive position. IMACS, by assigning the costs of conservation (protection and restoration) to individuals and organizations responsible for the damage done, can effectively address and solve the classic “tragedy of the commons”.

To the Editor: The abdominal surgical procedures are linked to a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and may be mitigated by administration of lung-protective mechanical ventilation during anesthesia.[1,2] To date, no relevant studies have focused on protective lung ventilation strategies specifically for laparoscopic colorectal cancer (CRC). Herein, we propose an innovative easy-to-use lung-protective strategy with lower tidal volume (VT), pneumoperitoneum pressure (PnP) and deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and assess whether it is superior to conventional lung protection strategies in reducing PPCs. A single-center, randomized trial was conducted in patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery and followed up until 30 postoperative days (PODs). A total of 120 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to either the test group (protective lung ventilation with lower VT (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight [PBW] + low PnP [10 mmHg] + deep NMB) or the control group (conventional pulmonary ventilation [8 mL/kg of PBW for VT] + standard PnP [15 mmHg] + moderate NMB). The institutional Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (Approval No. NCC2018W-006) and the registry was completed at ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR1900021989). The written informed consent were signed by each patient before enrollment. The patient follow-ups were performed throughout the hospital stay once daily or by telephone and outpatient records when patients were discharged at Day 30 after operation [Supplementary Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. In all the groups, mechanical ventilation during anesthesia consisted of volume-controlled modes of VT according to the group and PBW,[1,2] positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, and alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs) at 30-minute intervals. The respiratory rate was adjusted as necessary to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) between 35 mmHg and 45 mmHg, with an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (I:E) of 1:2. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was maintained at 40–60% throughout the anesthesia treatment. A portable neuromuscular monitor was applied to the ulnar nerve to confirm the depth of the NMB. The indications of NMB depth were defined as train-of-four count (TOFC) = 0 and posttetanic count (PTC) ≥1 for deep NMB and TOFC = 1–3 for moderate NMB.[3] The primary endpoint of the PPCs was systematically assessed via the operational definition of Kroenke et al[4] with the grades ranging from 1 to 4 [Supplementary Table 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. For those suspected to have PPCs, low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) was routinely performed for confirmation. The secondary endpoints comprise postoperative analgesia and serological inflammatory factor expression. All the statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 25.0 (IBM SPSS, Inc., NY, USA). The Kaplan–Meier (K–M) method combined with log-rank analysis was used to compare the incidence of PPCs between the two groups. Quantitative data are presented as the medians (interquartile ranges) and were compared using Student's t-test or the Mann–Whitney rank test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square or the Fisher exact test. The two-tailed P values <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The sample size was calculated according to the results of our preliminary experiment. With a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a minimum of 55 patients were included in each group. Considering a 10% drop-out rate during the follow-up, 60 patients were enrolled in each group. In this study, 152 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery were initially included, and a total of 120 patients were ultimately enrolled. The patients in the two groups had comparable baseline characteristics [Supplementary Table 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. The K–M analysis revealed a significant difference in the incidence of PPCs within 30 days after surgery between the test group (9 of 60, 15.0%) and the control group (19 of 60, 31.7%) (P = 0.031; Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26). Of these, patients of grade 1 (primarily microatelectasis) account for the largest proportion of PPCs (test group vs. control group; 77.8% [7 of 9] vs. 68.4% [13 of 19]). For subgroup analysis, the test group exhibited superior analgesic outcomes and fewer related postoperative inflammatory responses than did the control group for individuals with a standard or overweight body mass index (BMI) <27.9 kg/m2, who were younger than 62 years, or who had an anesthesia duration of 3 hours or less [Supplementary Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. Atelectasis formation, a shift in the ventilation-to-perfusion ratio by reduced pulmonary compliance and increased chest pressure facilitates PPCs even in patients with healthy lungs. This pathophysiological alteration will be exacerbated during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Pulmonary atelectasis is the main cause of PPCs progression and is mainly attributed to compression of the lung parenchyma, absorption of alveolar gases, and impaired extra-alveolar function. The use of higher FiO2 (>80%) can also lead to absorptive lung atelectasis and exacerbate inflammatory lung injury.[2] PPCs can also cause lung injury, lung infection, or barotrauma in turn. Tidal volumes in the range of 6–8 mL/kg of PBW are widely accepted for non-injured lungs.[2] Single low-tidal volume ventilation plays the most important role in protective ventilation,[1,2,5] which may lead to decreased compliance and atelectasis formation. Therefore, in comparison to the control group, which had a concentration of 8 mL/kg, 6 mL/kg was adopted for the test group. The ideal level of PEEP to resist atelectasis remains in dispute, with low-risk patients receiving PEEP of less than 5 cm H2O but high-risk patients requiring higher levels of PEEP.[5] Once atelectasis has occurred, ARMs are required to recruit alveoli. Additionally, it has been proven that a lower PnP involves reduced peak inspiratory pressure and facilitates respiratory compliance, especially in the Trendelenburg position. Some evidence has shown that postoperative lung function is equivalent in patients receiving the same PnP, regardless of whether deep or moderate NMB is used, thus demonstrating a close correlation between PnP and postoperative PPCs.[6] Postoperative pain is another critical factor in the formation of PPCs, pain-induced restriction of abdominal breathing initiates the microatelectasis and subsequent atelectasis formation. Despite using the same standardized analgesic protocol in both groups, our results indicate that the lung-protective strategy was associated with lower short-term postoperative VAS scores (P = 0.016 for postoperative 1 h, P = 0.071 for POD 1 [Table 1]) and decreased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression on POD 3 (P = 0.017). Of note, the subgroup results reveal a superior advantage in analgesia and systemic inflammation suppression in the test group, especially in those with BMI <27.9 kg/m2, age <62 years, or anesthesia duration ≤3 hours [Supplementary Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. One potential mechanism through which analgesia is achieved could be the reduction in tension exerted on the abdominal wall facilitated by deep NMB, thereby reducing postoperative incisional pain.[7] Additionally, low PnP can relieve visceral and shoulder pain by lowering the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and reducing inflammatory cytokines/oxygen-free radicals arising from visceral ischemia–reperfusion injury. Given that inflammation is implicated in the progression of pain, lung injury, and PPCs,[1] the causal relationship remains undetermined.

As a single-center study, only one study site cannot be representative of the clinical practices in a larger patient population. Chronic postsurgical pain and more detailed pain categories should be further explored. Furthermore, mechanistic studies in the outcome after novel treatment strategies need to be investigated. In conclusion, the holistic anesthetic strategy of protective lung ventilation combined with deep NMB and low PnP can reduce the PPCs in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Further studies are needed to test the efficacy and heterogeneity of the clinical application of this easy-to-use anesthetic strategy.

<p>我國綠建築評估系統EEWH至今已有20年歷史，然而在住宿類建築當中綠建築標章案件數仍僅占總使用執照數量1%以下，標章案之總樓地板面積僅占總使用執照總樓地板面積20%以下，因此對於推廣綠建築之成果仍有進步空間。分析綠建築申請率低的原因，包含大眾認為綠建築之成本較高、綠建築標章之總建築專案期程較久、所需之審查資料繁多&hellip;等。再者，申請綠建築標章時之分數常少於申請候選綠建築證書時之分數，甚至有案件未申請綠建築標章。專案管理係指對於專案生命週期之各項工作項目予以妥善管理，以減少專案成果與預期目標的落差。於過往在建築業的案例與相關研究中，指出專案管理對於管控建築成本與工期具有實際績效，然而案例多為大型工程與廠辦類建築物，對於住宿類建築物之探討相對較少。故本研究先透過專家問卷探討建築專案管理管控綠建築指標項目之能力，以提出在專案管理思維下，設計住宿類綠建築時可優先考量採用之建築技術，以消除大眾對於綠建築在成本與時程上之顧慮。研究成果顯示，不同綠建築技術與設施設備之採用情形，對於建築專案的管控能力確實具有差異性。在EEWH-RS版本下之指標項目，以日常節能指標與二氧化碳減量指標下之指標項目，較能夠受專案管理管控。但綠化量指標、水資源指標以及汙水垃圾改善指標等，由於其技術已經成熟、成為標準配備或已規格化，致使專案管理對其無法具有較高的影響能力。研究成果係可協助建築設計師於住宿類綠建築規劃設計時，擬定出較易管控成本與時程之方案，進而提升業主採用綠建築技術與設施設備之意願。</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Taiwan&rsquo;s green building assessment system (EEWH) has a history of 20 years, but the number of green building label cases in residential buildings still accounts for less than 1% of the total number of Building Use permit, and the total floor area of the label cases are less than 20% of the total building which get Building Use permit. So there is still room for promoting the achievements of green buildings. Analyze the reasons for the low green building application rate, including the public’s view that the cost of green building is relatively high, the overall construction project period of the green building label is longer, and the amount of review information required is more than general building... Furthermore, the score for applying for a green building seal is often less than the score for applying for a candidate green building certificate. There are even cases where the green building seal is not applied. Project management refers to the proper management of various work items in the project life cycle to reduce the gap between project results and expected goals. In the past cases and related research in the construction industry, it was pointed out that project management has actual performance in controlling construction costs and duration. However, most of the cases are large-scale projects and factory buildings, and there is relatively little discussion on residential buildings. Therefore, in this study, an expert questionnaire will be used to discuss the ability of the construction project management to control the green building index project, in order to put forward the construction technology that can be considered first when designing residential-type green buildings under the project management thinking, so as to eliminate the public’s cost and schedule for green buildings Concerns. The research results show that the adoption of different green building technologies and facilities and equipment has indeed different management and control capabilities for construction projects. The indicators under the EEWH-RS version are more able to be controlled by the project management based on the daily energy saving indicators and the CO2 reduction indicators. However, the greenery indicators, water resource indicators and sewage and garbage improvement indicators, etc., because their technology has matured, become standard equipment or has been standardized, the project management cannot have a high influence on it. The research results can assist architects in the planning and design of residential-type green buildings, and draw up plans that are easier to control costs and schedules, thereby enhancing the owners’ willingness to adopt green building technologies and facilities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
