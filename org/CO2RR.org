Abstract CO2 capture and transformation into chemical fuels presents a useful carbon-neutral energy source to curb the effects of global warming if the electrocatalyst used is highly active, exhibits sufficient product selectivity, and is energetically efficient. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising class of catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and their product selectivity can be further improved through surface modification with different ligands. The primary objective of this work is to compare the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and cyclic voltammetry with a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) to study CO2 reduction at silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) modified with amino acids (cysteine and tryptophan) and Ag NPs synthesized by a citrate reduction method. RRDE studies showed the onset potential for CO2RR was earlier for both the Ag NPs with cysteine and Ag NPs with tryptophan than those with citrate. SECM showed earlier onset potentials for CO2RR than the RRDE experiment for every type of Ag NP as well as the formation of different CO2RR products. SECM also showed less hydrogen formation for the Ag NPs with cysteine and Ag NPs with tryptophan. Comparing RRDE and SECM, SECM appears more sensitive for detecting products of CO2RR.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology seamlessly integrates and optimizes the merits of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, facilitating charge separation and enhancing solar conversion efficiency. It stands out as a promising approach for CO2 treatment. GaN as III-Ⅴ semiconductor, has garnered substantial attention in the realm of PEC CO2 reduction reactions (RR). In this study, GaN and In/GaN micro-rods were prepared via straightforward hydrothermal synthesis. Attaining a current density of approximately 10 mA/cm2 and CO Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of ~45% at -0.75 VRHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode, RHE), In/GaN exhibited exceptional stability over a 2 h PEC CO2 RR. The introduction of In into GaN significantly augmented CO2 adsorption capacity and light harvesting. Additionally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations elucidated that In-doped GaN can diminish the adsorption of intermediate CO, favoring subsequent CO desorption. Furthermore, the N-vacancy increased with In doping, resulting in a rise in the number of unpaired electrons, facilitating carrier transport. Herein, vibration energy harvester was introduced to drive CO2 RR, marking a significant advancement in development of PEC CO2 RR for future green energy applications.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has recently attracted increasing attention of chemists for converting CO2 to value‐added chemicals with the assistance of electrical energy. Over the past decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to CO2RR, however, this process still suffers the challenges of low conversion and poor selectivity to target product due to the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2. Among those catalysts, Cu has been widely used for CO2RR to produce hydrocarbons with relatively high efficiency in spite of the poor selectivity to products. Therefore, it is highly desired to developed highly active and selective Cu based catalysts for CO2RR. This mini‐review will summary the recent advances on CO2RR over Cu‐based nanocrystals (NCs) with a special focus on the control of selectivity of product via surface modification. We hope this mini‐review will motivate chemists to develop efficient catalysts for CO2RR, and also promote the fundamental research on catalyst design in heterogeneous catalysis.

Elucidating the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions helps promote the coordinated and synergistic development of the economy and the environment. This study utilizes the Tapio decoupling model to analyze the decoupling relationship between economic growth rate and CO2 emissions in 14 cities of Liaoning Province from 2005 to 2020. Additionally, a model is established with the aim of determining CO2 reduction targets for achieving strong or weak decoupling states. Results showed that although most cities showed a strong or weak decoupling state, the decoupling performance in specific year was not ideal, the proportion of negative decoupling increased from 2017 to 2020. Liaoning Province faces significant challenges in decoupling economic growth rate from CO2 emissions, it needs to reduce its CO2 emissions (CE) by 5659.33 107 Kg or 5397.80 107 Kg to achieve strong or weak decoupling, respectively. Among the 14 cities, 8 cities have not achieved strong or weak decoupling. Cities such as Anshan, Yingkou, and Benxi face the greatest challenges, with a minimum required reduction of 25.72% in CE, 41.77% in Carbon Emissions per Capita, and 16.62% in Carbon Emissions per Unit of GDP. The research results can provide theoretical support for improving energy efficiency.

In this work, gold-photo-catalyzed CO2 transformation was conducted and the effect of three variables with two levels was investigated: support (TiO2 and hydroxyapatite from bovine bone (BB)), Au content (5 and 10%) and activation wavelength (254 and 380–700 nm). Reactions were conducted in a stirred tank reactor by bubbling CO2 (9 × 10−3 dm3/min) in 0.1 dm3 of 0.5 M NaOH solution. The catalysts were synthesized using AuCl3, TiO2 and BB. Au nanoparticles were obtained by reduction with Hetheroteca inuloides, thus eliminating calcination and hydrogenation to reduce the gold species. By TEM, the particle size distribution was determined, and the synthesized nanoparticle sizes varied in the range of 9 to 19 nm, depending on the support and Au content. By UV–Vis spectroscopy, the energy band gaps of the prepared materials were 2.18 eV (10% Au/BB), 2.38 eV (5% Au/BB), 2.42 eV (BB), 3.39 eV (5% Au/TiO2), 3.41 eV (10% Au/TiO2) and 3.43 eV for pure TiO2. Methanol and formic and acetic acids were identified during the process. Selectivity toward methanol was found to be improved with the 10% Au/BB catalytic system.

Abstract Due to new environmental and cost challenges in the oil and gas industry, operators are looking for solutions to save costs and reduce their CO2 footprint. The main objective of this project was to find a solution to save time in the plug and abandonment (P&A) operation and reduce the CO2 footprint in a manner that can be applied in future P&A operations in the Norwegian Waters. The first step was to perform a detailed engineering analysis of the new solution, comparing it with the standard P&A technique. Technical requirements, associated costs, additional risks, equipment, NORSOK D010 requirements and blend designs were considered. After this analysis, the decision was made to go for the new P&A solution. This implied placing one long cement plug in one go (1425m) using a sacrificial drill pipe and a disconnect tool. The cement plug was tailored to achieve competent slurry properties for the job, such as fluid loss (FL), free fluid (FF), thickening time (TT), wait on cement (WOC), etc. Pre-job laboratory tests were conducted to assess the suitability of this blend for the new technique. The project was then planned, and the proper tools, equipment, and slurry design were selected for the job. A detailed cost analysis compared a conventional P&A method, which implied placing 5 – 6 plugs, versus the new method of placing one long plug in one go with a sacrificial pipe and a disconnect tool. The HSE aspects were evaluated, significantly reducing rig time, slop generation, CO2 footprint and people's exposure in the red zone. The job was performed as planned, observing normal circulation throughout the whole cement job and a clear indication of the dart landing and the tool release. The well barrier was verified by tagging and pressure test after WOC confirmed hard cement and isolation at the theoretical top of the cement. This new P&A method has been used for five jobs in Norway in the last two years. No issues have been recorded. The tool was disconnected as planned, confirming its reliability. Substantial rig time savings and HSE improvements have been achieved on all jobs so far. Improved HSE and reduced CO2 emissions can be achieved with this new P&A method. The paper will also show the advantage of the tool compared with conventional P&A methods and how important this can be for both environmental improvements and cost reductions.

Abstract The entropy design paradigm is yielding advanced materials for many societally crucial applications. While most work focuses on single-phase materials, there are vast opportunities to integrate entropy-designed materials into novel composites. Here we develop a nanocomposite design strategy using exsolution-self-assembly to fabricate Cu nanorods in an entropy-stabilized oxide. Atomic-scale electron probes and energetic calculations elucidate how exsolution-self-assembly is tunable using knowledge of point defect interactions. We leverage this to then demonstrate a high-throughput synthesis and screening strategy to fabricate a library of Cu-ESO tandem CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrodes. Electrocatalytic mapping and localized physicochemical analyses reveal structure-property relationships between local Cu valence and CO2RR activity, identifying operating potentials and electrode surface chemistries that favor CO2RR over competitive hydrogen evolution. This high-throughput synthesis-screening approach can accelerate development of advanced electrocatalysts and nanocomposite materials for many applications given its compatibility with entropy-designed materials and physical vapor deposition at/near silicon volume manufacturing temperatures.

Abstract Visible-light activation of photocatalysts is crucial for effectively utilizing solar energy in molecular conversions. This study demonstrates that modifying the bipyridine ligand with carbazole enables visible-light activation of a Ru(II) carbonyl complex catalyst, which is originally developed as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction but inactive as a photocatalyst on its own. The present study opens avenues for individually designing light-absorbing ligands and catalytic functions within one mononuclear complex.

Ruthenium CNC pincer complexes, comprised of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and a pyridyl ring, are highly active catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. We hypothesized that the addition of long chain aliphatic groups with an olefin terminus as wingtips on these CNC pincers could be used to form macrocyclic catalysts by ring closing metathesis (RCM). We have synthesized three new ruthenium pincer catalysts, [(CNC)Ru(CH3CN)2Cl]OTf, containing a long chain olefin wingtip (4A-4C, where R = H, Me, OMe para to N on the pyridine ring) and performed RCM on 4B, followed by hydrogenation, to form a novel macrocyclic ruthenium catalyst, 6B. These four catalysts were tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in the presence (sensitized) and absence (self-sensitized) of an external photosensitizer. With a photosensitizer, these catalysts produced mostly CO (775 to 1210 TON) with smaller amounts of H2 also formed. The methyl substituted macrocyclic catalyst 6B showed a TON of 1185 for CO over 72 hours compared to a TON of 775 for CO for the acyclic catalyst 4B. The remote substituents at the para-position of the central pyridine ring significantly influence catalyst activity with R = OMe > H = Me.

Abstract. Wildfires release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change and causing severe impacts on air quality and human health. Including carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wildfires in international assessments and national emission reduction responsibilities is crucial for global carbon reduction and environmental governance. In this study, based on a bottom-up approach and using satellite data, combined with emission factor and aboveground biomass data for different vegetation cover types (forest, shrub, grassland, cropland), the dynamic changes in CO2 emissions from wildfires in China from 2001 to 2022 were analyzed. The results showed that between 2001 and 2022, the total CO2 emissions from wildfires in China were 693.7 Tg (1 Tg = 1012 g), with an annual average of 31.5 Tg. The CO2 emissions from cropland and forest fires were relatively high, accounting for 46 % and 32 %, respectively. The yearly variation in CO2 emissions from forest and shrub fires showed a significant downward trend, while emissions from grassland fires remained relatively stable. In contrast, the CO2 emissions from cropland fires showed a clear upward trend. High CO2 emissions from wildfires were mainly concentrated in the eastern regions of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia Provinces in China, accounting for 44 % of the total annual emissions. Various factors such as daily cumulative sunshine hours (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, forest: -0.41, shrub:0.25; p < 0.001) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; Spearman’s correlation coefficient, forest: -0.35, shrub: 0.37; p < 0.001), influenced CO2 emissions from forest and shrub fires. Moreover, temperature (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.45, p < 0.001) primarily affected CO2 emissions from grassland fires. The CO2 emissions from cropland fires negatively correlated with the gross domestic product (GDP) (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.52, p < 0.001) and population density (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.51, p < 0.001). China's policy management has been crucial in reducing CO2 emissions from wildfires. By accurately assessing CO2 emissions from wildfires, governments worldwide can better set CO2 reduction targets, take corresponding measures, and contribute to the global response to climate change.

Air pollution is a critical issue impacting urban environments, leading to severe health problems and environmental degradation. This comprehensive review examines the potential of green systems—specifically green walls, active green walls, and urban greenery systems—to mitigate atmospheric pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon dioxide (CO2). By systematically analyzing 44 recent studies, the review highlights the pollutant capture efficiency of various green technologies and plant species in both indoor and outdoor settings. Active green walls, particularly those utilizing plant species such as Chlorophytum comosum and Sansevieria trifasciata, were found to be highly effective, with VOC reduction efficiencies up to 96.34%, PM reductions by 65.42%, and CO2 reduction rates reaching 4.8% under optimal conditions. The review identifies key strengths in current research, including diverse experimental setups and the use of sophisticated measurement techniques, but also notes significant limitations such as variability in experimental conditions and a lack of long-term performance data. The study underscores the importance of proper maintenance to sustain green systems&#039; efficacy and highlights the potential issue of pollutant resuspension, which remains under-researched. Practical implications for urban planning are discussed, advocating for the integration of effective green systems into urban infrastructure to enhance air quality and public health. Recommendations for future research include the need for standardized metrics, long-term studies, economic feasibility analyses, and real-world validation of simulation models to better understand and optimize green systems for urban air pollution mitigation.

Abstract This paper assesses the role of natural gas in the global energy transition and industrial decarbonization, specifically in the power and industrial sectors, where natural gas holds substantial importance both at present and well into the future. An overview of the current societal relevance of natural gas will be presented, and an assessment of natural gas contributions to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions/reductions will be presented. The opportunities and repercussions of fuel switching is illustrated through a detailed case study in the United States highlighting the importance of Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) for natural gas to have a more significant role in energy transitions and decarbonization efforts. This research presents a comprehensive approach, combining data analysis, literature review, and development of a case study to examine the significance of natural gas on the energy transition. Methods include assessing the share of natural gas in global emissions and analyzing fuel switching scenarios. The study draws on data from open sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Our World in Data and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to support its findings and conclusions. Natural gas, while contributing significantly to global CO2 emissions, emerges as a crucial transitional fuel for reducing emissions in the short term. Fuel switching, particularly from coal to natural gas, is identified as a key strategy for achieving immediate emission reductions. But the switch implies an increase in demand for natural gas. The study reveals that the United States (U.S.) has witnessed substantial emissions reductions through coal-to-gas switching, emphasizing the economic and environmental benefits. However, the ultimate goal remains a shift towards electrification and low-carbon sources for long-term sustainability. CCUS becomes crucial in advancing sustainable power and heat within the energy and industrial sectors and can be deployed with appropriate policy frameworks and incentives using current technology and infrastructure, making it a crucial bridge to decarbonization. This research introduces insights into the cooperative relationship between coal, natural gas, renewables and the role of CCUS, emphasizing their complementary roles in energy transitions. The potential of natural gas as a flexible and reliable transition energy source is explored, particularly in the U.S. industrial sector. The study also delves into the role of CCUS in decarbonizing power and heat generated by the use of natural gas in power generation and industrial settings. The need for a phased approach to energy transitions and policy support is highlighted. Research funding, financial incentives or carbon cap, and greenhouse gases (GHG) reporting are essential components for advancing carbon capture technologies. The study concludes by emphasizing the evolving role of natural gas in the context of global, regional, and national climate objectives, considering factors such as technology advancements, market conditions, policy support and necessary timelines for substantive reductions in CO2 emissions required by intergovernmental agreements such as the Paris Accord.

The need to reduce vehicle emissions has encouraged the development of various solutions. One of them is the steam injection method, which proved to be an effective option of reducing NOx emissions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the steam injection method on an agricultural engine, appropriate tests were carried out at the Alternative Fuels Research Laboratory of the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. The engine KDI 1903M and a self-made steam device ensuring steam injection in the intake manifold were used in the tests. The research engine was connected to the SIERRA CP-Engineering engine test bench. Additionally, emissions were recorded by the AVL SESAM FTIR exhaust gas analytical system. Testing was performed without steam supply and with steam supply at constant speeds, as well as in different load modes - 10 kW and 20 kW. The results showed that the largest reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions was obtained at idling (7.5%), while in case of all load modes the results were very similar (reduction by 4.1-5.0%). At the same time, increase of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions was observed in all testing modes by 3.0-5.6%, while carbon dioxide (CO2) changes were negligible. The studies confirmed an insignificant increase in the power and torque. The results prove that further research should increase the volume of steam supply by improving the given device.

Abstract The oil and gas industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its environmental footprint, particularly concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions contributing to climate change. Drilling operations represent a significant source, accounting for an estimated 11.6% of emissions within the industry's upstream activities. This study investigates quantifying the potential reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and overall environmental impact by transitioning from nonaqueous (oil/synthetic-based) to aqueous (water-based) drilling fluids. A multi-phase analysis was conducted to develop a comprehensive carbon emissions calculator for the entire lifecycle of nonaqueous fluids used in deep-water drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Across six lifecycle stages, from raw material transportation to disposal/reuse, the calculator quantifies CO2 emissions based on activity data and emission factors. Preliminary findings indicate rig operations (62%) and solids control/cuttings management (29%) contribute 91% of total calculated emissions. Case studies are presented demonstrating the emissions reduction potential of aqueous fluids. In the Gulf of Mexico, sustainable water-based mud eliminated operational steps like pit cleaning compared to nonaqueous fluids, reducing associated emissions. For a 12-well campaign in the Permian Basin, aqueous fluids reduced drilling days per well from 20 to 13 on average versus nonaqueous, resulting in a 37% reduction in CO2 emissions. The study proposes adapting this calculator framework to model representative aqueous fluid systems, enabling direct comparison of emissions profiles across all stages. Aqueous fluids’ inherent nature suggests reducible impacts through lower transportation volumes, less energy-intensive preparation, enhanced drilling performance, minimized rig time, and more straightforward waste management. However comprehensive comparative data is ongoing, aqueous fluids demonstrate compelling potential to lower the substantial carbon footprint associated with drilling activities. This rigorous methodology enables evidence-based decisions on drilling fluid selection to align with sustainability initiatives and improve environmental stewardship. The study proposes adapting this calculator framework to model a representative aqueous fluid system for the same drilling application. The potential environmental benefit achieved by using an aqueous fluid can be quantified by directly comparing the emissions profiles across all lifecycle stages. Aqueous fluids are expected to reduce impacts through lower transportation volumes, less energy-intensive preparation, enhanced drilling performance, minimized rig time, and more straightforward waste management. While comprehensive data is still needed for the complete comparative analysis, the inherent nature of aqueous fluids strongly suggests they offer a viable pathway to lowering the carbon footprint associated with drilling activities. This study establishes the foundational methodology to evaluate such environmental impacts rigorously, enabling operators to make informed decisions when selecting drilling fluid systems to improve sustainability practices.

Abstract This study examines the geospatial locations of energy stations within Port-Harcourt Aba expressway to ascertain their locations if it conforms to standard practice. It also took into cognizance the in-situ monitoring of the various air pollutants within the vicinity of the energy stations. The study location is in Obio/Akpor and Port Harcourt city Local Government Area, Rivers State. The result of the proximity analysis reveals that the energy stations do not fall within the standard of 15metres specified by DPR (Department of Petroleum Resources). The various pollutants examined are PM 10, PM 2.5, carbon monoxide (Co), Nitrogen Dioxide (No2), ground level ozone (O3), and sulphur dioxide (S02). The result reveals that their concentrations values fall within the permissible limit as specified by NESREA except (C02) which is the primary pollutant was extremely highly than the permissible limit of 400 (ppm). This can be attributed to the influx of vehicles that buys fuel from the energy stations. The concentration of (C02) poses a serious health effect on the pump attendants due to their constant inhaling of the pollutants. The study concludes that energy stations should be cited at the approved DPR standard of (15metres) and actionable measures should be put in place to aid in the reduction of CO2 within the energy stations. Finally, the study recommends that there should be strict compliance to DPR standard in the siting of energy stations.

Abstract Current liquid sorbents for CO2 capture in post-combustion gas mixtures are based on aqueous solutions of aliphatic alkanolamines, which react with carbon dioxide by forming carbamates. Regeneration of sorbents is therefore energy intensive. The present work shows that aromatic amines can be used advantageously, because of their lower energy demand. CO2 capture experiments are carried out in batch mode, allowing gas to flow into the headspace of a reactor at various pressures and temperatures. Sorption kinetics by the present liquid sorbents are measured by integrating data from a mass flow meter. Tests were conducted under two different pressures (10-20 bar) and temperatures (10-20 °C) for 4M water-ethanol solutions of the aromatic amines. CO2 sorption profiles show faster capture kinetics as the temperature and pressure, independently, increase. Alkylated derivatives are generally faster at sorbing CO2, while sorption amounts at the equilibrium are comparable for several species. Desorption/regeneration of sorbents occurred at a much lower temperature (30 °C) than with common alkanolamines. 80% saturation of some of the sorbents is very fast, being reached in 1-3 minutes. Loading capacities up to 200 mg CO2/g of sorbent solution (4.5 mol CO2/kg solvent) were observed. Energy demand calculations show how the present systems are much cheaper than those based on carbamate-forming sorbents. We propose that such energy savings may be invested in pressurization of a post-combustion flue gas, leading to the possibility of application of imidazole-based sorbents to this industrial process. In fact, it is shown that the energy burden added for pressurization is more than overcome by the drastic reduction of the sorption/desorption temperatures. This cooler process also decreases the corrosion potential of the sorbent.

Abstract Sustainable development demands a fundamental transformation in energy generation, requiring innovations in subsurface management and geomaterial manufacturing. Cement plays a crucial role in facilitating this transition on two fronts. Firstly, as carbon dioxide (CO2) storage emerges as a promising strategy for mitigating emissions from large-scale industrial operations, its effective implementation relies not only on identifying suitable reservoirs with proven storage capacities but also on the performance of wellbore cement in providing long-term mechanical and hydraulic sealing. Secondly, the production of cement demands an environmentally conscious alternative to traditional Portland cement (PC) capable of both curbing CO2 emissions during the calcination process and bolstering the resilience of wellbore casing under pressure. Our research adopts a dual-pronged approach. We investigate the chemical interactions between supercritical CO2 and cement, analyzing their effects on cement porosity, permeability, strength, and failure mechanisms. Concurrently, we explore the properties of a low-carbon cement formulation derived from a volcanic blend composition. This formulation aims to reduce reliance on limestone as a primary resource, thus cutting emissions and minimizing reactivity with CO2. Our findings reveal that exposure to CO2 triggers well-documented carbonation reactions in Portland-based cement, commonly used in older and legacy wells. These reactions lead to calcite mineralization within the cement pore space, resulting in decreased porosity, reduced permeability, and increased strength. While these outcomes show promise for effectively sealing stored CO2 and furthering sustainability goals, it is crucial to note that increased strength does not necessarily correlate with improved toughness. Our findings underscore that calcite mineralization exacerbates cement brittleness and damage, evident from crack propagation detected through acoustic emissions (AEs) monitoring. Over time, crack development worsens fluid flow and heightens the susceptibility of calcite to dissolution in the presence of acidic fluids generated by continuous CO2 injection. Conversely, the volcanic-based formulation yielded lightweight cement samples with density ranging from 1100 kg/m3 to 1300 kg/m3 and a remarkable CO2 reduction of up to 85%. The microstructure resulting from the volcanic blend composition enables ductile mechanical behavior, with peak strength and permeability ranging between 30MPa to 46MPa and 680μD to 30μD, respectively, thus appearing promising when cement is exposed to CO2.

Abstract Cement manufacture is a significant source of carbon dioxide (Co2) emissions in the building sector. Thus reduction in carbon footprint is need of the day which can be achieved through use of high volume flyash (HVFA) concrete mix which helps in reducing the cement demand in the concrete mix. HVFA mixes offers better life cycle assessment than the conventional Portland cement concrete mix (OPC). In this study, concrete mix of grade M30 to M70 with OPC mix without flyash was compared with the HVFA mix which had 40% and 50%flyash replacement. The mechanical behaviour such as compressive strength in HVFA mix was less as compared with pure OPC mix on an average by 4 MPA also the rapid chloride penetration (RCPT) was found less than when compared with pure OPC mix for all grades of concrete. For M30 grade of concrete the RCPT values were 1412 coulomb which was less as compared with OPC mix, while the RCPT values with HVFA mix for M35, M40 M45, M50, M60 and M70 was 1412 coulomb, 1317 coulomb, 1056 coulomb, 1182 coulomb, 990 coulomb, 870 coulomb 991 coulomb respectively. When compared to the HVFA mix, the pure OPC mix’s water absorption showed greater values. M30 grade of concrete the water absorption was 31% less than pure OPC. Similarly for M35, M40, M45, M50, M60 and M70 was 12%, 34% 5%, 34%, 38% and 53% respectively. Hence HVFA mix though had strength less than OPC mixes but delivered excellent durability parameters.

Our current research includes treating the toxicity of wastewater using green algae, and this is done through a set of steps that involve withdrawing nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater for algae to benefit from them in their growth, leading to a clear reduction in their concentrations. Since the algae depend on self-feeding for their living so that they carry out the process of photosynthesis, they thus consume carbon dioxide that is produced from the process of decomposing organic carbon in wastewater by the action of bacteria that work on consuming the oxygen liberated from the algae during the process of photosynthesis, and this leads to reducing carbon dioxide emissions on the one hand and reduces the requirements for ventilation necessary for the work of bacteria on the other hand. Quantitative analysis illustrates that 1.83 grams of carbon dioxide are consumed for every gram of algal biomass. This study highlights the effectiveness of algae as a sustainable and green method for treating wastewater.

Summary Mixing of incompatible injection and formation brines leads to the deposition of inorganic sulfate scales such as barite, celestite, and anhydrite in and around production wells. This process is well documented in seawater-flooded clastic reservoirs. One technique to avoid the resulting formation damage is to remove sulfate from seawater before injection using nanofiltration; however, this process is costly. We identify in this paper that it may not always be necessary in higher-temperature carbonate reservoirs. In this paper, we describe the use of reactive transport reservoir simulation to investigate the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) partitioning and changes in pH, ionic concentrations, and temperature on carbonate reactivity and the sulfate scaling risk in waterflooded carbonate reservoirs. Dissolution and precipitation of calcite, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, barite, and celestite are all modeled and found to be coupled through (various) common ion effects. The produced brine compositions are used to calculate the saturation ratios (SRs) and mass of precipitate that may form in the production system. Sensitivity to mineral reaction kinetics, particularly for the dolomite reactions, is accounted for. Results identify that there is a strong relationship between calcite dissolution and dolomite (or other calcium/magnesium carbonate mineral) precipitation reactions, which drive each other and are affected by the availability of CO2 in the residual oil phase. This evolves over time, and as the thermal front propagates, impacts the concentration of calcium and magnesium in the brines traversing the reservoir. Temperature changes around the injection wellbore impact CO2 and mineral solubilities. The concentration of calcium in the displaced brine mix is thus determined more by contact with rock and temperature than by mixing between injection and formation brines. Depending on location relative to the thermal front, this may lead to gypsum or anhydrite precipitation, thereby stripping sulfate out of the injection brine. Thus, the sulfate scaling risk at the production wells is significantly reduced by this sulfate depletion process: The sulfate is stripped out of the seawater as it warms up in the reservoir before it mixes extensively with the formation water and significantly before any mixture of the two brines reaches the production zone. Thus, any loss of permeability is restricted to deep within the reservoir, where the pore volume (PV) that can accommodate mineral precipitation is very large. In this work, we identify that for carbonate reservoirs above 90–100°C, stripping of sulfate due to coupled mineral reactions may reduce or eliminate the need for use of a sulfate reduction plant (SRP). The process is modeled for the first time, accounting for the impact of CO2 partitioning and thermal front propagation. Knowledge of the kinetics of calcium/magnesium carbonate precipitation is shown to be critical in predicting the extent of sulfate depletion.

This study aims to provide the first report on the soluble and polyphenolic profiles of “Farmacista Honorati” (FH) persimmons, which is a marketed cultivar with no existing data on its nutraceutical value. Total soluble tannins (TSTs) and major soluble (poly)phenols in FH fruits before and after post-harvest commercial treatments with carbon dioxide and ethylene were analyzed. Fruits at commercial harvest had a TST content of 1022 ± 286 mg GAL/100 g d.w. Whereas, after deastringency treatments, an 85% and 83% reduction were observed for carbon dioxide- and ethylene-treated fruits, respectively. Carbon dioxide treatment resulted in the insolubilization of tannins around comparable values in most fruit cultivars, despite the variable soluble tannin content in untreated fruit. By targeted metabolomic profiling, nineteen (poly)phenolic substances were quantified in the investigated untreated and treated fruits. Gallic acid (99 mg/100 g d.w.), (+)-catechin (1.8 mg/100 g d.w.), ellagic acid (1.2 mg/100 g d.w.), and (−)-epicatechin (1.1 mg/100 g d.w.) were the predominant compounds in the untreated FH samples. After the application of post-harvest treatments, a non-nutraceutical relevant decrease of 8-19% in the targeted (poly)phenolic content was generally observed. Ethylene induced the most significant reduction in the individual (poly)phenolic compounds in the FH fruits.

A new approach for the thermal reduction of tin dioxide (SnO2) in the carbon/sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) system is demonstrated. The process of tin smelting was experimentally optimized by adjusting the smelting temperature and amounts of the chemical components used for the thermal reduction of SnO2. The numbers obtained are consistent with the thermodynamic characteristics of the system and molar fractions of reactants derived from the proposed mechanism of the SnO2 thermal reduction process. They reveal that the maximum yield of tin is obtained if masses of C, Na2SO3 and SnO2 are approximately in the ratio 1:2:3 and the temperature is set to 1050 °C. The key role in the suggested mechanism is the thermal decomposition of Na2SO3. It was deduced from the available experimental data that the produced sulfur dioxide undergoes carbothermic reduction to carbonyl sulfide—an intermediate product involved in the bulk reduction of SnO2. Replacing sodium sulfite with sodium sulfate, sodium sulfide and even elemental sulfur practically terminated the production of metallic tin. The kinetic analysis was focused on the determination of the reaction orders for the two crucial reactants involved in the smelting process.

Abstract It is now widely recognized that net zero by 2050 transition cannot be achieved without major reductions in carbon emissions from the building and the related infrastructure development sector including both from building operations and from carbon embedded in construction materials. Collectively the construction and operation of buildings are one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Reductions need to occur quickly since buildings constructed today will likely still be in service well beyond 2070 and most existing buildings will remain in service in 2050. Transitioning to net zero buildings are also likely to have a significant impact on several areas of natural resources law including land use, construction and infrastructure development law, energy security, environment, zoning, procurement, and energy solidarity. This chapter focuses on the legal and policy challenges in pursuing net zero buildings strategies that can dramatically reduce the role of buildings in climate change.

Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) devices are increasingly used in treating acute-on-chronic respiratory failure caused by chronic lung diseases. There are no large studies that investigated safety, efficacy, and the independent association of prognostic variables to survival that could define the role of ECCO2R devices in such patients. This multicenter, multinational, retrospective study investigated the efficacy, safety of a single ECCO2R device (Hemolung) in patients with acute on chronic respiratory failure and identified variables independently associated with intensive care unit (ICU) survival. The primary outcome was improvement in blood gasses with the use of Hemolung. Secondary outcomes included reduction in tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, survival to ICU discharge, and complication profile. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify variables that are independently associated with ICU survival. A total of 62 patients were included. There was a significant improvement in pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) along with a reduction in respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation with Hemolung therapy. The complication profile did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariable analysis identified the duration of Hemolung therapy to be independently associated with survival to ICU discharge (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.040-1.518; p = 0.01).

Scenarios to stabilize global climate and meet international climate agreements require rapid reductions in human carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, often augmented by substantial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. While some ocean-based removal techniques show potential promise as part of a broader CDR and decarbonization portfolio, no marine approach is ready yet for deployment at scale because of gaps in both scientific and engineering knowledge. Marine CDR spans a wide range of biotic and abiotic methods, with both common and technique-specific limitations. Further targeted research is needed on CDR efficacy, permanence, and additionality as well as on robust validation methods—measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification—that are essential to demonstrate the safe removal and long-term storage of CO 2 . Engineering studies are needed on constraints including scalability, costs, resource inputs, energy demands, and technical readiness. Research on possible co-benefits, ocean acidification effects, environmental and social impacts, and governance is also required.

Abstract The Aeolian archipelago is known worldwide for its volcanic activity and hydrothermal emissions, of mainly carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide are minor components of these emissions which together can feed large quantities of bacteria and archaea that do contribute to the removal of these notorious greenhouse gases. Here we analyzed the metagenome of samples taken from the Levante bay on Vulcano Island, Italy. Using a gene-centric approach, the hydrothermal vent community appeared to be dominated by Proteobacteria , and Sulfurimonas was the most abundant genus. Metabolic reconstructions highlight a prominent role of formaldehyde oxidation and the reverse TCA cycle in carbon fixation. [NiFe]-hydrogenases seemed to constitute the preferred strategy to oxidize H 2 , indicating that besides H 2 S, H 2 could be an essential electron donor in this system. Moreover, the sulfur cycle analysis showed a high abundance and diversity of sulfate reduction genes underpinning the H 2 S production. This study covers the diversity and metabolic potential of the microbial soil community in Levante bay and adds to our understanding of the biogeochemistry of volcanic ecosystems.

Air pollution is the condition of air that is contaminated by the presence of materials, substances or polluting components. One of the causes of air pollution is the combustion or inseneration process because the residue of the process can be released into the air. Based on ISPU, there are five main pollutants, namely: carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), surface ozone (O3), and dust particles (PM10). This study was conducted to reduce the emission of gases. The use of modified cyclone with adsorbent pipe tube from cocoa husk can increase the efficiency of combustion results with adsorption pipe tube modified cyclone. From the results of the study it was found that emissions from incineration can be controlled with APPU in the form of a cyclone. The use of cyclone alone can reduce NOX and CO levels with a reduction in NOX emissions to 53% and CO to 96%. Both emission reductions are in line with the quality standards. However, the use of adsorption pipe tubes showed better efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract High‐entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted significant attention for electrocatalytic energy conversion by virtue of their promisingly high efficiency, stability, and low cost. Recently, encouraging progress has been made in tuning the structure and composition of HEAs used in electrolyzers and fuel cells. However, the understanding on the synthetic methods and the structure‐property‐performance relationship of well‐defined HEAs nanostructures is still inadequate. To gain insight into the future research directions on HEAs for electrocatalysis, in this paper, the synthetic methods commonly used to obtain well‐defined HEAs nanostructures (0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets/nanoplates, 3D nanoporous structures, and other three‐dimensional morphologies) are first summarized. Then, the authors discuss the application of well‐defined HEAs nanostructures in several typical electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and formic acid oxidation reaction. Finally, a practical perspective on the future research directions on well‐defined HEAs nanostructured electrocatalysts is provided.

Introduction: Execution of COVID-19 lockdown measures caused variations in air pollution worldwide. This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 stringency measures on the spatio-temporal dynamics of air pollution in Mumbai, India, using a comprehensive two-and-a-half-year pandemic period dataset. Materials and methods: We classified the pandemic period into 7 phases and 21 sub-phases based on the severity of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) Stringency Index (SI). Optimized Hotspot analysis (OHS) and Ordinary Least Square Regression models explored the spatio-temporal fluctuations and the effect of stringency measures on air quality. Results: The R2 value varied; with the best model R2 of 0.61 for Particulate Matters (PM10) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and lowest of 0.23 for Sulfur dioxide (SO2). A 10-point increase in SI caused a 3-7% reduction in air pollutants. Substantial reduction in average PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and Carbon monoxide (CO) was observed throughout the COVID-19 phases. Meteorology and SI collectively caused maximum reduction of 82.6%, 72.7%, 53.8%, 52.2%, 49.1%, 28.4% for NO2, PM2.5, PM10, NH3, CO, and SO2 respectively, during complete or extreme lockdown phases. Except SO2, seasonality significantly influenced the pollutant concentrations. Winter was the worst period while monsoon was the best. OHS identified central Mumbai wards as hotspots and areas close to the national park as coldspots. Conclusion: PM10, NO2 and CO were more affected by SI measures than NH3 and SO2.

Abstract Escalations in economic development and the concomitant upsurge in social globalization (SG) in the largest economies have enhanced the utilization of fossil fuels, which in turn has stimulated carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Given that reducing global warming is one of the essential means to disrupt climate change and attain sustainable development, this study examines the interlinkages between SG, energy transition (ENTR), international tourism (ITU), and CO 2 emissions. As environmental issues are widespread in the largest economies, this investigation analyzed the data from the 10 largest economies using the Method of Moments Quantiles Regression (MM‐QR) from 1995 to 2020. The study found that ENTR plays a significant role in decreasing emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. Alongside this, increasing social globalization also curbs CO 2 emissions and facilitates environmental sustainability. Apart from this, the findings demonstrate a progressively increasing contribution of ITU and economic growth to enhancing environmental degradation. Furthermore, results indicated that carbon emissions are not influenced by reductions in political risks in the member nations. Finally, policies to support environmental sustainability are discussed.

The presence of solvents can significantly alter the reaction kinetics of catalytic conversions, yet the mechanisms of the solvent effect remain widely debated and could greatly vary between different chemistries. We use vapor phase Hofmann elimination of tert-butylamine (TBA) to systematically investigate how solvents participate catalyzed reaction over Brønsted acid sites of solid acid catalysts and affect a catalytic cycle. Twenty commonly used organic and inorganic solvents were tested to investigate the relationship between solvent identity and their influence on reaction kinetics. Kinetic measurements showed a significant and reversible inhibition in rates of Hofmann elimination in the presence of every tested solvent, with the degrees of reduction vary from less than 10% for non-polar solvents (carbon dioxide, benzene, hexane) to more than 90 % (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, acetonitrile), which was found to exhibit a roughly linear against the molecular dipole moment of solvents. Additionally, the degree of reduction is not affected by the size of molecule as the carbon chain length increases, but is negatively related to the degree of substitution by alkyl group on the α-carbon as well as halogen atom on the β-carbon. Despite the significant kinetic inhibition and a 30 kJ mol-1 increase in the measured apparent activation energies, the temperature programmed surface reaction profiles performed with pre-adsorbed TBA with feeding of acetonitrile and methanol showed no change in the peak temperature from the catalyst without solvent feed. Cooperative adsorption complex formed between the surface tert-butylammonium and solvent molecule adsorbed on a neighboring framework oxygen, which is far less reactive towards Hofmann elimination, is proposed to be responsible for the observed rate inhibition. Also, the stability of adsorption complex formation is found to be affected by the proton affinity of solvent, as revealed by the kinetic modeling of experimental rate measurements.

As the imperative to address climate change becomes more pressing, there is an increasing focus on limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 °C by the century's end relative to 1990 levels. This compels economy-wide transformations in energy infrastructure, land use, and sustainability policies. During the recent Conference of Parties (COP28), nations committed to tripling renewable energy generation to a minimum of 11,000 GW by 2030 and increasing the global annual energy efficiency from 2 % to 4 % annually until 2030. Additionally, the Food and Agricultural Organization introduced a roadmap to transition the Agri-food system from a net emitter to a carbon sink. The role of carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) has become crucial in achieving climate targets, especially in the context of achieving net zero emissions by mid-century and removing residual emissions post-mid-century. This paper assesses the impact of these policies on emissions, energy structure, land use, and global warming temperature. The findings indicate that implementing the COP28 pledges and FAO roadmap leads to a warming temperature of 2 °C, falling short of the ambitious 1.5 °C temperature limit. Likewise, we see that shutting down fossil plants drives significant emissions and temperature reduction even without novel CDRs. The modeled result shows that Agricultural soil carbon and biochar contribute 47-58 % share of the total CDR deployed in the scenario. In conclusion, CDRs can expedite climate goals but must complement emission reduction efforts; hence, the transition away from fossil fuels should prompt the development of detailed roadmaps. Also, Also, more global efforts should be placed on nature-based CDR methods, as they offer diverse co-benefits.

Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing air pollution represent two pressing and interwoven environmental challenges. While international carbon markets, such as the European Union emissions trading system (EU ETS), have demonstrated their effectiveness in curbing carbon emissions (CO    2   ), their indirect impact on hazardous co-pollutants remains understudied. This study investigates how key toxic air pollutants—sulfur dioxide (SO    2   ), fine particulate matter (PM     2.5    ), and nitrogen oxides (NO    x   )—evolved after the introduction of the EU ETS with a comparative analysis of regulated and unregulated sectors. Leveraging the generalized synthetic control method, we offer an ex post analysis of how the EU ETS and concurrent emission standards may have jointly generated sizable pollution reductions in regulated sectors between 2005 and 2021. We provide an aggregate assessment that these pollution reductions could translate into large health co-benefits, potentially in the hundreds of billions of Euros, even when bounding the effect of emission standards. These order-of-magnitude estimates underscore key implications for policy appraisal and motivate further microlevel research around the health co-benefits of carbon abatement.

Ridesplitting has the potential to enhance transportation efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions from ridesourcing services by matching multiple shared rides to the same trip. However, an inappropriate matching can significantly diminish the environmental performance of ridesplitting. This study aims to propose a shared ride matching approach to low-carbon and electrified ridesplitting. Firstly, feasible ridesplitting trips within time constraints are identified and represented using a shareability network. Subsequently, the CO2 emission reduction of each feasible ridesplitting trip is calculated by comparing it with its corresponding single ride alternative. To maximize the total CO2 emission reduction from ridesplitting trips, an optimization model for shared ride matching is established and solved using a graph-theoretic algorithm. Additionally, a priority assignment policy is designed to preferentially assign available electric vehicles to feasible ridesplitting trips that have greater potential for emission reductions. Comparative experiments conducted in Chengdu, China show that the proposed model can achieve higher levels of CO2 emission reduction without compromising service quality in ridesplitting operations. Furthermore, significant improvements in emission reductions can be achieved by implementing the priority assignment policy instead of a random assignment policy for electrified ridesplitting trips, particularly when electric vehicles are limited. Finally, the effects of maximum tolerable delay and electric vehicle penetration are further analyzed to provide valuable insights for government authorities and ridesourcing companies aiming to enhance both the economic and environmental benefits associated with ridesplitting.

A three-dimensional (3-D) physical-biogeochemical-carbon cycle coupled model is used to investigate the interannual variability of the air-sea carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) flux ( F CO 2 ) in the Northern Yellow Sea (NYS) from 2009 to 2018. The verification of the model indicate that the simulation results for multiple variables exhibit consistency and fit well with the observed data. The study show that although the multi-year average F CO 2 in the NYS is close to the source-sink balance, there are obvious interannual differences between different years. In particular, a relatively strong source of atmospheric CO 2 (1.0 mmol m –2 d –1 ) is exhibited in 2014, while a relatively strong sink of atmospheric CO 2 (–0.7 mmol m –2 d –1 ) emerges in 2016. Mechanism analysis indicates that the abnormally high temperature is the main controlling factor for the relatively high CO 2 efflux rate in the NYS in 2014, while the abnormally low dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration is the main factor contributing to the relatively high CO 2 influx rate in 2016. Further analysis reveals that the primary reason for the low DIC concentration since the onset of winter in 2016 is the high net decrease rate of DIC in the NYS in 2015, influenced by net community production in the summer and advection processes during the autumn. The abnormally high primary production during the summer of 2015 results in the excessive reduction of DIC concentration through biological processes. In addition, due to the strong northeasterly wind event in November 2015, low-concentration-DIC water from the Yellow Sea (YS) extends into the Bohai Sea (BS). This further leads to higher DIC flux from the NYS into the BS in the upper mixed layer and increases the inflow of low-concentration-DIC water from the Southern Yellow Sea (SYS) into the NYS. These ultimately result in the abnormal reduction of DIC concentration in the upper mixed layer of the NYS during the autumn of 2015. This study enriches our understanding of interannual variability of F CO 2 in the NYS, which will not only help to further reveal the variations of F CO 2 under human activities and climate change, but also provide useful information for guiding the comprehensive assessment of the carbon budget.

The conventional air conditioning system used in high-speed railways has limitations in heating performance and environmental impact, necessitating the exploration of alternative refrigerants. The transcritical CO2 system has gained popularity due to its exceptional heating efficiency and environmental benefits. This study aims to evaluate the energy and environmental potentials for transcritical CO2 systems in high-speed trains based on four-vertical-and-four-horizontal railway lines within different climatic regions of China. A high-fidelity transcritical CO2 system model was first developed and validated through experiments. Then, a comprehensive energy and environmental evaluation method was proposed and applied to the four-vertical-and-four-horizontal railway lines. The results indicated that the transcritical CO2 system had a superior heating performance and competitive cooling performance based on daily and annual operations. Furthermore, the transcritical CO2 system exhibited significant environmental advantages with lower total life cycle climate performance for all lines, with an average emissions reduction ratio of 17.6% and a maximum emissions reduction ratio of 26.98%. These findings highlight the competitive energy performance and outstanding environmental benefits offered by transcritical CO2 systems as promising alternatives to air conditioning systems in railway transportation.

The bioelectroreduction of CO2 to value-added chemical commodities, by bioeletrochemical system (BES), represents a promising approach for alleviating both energy crisis and global warming. Although a wide variety of studies have been undertaken to improve efficiency of CO2 bioelectroconversion and speculate electron pathways of electroactive microorganisms, the underlying mechanisms of CO2 bioelectroconversion are still not fully understood. A much more comprehensive understanding of electron utilization mechanisms would be helpful to the practical applications of bioelectrosynthesis. Here, the working principles in bio-electrochemical CO2 reduction were summarized, and the change of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and dynamics for CO2 bioelectroconversion were analyzed to evaluate the potential effects of external microenvironment changes (e.g., operational conditions, supply of mediators/conductive materials, electro-activity of key functional microbes, arious redox potentials of cellular redox compounds, etc.) ono CO2 bioelectroconversion and the electron transfer chains of bioelectrocatalysis. The potential electron transfer mechanisms for CO2 bioelectroconversion to multi-carbon commodities were further summarized. Particularly, the functional proteins and genes associated with the metabolic pathway of CO2 electroreduction were discussed. Finally, taking the CO2-reducing pathways of methanogenic archaea as an example, the electron transfer pathways were illustrated in details, and the future perspectives for the possible improvement and research interests in bioelectrosynthesis of CO2 capture and use were elaborated. This paper reviews the thermodynamics and electron transfer mechanisms of CO2 bioelectroconversion, and provided the guidance for the practical implementations of employing and electrochemically manipulating electroactive functional microorganisms to electrocatalyze CO2 to value-added low-carbon commodities.

Abstract CO2-hydrate formation in porous media diminishes injectivity, which is crucial for sustained high-rate CO2 injection in geological sequestration, posing risks throughout the value chain. Confined water in small pores induces a shift in the CO2-hydrate envelope, especially in high-porosity, low-permeability chalk structures. This study aims to establish a CO2-hydrate envelope in chalk and explore the impact of brine salinity and other gases on hydrate formation. Experiments are conducted using a well-designed coreflooding rig, where a core sample is mounted with separate brine and CO2 inlet lines to minimize hydrate formation outside the porous media. Precise temperature monitoring and simultaneous injection of CO2 and water guarantee both phases' presence, with temperature reduction leading to CO2-hydrate formation. CO2-hydrate formation is tracked through pressure difference and electrical resistivity responses within the core. Preliminary findings demonstrate the repeatability and reproducibility of results, with observed heat release during hydrate initiation and subsequent temperature increase. Significant differential pressure increase indicates injectivity loss during CO2-hydrate formation, mitigated by elevated temperature, restoring core permeability. Temperature-dependent variations in hydrate formation and dissipation are noted, with ongoing experiments exploring the impact of brine salinity and non-CO2 gases on the hydrate envelope. Restricting water into small pores alters the CO2-hydrate envelope's stability, particularly in high-porosity, low-permeability chalk structures, warranting careful consideration due to limited experimental data available in the literature.

Summary The change in wettability of limestone reservoirs from oil-wet toward gas-wet can enhance crude oil production during immiscible CO2 injection. Therefore, in this research, we investigated the impact of wettability alteration to CO2-wet on oil recovery factor via dissolution of fluorine-free, CO2-philic, nonionic surfactants such as C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 in CO2. Based on the cloudpoint measurements, the dissolution pressures of nonionic surfactants in supercritical CO2 ranged between 2,100 psi and 2,700 psi (below the reservoir pressure, i.e., 3,000 psi) at reservoir temperature, 65°C; these pressures are commensurate with CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pressures. Also, the C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 can reduce the CO2-oil interfacial tension (IFT). Moreover, the CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solutions can change the limestone wettability from strongly oil-wet (Θ ~ 20o) to intermediate CO2/oil-wet (Θ = 95o and 110o) at reservoir conditions. The relative permeability curves also confirmed it by changing the curvature to the left and decreasing the residual oil saturation in both cases of CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solutions. The 20.8% and 13.1% additional oil recoveries were achieved during the 30,000 ppm CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solution scenarios, respectively, relative to the pure CO2 injection scenario. These nonionic surfactants are not able to make CO2-in-oil foam; therefore, wettability alteration and perhaps IFT reduction are the dominant mechanisms of EOR induced by the dissolution of nonionic surfactants in CO2, instead of CO2 mobility control. Consequently, the dissolution of fluorine-free, oxygenated, CO2-philic, nonionic surfactants (such as C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19) in CO2 at 30,000 ppm concentration can be a well-qualified candidate for altering the limestone wettability to intermediate CO2-oil-wet during the immiscible CO2 injection.

Abstract The high consumption of fossil fuels and concomitant contamination of the environment have promoted the search for new, low‐cost, and cleaner energy sources to satisfy the current energy demand around the world, decreasing the levels of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. One of the promising strategies to facilitate the generation of renewable energy involves solar‐driven chemical reactions, by using photocatalysts with improved sunlight absorption and carrier transfer abilities. Lead‐free halide perovskites (LFHPs) are good candidates, showing mesmerizing optical features, modulable band structure, oxidizing/reducing capability, and less toxicity compared to their Pb‐analogous. However, the literature reporting the photo(electro)chemical (PEC) properties of the LFHPs‐based materials for solar energy production is scarce. This review describes the current state‐of‐the‐art exhibiting the influence of the dimensionality, chemical composition and the formation of heterojunctions based on LFHPs on their photo(electro)activity for conducting solar‐driven hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction, and the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants to obtain added‐value chemicals. In this way, it is also included the main challenges to be faced. Furthermore, we address some potential LFHPs to be explored in PEC systems, opening up the gamut of possibilities to consolidate the solar‐to‐chemical transformation as an innovative alternative to favor environmentally friendly energy production.

Vegetables are the high valued crops for human kind as it is rich source of important vitamins and minerals especially, micronutrients and phytochemicals promote good health which helps in reduction of mal nutrition. It is also primarily responsible for the positive health effects due to contains generous amount of numerous antioxidant substances, carotenoids and phenolics. Farmers are favored for their economics due to the short period of cultivation. But due to world's biggest threat that is climate change, which has made vegetable cultivation vulnerable to extreme weather occurrences including high temperatures, unpredictable rainfall that causes flooding, and drought situations. Vegetables are very perishable in nature due to high water content i. e., 90%. Therefore, high temperature makes the cell damage and vulnerable for carry out all physiological and biological process inside the cell. Shedding down of flower bud and small fruit of solanaceous, cucurbitaceous and other types of vegetables also occur under high temperature stress. Not only drought, high temperature causes the cell damage but also erratic rainfall pattern results flood condition also dangerous for crop growth and development. In flooded condition, tomato plants produced ethylene hormone which is detrimental for fruit quality due to absence of oxygen. Increases in carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and other harmful gases as a result of human activity are the primary cause of climate change. The majority of carbon dioxide is produced by burning of fossil fuels with emission of harmful industrial gases, methane is produced by raising livestock, and nitrous oxide is produced by using inorganic fertilizer. According to FAO, worlds vegetable production is get lowered around 18.68% due to adverse climatic effect. As a result, by 2050, an estimated 175 million more people could have zinc deficiency and 122 million more could have protein deficiency. People in poverty, who rely primarily on plant sources for sustenance, will be most affected by these effects. Therefore, to mitigate climate change problem crop prototype or idiotype will be helpful in a 328significant manner. Climate change is not only responsible for abiotic stresses but also it is responsible for spreading of biotic stress. So, incorporation of new crop prototype or new cultivar in a farming system which are resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses along with rich in high nutrition content. Climate change is not only a potential for the future; it is a reality that we are all already experiencing. Therefore, in modern farming systems modified and new innovation technology regarding water, soil and food security can be helpful to cope up in the climate change issue.

Analyzing building loads and energy-efficient retrofits is crucial for effective energy management and sustainable development. Strengthening the identification and analysis of factors that impact energy consumption is informative for devising appropriate measures. In order to address the current limitations in analyzing building energy consumption, the present study proposes a combination of the arc elasticity analysis method with CO2 storage technology. By introducing sensitivity and arc mean elasticity indices, the cooling and heating loads of building energy consumption can be analyzed. Subsequently, a CO2 refrigeration system and compression process can be designed to optimize the storage of CO2 and facilitate its role in energy conservation and reduction of energy consumption. Thus, the research aims to fulfill the potential of CO2 in promoting energy efficiency and reducing consumption. The study utilized software simulation and experimental analysis to examine the impact of the proposed method. The findings revealed a positive correlation between the heat transfer coefficient and the building's annual heat load. In addition, the maximum data variation of the building's cold load was a mere 0.05 per cent, and the relative discrepancy between the software simulation and the actual load values was less than 10 per cent. The exterior building's total cold load value showed a difference of more than 25 per cent when cooled with CO2 intervention compared to the non-intervention result. Furthermore, the building's maximum load reduction reached 3.4 per cent when uniformly varying the thickness of the insulation layer from 40 mm to 100 mm. The proposed method demonstrates a positive impact on building energy sensitivity analysis. Its energy loss design for various parts of the building could offer useful references for practical engineering designs.

Abstract Incorporating reprocessing, recycling, and sustainable processes and materials is essential for a circular economy. Reprocessing and recycling are related since both help minimize wastage and produce a sustainable regenerative economy. However, polymers might undergo degradation depending on the recycling process, reducing their lifespan. In this study, polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) undergoes repetitive reprocessing under varied temperatures, times, and shear rates to investigate the evolution of mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. Furthermore, foaming experiments are conducted using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 ) on reprocessed samples to examine changes in the properties and morphology of the foam. The significance of reprocessing PBAT is divided into environmental, temperature, and processing effects. Environmental conditions impact the results where no oxidation effects are noticed in the 2‐hour test, while 7 days of humidity exposure lead to a tenfold reduction in polymer viscosity. Different processing techniques reduce the molecular weight of PBAT and alter its polydispersity. Specifically, the number average molecular weight ( M n ) decreases from an initial 53 to 37 kDa after processes like extrusion or mixing. However, elongation at break and ultimate strength of PBAT remain unchanged after high‐shear extrusion processing. Additionally, PBAT foam morphology evolves over 5 cycles, leading to smaller pores and reducing compressive modulus.

Incorporating outstanding flame retardancy and electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) into polymers is a pressing requirement for practical utilization. In this study, we first employed the principles of microencapsulation and electrostatic interaction-driven self-assembly to encapsulate polyethyleneimine (PEI) molecules and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets on the surface of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), forming a double-layer-encapsulated structure of ammonium polyphosphate (APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx). Subsequently, flame-retardant thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites were fabricated by melting the flame-retardant agent with TPU. Afterwards, by using air-assisted thermocompression technology, we combined a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film with flame-retardant TPU composites to fabricate hierarchical TPU/APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx/rGO composites. We systematically studied the combustion behavior, flame retardancy, and smoke-suppression performance of these composite materials, as well as the flame-retardant mechanism of the expansion system. The results indicated a significant improvement in the interface interaction between APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx and the TPU matrix. Compared to pure TPU, the TPU/10APP@PEI@1TC composite exhibited reductions of 84.1%, 43.2%, 62.4%, and 85.2% in peak heat release rate, total heat release, total smoke release, and total carbon dioxide yield, respectively. The averaged EMI SE of hierarchical TPU/5APP@PEI@1TC/rGO also reached 15.53 dB in the X-band.

This study proposes an IoT architecture for monitoring emissions of polluting gases in vehicles, in response to the growing concern about air pollution and global warming. The architecture is based on a node equipped with DHT22, MQ9, and MQ135 sensors to capture temperature, humidity, and gas emissions, respectively. This node effectively communicates through the LTE network to send the data to the ThingSpeak platform. An analysis of CO2, CO, and CH4 pollution levels is conducted using the collected data. These data are validated through the technical review of a test vehicle. Subsequently, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained using a specific database of CO2 emissions from vehicles in Canada. As a result, a high R2 of 99.2% is achieved, along with low values of RMSE and MSE, indicating that the model is making accurate predictions and fits well to the training data. The ANN aims to predict CO2 emissions and verify CO2 data from the IoT network. The architecture demonstrates its capability for real-time monitoring and its potential to contribute to pollution reduction.

Through photosynthesis, forests absorb annually large amounts of atmospheric CO2. However, they also release CO2 back through respiration. These two, opposite in sign, large fluxes determine how much of the carbon is stored or released back into the atmosphere. The mean seasonal cycle (MSC) is an interesting metric that associates phenology and carbon (C) partitioning/allocation analysis within forest stands. Here, we applied the 3D-CMCC-FEM model and analyzed its capability to represent the main C-fluxes, by validating the model against observed data, questioning if the sink/source mean seasonality is influenced under two scenarios of climate change, in five contrasting European forest sites. We found the model has, under current climate conditions, robust predictive abilities in estimating NEE. Model results also predict a consistent reduction in the forest’s capabilities to act as a C-sink under climate change and stand-aging at all sites. Such a reduction is predicted despite the number of annual days as a C-sink in evergreen forests increasing over the years, indicating a consistent downward trend. Similarly, deciduous forests, despite maintaining a relatively stable number of C-sink days throughout the year and over the century, show a reduction in their overall annual C-sink capacity. Overall, both types of forests at all sites show a consistent reduction in their future mitigating potential.

Indonesia once applied net metering scheme for rooftop solar PV policy and was expected to be able to boost rooftop solar PV growth. A system dynamics approach is used in the research to develop an assessment model to evaluate the policies’ impact on residential rooftop solar PV system growth. A Causal Loop Diagram was established then transformed into Stock and Flow Diagram (SFD) using software Vensim PLE 10.1.3, which was used to simulate several policies’ scenarios related to residential rooftop solar PV adoption and CO2 emissions reduction. Ten scenarios were simulated in this study involving three groups of intervention: initial net metering tariff, reduction on initial solar PV cost, upper limit of ROI, and combination of initial net metering tariff and initial solar PV cost reduction. The simulations revealed that combination of increasing net metering tariff to 80% & initial cost reduction 30% has the highest potential solar PV installations, the highest CO2 emissions reduction, and the lowest accumulation cost of net metering in 2030. This study can be used as reference by the policy makers in Indonesia to formulate the optimum policy to boost rooftop solar PV growth as the simulations shows that residential rooftop solar PV with the right intervention can meet the government’s target of rooftop solar PV in 2030.

Abstract Using CO2 as a heat extraction medium from the subsurface offers several compelling advantages. These benefits result from CO2's distinct properties, notably its lower viscosity compared to water, as well as its pronounced density variations under varying pressures. Using CO2, it becomes possible to harness higher flow rates and density fluctuations to create a thermosyphon effect. These effects result in significant cost savings when contrasted with conventional water-based geothermal projects. To effectively predict and optimize the utilization of CO2 in geothermal applications, a precise understanding of CO2 properties and CO2-hydrocarbon gas-water mixtures become imperative. We conducted a series of highly accurate composition, viscosity and density measurements of CO2-methane-water mixtures. To prepare the mixtures, CO2 and CO2-methane gas was humidified in a saturating unit with accurate control of pressure and temperature. The humid gas was then directed through a capillary rheometer and an oscillating U-tube to measure viscosity and density of the mixtures. The outlet was equipped with a multi-stage gravimetric hygrometer to measure the water content and get the composition of the mixture. To ensure reproducibility and high quality of the data, the experiments were conducted repeatedly. Our research yielded data across a spectrum of CO2-methane-water properties. The measured water solubility in CO2 agreed with existing literature, while significantly extending the available dataset into the realm of high pressure and temperature conditions, pertinent to CO2 geothermal applications. This extension elucidated the non-linear relationship between solubility and pressure. Brine salinity has a noticeable impact on water solubility in CO2, causing up to a 15% reduction. Our investigation also established the relationship between water solubility and the CO2 content within CO2/Methane mixtures.Furthermore, our study precisely quantified the influence of CO2's water content on phase density and viscosity, revealing that while water's effect on CO2 density is modest, it engenders a substantial difference in CO2 viscosity, with variations of up to 9.1% observed between dry and water-saturated CO2. This paper addresses critical knowledge gaps pertaining to the modelling of CO2-methane-water fluids for CO2 geothermal applications. Our laboratory findings substantially enhance the dataset for water solubility in CO2 under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions. Furthermore, we shed light on the influence of brine salinity and gas composition, aspects that have not been extensively explored previously. Additionally, we unravel the impact of these properties on the density and viscosity of CO2-rich phases, enabling accurate predictions of volumetric and flow behaviour. Furthermore, this paper presents a comprehensive account of our experimental methodology and procedures. The results obtained have been rigorously cross verified with existing literature data, affirming the robustness of our chosen approach.

Background United States (U.S.) school meal programs serve billions of meals annually; however, little is known about their environmental impacts.Objective This study estimated the daily greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), water scarcity footprint (WSF), and food cost associated with the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) Programs and modeled the association of food substitutions and food waste reduction.Design A cross-sectional analysis of day-1 dietary intake in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2011-2018.Participants/Setting Participants included 796 children and adolescents from pre-Kindergarten to grade 12 who consumed breakfast or lunch on a weekday from a school cafeteria that met the minimum standard for an eligible meal. Main outcome measures The main outcomes were per capita nutrient intake, GHGE, WSF, and food cost.Statistical analyses performed Differences in mean impacts and between baseline and two modeled scenarios (food substitutions, food waste reductions) were evaluated using paired Wald tests.Results Daily per capita GHGE, WSF, and food cost for school food programs (NSLP + SBP) was 1.69 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) (95% CI: 1.55-1.84 kg CO2eq), 10.23 L eq×102 (9.20-11.27 L eq×102), and USD $3.70 ($3.39-4.00), respectively. Dairy (mainly cow’s milk) and protein foods (mainly beef) were the largest contributors to GHGE. Fruit was the largest contributor to the WSF. Modeled food substitutions significantly reduced GHGE by 14-25% and WSF by 11-14% for the school meal programs. There were mixed effects on food cost (-2% to 6% change) and nutrient intake. Modeled food waste reductions of 5% were associated with a 1% decrease in GHGE, WSF, and food costs.Conclusions The NSLP and SBP are critical to child nutrition, and food substitution and food waste reduction strategies can lower their environmental footprint with manageable impacts on nutrition quality.

Regulating the binding effect between the surface of an electrode material and reaction intermediates is essential in highly efficient CO2 electro‐reduction to produce high‐value multicarbon (C2+) compounds. Theoretical study reveals that lattice tensile strain in single‐component Cu catalysts can reduce the dipole–dipole repulsion between *CO intermediates and promotes *OH adsorption, and the high *CO and *OH coverage decreases the energy barrier for C–C coupling. In this work, Cu catalysts with varying lattice tensile strain were fabricated by electro‐reducing CuO precursors with different crystallinity, without adding any extra components. The as‐prepared single‐component Cu catalysts were used for CO2 electro‐reduction, and it is discovered that the lattice tensile strain in Cu could enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products effectively. Especially, the as‐prepared CuTPA catalyst with high lattice tensile strain achieves a FEC2+ of 90.9% at −1.25 V vs. RHE with a partial current density of 486.1 mA cm−2.

The excessive emission of CO2 has aroused increasingly serious environmental problems. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way to reduce CO2 concentration and simultaneously produce highly valued chemicals and fuels. Cuδ+ species are regarded as promising active sites to obtain multi‐carbon compounds in CO2RR, however, they are easily reduced to Cu0 during the reaction and fail to retain the satisfying selectivity for C2+ products. Herein, via a one‐step method, we synthesize Cu2(OH)2CO3 microspheres composed of nanosheets, which has achieved a superior Faraday efficiency for C2+ products as high as 76.29 % at ‐1.55 V vs. RHE in an H cell and 78.07 % at ‐100 mA cm‐2 in a flow cell. Electrochemical measurements, in situ Raman spectra and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectra as well as the theoretic calculation unveil that, compared with Cu(OH)2 and CuO, the dual O‐containing anionic groups (OH‐ and CO32‐) in Cu2(OH)2CO3 can effectively stabilize the Cuδ+ species, promote the adsorption and activation of CO2, boost the coverage of *CO and the coupling of *CO‐*COH, thus sustain the flourishment of C2+ products.

This study investigates the impact of various auxiliary cooling techniques on machinability, energy consumption, carbon emissions, and economic factors in the drilling process of AA7075T6 aluminium alloy using TiO2 and C-reinforced composites. The study employed various cooling conditions (dry, MQL, CO2, and hybrid MQL+CO2), with different cutting speeds and feed rates, to evaluate their effects on drilling characteristics. The findings indicated that the combined MQL and CO2 cooling notably enhanced the drilling process by reducing cutting forces by 32% and surface roughness by 65% compared to dry cutting. This synergy between lubrication and cooling significantly improves machinability, resulting in higher-quality machining outputs with smoother surfaces and more precise circularity. Energy analysis revealed that the MQL+CO2 method reduces energy consumption to 64% observed under dry conditions, underscoring its efficiency through better heat dissipation and reduced friction. Furthermore, this method demonstrates a significant reduction in carbon emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability. Economically, although initial costs associated with the implementation of cooling systems are higher, they are offset by reduced tool wear and energy costs, making it a viable solution for sustainable manufacturing practices.

To investigate the influence of Ag and the loading of Ni species, Ni-Ag type catalysts were synthesized with varying Ni/Ag ratios (1, 1.5 and 2) using the coprecipitation method. The catalysts were extensively characterized using various techniques such as TG-DSC-SM, XRD, ICP, BET, SEM-EDX and TPR and subsequently tested in the CH4/CO2 reaction without any pretreatment. Regardless of the ratio employed, a phase mixture containing NiO and Ag was observed after calcination under air between 600 °C and 1200 °C. SEM analysis confirmed the presence of a close interface between Ag and NiO. The specific surface area was found to be significantly higher for the catalyst with lower Ni content (R = 1). TPR analysis demonstrated that the inclusion of Ag facilitated the reduction of Ni at lower temperatures. XRD analyses of the spent catalyst confirmed catalyst reduction during the reaction. Among the samples, a catalyst with Ni/Ag = 1 exhibited superior catalytic activity without any pretreatment under a reduction atmosphere, in which case the conversions of methane and CO2 at 650 °C amounted to 38 and 45 mol%, respectively, with H2/CO = 0.7 and 71 mol% of H2. The presence of Ag species enhances the stability of the Ni catalyst and improves catalytic performance in the dry reforming of methane.

Abstract Background and Aims Long-term exposure over several days to Far-Red (FR) increases leaf expansion, while short-term exposure (minutes) may enhance the PSII operating efficiency (ϕPSII). The interaction between these responses at different time scales, and their impact on photosynthesis at whole-plant level is not well understood. Our study aimed to assess the effects of FR in an irradiance mimicking the spectrum of sunlight (referred to as artificial solar irradiance) both in the long and short-term, on whole-plant CO2 assimilation rates and in leaves at different positions in the plant. Methods Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants were grown under artificial solar irradiance conditions with either a severely reduced or normal fraction of FR (SUN(FR-) vs. SUN). To elucidate the interplay between the growth light treatment and the short-term reduction of FR, we investigated this interaction at both the whole-plant and leaf level. At whole-plant level, CO2 assimilation rates were assessed under artificial solar irradiance with a normal and a reduced fraction of FR. At the leaf level, the effects of removal and presence of FR (0FR and 60FR) during transition from high to low light on CO2 assimilation rates and chlorophyll fluorescence were evaluated in upper and lower leaves. Key Results SUN(FR-) plants had lower leaf area, shorter stems, and darker leaves than SUN plants. While reducing FR during growth did not affect whole-plant photosynthesis under high light intensity, it had a negative impact at low light intensity. Short-term FR removal reduced both plant and leaf CO2 assimilation rates, but only at low light intensity and irrespective of the growth light treatment and leaf position. Interestingly, the kinetics of ϕPSII from high to low light were accelerated by 60FR, with a larger effect in lower leaves of SUN than in SUN(FR-) plants. Conclusions Growing plants with a reduced amount of FR light lowers whole-plant CO2 assimilation rates at low light intensity through reduced leaf area, despite maintaining similar leaf-level CO2 assimilation to leaves grown with a normal amount of FR. The short-term removal of FR brings about significant but marginal reductions in photosynthetic efficiency at the leaf level, regardless of the long-term growth light treatment.

The LDR-50 low-temperature nuclear reactor is designed for the Finnish and European district heating markets, as an environmentally sustainable heating option for the 2030s. While the carbon footprint of conventional electricity-producing reactors is known to be small, there have been no comprehensive studies on the emission reduction potential when the technology is applied to the heating sector. This paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis. The carbon footprint of the LDR-50 heating plant is evaluated, and compared to conventional heating fuels, direct electric heating, and heat pumps. The results of the analysis show that the life cycle CO2 emissions are low, although there are still significant uncertainties related to the construction phase, due to missing data. In addition to carbon footprint, the analysis is also extended to other adverse environmental impacts. It is concluded that significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved by replacing fossil heating fuels with nuclear energy. The technology is considered a viable option alongside biofuels and heat pumps. The overall environmental impacts are low, and the production does not compete for low-carbon electricity or scarce natural resources.

Abstract An approach that combines data-driven analysis and modeling was used to select the optimal mud motor power section tailored to specific drilling requirements. Additionally, a novel methodology was developed for estimating the CO2 footprint of drilling operations based on operational data. Practical demonstrations verified that the strategic utilization of the optimal power section enhances drilling efficiency and mitigates the CO2 impact associated with drilling processes. Our focus revolves around choosing the optimal power section for the drilling, considering both drilling conditions and limits. Additionally, we estimatethe CO2 footprint for the entire drilling process after the job to underscore the positive impact of selecting the right power section. To achieve these goals, we integrate an advanced physical model of the power section with the capabilities of machine learning and data science. This power section model empowers us to predict its performance and durability in advance, facilitating an optimal choice based on expected drilling conditions. The established workflow for CO2 footprint estimation utilizes surface drilling data, ensuring precise results. To optimize the power section for drilling, we employ a modeling method coupled with a machine-learning approach. This aids in selecting a suitable power section type and determining drilling parameters based on specific requirements and equipment specifications, contributing to heightened drilling efficiency. Leveraging digital capabilities enables strategic implementation to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Enhancing drilling efficiency via optimal mud motor power section selection improves rate of penetration, reduces nonproductive time, and substantially cuts field failures. This cumulatively shortens total drilling time, leading to both direct and indirect CO2 emissions reductions. To gauge the carbon footprint during drilling operations, we construct a physical model. This model predicts rig power consumption by considering surface drilling parameters (as pressure, flow rate, etc.). It estimates power consumption by components like mud pumps, top drive, and draw works, using system efficiency data. Additionally, a model encompassing generator sets and diesel combustion is employed to estimate CO2 emissions. Application of the proposed methodology to a real field example demonstrated the impact of enhanced drilling performance with optimal power sections versus conventional ones, along with effective greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The entirety of the results and conclusions highlights the substantial value of digital technologies and a smart approach in selecting drilling equipment for the energy transition.

Abstract The ability of high-temperature solid oxide cell (SOC) electrochemical reactors to efficiently convert atmospheric carbon to high value chemicals for industrial and energy storage applications via CO2 and co-electrolysis makes them a key technology for active carbon utilisation. However, due to additional operational risks from thermochemical reactions on thermal management, limited experimental capacity, and relative novelty, CO2 and co-electrolysis lag behind steam electrolysis in large-scale adoption. Here, a 1D+1D SOC model based on fundamental first principles considering three-dimensional heat transfer was improved via a unique method for representing co-electrolysis electrochemistry, solving with low computational effort. Validation against experimental data for two compositions and pressures, showed high levels of accuracy with respect to characteristic cell voltages, temperatures, and outlet compositions. The model also showed CO2 reduction during co-electrolysis mainly occurred via reverse water gas shift, while CO2 electrolysis still accounted for up to 35% of the total share. Pressurised co-electrolysis operation promotes exothermic methanation, causing pronounced heating of the reactor, consequently reducing the isothermal current density. Therefore, low to moderate pressurisation is likely most suited for coupling with downstream synthesis processes to avoid the installation of unnecessarily large systems and associated high costs.

_ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 214950, “Limitations and Fallacies of Carbon Capture and Storage and Impact on Oil and Gas Production,” by S.M. Farouq Ali, SPE, and Mohamed Y. Soliman, SPE, University of Houston. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ In the complete paper, the authors write that, while carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives are affecting oil and gas operations profoundly, such efforts have had little perceptible effect on atmospheric CO2, which continues to increase. The paper aims to show that current CCS regimens have serious technical and fiscal constraints and questionable validity, stating that, globally, CCS has not increased beyond approximately 0.1% of global CO2 emissions in the past 20 years. The paper offers partial solutions and concludes that, while oil and gas will continue to be important energy sources beyond the foreseeable future, oil companies will accomplish the needed CCS. Introduction The authors write that, while CCS efforts have been pursued for 4 decades, little has been achieved. For the past 20 years, the percentage of CO2 captured and stored is less than 0.1% of the CO2 emitted worldwide, if one considers CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects to be CSS—which, the authors write, is a fallacy. They emphasize that CCS means injection with no production. The key to CCS success, they write, is major governmental subsidization, by whatever terminology it is known, and that means taxpayer money. Sweeping decisions that have a profound effect on oil and gas production and petroleum engineering education are being made based on predictions of an increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in various time frames. Magnitude of the Problem The problem of world CO2 emissions capture is gigantic. To appreciate the magnitude of the problem, imagine that 1 year’s CO2 emissions (40 billion tonnes) are captured, compressed and liquified, and injected into a reservoir the size of the Ghawar oil field, the largest reservoir in the world, with the entire pore space (approximately 0.5 Tcf) available for storage. In this hypothetical, nine such reservoirs would be required every year. Presumably, such storage space can be found, but collecting the CO2 and bringing it to a storage site is a highly complex task. For example, in a sequestration effort in a building complex in New York, the CO2 is separated, liquified, and trucked to a storage site to be injected underground, which is impractical. Often, the example of the Nordic countries (mainly Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) is cited as evidence of successful emissions reduction. But the total population of these countries is approximately the same as that of metropolitan Mumbai in India. Definitions Carbon capture use and storage (CCUS) implies that the CO2 produced by various processes is captured and used for EOR. This accounts for approximately 30% of the 230 mtpa of CO2 captured globally. CCS means that any CO2 produced by the process is captured and injected into a suitable geological formation for storage for thousands of years. Net-zero emissions (NZE) implies that all the CO2 produced is captured and stored. In Canada, “absolute zero emissions” is discussed, meaning that no CO2 is produced in the first place, pointing to total fossil-fuel phaseout.

Abstract The paper aims to outline the technical challenges and opportunities associated with implementing blue hydrogen production in the Panchevo oil refinery. It will emphasize a viable pathway for decarbonization, focusing on optimizing carbon capture and storage technologies, ensuring cost-effectiveness, and addressing environmental concerns. The scope includes contributing to the refinery's sustainability goals and fostering innovation in the energy transition. The approach involves utilizing Aspen Hysys for CO2 emission calculations, assessing all refinery emitters, and defining the carbon footprint. The required CO2 reduction for European blue hydrogen standards has been determined. Physical space needs for a carbon capture unit are analyzed, with parcel allocation. Three hydrogen production scenarios are evaluated using facility data and specialized software. This comprehensive methodology ensures a thorough examination of technical challenges and opportunities in implementing blue hydrogen production at the Panchevo oil refinery, emphasizing sustainability and adherence to European standards. The study employed Aspen Hysys with a Gibbs reactor to model fuel combustion, optimizing Gibbs free energy for phase and chemical equilibrium. Adjusting air flow to measured oxygen values, it was found that HPU emissions contribute 41% to total refinery emissions. Steam Methane Reforming data revealed current hydrogen production and the plant's underutilization at 50-60% capacity, indicating room for expansion. Implementing carbon capture technology enables the monetization of premium blue hydrogen. Analysis of three scenarios, with additional daily hydrogen production of 20t/day, 35t/day, and 50t/day, consistently showed a 74% emission reduction to meet blue hydrogen standards, equating to 350,000–530,000 tCO2/year for capture and storage. The proposed solution involves transporting captured CO2 via a pipeline to a depleted gas field located 40 km from the refinery, aligning with sustainability goals.

Background: Stretch marks, or striae distensae (SD), are a common dermatological issue caused by skin stretching and subsequent dermal damage. Various treatments, including laser therapy and microneedling, have been explored for SD. This study evaluates and compares the effectiveness of Fractional CO2 laser and microneedling with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for treating SD. Method: A randomized controlled trial was conducted over a year at Rohilkhand Medical College and Hospital. Ninety-eight patients aged 18-40 were enrolled and divided into two groups: Group A (Fractional CO2 laser) and Group B (microneedling with PRP), each receiving four sessions at three-week intervals. Patients' histories, including demographics and striae characteristics, were documented. The effectiveness of treatments was assessed using the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS) at multiple follow-ups. Side effects were also recorded. Result: Group A (Fractional CO2 laser) had 49 patients with a mean age of 25.9 years, and Group B (microneedling with PRP) had 49 patients with a mean age of 26.4 years. Group A showed a significant reduction in striae width and length compared to Group B. By Week 12, 48.80% of Group A reported Excellent Improvement in VAS scores, compared to 12.80% in Group B. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in Group A, with more patients reporting Very Satisfied and Extremely Satisfied outcomes. Side effects such as erythema and hyperpigmentation were more common in Group A. Conclusion: Fractional CO2 laser therapy is more effective than micro needling with PRP in reducing the appearance of stretch marks, with higher patient satisfaction and significant improvements in VAS scores. Despite a higher incidence of side effects, the CO2 laser provides better overall outcomes.

Abstract According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero report of 2023, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is projected to achieve an 8% reduction in cumulative emissions, with an estimated capacity of 6 billion tons per year by 2050. The purpose of this work is to estimate the magnitude of effort required to meet this projection, both from an economic and an energy point of view. Based on the post-combustion process of a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant and using Shell-Cansolv proprietary DC-103 solvent as a reference capture agent, an analysis of the energy requirements and economic costs associated with this technology has been conducted. This analysis includes parameters such as the energy surplus required for CO2 capture, Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) of the plant. Costs related to CO2 transport and storage have not been considered. The values obtained, applied to the IEA's climate neutrality goals, are essential for understanding the operational and economic challenges of post-combustion capture. In particular, considering the important role of CCS in the IEA report and considering the calculation made with the reference data, about 5000 plants would need to be built by 2050, equivalent to an average of nearly 200 plants annually. This would require an investment of $1.24 trillion according by the current available technologies. Moreover, an additional energy cost of about 25% for the CCGT plant would be required to capture the CO2 that has been emitted for the power production. This could also result in additional CO2 emissions, thereby reducing the net capture capacity of the system. These data illustrate the scale of commitment required to achieve the ambitious climate-neutrality goals, in which significant amount of economic efforts and energy resources will have to be drawn upon. It also highlights the urgency of investing in more efficient and sustainable CO2 capture technologies and strategies. This study provides quantitative data that can be useful in making informed decisions regarding the adoption and implementation of CCS technologies.

Abstract Accurately reproducing the coupling of fluid flow in porous medium and rock mechanics is crucial for the modelling of CO2 geological storage in order to properly evaluate and prevent the risk of inducing fault instability during injection operations. As an alternative to using monolithic flow/mechanical suites, the process can be modelled by linking individual codes, i.e., a reservoir simulator for flow and a geomechanical package to account for fluid induced stress change, which tackle the two problems sequentially. We developed a flexible numerical framework where different coupling logics can be selected, i.e., one-way coupling, two-way coupling, and explicit coupling, which are characterized by different levels of accuracy and computational costs. A multirate two-way coupling algorithm, which allows the flow and mechanical simulators to exchange information periodically rather than at every time step, is also available to reduce the computational cost of two-way coupled simulations. In this work, we employ this coupling infrastructure to perform numerical experiments aimed at defining whether sequential iterative coupling is strictly needed or not, and which less expensive logic can be used in case to attain a similar solution accuracy. First, a synthetic test case is used to illustrate the onset of fault instability during CO2 injection operations for different sets of coupling parameters (type and frequency), rock properties and fault permeability. It is thus possible to evaluate, for a reasonable range of coupling strength, which depends on fluids and rock properties, the optimal level of coupling. Results are strongly influenced by the coupling strength and two-way iterative coupling should be selected for tightly coupled systems to accurately reproduce the fault behavior. For loosely coupled system instead, the one-way approach should be the preferred choice due its lower computational cost. Later, we consider CO2 injection into a realistic formation, and we analyze the impact of the coupling frequency on the computational performance. We show that for complex cases there is no one-to-one correspondence between the reduction in the number of coupling iterations and the reduction in computational time for increasing coupling period.

A long period of deposit development leads to a reduction in the volume of balance reserves of ores, while the volume of accumulation of waste (tailings) from mining and processing production increases. In connection with this, an urgent problem is the processing of waste tailings, which can serve as an additional source of commercial products of non-ferrous metals. The set objectives can be achieved by implementing comprehensive extraction of valuable components, reducing fuel, and energy costs at the stage of low-temperature sintering to produce white soot (grade BS-100). In order to determine the amount of heat of chemical reactions during sintering of rough copper concentrate with sodium hydroxide, thermochemical calculations were carried out. For the research, we used rough copper concentrate with a copper content of 4.40% and silver of 77.03 g/t. An equation has been obtained for calculating the heat of chemical reactions of rough concentrate sintering. According to this equation, the greatest contribution to the heat release is provided by the iron content (60%), three times less and equally (19%) - copper and silicon and about 0.2% is absorbed by aluminum. The thermal effect of sintering will be -920.45 kW·h/t of concentrate. From the heat balance of sintering it follows that with an alkali consumption of up to 200% of the mass of the concentrate. The heat of chemical reactions will be sufficient for the autogeneity of the process. Research has been carried out on sintering the concentrate with alkali in the temperature range of 250-500 °C and obtaining white soot from a productive leaching solution with the extraction of 60% silicon. White soot (mSiO2·nH2O) was isolated by two-stage carbonization of a silicate solution with carbon dioxide in a recirculation system with further washing of the precipitate with a solution of sulfuric acid.

Compared with conventional methane reforming technologies, chemical looping reforming (CLR) has the advantages of self-elimination of coke, a suitable syngas ratio for certain down-stream processes, and a pure H2 or CO stream. In the reduction step of CLR, methane combustion has to be inhibited, which could be achieved by designing appropriate oxygen carriers and/or optimizing the operating conditions. To gain a further understanding of the combustion reaction, methane oxidation by perovskite (SrFeO3-δ) at 900 °C and 1 atm in a pulse mode was investigated in this work. The oxygen non-stoichiometry of SrFeO3-δ prepared by a Pechini-type polymerizable complex method is 0.14 at ambient conditions, and it increases to 0.25 and subsequently to 0.5 when heating from 100 to 900 °C in argon that contains 2 ppmv of molecular oxygen. The activation energies of the first and second transitions are 294 and 177 kJ/mol, respectively. The presence of 0.99 vol.% hydrogen in argon significantly reduces the amount CO2 produced. At a pulse interval of 10 min, the amount of CO2 produced in the absence of hydrogen is one order of magnitude greater than that in the presence of hydrogen. In the former case, the amount of CO2 produced dramatically decreases first and then gradually approaches a constant, and the oxygen species involved in methane combustion can be partially replenished by extending the pulse interval, e.g., 82.5% of this type of oxygen species is replenished when the pulse interval is extended to 60 min. The restored species predominantly originate from those that reside in the surface layer or even in the bulk.

Biomass, due to its neutrality in terms of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere during its life cycle, is considered an interesting renewable source for energy production as an alternative to the use of more polluting fossil fuels. Among the different wood fuels, pellets are convenient for use in dedicated stoves, and pellet heating systems have a high energy efficiency. The aim of this work was to estimate the economic and global warming potential (GWP100a) generated along the thermal energy supply chain of wood pellets, starting from the production of raw biomass from dedicated poplar cultivations and ending with the use of pellets in stoves by the end-user to produce thermal energy and ash. The Eco-Efficiency Indicator (EEI) was used to link the economic and environmental performance for eight proposed scenarios, obtained by combining different levels of mechanisation for poplar harvesting and wood biomass management before arrival at the pellet plant. For the thermal energy produced by the poplar wood pellet, the GWP100a ranged from 1.5 × 10−2 to 2.1 × 10−2 kg CO2−eq MJ−1 for three-year-old plantations and from 1.9 × 10−2 to 2.4 × 10−2 kg CO2−eq MJ−1, for six-year-old plantations. In terms of eco-efficiency of the baseline scenario (EEIb), the most favourable scenarios remain those linked to the use of biomass from three-year-old poplar plantations, with EEIb values ranging from 0.31 to 0.60 € kgCO2−eq−1, compared to from 0.29 to 0.36 € kgCO2−eq−1 for pellets obtained from biomass produced from six-year-old poplar plantations. In terms of the Global Eco-Efficiency Indicator (EEIg), which also takes into account the positive effect on the reduction of greenhouse gases due to the storage of carbon in the soil by the plantations and the reduction of emissions from avoided fossil fuels, the most favourable scenarios remain those linked to the use of biomass from three-year-old poplar plantations, with EEIg values that vary in the range of 0.60 ÷ 1.04 € kgCO2−eq−1, compared to 0.55 ÷ 0.62 € kg CO2−eq−1 for thermal energy obtained using biomass from six-year-old poplar plantations.

As part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and lower its negative effects on climate change, this study was conceived with the aim of evaluating the rate of reduction of greenhouse gases emission from diesel engine powered with Jatropha Curcas seed oil blend diesel. The study produced biodiesel from the oil extracted from the Jatrophha Curcas seed using trans-esterification method. The amount of CO2, SO2 and NO2 emitted from a diesel engine powered with conventional oil and jatropha biodiesel blend were determined to ascertain whether there was reduction or increment in percentage of emissions. Laboratory analysis of Jatropha Curcas oil shows that 131.9524g jatropha curcas seed yielded 90.559ml of biodiesel and 41.2437ml of glycerol. Conventional diesel and Jatropha curcas biodiesel produced has similar physiochemical characteristics confirmed through ASTM(US) and DIN(EN) hence their combustibility. CO2 emissions increased with increase in diesel at B100 and B50 while it decreases in B20 and B40. While NO2 emissions increased by 1% in all the revolutions per minute, SO2 was only detected at B100 and B50 emission of the greenhouse gases. From the questionnaire survey conducted at Egbema, it was found that gas flaring has serious adverse effect on vegetation in the area, significant negative effect on the economy of the area due to the rise in air pollution. The result of the laboratory experiments showed that blended green diesel reduces the emission of greenhouse gases from combustion of diesel. The study recommended adoption of renewable energy sources for the operation of the oil firms in Egbema the study therefore concluded that blended green diesel is a promising alternative fuel for internal combustion engines.

Abstract This report discusses experienced lower C2 / C2+ recovery in NGL recovery unit of Saudi Aramco Khursaniyah Gas Plant Department (KGPD). The experienced lower recoveries were due to the unplanned outage of HP gas and no available HP gas feed to NGL plant. This led to uneven flow distribution of the gas through splits and turbo expander side which ultimately led to lower utilization of critical heat integrations affecting the temperature profile of the demethanizer column and eventually led to a lower C2 recovery overall. However, KGP has evaluated and applied an initiative solution of recycling over 100 MMSCFD of sweet gas back to the NGL train through the start-up line. The innovative solution boosted the C2 recovery to 95% from 84%. This special mode of operation of recycling sweet gas held for 8 days and after preforming the enhancement it was observed that NGL production was increased by 6.5 MBD with a total quantity of 52,000 BBL. Moreover, fuel gas quality improved as a result of lower C2+ components resulted in CO2 avoidance by 52% which represents a reduction of to 70 KTons of CO2.

Abstract. Earth system model experiments presented here explore how the centennial response in the Southern Ocean can drive ongoing global warming even with zero CO2 emissions and declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These projections were simulated by the earth system model version of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS-ESM1.5) and motivated by the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP); ACCESS-ESM1.5 simulated ongoing warming in the ZECMIP experiment that switched or branched to zero emissions after 2000 PgC had been emitted. New experiments presented here each simulated 300 years and included intermediate branch points. In each experiment that branched after emitting more than 1000 PgC, the global climate continues to warm. For the experiment that branched after 2000 PgC, or after 3.5 °C of warming from a preindustrial climate, there is 0.37 ± 0.08 °C of extra warming after 50 years of zero emissions, which increases to 0.83 ± 0.08 °C after 200 years. All branches show ongoing Southern Ocean warming. The circulation of the Southern Ocean is modified early in the warming climate, which contributes to changes in the distribution of both physical and biogeochemical subsurface ocean tracers, such as ongoing warming at intermediate depths and a reduction in deep oxygen south of 60° S. A simple slab model emulates the global temperatures of the ACCESS-ESM1.5 experiments demonstrating the response here is primarily due to the slow response of the ocean and the Southern Ocean in particular. Centennial global warming persists when the slab model is forced with CO2 diagnosed from late-branching experiments with other ZECMIP models, confirming the dominant role of ocean physics at these timescales. However, decadal responses changed due to the larger drawdown of CO2 from other models. Slow ongoing warming in the Southern Ocean can be found in ZEC scenarios of most models, though the amplitude and global influence varies.

Abstract The global challenge of climate change has prompted significant steps to reduce CO2 emissions, guided by international agreements like the Paris Agreement, which set targets for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Acting too slowly could result in future losses and reputational issues, while moving too swiftly could jeopardize shareholder value due to the marginal profitability or potential losses resulting from technology challenges and the immaturity of many renewable projects. To navigate this complex landscape wisely, energy companies will benefit from developing Sequential Decision Making (SDM) policies to maximize value creation from decision flexibility under uncertainties. However, achieving this goal is not trivial. This necessitates the use of decision-analysis and optimization methods that deliver robust decision insights without prohibitive computational costs or delays. In this research, we propose a multi-objective SDM framework to model the dynamic energy landscape up to 2050, allowing exploration of various decision strategies related to different portfolios for allocating funds across three sectors: hydrocarbon, renewables, and CO2 reduction investments. This approach aims to maximize value during the transformation while accounting for uncertainties in hydrocarbon and renewable energy productions, energy prices, and production costs. The framework targets three main objectives: maximizing profit, minimizing CO2 emission, and enhancing competitive advantage. Our research evaluates the benefits of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve for the optimal investment decision policy for the SDM context. The sequential decisions of the energy company shape the virtual dynamic environment by influencing various variables. Subsequently, the environment responds with new variable states and immediate value feedback, reflecting the three defined objectives. Through repeated interactions, the RL algorithm navigates the extensive state space, learning the optimal decision policy amidst uncertainties.

Abstract The rate and severity of potential loss of CO2 injectivity in saline aquifers due to brine dry-out and salt accumulation near-wellbore is one of the main uncertainties in CCS project planning. Default parameters implemented in commercial reservoir simulators overestimate the degree of salt precipitation and resulting permeability impairment. The current study used lab and digital core analyses of Berea sandstone to estimate the petrophysical and dynamic properties for adjustment of predicted precipitation and flow reduction in reservoir simulation models of intermittent CO2 injection with aquifer drive. A set of 23 core plugs were subjected to repeated brine infiltration and drying for varying cycles and drying methods, and characterized by dried-state measurements of helium porosity, Klinkenberg permeability and mercury intrusion capillary pressure, plus non-destructive 3D X-ray imaging. In early cycles, permeability showed a gradual linear decrease with porosity loss, followed by a much steeper decline over later cycles, due to preferential accumulation of salt near the end faces. The plug-scale 3D porosity map was used to history match the flow experiments, to remove these end-effects from the salt-blocking porosity-permeability trend and generalized Kozeny-Carman exponent. High-resolution 3D imaging of a Berea subsample through an analogous sequence of small-scale brine infiltration-drying experiments was used to visualize the precipitated salt in pores, for pore-scale simulation of the porosity-permeability trend in the absence of larger-scale heterogeneities in salt distribution. Further, the co-flow of brine and CO2 during drainage and imbibition was also simulated in this salt-blocked image sequence, to generate curves of relative permeability and capillary pressure versus saturation of brine and dried salt. The resulting flow properties at pore- to plug-scale were integrated into a conceptual reservoir model to evaluate injectivity impairment caused by salt clogging.

In the present investigation, Cu2O-based composites were successfully prepared through a multistep method where cubic Cu2O nanoparticles (CU Cu2O) have been grown on Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) nanosheets. The structural and morphological properties of the materials have been studied through a comprehensive characterization, confirming the coexistence of crystalline Cu2O and RGO. Microscopical imaging revealed the intimate contact between the two materials, affecting the size and the distribution of Cu2O nanoparticles on the support. The features of the improved morphology strongly affected the electrochemical behavior of the composites, increasing the activity and the faradaic efficiencies towards the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction process. CU Cu2O/RGO 2:1 composite displayed selective CO formation over H2, with higher currents compared to pristine Cu2O (−0.34 mA/cm2 for Cu2O and −0.64 mA/cm2 for CU Cu2O/RGO 2:1 at the voltage of −0.8 vs. RHE and in a CO2 atmosphere) and a faradaic efficiency of 50% at −0.9 V vs. RHE. This composition exhibited significantly higher CO production compared to the pristine materials, indicating a favorable *CO intermediate pathway even at lower voltages. The systematic investigation on the effects of nanostructuration on composition, morphology and catalytic behavior is a valuable solution for the formation of effective interphases for the promotion of catalytic properties providing crucial insights for future catalysts design and applications.

Abstract As a key material for manufacturing clean energy technologies, steel is crucial for energy transition, but its production causes 2.6 Gton of CO2 emissions at global level each year. In 2020 the European Union (EU) set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, fostering innovation in the steel industry to reduce its environmental impact. However, a scenario-oriented and technologically comprehensive analysis assessing prospected environmental and market implications of steel decarbonisation strategies remains a gap, which is addressed in this paper. The analysis adopts a hybrid input-output-based LCA model built in the MARIO framework, extending the Exiobase database to represent the supply chains of the most promising low-carbon steelmaking technologies in the EU, such as hydrogen- or charcoal-injected blast furnaces and natural gas- and hydrogen-based direct reduction routes. The penetration of these technologies is explored by formulating scenarios resembling European climate targets. The results show a reduction in the carbon footprint of steel across all scenarios, ranging up to -26% in 2030 and to -60% in 2050. However, the extent of footprint reduction is highly dependent on the share of clean electricity in the European supply mix, highlighting the relevance of holistic decarbonization strategies. Economic implications affect steel prices, which rise up to 25% in 2030 and 56% in 2050, opening discussions on the need for suitable policies such as CBAM to avoid protectionism and encourage international technological progress.

Abstract Well integrity plays an important role in any subsurface operation since the wellbore connects the target formation with surface facilities. Any compromising of well integrity may lead to unsafe operation, harm the environment, and may lead to complete failure of the project. This study introduces new built setup to study well integrity through permeability measurement of different wellbore components allowing new insights on the risk management of the geologic carbon storage projects. To study wellbore size sections like of casing-cement, cement-rock, or even casing-cement-rock, a large- scale facility was built at our underground laboratory at 150 m underground. The facility weighs approx. 3 tons with a length of 2 m, and a diameter of 0.7 m. It can handle samples of size 80 cm length and 30 cm diameter. Working pressure and temperature are up to 20 MPa, and 100 °C, respectively. The facility is equipped with two chamber real-time permeability measurement system that can determine the effective permeability of wellbore components based on transient method. Effective permeability of casing-cement composites is measured using CO2 at ambient and subzero temperatures to ensure the well integrity during CO2 injection in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Preparation of casing-cement samples requires special conditions to preserve integrity of the samples and avoid damage. The preliminary results show that the tested samples exhibit expected values of permeability at ambient temperatures (lower than 1×10−17 m2). Subzero temperatures, down to -11 °C have no effect on original permeability i.e., no increase in permeability after thawing. Pressure cycling experiments showed that the effective pressure and exposure time to CO2 play the most important role in permeability degradation. Furthermore, small pure cement cylinders (10 cm× 10 cm) were prepared and tested on a small-scale facility (analogous to the large-scale setup) to compare the results with the composites. In addition, the permeability of the composites was measured -before and after CO2 exposure- with H2 to account for the reduction in permeability due to the geochemical reactions. It was concluded that the permeability has decreased at least in one order from 10−18 m2 to 10−19 m2 owing to the reaction. The large-scale facility has been used for HYPOS (Germany) project and currently working for RETURN (EU) project as well. Its uniqueness is in the broad range of pressure and temperature working conditions and handling wellbore sections of the size 1:1. The results provide new insights into the risk management of storage projects saving time and cost.

Bio-carbon–manganese composites obtained from olive mill wastewater were successfully prepared using manganese acetate as the manganese source and olive wastewater as the carbon precursor. The samples were characterized chemically and texturally by N2 and CO2 adsorption at 77 K and 273 K, respectively, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction. Electrochemical characterization was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The samples were evaluated in the electro-Fenton degradation of tetracycline in a typical three-electrode system under natural conditions of pH and temperature (6.5 and 25 °C). The results show that the catalysts have a high catalytic power capable of degrading tetracycline (about 70%) by a three-electron oxygen reduction pathway in which hydroxyl radicals are generated in situ, thus eliminating the need for two catalysts (ORR and Fenton).

During a trip to western North Dakota last month to visit my family, I met with a long-time friend, Dick, who holds subsurface mineral rights and surface rights in the Bakken area. Over coffee, German sausage, and kuchen, our conversation naturally turned to the leasing of pore space. Dick has lately been approached by landmen with what they describe as “great deals” for purchasing the underlying pore space associated with his surface rights. They hesitate to provide specific offers. Instead, he described the initial interactions as “like making a deal for a new car or tractor.” The landmen reply, “I’ll need to go back to the client [my boss or manager] with your questions.” Sound familiar? Like most US states, pore space ownership correlates with surface ownership in North Dakota. In August 2022, the North Dakota Supreme Court clarified the rights of surface owners and the need for compensation for pore space use. It also created uncertainty for oil and gas operators who previously had more latitude in using pore space without compensation. Dick knows his way around the dealmaking involved in oil and gas rights leasing, having been involved in many landmen inquiries in the days of the Bakken boom and subsequent wheeling and dealing. However, pore space leasing is relatively nascent and faces similar unknowns like the early days of Bakken pitches. During his research, he came up against the same walls I have over the years while writing about pore space leasing for carbon sequestration. Becoming more apparent as deals gain momentum is the lack of specifics for comparable deals. As when purchasing a home, identifying “comps” for similar properties is a necessary part of the process. But the amounts paid for pore space are closely held, generally not publicly available. It’s impossible to determine if a deal is good or bad. Is the compensation fair? And individual surface owners and landowners rights associations (and/or their attorneys) are aware of the 45Q tax credit of $85/tonne of CO2 captured and stored available to the project developer/operator under the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. How should this be factored into the determination of fair compensation? For example, the Ohio River Valley Institute (ORVI), a think tank focused on the Appalachian region, in March described a proposal by Tenaska Inc. to lease underground pore space across seven counties (approximately 80,000 acres) in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia for the sequestering of 150 million tons of CO2. In a document proposing terms for the acquisition of nearly 1,400 acres of pore space in county parklands in Washington County, Pennsylvania, Tenaska offered about $4 million for the county’s 2.6-million-metric-ton share of the CO2 between 2027 and 2056, or about $1.50 per metric ton. The ORVI called the deal “ridiculous and borderline insulting.” It supports this declaration by highlighting a comp available from August 2023. Mountaineer GigaSystem LLC offered the state of West Virginia a royalty of $3.35 per metric ton to sequester CO2 on public land in Mason County—more than two times what Tenaska is offering Washington County. It also made the point that the ultimate cost of capturing and sequestering the CO2 will not be borne by Tenaska or its customers. The 45Q tax credit will provide Tenaska $423 million annually for sequestering 5 million tons of CO2 annually. The region’s lease revenue will be $7.5 million. To align with the available comp, ORVI said Tenaska’s offer should at least match Mountaineer’s $3.35 instead of the proposed $1.50 per metric ton. In the western US, ExxonMobil is seeking to pay the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to inject 150 million tons of CO2 over the course of 20 years into 100,000 subsurface acres of pore space on federal lands. The proposed Snowy River CO2 project in Carter County, Montana, is still in the environmental assessment and public comment phase, and the BLM’s compensation for the use of the land is not yet publicly disclosed or finalized. Our takeaway after finishing the sausage and kuchen? As pore space leasing evolves, landowners like Dick face a complex landscape of uncertain deals and opaque compensation. With legal clarifications and potential tax credits in play, navigating these new frontiers requires keen insight and vigilance to ensure fair and beneficial agreements for all involved.

Abstract CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) is increasingly relied upon as a significant contributor to the overall reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the transportation and injection of CO2 presents significant challenges to engineers, in terms of risk mitigation for the facilities, economics and feasibility. This paper focuses on the thermo-hydraulic connection between surface facilities and reservoir characteristics such as size, permeability, porosity, that ultimately determines the total amount of stored CO2, and the maximum achievable flow rates. As reservoir conditions and the number, type, and size of emitters change over time, this connection plays a key role in the overall feasibility of the project. Furthermore, we examine how the presence of different impurities may add significant uncertainty, which requires careful evaluation of the mixture's physical and thermodynamic properties. This approach ensures the asset's physical constraints are correctly taken into account. Through the novel use of a flexible life-of-field simulator, based on first principles and rigorous thermodynamics, we show that a holistic approach to modelling the whole asset comprised of surface facilities as well as subsurface stores, represents a crucial tool to design, plan and optimize the performance of the CCS hub. Based on the simulation of various case studies, representing different scenarios, we identify the physical constraints of the asset, and highlight methods and strategies to solve the challenges that may hinder the feasibility and sustainability of the project in the long term. The combined modelling integration of process, production, and injection facilities (e.g., pumps, compressors, heaters, pipelines, and wells), a simplified representation of the reservoir, and rigorous thermodynamics enable us to evaluate and compare different operating strategies from various angles. These include power and pressure requirements, achievable injection rates, and estimation of the overall project lifecycle, while monitoring the facility's flow assurance and integrity risks. As boundary conditions change, the continuity of flow between transport and injection facilities determines a variability in thermohydraulic behaviour that can only be examined using an integrated asset modelling approach. Furthermore, the unique thermodynamic properties of CO2, combined with the variability of the concentration's impurities, adds complexity to effectively evaluate the design and operating strategies. Such complexity implies that simple non-compositional approaches are ill-suited for evaluating the feasibility of the project.

The reduction of fossil fuels which produce CO2 emission that damage the environment, can be done by implementing renewable energy-based power generations, such as solar and wind. This research designs a hybrid energy system by optimizing the use of existing diesel generators through the integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic and micro wind turbine, and is equipped with an energy storage system. This research uses HOMER Pro software to determine the optimal capacity of hybrid system components, and to calculate the cost of energy (CoE). Furthermore, the hybrid system configuration is analyzed by applying several objectives. The objectives of the hybrid system design are to prioritize a maximum renewable energy penetration ratio within permitted annual capacity shortage and with the CoE lower than the existing CoE. The research results show that the proposed hybrid energy system can provide a renewable energy penetration ratio of 57.1% with CoE of IDR 3,510/kWh.

High-performance machine components are involved in a wide range of industrial production processes. They play an important role in the provision of chemical products, pharmaceuticals, and energy resources. They require monitoring because they can fail during production due to corrosion and/or wear, which often means an increased risk to people and the environment. Periodic inspections with on-site test personnel often require a shutdown of the chemical plant. Ideally, an ultrasonic structural health monitoring (SHM) system could be used to provide continuous data on the structural integrity of these components while reducing or eliminating plant downtime. A plant shutdown is not only a high economic or supply risk but can also be energy intensive. In our presentation, we would like to give an overview of the technical requirements for an SHM system to be used in the chemical industry. Finally, the presentation will highlight the economic benefits of SHM as well as its contribution to energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of chemical product produced.

In recent years, anaerobic oxidation of methane with iron and manganese oxides as electron acceptors has been confirmed to exist in electrochemical constructed wetlands (CW), and this process is an important way to reduce methane emissions. However, the internal mechanisms of emission reduction, microbial ecological networks, and electron transfer mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that AOM driven by iron and manganese oxides (Fe/Mn-AOM) reduced methane emissions by more than 50.86% in constructed wetland – microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) systems. In iron and manganese systems, the relative abundance of microorganisms associated with methane metabolism (methanotrophic bacteria) increased significantly. AOM-related microorganisms cooperated with other microorganisms to form a robust and stable microbial ecological network. In the process of methane metabolism, there was an increase in the proportion of reverse methanogenic genes in iron and manganese systems, with the proportion of mcr genes being 1.75 and 1.79 times that of control systems. The key genes (cyc1 and cox11) that influence cytochrome C synthesis in AOM process were significantly enriched, resulting in enhanced electron transfer process. The coexistence of iron and manganese oxides enabled the simultaneous biochemical processes of CH4 oxidation and CO2 reduction within a single system. Additionally, the increase in humic acid also facilitated electron transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the removal efficiency of COD, TN, and TP in the CW-MFC systems. This study reveals the potential mechanism of Fe/Mn-AOM for CW-MFC methane emission reduction, which can provide a theoretical basis for the collaborative treatment of sewage and methane control in CWs, so as to achieve the maximum environmental benefits of CW.

This study critically examines the impact of indoor air quality (IAQ) on occupant health in two critical care units (ICUs) at Jason Sendwe Hospital (JSH) and General Carrier de Mine Hospital (GCMH) within the Southern DRC metropolitan area, focusing on their impact on occupant health and well-being. Utilizing a mixed methods approach that includes health questionnaires, continuous environmental monitoring (monitoring CO2, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, and relative humidity), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, this research aims to identify correlations between environmental factors and the health of hospital staff and patients. The investigation was conducted across both the rainy and dry seasons, revealing significant seasonal variations in IEQ parameters and exploring the incidence of symptoms commonly associated with sick building syndrome among hospital staff. Higher CO2, VOCs, and particulate matter levels during the dry season indicated the inadequacy of current ventilation strategies to maintain optimal air quality. This study proposes the implementation of air filtration and purification systems and the refurbishment of natural ventilation systems as effective measures to improve IAQ. Additionally, alternative ventilation strategies, including occupancy reduction and the integration of supply and exhaust ventilation, were explored to address the challenges of inadequate ventilation. The findings reveal the urgent need for hospitals to adopt ventilation strategies that ensure the health and well-being of occupants, highlighting the importance of continuous IAQ monitoring, community engagement, and the integration of advanced ventilation technologies in healthcare settings. This comprehensive exploration offers valuable insights for improving ventilation in ICUs, contributing to creating healthier indoor environments in hospital settings, especially in regions facing unique environmental challenges.

Eceng gondok contains chlorophyll which is an oxygenate type additive which can increase the combustion reaction in fuel and reduce exhaust emissions. Therefore, eceng gondok has the potential to be used as a bioadditive in fuel by adding carotene from crude palm oil which functions as an antioxidant through electron transfer, thereby protecting chlorophyll from autooxidation. The two chlorophyll and carotene extracts at a ratio of 0:1, 2:3, 3:1, 4:1, 3:2, and 1:0 respectively were mixed with toluene and Fatty Acid Methyl Ester as a bioadditive formula. in gasoline fuel. The research results show that there is an increase in octane value of 0.1-0.5% according to ASTM D 2699 and GC-FID and results in a reduction in CO and CO2 exhaust emissions of 52.38% and 37% respectively. .00% on the use of chlorophyll : carotene (2:3) bioadditives in gasoline. This shows that eceng gondok and crude palm oil can be used as bioadditives in gasoline motor vehicles.

The affinity of oxygen (O)-bound species is a key factor in CO2 reduction (CO2R) reactions (including C1 and C2+ products), although existing experimental methods cannot quantitatively track the O atoms active within CO2R reactions in real time. Among the diversified products from CO2R reactions, the formate (HCOO−) possesses the highest profit per mole of electrons. Here, we report an operando electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method, which allows to quantitatively describe the complex species containing O atoms during the electrochemical CO2R reactions. Based on Cu and bimetallic Cu-based materials (Bi2CuO4 and In2Cu2O5) systems, we found that by introducing Bi and In metal adsorption sites, the O atoms of adsorbed H2O can directly involve in the formation of HCOO− through a water-assisted mechanism (∗COOH− regeneration), thereby improving the selectivity of liquid HCOO− product mostly from 34.2% to 98%. This strategy gives valuable insights into the design of HCOO−-favored catalysts.

Electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and solvation effects can alter the free energies of ionizable functional groups in proteins and other enclosed porous architectures, allowing these nanostructures to tune acid-base chemistry as needed to support specific functions. Herein, we expand on this theme to examine how metal sites (M = H2, ZnII, CoII, CoI) affect the pKa of benzoic acid guests bound in discrete porphyrin nanoprisms (M3TriCage), which were chosen as model systems for better understanding how porous metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts might influence H+ transfer processes that are needed to support many important electrochemical reactions (e.g., reductions of H+, O2, or CO2). Lewis acidic CoII and ZnII ions increase the Brønsted acidities of the guests by 4 and 8 pKa units, respectively, while reduction of the CoII sites to anionic CoI sites produces an electrostatic potential that lowers acidity by ca. 4 units (8 units relative to the CoII state). Lacking functional metal sites, H6TriCage increases the acidity of the guests by just 2.5 pKa units despite the 12+ charge of the host and contributions from other factors (hydrogen bonding, pore hydration) that might stabilize the depro-tonated guests. Thus, the metal sites have dominant effects on acid-base chemistry in the M3TriCages, providing a larger pKa range (12.75 to ≥24.5 in CD3CN) for the encapsulated acid than attained via other confinement effects in proteins and artificial porous materials.

Abstract The advent of digital health technologies has transformed the landscape of healthcare delivery and sustainable practice, with dermatology being no exception. National Health Service (NHS) England reported carbon emissions of 27.1 million tonnes from the health and social care system in 2017, equating to 6.3% of England’s emissions [NHS England. Delivering a ‘net zero’ National Health Service. Available at: https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf (last accessed 19 March 2024)]. Subsequently, the initiation of the NHS campaign ‘For a Greener NHS’ was introduced to ensure stakeholders are mindful of their healthcare delivery. This project delves into the sustainability implications of transitioning from traditional paper-based patient information leaflets (PILs) to online platforms within the field of dermatology. Focusing on environmental, economic, patient and healthcare delivery perspectives, the project aims to elucidate the benefits and challenges associated with this digital shift. A quality improvement project was used to propose a new lean pathway for educating patients using digital PILs. Quantitative data assessed printing habits from the outpatient department printer over 2 weeks prior to any intervention. Printing habits were reassessed for a further 2 weeks after QR codes to PILs were left in the dermatology clinic rooms and clinicians were encouraged to avoid printing PILs where feasible. Carbon emissions and cost analyses were calculated to quantify the effect of digital PILs. Qualitative data through a survey disseminated to patients and clinicians assessed the impact of digital PILs on healthcare delivery, patient engagement, and information accessibility. The results demonstrated that over the first 2-week period 1723 pages were printed, which equated to 8615g CO2 equivalent. Implementation of the digital PILs resulted in 1596 pages printed, equating to 7980g CO2 equivalent. This equates to 16 510g of CO2 emissions and £317.50 in costs potentially saved annually when switching to digital PILs. This is equivalent to the CO2 emitted by fully charging 2068 smartphones [US Environmental Protection Agency. Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator. 2024. Available at: https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator (last accessed 19 March 2024)]. Preliminary qualitative results illustrated the reluctance of particular age groups to engage in digital PILs due to poor technology literacy. However, there was an awareness among patients and dermatologists to implement sustainable education. Our findings demonstrate that digital PILs foster a reduction in the carbon footprint and costs. The increasing prevalence of smartphones and internet connectivity gives digital platforms the potential to enhance patient education, engagement, and adherence to treatment plans. However, considerations related to digital literacy, accessibility and data security need to be addressed to ensure equitable healthcare delivery. Through a synthesis of environmental, economic and healthcare delivery perspectives, our findings aim to guide healthcare providers in making informed decisions regarding the adoption of digital platforms for sustainable patient information dissemination.

We present an optical study based on the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) approximation, combining structural information taken from density-functional theory (DFT) to elucidate spectral features of CO adsorbed on Pt (111) and Cu (111). Optical information and structural arrangement of the adsorbed CO are correlated by varying both site positions and CO coverage as compared to experimental studies (θ = ¼ to θ = ½). This enables us to resolve key spectral features of both occupied and unoccupied molecular states at various adsorbate coverages, comparing theory to experiment. Using experimental data as benchmarks: we show the theory compares well with available data. Its predictive power provides a new path to infer information about the structure of CO from optical information, and can help to predict the presence of other little understood adsorbates such as an OCCO dimer, that may be relevant to mechanistic pathways for reduction of CO2 to high value C2+ products. This new approach complements total energy calculations, and also fills a void in DFT based theory that is known to be an unreliable predictor of the energetics of CO on transition metal surfaces.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic-assisted radical gastrectomy (LARG) is the standard treatment for early-stage gastric carcinoma (GC). However, the negative impact of this procedure on respiratory function requires the optimized intraoperative management of patients in terms of ventilation. AIM To investigate the influence of pressure-controlled ventilation volume-guaranteed (PCV-VG) and volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) on blood gas analysis and pulmonary ventilation in patients undergoing LARG for GC based on the lung ultrasound score (LUS). METHODS The study included 103 patients with GC undergoing LARG from May 2020 to May 2023, with 52 cases undergoing PCV-VG (research group) and 51 cases undergoing VCV (control group). LUS were recorded at the time of entering the operating room (T0), 20 minutes after anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (T1), 30 minutes after artificial pneumoperitoneum (PP) establishment (T2), and 15 minutes after endotracheal tube removal (T5). For blood gas analysis, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) were observed. Peak airway pressure (Ppeak), plateau pressure (Pplat), mean airway pressure (Pmean), and dynamic pulmonary compliance (Cdyn) were recorded at T1 and T2, 1 hour after PP establishment (T3), and at the end of the operation (T4). Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) were recorded. Pre- and postoperative serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Compared with those at T0, the whole, anterior, lateral, posterior, upper, lower, left, and right lung LUS of the research group were significantly reduced at T1, T2, and T5; in the control group, the LUS of the whole and partial lung regions (posterior, lower, and right lung) decreased significantly at T2, while at T5, the LUS of the whole and some regions (lateral, lower, and left lung) increased significantly. In comparison with the control group, the whole and regional LUS of the research group were reduced at T1, T2, and T5, with an increase in PaO2, decrease in PaCO2, reduction in Ppeak at T1 to T4, increase in Pmean and Cdyn, and decrease in Pplat at T4, all significant. The research group showed a significantly lower incidence of PPCs than the control group within 3 days postoperatively. Postoperative IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α significantly increased in both groups, with even higher levels in the control group. CONCLUSION LUS can indicate intraoperative non-uniformity and postural changes in pulmonary ventilation under PCV-VG and VCV. Under the lung protective ventilation strategy, the PCV-VG mode more significantly improved intraoperative lung ventilation in patients undergoing LARG for GC and reduced lung injury-related cytokine production, thereby alleviating lung injury.

Bismuth-based catalysts have demonstrated significant electrocatalytic activity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formate/formic acid, while the morphology of these catalysts is considered to be crucial for their electrocatalytic performance. However, the potential topological transformation of Bi-based catalysts during CO2RR catalysis has been largely overlooked, which could lead to an underlying lack of understanding of the structure–activity relationship. In this study, various morphologies of bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3), including nanowires, nanoribbons, nanospheres, nanoparticles, and commercially available bulk powders of Bi2S3, were systematically investigated for the electrocatalytic CO2RR in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Surprisingly, all of these morphologies exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities for formate synthesis, with high Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. Meanwhile, no significant distinction could be observed regarding their catalytic performance during long-term operation. During the CO2RR process, all Bi2S3 morphologies initially turn into similar nanocomposites of Bi and Bi2O2CO3 sheets, which subsequently undergo a topotactic transformation into metallic Bi nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations indicate that such a topotactic transformation is conducive to the CO2RR due to the superior activity and selectivity of metallic Bi nanoparticles. These findings shed light on the impact of the topotactic transformation of bismuth-based catalysts on the CO2RR, providing insights into the structure–activity relationship.

The decentralization of electricity authority in Nigeria has made it expedient for the South-West Geopolitcal Zone to develop strategic power generation infrastructure. This study assessed the techno-economic viability of the liquefied petroleum gas-powered alternative electricity infrastructure option in Southwestern Nigeria as a mitigation strategy to endemic inadequate grid power supply under the region's integrated electric power programmes. An energy project planning and foresight analysis methodology was used. The study showed that a 25 MW stand-alone LPG-based CHP power plant would require 8.567 acres of land, consume approximately 15.459 million kg of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) annually, while generating 210,240 MWh of electricity annually. This power plant initiative was considered to have acceptable risk (Payback Period = 9 years 3 months; Return on Investment = 10.73%) and viability at the minimum tariff of $0.11/kWh. It also had considerable annual CO2 emissions and fuel cost savings (255.75 metric kilotonnes and $137.58 million respectively) relative to diesel-based alternative power generation. The study recommended that the viability of the power plant be improved by reductions in operations costs. The study concluded that the LPG plant initiative was technically feasible, economically viable and environmentally friendly, and suitable for deployment in the study area.

While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber‐Bosch process, the high bond energy of N≡N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low‐temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the activated nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal‐organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe‐based catalyst MIL‐100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4 mmol g‐1 h‐1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL‐100(Fe) during the plasma‐driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe‐O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL‐100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL‐100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate‐limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

Microbial grouting technology based on microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a new soil improvement method. This technique involves injecting bacteria and a cementation solution into soil pores to generate CaCO3 precipitation, thereby enhancing soil strength. Studies on microbial grouting from the aspects of experimental studies, theoretical models and engineering applications were extensively reviewed. Factors such as grouting methods, grouting rate, cementation solution concentration, and pH significantly influence the size and distribution of CaCO3. The three-phase grouting method enhances bacterial adsorption and soil strength. The higher grouting rate (grouting rate greater than reaction rate) and low pH (pH is not lower than 4) facilitate the uniform distribution of CaCO3. The size of CaCO3 and the soil strength increase with increasing cementation solution concentration. The existing models were established based on equilibrium flow, which overlooks the reduction of solute migration distance caused by the non-uniformity of the medium. Micro-structural analysis shows that CaCO3 precipitation between adjacent soil particles acts as a matrix supporting to increase soil strength. Microbial grouting technology can employ CaCO3 precipitation to seal wellbore cracks for CO2 storage and cement soil particles for slope stability and foundation improvement. Finally, the challenges encountered in microbial grouting technology were discussed.

Drought stress is one of the most critical threats to crop productivity and global food security. This review addresses the multiple effects of drought on the process of photosynthesis in major food crops. Affecting both light-dependent and light-independent reactions, drought leads to severe damage to photosystems and blocks the electron transport chain. Plants face a CO2 shortage provoked by stomatal closure, which triggers photorespiration; not only does it reduce carbon fixation efficiency, but it also causes lower overall photosynthetic output. Drought-induced oxidative stress generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage cellular structures, including chloroplasts, further impairing photosynthetic productivity. Plants have evolved a variety of adaptive strategies to alleviate these effects. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanisms help dissipate excess light energy as heat, protecting the photosynthetic apparatus under drought conditions. Alternative electron pathways, such as cyclical electron transmission and chloroplast respiration, maintain energy balance and prevent over-reduction of the electron transport chain. Hormones, especially abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and cytokinin, modulate stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, and osmotic adjustment, further increasing the tolerance to drought. Structural adjustments, such as leaf reordering and altered root architecture, also strengthen tolerance. Understanding these complex interactions and adaptive strategies is essential for developing drought-resistant crop varieties and ensuring agricultural sustainability.

The carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) toward C2+ and C3+ products such as propylene and cyclopropane can not only reduce anthropogenic emissions of CO and CO2 but also produce value-added organic chemicals for polymer and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we introduce the concept of triple atom catalysts (TACs) that have three intrinsically strained and active metal centers for reducing CO to C3+ products. We applied grand canonical potential kinetics (GCP-K) to screen 12 transition metals (M) supported by nitrogen-doped graphene denoted as M3N7, where M stands for Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au. We sought catalysts with favorable CO binding, hydrogen binding, and C–C dimerization energetics, identifying Fe3N7 and Ir3N7 as the best candidates. We then studied the entire reaction mechanism from CO to C3H6 and C2H4 as a function of applied potential via, respectively, 12-electron and 8-electron transfer pathways on Fe3N7 and Ir3N7. Density functional theory (DFT) predicts an overpotential of 0.17 VRHE for Fe3N7 toward propylene and an overpotential of 0.42 VRHE toward cyclopropane at 298.15 K and pH = 7. Also, DFT predicts an overpotential of 0.15 VRHE for Ir3N7 toward ethylene. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of advanced catalysts for C2+ and C3+ synthesis at room temperature.

Microbial communities of terrestrial mud volcanoes are involved in aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation, but the biological mechanisms of these processes are still understudied. We have investigated the taxonomic composition, rates of methane oxidation, and metabolic potential of microbial communities in five mud volcanoes of the Taman Peninsula, Russia. Methane oxidation rates measured by the radiotracer technique varied from 2.0 to 460 nmol CH4 cm−3 day−1 in different mud samples. This is the first measurement of high activity of microbial methane oxidation in terrestrial mud volcanos. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has shown that Bacteria accounted for 65–99% of prokaryotic diversity in all samples. The most abundant phyla were Pseudomonadota, Desulfobacterota, and Halobacterota. A total of 32 prokaryotic genera, which include methanotrophs, sulfur or iron reducers, and facultative anaerobes with broad metabolic capabilities, were detected in relative abundance >5%. The most highly represented genus of aerobic methanotrophs was Methyloprofundus reaching 36%. The most numerous group of anaerobic methanotrophs was ANME-2a-b (Ca. Methanocomedenaceae), identified in 60% of the samples and attaining relative abundance of 54%. The analysis of the metagenome-assembled genomes of a community with high methane oxidation rate indicates the importance of CO2 fixation, Fe(III) and nitrate reduction, and sulfide oxidation. This study expands current knowledge on the occurrence, distribution, and activity of microorganisms associated with methane cycle in terrestrial mud volcanoes.

High light (HL) significantly impacts plant photosynthesis. This study investigated the effects of different magnesium (Mg) levels (0, 1, 2, and 5 mol Mg plant⁻1; HMg0, HMg1, HMg2, and HMg5) on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Cuibi No. 1) under HL (1500 μmol m⁻2 s⁻1), aiming to understand the role of Mg in mitigating the impact of HL on photosynthesis and carbon–nitrogen metabolism. Plants treated with 1 mol Mg plant⁻1 under 750 μmol m⁻2 s⁻1 light conditions served as the control. HL led to a reduced chlorophyll (Chl) content and inhibited the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax). It also decreased energy involved in photosynthetic electron transfer (ET) and electron flux to reduction end-electron acceptors at the photosystems I (PSI) acceptor side (RE) and caused photosynthetic system damage. H2O2 accumulation exacerbated membrane lipid peroxidation damage, disrupting carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and inducing antioxidant enzyme activity. HMg2 increased Chl content, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, and the net photosynthetic rate compared to HMg0. It enhanced ET efficiency, PSI and PSII functionality, reduced dissipated energy flux (DI), and minimized photosynthesis damage. Conversely, excessive Mg application (HMg5) decreased Pmax and PSII activity, increasing DI. Adequate Mg supply alleviated HL’s detrimental effects by enhancing Chl content and ET and RE efficiency.

Wind power generation has increased in China to achieve the target of decreasing CO2 emissions by 2050, but there are high levels of wind curtailment due to the mismatch between electricity supply and demand. This paper proposes a single-stage air source heat pump coupled with thermal storage for building heating purposes. The main objective is to find the proper system designs and operating strategy, which can help to avoid peak demand periods while obtaining minimized running costs and reduced wind energy curtailment. Dynamic simulations were performed using TRNSYS to investigate its use in a typical office building based on an actual electricity tariff, wind power, and meteorological data. The proper system designs, including the tank size and thermal storage temperature, were determined to maximize the system’s performance. It was found that a proper combination of the two parameters exists for a specific application. Further, results showed that the use of auxiliary electric heating is necessary for single-stage air source heat pumps to participate in a wind curtailment reduction. The operating strategy of the system was also studied. Results indicate that by implementing a proper operating strategy, non-renewable power consumption can be reduced by 11% for the studied building, with a total wind power utilization of 3348 kWh during the heating season while still satisfying the heating demands of users. These findings can contribute to the green and low-carbon development of the building industry and further enhance the grid’s accommodation capacity for renewable energy sources.

While significant progress has been made in carbon abatement, evidenced in literature produced over the past year, particularly within the realm of carbon capture and storage (CCS), I’d like to invite your attention to three key topics in this discussion. First, despite more than 3 decades of intense focus on emissions issues, highlighted since the 1980s and formalized with the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, global emissions have only increased instead of going down. It’s imperative to question the efficacy, premises, practicality, and overlooked hurdles of current approaches. Paper SPE 214950, summarized here, sheds light on some of these challenges. It emphasizes that implementing costly carbon-abatement methods in a world marked by sharp regional economic disparities with wealth concentrated in a few countries could worsen economic inequalities by making access to energy even less equitable. Additionally, paper SPE 215050 (included in the list for further reading) underscores the priority of energy security over carbon reduction, citing recent evidence from leading proponent nations of climate action resorting to the use of coal. Failing to address energy security and economic disparity, though these are not the only obstacles, could hinder progress toward societal carbon-reduction goals. My second topic for your kind attention is the progress made on the CCS front, on which an overwhelming number of papers (approximately 75% of those reviewed) were presented at SPE conferences last year. An ongoing challenge with CCS, particularly in deep saline aquifers, is the prolonged period required for injected CO2 to chemically react and solidify for permanent storage. Paper SPE 215352, summarized here, introduces a different perspective based on the author’s exposure to another industry: proposing the coinjection of CaCl2 to expedite the permanent storage of CO2, potentially addressing this issue. The third topic that you will find interesting is developments on the hydrogen front, aimed at replacing direct use of fossil fuels as energy vectors. The cost of producing green hydrogen is expected to come down with advancement of technology, at least in some geographical areas, as the second paper shortlisted for further reading, paper IPTC 23652, suggests. One promising application involves using excess solar power during the day to convert hydrogen and store it underground for use when sunlight is unavailable. This could green the so-called peaker plants. While the approach of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) undoubtedly has the advantage of storing large amounts of energy, it may still struggle to compete with utility-scale battery storage in terms of the associated round-trip energy efficiency. There are many technoeconomic challenges to be solved in the hydrogen-based energy approach, including in the UHS context, before it can be used at a significant scale. Despite some previous experience with controlled and small-scale application of UHS, much remains to be learned about its safety and economics. The risks include leakage hazards, underground chemical reactions, loss from residual trapping, and contamination, among others. However, papers like IPTC 23943, one summarized here, along with the third one selected for further reading, paper SPE 215489, underline the necessity and the strides being made by the engineering community in overcoming these technological challenges.

L-asparaginase (L-asnase) is a versatile enzyme with uses in food industry and medicine. Current study aimed to isolate L-asnase producing microorganism/s without urease and glutaminase and optimize L-asnase production. First, screening and isolation of L-asnase-producing bacterial strains that did not produce glutaminase and urease from chicken gizzards were performed. For this purpose, the enzyme producing bacteria were screened on the agar medium supplied with substrate and phenol red indicator dye. Among the isolated bacteria, 1 isolate showed L-asnase free of glutaminase and urease. The selected strain was identified by biochemical, morphological and 16s rRNA sequencing. The selected strain was identified as Bacillus atrophaeus by 16S rRNA sequencing. The effects of incubation temperature (30°C) and time (72 hours), medium pH (8.0) and nutritional sources (glucose and NaNO3) on L-asnase production were determined. L-asnase was purified with acetone, and its molecular weight was determined to be 42 kDa by SDS-Page. Enzyme kinetics were also calculated, and it was determined that Vmax was 43 μmol/mL/min and Km was 2.7 mM. L-asnase activity was highest at 40 ℃ and the optimal pH was 8.0. L-asnase activity was stimulated by Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ but inhibited by Co2+, Na+, Zn2+, and Hg2+. L-asnase was utilized to treat potato chips before they were fried in order to assess its capacity to mitigate acrylamide. The result was an 80% reduction in acrylamide concentration when compared to the untreated control. Based on these findings, it appears that L-asnase could have potential use in the food industry.

Nuclear power plants and research purposed reactors produce spent nuclear fuel, which leads to a need for safe spent fuel management and radiation protection. Traditionally, concrete with the addition of different aggregates has been the primary material for shielding against radiation and is used also for transport and storage of radioactive waste. Despite these applications, there is still a need to develop new composite materials that will preserve the radiation shielding properties of concrete, while offering superior mechanical and also cost effective benefits. This article investigates the radiation shielding properties of HI-STORM containers, made of a new composite material, and reinforced with basalt-boron fibre for human and environment protection. In the concrete recipe, part of the cement is replaced by oil shale ash with cementitious characteristics. The formulation of concrete reinforced with basalt-boron fibre (with the addition of 6% boron oxide) is presented. Oil shale ash (OSA) is a class-C fly ash, a by-product in the energy production process. OSA can be used as a partial replacement to cement in concretes, thanks to its cement-like qualities and low carbon content, which contributes to a reduction in the overall CO2 footprint of concrete. In our investigated concrete mixes 5 to 35% of cement was replaced by OSA (Electrostatic Precipitator Ash) coming from Auvere (Estonia) thermal power plant. Using the Monte Carlo method, the Serpent code was used to simulate the passage of neutron radiation through a composite material to assess its biological shielding properties. It is shown that the addition of basalt-boron fibre to concrete improves the protective properties of biological shielding against neutron radiation.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">Engine and aftertreatment solutions have been identified to meet the upcoming ultra-low NO<sub>x</sub> regulations on heavy duty vehicles in the United States. These standards will require changes to current conventional aftertreatment systems for dealing with low exhaust temperature scenarios while increasing the useful life of the engine and aftertreatment system. Previous studies have shown feasibility of meeting the US EPA and California Air Resource Board (CARB) requirements. This work includes a 15L diesel engine equipped with cylinder deactivation (CDA) and an aftertreatment system that was fully DAAAC aged to 800,000 miles. The aftertreatment system includes an e-heater (electric heater), light-off Selective Catalytic Reduction (LO-SCR) followed by a primary aftertreatment system containing a DPF and SCR. The e-heater was capable of providing up to 10 kW, however for the purpose of this project, lower power settings of 2.5 kW and 5 kW were studied in combination with CDA for lowest possible CO2 emissions. Test cycles included the heavy duty FPT (hot and cold), a low load cycle, a beverage cycle, and a stay hot operation. The data found in this study show how the application of a low power e-heater enables an engine with CDA and an aftertreatment system after 800,000 miles aging to meet ultra-low NO<sub>x</sub> emissions with minimum CO<sub>2</sub> penalty.</div></div>

Speciation of selected heavy metals in Abuja metropolitan soil samples was investigated using a sequential extraction analytical technique. Flame atomic absorption spectrometer was used for instrumental analysis. Metals were bound in six operational phases, in the sequential extraction method. Pb, Mn and Cd speciate more in exchangeable, As and Ni speciate more in bound to carbonate, Cu and Fe speciate more in bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Cr and Zn speciate more in organically bound while Al speciate more in residual in urban soil samples. In sub-urban samples, Pb and Cd speciate more in exchangeable and bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Cu speciate more in exchangeable, Al speciate more in bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Fe and Al speciate more in residual, Ni and As speciate more in bound to carbonate, Zn speciate more in organically bound and Cr speciate more in exchangeable and organically bound. Asokoro Forest (control) has most of the metals as non-residuals except Al and As which speciate more in residual phase. Sequence of ionic mobility in decreasing order for Abuja urban soils is as follows: Zn>Cu>Fe>Al>Mn>>As>Ni>Cr>Cd>Pb and in sub-urban soil samples is: Zn>Cu>Fe>Al>Mn>>Ni>As>Pb>Cd>Cr. From the results, it can be deduced that Zn is the ion with highest speciation. This portends danger to Abuja metropolis due to Zn phytoxicity which hinders photosynthesis in plants, thereby increasing the amount of CO2 giving rise to global warming. This requires that relevant authorities should enforce reduction of the activities that lead to abundance of Zn in Abuja soils.

Livestock and poultry products are an essential human food source. However, the rapid development of the livestock sector (LS) has caused it to become a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Consequently, investigating the spatio-temporal characteristics and evolution of GHG emissions is crucial to facilitate the green development of the LS and achieve "peak carbon and carbon neutrality". This study combined life cycle assessment (LCA) with the IPCC Tier II method to construct a novel GHG emissions inventory. The GHG emissions of 31 provinces in China from 2000 to 2021 were calculated, and their spatio-temporal characteristics were revealed. Then, the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model was used to identify the main driving factors of GHG emissions in six regions of China and explore the emission reduction potential. The results showed that GHG emissions increased and then decreased from 2000 to 2021, following a gradual and steady trend. The peak of 628.55 Mt CO2-eq was reached in 2006. The main GHG-producing segments were enteric fermentation, slaughtering and processing, and manure management, accounting for 45.39 %, 26.34 %, and 23.08 % of total GHG emissions, respectively. Overall, the center of gravity of GHG emissions in China migrated northward, with spatial aggregation observed since 2016. The high emission intensity regions were mainly located west of the "Hu Huanyong line". Economic efficiency and emissions intensity were the main drivers of GHG emissions. Under the baseline scenario, GHG emissions are not projected to peak until 2050. Therefore, urgent action is needed to promote the low-carbon green development of the LS in China. The results can serve as scientific references for the macro-prevention and control of GHG emissions, aiding strategic decision-making. Additionally, they can provide new ideas for GHG accounting in China and other countries around the world.

Abstract Despite high expectations about the role of carbon removal in meeting global climate targets, many of the proposed techniques remain nascent. This is especially so for techniques with potential for large-scale, permanent removal of CO2, such as Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) and Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE). In such a context, understanding public attitudes is crucial but challenging, since we do not have enough information about the sociotechnical configurations which might accompany such proposals over future timescales. Carbon removal at scale will not take place in a vacuum – it will co-evolve within political, social, economic, and legal structures which in turn will have a strong influence on public attitudes. This study used a nationally-representative survey (n=1,978) in the UK to test the impact of alternative sociotechnical systems on public attitudes to DACCS and OAE. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five scenario conditions, representing different forms of governance logic (top-down vs bottom-up) and market logic (planned vs liberal economy), plus one with minimal sociotechnical information. We find that the scenario condition significantly impacted perceptions of OAE, with participants preferring its implementation within a bottom-up, planned economy scenario, and rejecting scenarios which most closely resembled the status quo. There were no significant differences between scenarios for DACCS, suggesting that the technology may be more flexible across alternative sociotechnical arrangements. OAE arouses more negative emotions, particularly worry about impacts on ocean ecosystems, whereas DACCS arouses more hope. We found that climate worry is associated with stronger emotions – both positive and negative – toward both techniques, thus CDR could be polarising for the most climate-worried, likely due to tensions between climate urgency and concerns about deterring emissions reductions. The most important criteria for future CDR deployment were deemed to be biodiversity, durability, and cost, with a strong discourse around the current cost-of-living crisis.

Abstract Considering future developments and plans of decarbonization, the H2 pipeline transport technology will play a key role, and it could also be implemented as a component of an integrated system with CO2 pipelines (i.e. blue hydrogen). A key aspect of H2 technology development is the possibility to use existing natural gas transport infrastructure to be retrofitted for H2 transport. It is recognized that the transport of natural gas mixtures containing a 10% of hydrogen content could be in general feasible in existing onshore natural gas pipeline systems with minor modifications. Higher hydrogen contents, however, appear to have a large impact on the system components, requiring significant modifications instead. The more important bottleneck is related to the utilization of carbon steel grades normally used for natural gas transmission pipelines. Most of literature sources report a higher susceptibility of high steel grades to hydrogen embrittlement, i.e. the loss of toughness in steel which results from adsorption of hydrogen. Corresponding to the loss of net material toughness is a reduction in fatigue life, causing crack growth and propagation. There is a need to complement existing standards on hydrogen piping, pipeline and their components part of the hydrogen value chain to fulfill the energy transition design scenarios and the need to reuse existing gas transport infrastructure to support the economics of the transition. This translates to the definition of a clear methodology to carry out the assessment of existing natural gas pipeline systems (both onshore and offshore), in such a way to identify the tolerance to hydrogen of the different system components. All the engineering disciplines need to be involved, including piping & materials, machinery, instrumentation, as well as loss prevention & safety. Since the potential transport service conversion is normally carried out in steps, starting from a low H2 content in the blend with natural gas up to possibly 100% H2, the number of affected components will increase during this evolution; some of them could be ready to tolerate 100% H2 from the beginning, others will need some modifications, while some will need a complete replacement. This paper presents a description of Saipem methodology, that has been applied to a number of conversion studies relevant to transport systems mainly located in Europe.

Abstract. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are powerful anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) with high global-warming potentials (GWPs). They have been widely used as refrigerants, insulation foam-blowing agents, aerosol propellants, and fire suppression agents. Since the mid-1990s, emissions of HFCs have been increasing rapidly as they are used in many applications to replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) whose consumption and production have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol (MP). Due to the high GWP of HFCs, the Kigali Amendment to the MP requires the phasedown of production and consumption of HFCs to gradually achieve an 80 %–85 % reduction by 2047, starting in 2019 for non-Article 5 (developed) countries with a 10 % reduction against each defined baseline and later schedules for Article 5 (developing) countries. In this study, we have examined long-term high-precision measurements of atmospheric abundances of five major HFCs (HFC-134a, HFC-143a, HFC-32, HFC-125, and HFC-152a) at Gosan station, Jeju Island, South Korea, from 2008 to 2020. Background abundances of HFCs gradually increased, and the inflow of polluted air masses with elevated abundances from surrounding source regions were detected over the entire period. From these pollution events, we inferred regional and country-specific HFC emission estimates using two independent Lagrangian particle dispersion models and Bayesian inversion frameworks (FLEXPART-FLEXINVERT+ and NAME-InTEM). The spatial distribution of the derived “top-down” (measurement based) emissions for all HFCs shows large fluxes from megacities and industrial areas in the region. Our most important finding is that HFC emissions in eastern China and Japan have sharply increased from 2016 to 2018. The contribution of East Asian HFC emissions to the global total increased from 9 % (2008–2014) to 13 % (2016–2020). In particular, HFC emissions in Japan (Annex I country) rose rapidly from 2016 onward, with accumulated total inferred HFC emissions being ∼ 114 Gg yr−1, which is ∼ 76 Gg yr−1 higher for 2016–2020 than the “bottom-up” (i.e., based on activity data and emission factors) emissions of ∼ 38 Gg yr−1 reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is likely related to the increase in domestic demand in Japan for refrigerants and air-conditioning-system-related products and incomplete accounting. A downward trend of HFC emissions that started in 2019 reflects the effectiveness of the F-gas policy in Japan. Eastern China and South Korea, though not obligated to report to the UNFCCC, voluntarily reported emissions, which also show differences between top-down and bottom-up emission estimates, demonstrating the need for atmospheric measurements, comprehensive data analysis, and accurate reporting for precise emission management. Further, the proportional contribution of each country's CO2-equivalent HFC emissions has changed over time, with HFC-134a decreasing and HFC-125 increasing. This demonstrates the transition in the predominant HFC substances contributing to global warming in each country.

Mulching cultivation with agricultural wastes is the main production pattern of coffee at present, but the effect of mulching cultivation on photosynthetic physiological processes of coffee plants is still not clear. Therefore, a randomized block design was adopted to establish a field experiment by one-year-old Coffee Canephora seedlings in this study. There were four types of mulch treatments, including non-mulch coffee waste (C), mulching coffee litter (L), mulching coffee cascara (cherry pericarp, P), and mulching coffee litter and cascara (LP) in this field experiment. Soil properties and microenvironment (e.g., moisture, temperature, pH, bulk density, organic matter content, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen content, available potassium content, and available potassium content), agronomic traits (e.g., specific leaf area, leaf area index, plant height, and relative chlorophyll content), and photosynthetic indices (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration, respiration, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, water use efficiency, and carbon use efficiency) were investigated to determine the effects of different coffee waste mulches on the photosynthetic physiology of coffee seedlings. The results show that coffee litter and cascara mulch significantly reduced soil temperature by 0.42 or 0.33 °C, respectively, and coffee litter rather than cascara mulch significantly increased the soil’s available potassium content by 46.28%, although coffee waste mulch did not affect other soil properties or microenvironment indices; coffee cascara mulching significantly increased the specific leaf area and net and gross photosynthesis of coffee by 45.46%, 78.33%, and 91.72%, respectively, but the mulching treatments did not affect stomatal conductance, transpiration, or carbon use efficiency in this study. Additionally, coffee cascara mulching increased leaf respiration and net and gross water use efficiency by 109.34%, 80.54%, and 104.95%, respectively. The coffee cascara mulching alone had the most significant positive impact on the photosynthetic index, followed by a combination of litter and cascara, litter alone, and the control treatment. The observed variations in the coffee photosynthetic index may be attributed to the reduction of soil temperature caused by mulching treatments rather than the increase in soil nutrients content. These results indicate that coffee cascara mulching could effectively promote photosynthesis and the growth of coffee seedlings by improving the soil microenvironment.

The rising electricity costs, cost of space heating, and domestic hot water end up driving consumers toward reducing expenses by generating their electricity through devices like photovoltaic systems and efficient combined heat and power plants. When coupled with thermal systems via an energy management system (EMS) in a Multi-Energy System (MES), this self-produced electricity can effectively lower electricity and heating bills. However, MESs with EMSs can serve various purposes beyond cost reduction via self-consumption, such as reacting to variable electricity prices, meeting special grid connection conditions, or minimizing CO2 emissions. These diverse strategies create unique prosumer profiles, deviating significantly from standard load profiles. The potential threat to the power grid arises as grid operators lack visibility into which consumers employ which control strategies. This paper investigates the impact of controlled MESs on the power grid compared to average households and answers whether new control strategies affect the planning strategies of low voltage grids. It proposes a comprehensive four-step toolchain for the detailed simulation of thermal–electrical load profiles, MES control strategies, and grid dynamics. It includes a new method for the grid impact analysis of extreme and average bulk values. As a result, this study identifies three primary factors influencing distribution power grids by MESs. Firstly, the presence and scale of photovoltaic (PV) systems significantly affect extreme values in the grid. Secondly, MESs incorporating combined heat and power (CHP) and heat pump (HP) units impact the overall grid performance, mainly reflected in bulk values. Thirdly, the placement of an MES with heating systems, especially when concentrated in one feeder, plays a crucial role in grid dynamics. Despite the three distinct factors identified as impactful on the power grid, this study reveals that the various control strategies, despite leading to vastly different grid profiles, do not exhibit divergent impacts on buses, lines, or transformers. Remarkably, the impact of MESs remains consistently similar across the range of control strategies studied. Therefore, different control strategies do not pose an additional challenge to the grid integration of MESs.

Abstract The influence of individual solvents (ethyl acetate and tetralin) as hydrogen donors on the nature of the conversion of organic matter of low-permeable shale Domanik rock from the Mendym deposits of the Upper Devonian of the Tavel deposit (Tatarstan, Russia) during hydrothermal processes was studied. The experiments were carried out at a temperature of 300°C in a CO2 environment with a water content in the reaction system of a 1:1 to sample of rock and an exposure time of 24 hours. The degree of conversion of kerogen into extractable hydrocarbons was determined by Rock-Eval and thermal analysis methods. The changes in the composition of the formed hydrocarbons were evaluated using different technic such as gas chromatography (GC) analysis of evolved gasses, SARA analysis, GC-MS of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons) and elemental analysis before and after hydrothermal experiments. The results showed that, ethyl acetate does not exhibit the properties of a hydrogen proton donor but intensifies the destruction of kerogen. The results of GC-MS showed that, the ethyl acetate almost completely decomposes to acetic acid, which, in turn, due to its effect on the carbonate component of the rock, promotes the extraction of high-molecular components associated with the rock and the destruction of kerogen along the least stable C-S bonds. This is demonstrated by a higher presence of H2S in the gas composition compared to the control hydrothermal experiment. Additionally, there's an increase in the yield of extract from the rock, along with a higher content of high molecular weight components, consequently raising the sulfur content and the abundance of benzothiophenes in the aromatic fraction. Under these experimental conditions, tetralin not only enhances the conversion of organic matter from the Domanik rock into extractable hydrocarbons but also facilitates the removal of heteroatomic compounds by transferring hydrogen donors, which inhibit radical reactions. This leads to the elimination of alkyl substituents and the formation of lower molecular weight hydrocarbons. The results of GC-MS measurements of the aromatic hydrocarbons obtained confirm these processes. Specifically, a comparison with the control experiment reveals the formation of 1,4-dihydronaphthalene, naphthalene, and 1-, 2-methylnaphthalene in the composition. In addition, tetralin is not completely converted under these conditions and partially remains in the extract, also acting as a diluent, which can facilitate easier transportation of the extracted oil. The utilization of tetralin during hydrothermal treatment of kerogen-containing Domanik rock leads to several notable outcomes. Firstly, there is an increase in the yield of hydrocarbon gases. Additionally, the yield of oil extract rises, marked by more than a two-fold increase in the content of saturated hydrocarbons. Furthermore, there is a notable reduction in the content of resins by 1.5 times and a three-fold decrease in benzothiophenes within the aromatic fraction. Moreover, the presence of dibenzothiophenes is not detected, and the extract exhibits the lowest total sulfur content compared to all conducted experiments.
