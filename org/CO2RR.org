Iron porphyrins are molecular catalysts recognized for their ability to electrochemically and photochemically reduce carbon dioxide (CO2). The main reduction product is carbon monoxide (CO). CO holds significant industrial importance as it serves as a precursor for various valuable chemical products containing either a single carbon atom (C1), like methanol or methane, or multiple carbon atoms (Cn), such as ethanol or ethylene. Despite the long‐established efficiency of these catalysts, optimizing their catalytic activity and stability and comprehending the intricate reaction mechanisms remain a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO using an iron porphyrin substituted with four trimethylammonium groups in the para position [(pTMA)FeIII‐Cl]4+. By employing infrared and UV‐Visible spectroelectrochemistry, changes in the electronic structure and coordination environment of the iron center can be observed in real‐time as the electrochemical potential is adjusted, offering new insights into the reaction mechanisms. Catalytic species were identified, and evidence of a secondary reaction pathway was uncovered, potentially prompting a re‐evaluation of the nature of the catalytically active species.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has the potential to adequately contribute to addressing the energy and environmental challenges faced by the humanity today. The surplus of CO 2 produced by burning fossil fuels can be transformed into valuable products by CO 2 RR. An effective use of this approach on a large scale requires active, selective, and stable CO 2 reduction electrocatalysts. Additionally, insightful understanding of interfacial behavior such as water wetting and carbonate formation at the electrode is required to enhance the performance and durability of CO 2 RR electrocatalysts. 1 Atomically dispersed Ni-N-C materials have attracted attention due to their superior selectivity for CO generation. 2 Their activity and selectivity of CO 2 RR are influenced by the metal center and local atomic defects in M-N-C catalysts. 3 In addition to catalyst structures, electrode composition and structure have also substantial impact on the activity and selectivity of CO 2 RR. Particularly, ionomer compositions and the electrode fabrication process can alter the hydrophobicity of the electrode and the local pH on the catalyst, resulting in considerable changes in CO 2 RR activity and selectivity. In this presentation, we will report on the performance of various electrodes fabricated with the Ni-N-C catalyst, using different types of ionomers and measured in a flow cell and zero-gap electrolyzer at > 100 mA/cm 2 current densities for CO 2 RR. We will also introduce an approach that aims at reducing carbonate formation at the CO 2 RR electrolyzer cathode by the modifications to the electrolyte composition, the CO 2 inlet humidity, and the electrochemical cell temperature.

In the context of clean energy and green chemical production, the two-phase flow electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to formate has gained considerable interest, and efforts are being made to scale up the process [1] . With respect to electrode design, unlike in the simpler single-phase system, which is limited by the solubility of CO 2 in the electrolyte and by the mass transport of the dissolved CO 2 gas from the bulk of the electrolyte to the cathode surface [2] , mixed gas/liquid flow in the trickle bed reactor [3] or segregated flow in the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) [4] reactor provide more efficient gas delivery at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. This enhanced the overall mass transfer coefficient and enabled higher reaction rates per unit geometric area of the electrodes, providing that the electrocatalyst layer's intrinsic activity and selectivity are established. Due to the limitation in retaining the effective electroactive bed thickness in the trickle bed reactor [3] , GDEs are preferred for high current density operations (typically above 100 mA cm -2 ). Despite the continuous gas transport mechanism, the reported performance in the GDE-based system lies around 200 mA cm -2 , with occasional reports above 200 mA cm -2 but on a tiny electrode area (typically 1 cm 2 or below) [5] . The flooding of the GDE porous structure is believed to be the prime cause that limits electrode durability at high current density. Here, we present the optimization of the two-phase flow dynamics and the GDE (with 20 cm 2 geometric area) operating conditions to enable high current density operation up to 500 mA cm -2 using a tin-based catalyst layer and scalable reactor design. The performance was compared with other catalytic materials that were intrinsically active for CO 2 RR to formate. References [1] M.F. Philips, G.M.Gruter, M.T.M. Koper and K.J.P.

Most of the bacterial species form biofilms, in which microorganisms are attached to a surface and they are held together by extracellular polymeric substances that they produce. They tend to grow almost everywhere both on living or non-living surfaces. Biofilms are able to propagate charge within their structures and to transfer effectively electrons at interfaces, as well as they could exhibit electrocatalytic properties (e.g. in Microbial Fuels Cells). The application of microbes provides better flexibility: experiments with fuel cells can be operated at normal conditions (temperatures and pressures). Wide variety of microbial metabolic pathways gives the possibility to use aggregates of bacteria in diverse processes. Proposed electrochemical studies using bacterial biofilms (in the form of thin coatings on the glassy carbon electrodes) can be considered as an attempt to find efficient methods of using the energy produced by microorganisms and converting it to electricity. The ultimate goal of the present research has been to determine whether it is possible under laboratory conditions to perform electrocatalytic processes using the hybrid (composite) layers composed of aggregates of bacteria in pristine or modified forms. A biofilm formed by a strain of Yersinia enterocolitica ( Y. enterocolitica ) is characterized by a high physicochemical stability over a wide pH range (4-10) and temperatures (0-40°C).The subject of interest is a fairly complex reaction, electroreduction of carbon dioxide. There has been growing interest in the search of electrocatalytic anf photoelectrochemical systems capable of efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into fuels and utility chemicals. Our previously performed studies have clearly shown that the Y. enterocolitica biofilm itself has no activity with respect to reduction of CO 2 , however it acts as a good matrix for the catalytic (e.g. noble metal or metaloorganic) centers, because it affects the reaction mechanism and appears to decrease overpotential of the electroreduction processes. The conducted research shows that the composite materials containing bacterial biofilms can be successfully used to construct systems that have an electrocatalytic reactivity in the reduction of carbon dioxide. We will also address the possibility of dispersing the organometallic ruthenium (II) complex in the biological layer (biofilm). Indeed, the ruthenium (II) complex has been immobilized in the biofilm matrix by successive modification of the liquid medium ( Luria-Bertani medium) for culturing bacteria with a solution of the complex compound. In addition, the biological matrix was used (along with the ruthenium (II) complex molecules dispersed in its layer) as a protective coating, stabilizing the unstable p -type semiconductor - copper (I) oxide. The proposed hybrid co-catalytic system showed activity during the photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide and stability under semi-neutral experimental conditions. Finally, we are going to address the design of the above-mentioned catalytically active systems emphasizing the need to control the structure of the studied hybrid materials (in addition to their stability). Among important issues is the viability of bacteria in the biological membrane as well as elucidation of the role of the bacterial biofilm during the carbon dioxide reduction.

There were 40 million cows in the US in 2020 which provide necessary protein-rich food and are integral to the US economy. However, . Currently manure is managed simply by storing and spreading to nearby cropland as a fertilizer to reuse nutrients. Given the high water content and low nutrient concentration of manure, effective approaches to recover nutrients from manure wastewater and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are needed. Our group has recently developed ammonia (potassium) recovery from manure wastewater and co-production of chemicals using nutrient-selective redox material 1 . I will report my progress toward developing a new electrochemical strategy to achieve integrated ammonium (and potassium) nutrient recovery from manure wastewater and simultaneous biogas upgrading by electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide to formate and other locally useful products. This project will effectively mitigate CO 2 emissions in traditional manure processing and provide a sustainable strategy for resource recovery, distributed electrosynthesis of fertilizers and other value-added chemicals, paving the way to carbon-neutral agriculture.

Carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) presents numerous advantages in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and can be integrated with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Nevertheless, establishing an electrochemically stable catalytic system that can effectively decrease the overpotential while maintaining high current density and faradaic efficiency is challenging. The precise mechanisms causing the reactions and the specific functions of the electrode with electrolytes are still not fully understood. Hence, a significant increase in attention has been paid to using ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes for CO2ER. This phenomenon is attributed to the unique capabilities of ILs to reduce overpotential, increase current density, and improve electrochemical stability. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of incorporating ILs into electrolytes to comprehend the cation and anion influences on CO2ER reactions. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were employed to examine the reduction peaks and current density values for different electrolytes, respectively. Consequently, a 0.1 M NBu4PF6 acetonitrile solution containing 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [EMIM][BF4] demonstrated a significantly lower onset potential of the reduction by 320 mV. A reduced CO2ER efficiency involving ILs with long alkyl chains was also observed. Meanwhile, a novel hypothesis concerning molecular orbitals for the CO2ER reaction mechanism was discussed. Overall, various performance variables (reduction stability, applied potential, and current density) of CO2ER were improved using cations with short alkyl chains, anions with high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, and appropriate solvation media. These findings can serve as selection criteria to aid in choosing appropriate ionic liquids for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER).

Renewable electricity shows immense potential as a driving force for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in production of formate (HCOO‐) at industrial current density, providing a promising path for value‐added chemicals and chemical manufacturing. However, achieving high selectivity and stable production of HCOO‐ at industrial current density remains a challenge. Here, we present a robust Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs catalyst capable of regenerating necessary catalytic core (Bi‐O) through cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment. Notably, at 260 mA cm‐2, faradaic efficiency of HCOO‐ reaches an exceptional selectivity to 99.23%, maintaining above 90% even after 400h, which is longest reaction time reported at industrial current density. Furthermore, in stability test, the catalyst was constructed by CV reconstruction to achieve stable and efficient production of HCOO‐. In 20h reaction test, the catalyst has a rate of HCOO‐ production of 13.24mmol m‐2 s‐1, a HCOO‐ concentration of 1.91mol L‐1, and an energy consumption of 129.80kWh kmol‐1. In‐situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of Bi‐O structure during the gradual transformation of catalyst from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs to Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs. Theoretical studies highlight the pivotal role of Bi‐O structure in modifying the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, which further reduces energy barrier for *OCHO conversion in CO2RR.

The conversion of CO 2 into liquid fuels, using only sunlight and water, offers a promising path to carbon neutrality. An outstanding challenge is to achieve high efficiency and product selectivity. Here, we introduce a wireless photocatalytic architecture for conversion of CO 2 and water into methanol and oxygen. The catalytic material consists of semiconducting nanowires decorated with core–shell nanoparticles, with a copper-rhodium core and a chromium oxide shell. The Rh/CrOOH interface provides a unidirectional channel for proton reduction, enabling hydrogen spillover at the core–shell interface. The vectorial transfer of protons, electrons, and hydrogen atoms allows for switching the mechanism of CO 2 reduction from a proton-coupled electron transfer pathway in aqueous solution to hydrogenation of CO 2 with a solar-to-methanol efficiency of 0.22%. The reported findings demonstrate a highly efficient, stable, and scalable wireless system for synthesis of methanol from CO 2 that could provide a viable path toward carbon neutrality and environmental sustainability.

Visible light‐active photocatalysts play a crucial role in gas‐phase photocatalytic CO2 reduction, offering significant potential for sustainable energy conversion. Herein, we present the synthesis of spindle‐shaped Iron (Fe)‐based metal‐organic framework (MOF) MIL‐88A, coupled with distinct α‐Bi2O3 nanospheres. The α‐Bi2O3/MIL88A heterostructure is formed by interacting opposite surface charges, enhancing visible‐light absorption and efficient interfacial charge‐carrier separation. Such low‐cost photocatalysts have a 1.75 eV band gap and demonstrate enhanced efficacy in converting CO2 to CO, CH4, and H2 in water without using any sacrificial agents or noble metals compared to pristine MIL88A. In addition, in situ Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) analyses revealed that these unique catalysts combination promoted enhanced interfacial charge dynamics, creating efficient trapping sites for photogenerated carriers. Further, in‐situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transfer Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) investigation elucidates the plausible reaction mechanism and provides an effective methodology for catalyst screening for CO2 photoreduction. This study offers an effective approach for synthesizing the earth‐abundant heterostructure from metal oxide and low‐cost MOFs, enhancing photocatalytic activity for sustainable carbon dioxide conversion into invaluable chemicals.

Abstract Quantifying regional health disparities linked to air pollution is essential for enhancing air quality and attaining carbon neutrality objectives. Nonetheless, the efficacy of proactive policies in ensuring equitable health protection in China's Eastern Coastal Area (ECA) remains uncertain. Here, we employed an integrated assessment model to assess the combined reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and atmospheric pollutants and their health repercussions in the ECA of China. Our findings reveal that 273,000 premature deaths are attributable to air pollution in 2060 in the ECA in the absence of mitigation policies. Conversely, carbon reduction policies are poised to curtail 80% of CO2 emissions, alongside reductions of 76% for NOx, 79% for SO2, 80% for PM2.5, 72% for VOCs, and 66% for NH3 emissions. Air pollution control policies could mitigate premature deaths by 19,600, while carbon reduction policies could potentially lower them by 50,800. The health inequality coefficient among provinces stands at 0.19, primarily attributable to significantly higher mortality rates in Hebei and Shandong. These findings yield valuable insights for crafting synergistic abatement strategies in similarly imbalanced developmental regions grappling with comparable environmental challenges.

The rapid utilization of fossil fuels escorted by an excess of CO2 emissions has led to global energy and environmental crisis. Therefore, the necessity for a clean, renewable and sustainable source of energy is a growing concern for the present and future society. In this regard, economically viable CO2 reduction would be a critical turnover in research, as it has the potential to fulfil a substantial need for clean energy. However, even though many efforts have been done in this field, there is still room for improvements concerning efficiency, material stability, and catalytic enhancement in regard of kinetics and selectivity. Herein, we provide the experimental proof for enhancement of the CO2 reduction efficiency and selectivity from the SEI (semiconductor-electrolyte interface) side through the use of carbonates, borates, sulphates and alkali cations as the electrolyte as well as an overview of the latest developments on Cu2O based PEC CO2 reduction for solar fuel production. Cu2O is a low-cost semiconductor and one of the most promising candidates for PEC CO2RR. However, its stability and performance is still unsatisfactory, thus the CO2 reduction products vary from one investigated system to another, such as: CH3OH, CO, HCOOH, CH3COOH, and CH3CH2OH. Moreover, the instability of Cu2O causes it, to be rarely used for the routine CO2 reduction reaction. In this paper, we use a very facile electrodeposition method, which offers a high level of reproducibility and the possibility of using a new electrode in each experiment, in order to focus our efforts on following the phenomena occurring in the double layer during the photocatalytic run. In this way, we were able to correlate the final CO2RR performance with a reorganization of the cations and anions near the photocatalyst surface. It is shown in the literature that factors such as: carbonate concentration, local pH, the presence of alkali metal cations, the geometry of the anionic group, CO2 solubility, conductivity, as well as pH changes along with the number of H+ in the electrolyte, play a significant role in regulating the partial CO2RR current. In this paper, we would like to shed new light on the influence of the electrolyte composition, cation-anion interaction and local reaction environment around the catalyst on the performance of CO2RR. We found out that the specific interaction between the alkali cation and the anionic group of particular geometry contributes to the formation of a kind of a “rigid layer” within the double diffusion, close to the photocatalyst surface layer, which accounts more for an apparent CO2RR current than the decrease in the finite Warburg element, which is a central key parameter for the diffusion coefficient values. The effectiveness of the strength of the cation-anion interaction in the formation of the “rigid layer” around the photocatalyst surface is found to increase the PEC CO2RR performance. Elucidating this mechanism provides useful information for creating further experimental design and the new pathways for addressing highly efficient PEC CO2RR systems. The authors have noticed a significant knowledge gap in the existing literature, as no prior publications have delved into the concurrent and combined impact of both cations and anions on PEC CO2RR. In this pioneering publication, we present the inaugural investigation of this this intricate phenomenon.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) into valuable chemicals represents an effective approach for realizing carbon neutralization goals. Copper oxide‐derived catalysts are particularly promising due to their tunable electronic structures. In this study, we focused on investigating the Ag2Cu2O3 model catalyst and a mixture of CuO and Ag2O with an identical metal molar ratio (denoted an M‐CuAgO). Electrochemical CO2RR tests revealed that Ag2Cu2O3 exhibited selectivity towards ethanol, while M‐CuAgO showed no selectivity towards multi‐carbon products. Characterizations of the post‐reaction materials showed differences in the specific crystal structures of the two catalysts. Further X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis demonstrated that the Ag2Cu2O3 structure, after the reaction, facilitated the transfer of electrons from Cu to Ag, thereby promoting the formation of multi‐carbon products. This work underscores the significance of structural design in precatalysts and opens up new avenues for the design of high‐performance catalysts.

The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or carbon monoxide (CO) to commodity fuels and chemicals, empowered by low-carbon electricity, has attracted much attention as an alternative to conventional routes of chemical production [1]. Numerous studies have focused on CO 2 reduction to CO or formic acid and active/efficient electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) have been developed [2]. However, CO 2 reduction to higher value C 2+ products needs the critical C-C coupling step, and to date, Cu has been the main electrocatalyst for this conversion [3]. Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) to C 2+ products has advantages over electrochemical CO 2 conversion (CO 2 RR) as issues such as carbonation, and CO 2 loss during CO 2 RR are omitted in CORR due to the stability of CO in alkaline solutions. Facing common challenges as CO 2 RR, CORR suffers more from mass transport resistance and intrinsically lower aqueous CO solubility. Therefore gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are desired to boost the formation of triple phases and active sites to obtain higher reaction rates. Herein for the first time we design Cu-based HFGDEs for efficient CORR to C 2+ products with ethylene as the main product. The pristine Cu HFGDEs showed low selectivity towards C 2+ products. Therefore, we tuned the Cu catalyst shape morphology and orientated growth of nanocubes on the outer surface of HFGDEs by electrodeposition. Due to the efficient C-C coupling and high C 2+ _ selectivity of copper nanocubes with dominant Cu(100), the HFGDEs showed exceptionally high current densities in the 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming conventional GDEs tested for CORR under similar conditions. Compared with CO 2 RR in a bicarbonate medium, significantly higher current densities and FEs of C 2+ products (>90%) and ethylene (>65%) were achieved when the HFGDE were used for CORR. Moreover, lower partial current densities of C 2+ were obtained when using the hollow fibers in the non-GDE mode, confirming the significant performance of HFGDEs for achieving high-rate and selective CO reduction through maximizing triple-phase interfaces and local CO concentration. By increasing the concentration of KOH, an ethylene partial current density of 472 mA cm 2- was obtained using the flow-cell reactor, indicating the promises of HFGDEs as an emerging electrode configuration for efficient CORR to C 2+ products.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂RR) represents a promising strategy for CO₂ mitigation, requiring highly efficient catalysts integrated into electrochemical devices to achieve high conversion rates and energy efficiencies for desired products. Establishing a gas diffusion electrode is crucial for practical applications of CO₂ electrochemical reduction reactions (CO₂RR). This study uses the air-spraying method to immobilise nano-catalysts onto a gas diffusion layer (GDL) with exceptional homogeneity. A composite of copper(I) oxide (Cu₂O) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles in a 4:1 ratio was deposited onto the GDL. Surface morphology analysis revealed the successful immobilisation of cubic Cu₂O and hexagonal wurtzite ZnO with a uniform distribution, indicating potential improvements in CO₂RR performance. Contact angle measurements were conducted to assess surface hydrophobicity, comparing pristine GDL with Cu₂O/ZnO-based GDL. Although the contact angle on the surface of the Cu₂O/ZnO-based GDL slightly reduced from 143.69° to 134.82°, it maintained its hydrophobic nature. This reduction is attributed to Nafion, a binder in the catalyst ink mixture. The sustained high contact angle is crucial for the CO₂ reduction reaction process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractograms of Cu₂O/ZnO-based GDL were compared with reference Cu₂O, ZnO, and bare GDL. The presence of all essential peaks confirms the successful immobilisation. The air-spraying technique effectively achieved a favourable distribution of active metals.

Bi‐based electrocatalysts have attracted high attention due to their high selectivity for formate, low cost, and high biocompatibility. Surface modification with halides can adjust the surface charge distribution of metal catalysts, thereby regulating the binding force of the intermediate. Organic‐inorganic hybrid bismuth halides provide an alternative, especially low dimensional structures. Herein, zero‐dimensional hybrid bismuth halides containing Bi4I16 units (denoted as Bi4I16) was recommended as pre‐catalyst due to the Bi∙∙∙Bi spacing in Bi4I16 is 4.760 Å, nearly equaling to the Bi∙∙∙Bi spacing in rhombohedral Bi (4.750 Å). The equal spacing may be more beneficial for the electricity‐driven in situ conversion and rearrangement of Bi atoms in the catalytic process. As a contrast, zero‐dimensional bismuth halide containing Bi2I9 units (denoted as Bi2I9) with shorter Bi∙∙∙Bi spacing (4.2415 Å) was prepared. The working electrode prepared by Bi4I16 ink was measured for CO2RR, and the partial formate current density can reach 8.2 mA cm−2 at −1.1 V vs RHE. The Bi4I16 catalyst delivers a maximum Faradaic Eﬃciency (FE, ~80%) for formate at −0.86 V vs RHE and maintain a FE higher than 78.5% after 16 h.

Converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into high-value-added chemicals using solar energy is a promising approach to reducing carbon dioxide emissions; however, single photocatalysts suffer from quick the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and poor photoredox ability. Herein, silver (Ag) nanoparticles featuring with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are combined with g-C3N4 to form a Schottky junction for photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction. The Ag/g-C3N4 exhibits higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity under UV-vis light; the CH4 and CO evolution rates are 10.44 and 88.79 µmol·h−1·g−1, respectively. Enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performances are attributed to efficient hot electron transfer in the Ag/g-C3N4 Schottky junction. LSPR-induced hot electrons from Ag nanoparticles improve the local reaction temperature and promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The charge carrier transfer route was investigated by in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) method verified the strong electromagnetic field at the interface between Ag and g-C3N4. The photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction pathway of Ag/g-C3N4 was investigated using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS). This study examines hot electron transfer in the Ag/g-C3N4 Schottky junction and provides a feasible way to design a plasmonic metal/polymer semiconductor Schottky junction for photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction.

To mitigate the greenhouse effect and environmental pollution caused by the consumption of fossil fuels, recent research has focused on developing renewable energy sources and new high-efficiency, environmentally friendly energy storage technologies. Among these, Li–CO2 batteries have shown great potential due to their high energy density, long discharge plateau, and environmental friendliness, offering a promising solution for achieving carbon neutrality while advancing energy storage devices. However, the slow kinetics of the CO2 reduction reaction and the accumulation of Li2CO3 discharge on the cathode surface lead to a significant reduction in space and active sites. This in turn results in high discharge overpotential, low energy efficiency, and low power density. This study elucidates the charge–discharge reaction mechanisms of lithium–carbon dioxide batteries and systematically analyzes their reaction products. It also summarizes the latest research advancements in cathode materials for these batteries. Furthermore, it proposes future directions and efforts for the development of Li–CO2 batteries.

Bio-energy systems with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) will be essential if countries are to meet the gas emission reduction targets established in the 2015 Paris Agreement. This study seeks to carry out a thermodynamic optimization and analysis of a BECCS technology for a typical Brazilian cogeneration plant. To maximize generated net electrical energy (MWe) and carbon dioxide CO2 capture (Mt/year), this study evaluated six cogeneration systems integrated with a chemical absorption process using MEA. A key performance indicator (gCO2/kWh) was also evaluated. The set of optimal solutions shows that the single regenerator configuration (REG1) resulted in more CO2 capture (51.9% of all CO2 emissions generated by the plant), penalized by 14.9% in the electrical plant’s efficiency. On the other hand, the reheated configuration with three regenerators (Reheat3) was less power-penalized (7.41%) but had a lower CO2 capture rate (36.3%). Results showed that if the CO2 capture rates would be higher than 51.9%, the cogeneration system would reach a higher specific emission (gCO2/kWh) than the cogeneration base plant without a carbon capture system, which implies that low capture rates (<51%) in the CCS system guarantee an overall net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in sugarcane plants for power and ethanol production.

The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) into higher-value materials is crucial for addressing escalating levels of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. Employing first-principles methods, we investigated the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and CO on two Fe-based MOFs: Fe2DOBDC and Fe2DSBDC. By directly comparing these MOFs, we aimed to discern the impact of introducing S atoms into the framework without changing the topological framework. Several chemical properties such as electronegativity, atomic radius, polarizability, and charge density are expected to lead to significant changes for the reduction reactions upon the replacement of O atoms with S atoms. CM5 atomic charge analysis highlights some of these differences by showing the equatorial Fe-O/S bonds of Fe2DSBDC are less polarized and result in smaller positive and negative charges on the Fe and O/S atoms, respectively. Additionally, the larger S atoms are expected to weaken adsorbate binding due to less favorable van der Waals interactions near the open-metal Fe site. Consequently, the less electropositive Fe site and the larger S atoms of Fe2DSBDC impede the adsorption of reduced CO2 and CO products, while the more electropositive Fe site and smaller O atoms of Fe2DOBDC strongly favor product adsorption. This implies that CO2 and CO reduction on Fe2DSBDC is likely to yield only 2e- products (HCOOH and CH2O, respectively), whereas Fe2DOBDC is expected to produce deeper reduction products (CH2O and CH4, respectively). This insight offers a foundation for constructing novel MOFs with tunable reaction behaviors by strategically replacing O atoms with heavier S atoms in the MOF scaffold.

The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two‐step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5% and 55.1%, respectively, at a current density of 700 mA cm‐2. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942 mA cm‐2 at 2000 mA cm‐2. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7‐fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.

The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two‐step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation.

The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added feedstock materials, fine chemicals, and fuels represents a crucial approach for meeting contemporary chemical demands while reducing dependence on petrochemical sources. Optimizing catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction can entail employing first principles methods to identify catalysts possessing desirable attributes, including the ability to form diverse products, selectively form few products, or exhibit favorable reaction kinetics. In this study, we investigate the CO2 reduction reaction on bimetallic Cu paddlewheel complexes, aiming to understand the impact metal substitution with Mn, Co, or Ni has on bimetallic paddlewheel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Substituting one of the Cu sites of the paddlewheel complex with Mn results in a more catalytically active Cu center, poised to produce substantial quantities of formic acid (HCOOH) and minor quantities of methane (CH4) with a suppressed production of C2 products such as ethanol (CH3CH2OH) or ethylene (C2H4). Moreover, the presence of Mn significantly reduces the limiting potential for CO2 reduction from 2.22 eV on the homo-bimetallic Cu paddlewheel complex to 1.19 eV, thereby necessitating a smaller applied potential. Conversely, within the Co-substituted paddlewheel complex, the Co site emerges as the primary catalytic center, selectively yielding CH4 as the sole reduced CO2 product, with a limiting potential of 1.22 eV. Notably, the Co site faces substantial competition from H2 production, attributed to a lower limiting potential of 0.81 eV for hydrogen reduction. Our examination of the Cu-Ni paddlewheel complex, featuring a Ni substituent site, reveals two catalytically active centers, each promoting distinct reductive processes. Both the Ni and Cu sites exhibit a propensity for HCOOH formation, with the Ni site favoring further reduction to CH4, while the Cu site directs the reaction towards methanol (CH3OH) production. The significance of this study lies in its potential to inform and streamline future experimental efforts, facilitating the synthesis and evaluation of novel catalysts with superior capabilities for CO2 reduction.

Soil has a high capacity for absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2). The significance of soil organic carbon (SOC) in tropical regions is often overlooked, despite its crucial role. This study investigates the potential of forest management to enhance the sequestration of SOC and rehabilitate degraded tropical ecosystems. Sequestering soil organic carbon has the potential to improve soil fertility while also mitigating land degradation and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The improvement of soil structure, aggregation, infiltration, faunal mobility, and nutrient cycling (specifically carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) is observed. Managing forest ecosystems enhances carbon sequestration, mitigates climate change, and rehabilitates degraded land. By integrating organic residue management with nitrogen-fixing plants, afforestation or reforestation of marginal or degraded lands can effectively increase carbon storage in both biomass and soil. This approach also promotes soil health, improves food productivity, restores land quality, and contributes to the reduction of GHG emissions. The sequestration of carbon promotes the biological, physical, and chemical fertility of the soil, hence enhancing soil health.

Abstract Carbon storage in soils is important in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the sensitivity of the soil-carbon turnover time (τsoil) to temperature and hydrology forcing is still not fully understood. Here, we use radiocarbon dating of plant-derived lipids in conjunction with reconstructions of temperature and rainfall from an eastern Mediterranean sediment core receiving terrigenous material from the Nile-River watershed to investigate τsoil in subtropical and tropical areas during the last 18,000 years. We find that the τsoil was reduced by an order of magnitude over the last deglaciation and infer that this reduction was caused from amplified soil respiration rates. Our data indicate that the deglacial warming was the major driver of these changes while the impact of hydroclimate was relatively small. We conclude that increased CO2 efflux from soils into the atmosphere constituted a positive feedback to global warming. However, simulated glacial-to-interglacial changes in a dynamic global vegetation model underestimate our data-based reconstructions of soil-carbon turnover times suggesting that this climate feedback might be underestimated.

One of the main agents responsible for global warming is greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) associated with fuel combustion. Most works in the literature address logistics transportation from an economic perspective, giving little attention to the existing trade-off with sustainability. In this work, we develop a bi-objective approach to the inventory routing problem with heterogeneous fleet, where we minimize costs while simultaneously reducing CO2 emissions. First, we present an explicit vehicular equation developed to calculate CO2 emissions for different types of vehicles and fuels. We demonstrate that this equation is statistically precise by conducting a study with a database in which machine learning techniques were applied to assess the predictive accuracy of CO2 emissions. The comparison between the explicit equation and machine learning models proves its efficacy as a suitable approximation for practical applications. Then, we propose an augmented e-constrained method to find the efficient Pareto frontier using a branch-and-cut method. Computational experiments were conducted on 285 instances, of which 125 were adapted from the literature, solving the augmented e-constrained optimally. Result analysis indicates the ability of the approach to trade off between economy and sustainability, where, on average, lexicographic solutions show a 58% reduction in emissions and a 36% increase in costs. We conclude with a managerial analysis providing insights into the proposed approach, highlighting the advantages of using different vehicles and fuels.

Biochar from waste produced by pyrolysis benefits soil fertility, increases water and nutrient retention and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, promoting more sustainable agricultural practices. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the benefits of biochar produced from babassu and açaí coconut shells on the physical, chemical and biological attributes of the soil, as well as on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. A comprehensive literature review was carried out, exploring articles and books in scientific databases. The results showed that the biochar of babassu coconut shells and açaí have significant impacts on the soil. In terms of soil attributes, an increase in water retention capacity, improvement in soil structure and an increase in the availability of essential nutrients for plants were observed. In addition, there was a reduction in the emission of gases such as carbon dioxide-CO2, methane-CH4 and nitrous oxide-N2O, important greenhouse gases, indicating the potential of biochar in mitigating climate change when incorporated into agricultural practices.

This study examines the impact of supercritical fluid treatment on 1200V 4H-SiC vertical double diffusion MOSFETs (VD-MOSFETs). When exposed to pure carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide mixed with nitrous oxide, there is a significant increase in the improvement ratio of drain current, which is contingent upon channel mobility but has no effect on threshold voltage. Conversely, the degradation of drain current caused by ammonia gas treatment is attributed to a reduction in channel mobility. Furthermore, the treatment with pure carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide mixed with nitrous oxide effectively passivates shallow defects, while the presence of hydrogen atoms in ammonia gas leads to an increase in shallow defects.

The development of technologies and processes to decarbonize chemical and fuel production is key to reducing global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction enables a sustainable pathway to circularize carbon-based chemical products by upgrading recovered carbon dioxide using renewable energy sources. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction has successfully been employed to produce chemicals such as methanol and ethylene, but it has been hindered by dependence on elevated temperature to achieve high yields and limited ability to generate higher order carbon products. Non-thermal carbon dioxide plasma can be generated at ambient temperature and pressure and contains energetically excited oxygen and carbon species. When introduced to an electrocatalyst, these reactive species could more readily participate in reaction pathways with higher activation barriers towards forming higher order carbon species compared to electrochemical reactions involving ground-state reactants. Further, plasma discharges over water in an electrochemical cell generate plasma-activated water, introducing solvated electrons and secondary reactive oxygen species. In this work, we investigate how the use of plasma-activated carbon dioxide and a plasma-water interface impacts electrochemical product generation. We design a novel non-thermal plasma electrode to discharge carbon dioxide plasma into water in an electrochemical cell with a Cu nanoparticle electrocatalyst. Results suggest the potential for a plasma-water electrochemical system to generate value-added products that are less commonly generated in electrochemical processes at ambient pressure and temperature.

Achieving efficient CO 2 electroreduction for production of valuable chemicals requires affordable, stable, and non-toxic catalysts. One of the most studied and promising products of CO 2 reduction is formic acid/formate. The latter species is receiving increased attention as an energy vector [1] or energy storage media (e.g., in CO 2 redox flow batteries [2]). At present, the practical application of CO 2 reduction to formate still faces challenges due to the lack of electrocatalysts capable of operating at high current densities (> 200 mA cm −2 ) with low degradation over long-duration operation [3]. Traditional metallic catalysts like Bi, Sn, In or Pb when scaled in flow cells typically suffer from low faradaic efficiencies (< 70%) at current densities ≥ 200 mA cm -2 , coupled with inadequate durability [4]. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) present promising and thus far largely unexplored attributes as electrocatalysts for CO 2 reduction, including high atom utilization during catalysis due to their porous crystal structure and tunable pore size distribution [5,6]. However, they also face challenges related to high overpotentials and complex synthesis methods [7]. This study elucidates the efficacy of a Bi metal-organic framework (Bi-MOF) synthesized through a rapid and facile method. The Bi-MOF obtained by our proprietary novel method [8], exhibits exceptional catalytic performance. Notably, it demonstrates outstanding faradaic efficiencies towards formate (FE HCOO - = 95–100%) at current densities up to 1 A cm −2 in a gas diffusion electrode, at low catalyst loading (0.5 mg cm −2 ). Moreover, Bi-MOF displays extended stability, operating continuously for over 20 hours at an industrially relevant current density (200 mA cm −2 ) and without electrolyte (1.5 M KOH) replenishment. In a flow reactor with 10 cm 2 electrode geometric area, a 100% FE HCOO - was obtained during 2-hour electrolysis at 100 mA cm −2 across a broad pH range (8–14). The electrochemical testing of the Bi-MOF was supplemented by surface and structural characterizations to correlate the activity with structural features. This analysis unveiled the role of the organic framework and the reason why Bi-MOF surpasses other Bi-based catalysts, including commercial Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 , Bi 2 O 3 , and metallic Bi, in selectivity (FE), cell potential, and durability. These findings hold promise for further scale-up of CO 2 reduction to formate using the cost-effective and easily prepared Bi-MOF catalyst.

Electrochemical production of hydrocarbons provides a pathway for connecting renewable energy generation with chemical production. In this work, we present research on the targeted electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethylene, which has a global production volume of over 200 metric tonnes per year. The selectivity of carbon dioxide to ethylene is heavily dependent on cell architecture, surface interfaces, and operating conditions. We explore the tradeoffs of using a zero-gap cell design, and demonstrate the production of ethylene with greater than 30% selectivity at 200 mA/cm2 with an uncompensated full cell voltage of 2.7 V. We also present modifications to a copper catalyst cathode, and the effects of conditioning and variable operation on the electrochemical cell performance including selectivity and durability. Leveraging technoeconomic analyses, we will present the projected costs of this pathway for producing ethylene and conclude with a discussion on long-term operation failure modes which greatly impact the future feasibility of this technology.

Chemelectronics LLC has developed economical approach to use solar energy to convert CO 2 directly captured from air using carbon dioxide capture conductive sorbent materials coated on carbon foam electrodes into chemical products (ethylene) and oxygen from nick foam electrodes separated with solid polyelectrolytes. We take advantage of commercial off-the-shelf solar panels as electricity to supply the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 directly captured from air into chemical products with zero carbon emission. Based on the life cycle analysis, there is no CO 2 emission from CO 2 capture and conversion. The energy will be produced from solar panels.

Carbon dioxide reduction has emerged as a highly promising area of focus, particularly considering the perpetual CO 2 emissions from the industrial sector. The electrochemical reduction pathway stands out as one of the most auspicious methodologies for CO 2 utilization, owing to its compelling attributes. These include, but are not limited to, operation under mild conditions, the ability to tailor CO 2 conversion towards desired products, and the potential for seamless integration with renewable electricity sources (e.g., derived from solar and wind), thus offsetting the associated carbon footprint. Moreover, the application of magnetic fields has demonstrated effectiveness in numerous electrocatalytic reduction processes. Presently, there is a paucity of literature addressing the utilization of magnetic fields for CO 2 reduction, as it represents a recently introduced concept. This presentation aims to contribute to the advancement of this novel idea, paving the way for its scalability in the near future. Our focus is on addressing mass transfer limitations and optimizing the process to handle high current density, thereby rendering it viable for large-scale CO 2 reduction.

Summary Carbon dioxide (CO2) modification of a nonionic surfactant alkyl polyglycoside (C-APG) was conducted based on a commercial APG product under mild synthesis conditions, including a low temperature (50°C) and a low pressure (2.5 bar). Using this method, CO2 was incorporated into APG molecules through the formation of carbonyl structures. The effectiveness and performance of C-APG as a novel surfactant for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) application in carbonate reservoirs were investigated and compared with its precursor—the unmodified APG. The key factors in the chemical structure of C-APG were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to confirm successful CO2 modification. The properties, including compatibility, surface tension, wettability alteration, interfacial tension (IFT), phase behavior, and static and dynamic adsorption of both APG and C-APG, were evaluated by various techniques and methods. Crude oil displacement efficiency of the surfactants was investigated via spontaneous imbibition, visualized micromodel, and coreflooding tests, respectively. Both surfactants were compatible with a high-salinity water (HSW), they exhibited a similar critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 8.5 mg/L and 13.5 mg/L for APG and C-APG, respectively, and had the same contact angle of around 135°. Interestingly, C-APG was found more effective in reducing IFT between oil and water phases. The IFT of oil in the C-APG solution was 0.058 ±0.001 mN/m, one order of magnitude lower than the value of 0.47 ±0.02 mN/m obtained from the solution of original APG, suggesting a better performance of C-APG in chemical flooding for oil displacement. A Winsor Type I microemulsion was formed by APG within the salinity range, while a transition of Type I to Type II microemulsion was observed for C-APG. The static adsorption of APG and C-APG at 2 g/L in carbonate were 0.93 mg/g rock and 1.08 mg/g rock, and the adsorption decreased to 0.11 mg/g rock and 0.13 mg/g rock under dynamic conditions for APG and C-APG, respectively. The spontaneous imbibition test demonstrated a higher oil imbibition recovery of 18.0% from C-APG solution compared to the result of 10.2% obtained from APG solution. A micromodel test showed that more crude oil was displaced by injection of APG or C-APG solution after waterflooding, while C-APG injection exhibited a stronger emulsification. The oil displacement by coreflood test showed that C-APG injection led to a lower differential pressure and a higher cumulative oil production (48%) compared to APG chemical flooding with a cumulative oil production of 41%. The produced fluids containing displaced crude oil from C-APG flooding, and subsequent waterflooding demonstrated very strong emulsification compared to the fluids produced after APG injection. This study demonstrates the significant potential of C-APG in two aspects—CO2 reduction and chemical EOR for the upstream petroleum industry.

Water oxidation is an important reaction that produces electrons and protons, which are important for downstream reactions such as hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction. Presently, the slow water oxidation is a key limiting factor for the development of hydrogen production and/or carbon dioxide reduction into practical solar energy storage technologies. An important reason for the slow progress in solve water oxidation problems is the lack of knowledge on the detailed mechanisms by which water is oxidized. As a multi-step process, the reaction involves at least 4 protons and 4 holes (when the desired product is oxygen gas). Intuitively, the coordination of charges and protons plays a critical role, but the details remain unknown. In this talk, we report our recent progress in understanding how water oxidation is influenced by surface hole behaviors. Using an Ir-based catalyst that features atomically defined structures, we were able to systematically vary a number of parameters, including the hole concentration, the density of active sites, as well as the properties of the supporting substrate that determines hole accumulation. It was found that matching the concentrations of surface holes and active site densities is critical. It was also revealed that the support substrate could have a profound influence on the reaction kinetics, even though they do not directly participate in the reactions. This knowledge is expected to propel the development of catalysts for improved water oxidation under photochemical conditions.

Tailoring the structure of the electrified interface and the electrocatalytically active sites at the atomic and molecular levels is key to elucidating the design principles to develop advanced materials for sustainable energy conversion and storage. This talk will focus on recent strategies to tune the structure-activity-selectivity relationships for oxygen, carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide and methane electrocatalysis to produce renewable fuels. First, I will present our work toward understanding and tuning the structure-property relations for oxygen evolution for the production of green hydrogen in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers. Then, I will show our model studies on well-defined Cu-based surfaces to understand structure-properties relations for the electrochemcial CO 2 reduction reaction. We have investigated the effect of electrolyte, pH, and potential dependence for CO reduction on Cu single crystals as well as methods to evaluate the facet distribution on Cu-based catalysts. Finally, I will discuss some strategies for selective oxidation reactions such as partial oxidation of methane to produce liquid fuels such as methanol.

Electrochemical reactions, including water splitting, oxygen reduction, hydrogen oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen oxide reduction, etc., are critical for sustainable energy conversion and storage. Achieving high efficiency in these reactions requires catalysts with superior activity, selectivity, and stability, often realized through nanostructured metal catalysts. However, practical challenges such as low selectivity and catalytic degradation persist. In situ and operando characterization techniques offer real-time insights into catalyst behavior under reaction conditions, enabling a deeper understanding of structure–performance relationships and, therefore, guiding the design and optimization of electro-catalysts. This review discusses the common in situ/operando techniques, highlights their applications in model catalysts, including single-atom and single-crystal catalysts, and further explores their combinational analysis to study practical complex nanocatalysts. Finally, we provide suggestions and perspectives on the development of the in situ/operando techniques to further advance the field of electrochemical catalysis.

Abstract With the Pan-European TIMES-VTT model, we studied pathways for carbon neutrality by 2050 for 31 European countries by modelling a large portfolio of varius terrestial and technological carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies. Negative emission technologies and practices (NETPs) such as af-/reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and storage, biochar, and enhanced weathering, were considered. Three different storylines were created to describe the role for NETPs in varying future developments. The scenario storylines illustrated potential opportunities and constraints for a large scale NETP implementation focusing on 1) optimistic technology development, 2) strict protection of planetary boundaries, and 3) increased self-sufficiency due to geopolitical risks with policy fragmentation. The results show that the demand for NETPs could be in a gigaton scale to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050. As different countries have different opportunities to implement NETPs, none of the NETP options should be excluded from mitigation portfolios at this stage. The results also indicate the potential of NETPs in providing cost-effective solutions for achieving the climate targets. On the other hand, stricter greenhouse gas emission reduction polices are needed to avoid over-reliance on CDR.&#xD;

One of the most important challenge of humanity in the mid-21st century is to maintain economic growth in an environmentally sustainable way. The European Green Deal addresses this issue, and it aims at making Europe climate neutral by 2050. To reach this aim, a promising technology is to convert a greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals (produce e.g., energy carriers, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals) in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner, such as the utilization of renewable energy sources. The direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon-monoxide (a high-value product which can be readily used in the chemical value chain) is a promising waste-to-wealth approach among the developed technologies and it can be easily coupled with carbon-free electricity sources to make the process completely sustainable. Novel catalysts, electrode assemblies, and cell configurations are all necessary to achieve economically appealing performance, as well as finding technological solutions that enable scale-up to reach industrially relevant dimensions. Zero-gap electrolyzer cell technology operates with high reaction rates and good efficiencies under ambient and near ambient conditions. In addition, its operation is simpler compared to other types of carbon-dioxide electrolyzer cell technologies (just one example: there is no need very precisely pressure control because no flowing catholyte inside the cell), and this allows the scale up of such architectures. Exploring the fundamentals and understanding of the chemistry in zero-gap electrochemical cells is carried out by many research groups, usually with small experimental test cells. These results provide a good scientific basis (e.g., to select the right catalysts, components, or to study long-term degradation, etc.), however, compared to the size of an industrial-scale electrolyzer, these experimental cells only measure a "one point" chemistry. The results cannot be transferred without careful consideration during scale-up, due to several additional challenges. These challenges are mainly of mechanical origin, and all of these create uneven conditions that can significantly affect the chemistry of the on given sections of the cells. Over the past several years, we have gone through the steps of scaling up electrochemical cells (for CO 2 -to-CO conversion) from a small experimental test cell (8 cm 2 ) to an industrial-sized cell stack (2500 cm 2 / cell). During the development journey we encountered many of the challenges outlined above. In this talk, I am going to present some of these challenges, their origins, what affects them and by them, and what principles can be used to find solutions.

Abstract A building block containing eight zincs and eight iodo groups (8 Zn) is obtained by the Zn complexation of a salen ligand bearing two additional hydroxy groups. Through the Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling of 8 Zn with 1,3,5,7‐tetra(4‐ethynylphenyl) adamantane, microporous organic polymers bearing octanuclear zinc clusters (MOP‐8 Zn) are prepared, exhibiting a high surface area of 562 m 2 g −1 , microporosity, and a particulate morphology with an average diameter of 249 nm. The MOP‐8 Zn exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic performance, compared to molecular counterparts, in the reductive carbon dioxide fixation to formamides, possibly due to the cooperative adsorption and confinement effect of networks on substrates.

Academic activity at the Unesa Ketintang Campus Surabaya Indonesia, to some extent, contributed to the increase of CO2 concentration in Surabaya City. The increase in CO2 concentration can be balanced by green open space. This study aims to determine the adequacy of green open space in Unesa Ketintang Street Campus in reducing CO2 in ambient air. The analysis unit uses a box model. The observation was carried out for six days in July-August 2021. The adequacy of green open space uses the CO2 reduction value (Net_CO2-Con), an indicator of reducing CO2 concentrations. Net_CO2-Con value is the cumulative concentration of CO2 in the surrounding air for 24 hours. The study results show that from 7 observation points, the average CO2 concentration ranges from 417 – 425 ppmV. The CO2 concentration reduction value (Net_CO2-Con) ranges from -19.46 to -87.69 ppmV. The minus sign (-) on the reduction value indicates that the green open space on the Unesa Campus is sufficient to reduce the CO2 concentration in the ambient air.

The selective double hydroboration of CO2 into bis(boryl)acetal (BBA) is a challenging yet appealing reduction process since BBA can be used as a versatile C1 and Cn sources for the synthesis of value-added products. In the present study, we demonstrate that simple borohydride compounds are efficient and selective catalysts for the synthesis of BBA when using 9-borabicyclo(3.3.1)nonane (9-BBN) as a reductant. The experimental and theoretical investigations show that while the borohydride species catalyzes the first reduction step of CO2 into formoxyborane (2e– reduction intermediate), the observed 4e– reduction selectivity is mostly due to the ability of 9-BBN to reduce the formoxyborane into BBA without a catalyst. Notably, 0.2 mol % of LiH2BBN catalyzed the hydroboration of CO2 with 9-BBN as a reductant into the corresponding BBA in 77% yield with TON and TOF of 385 and 196 h–1, respectively. The simplicity of borohydride contrasts with the more elaborate catalytic systems used so far for the 4e– reduction of CO2.

The widespread challenges facing lithium-sulfur batteries, including the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and its species, electrode volume fluctuations during cycling, and the lithium polysulfides shuttle effect, have hindered their commercialization and practical utility [1,2]. Our study addresses these issues by incorporating titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles onto high specific surface area porous carbon, exploring this composite's potential as both a sulfur cathode host and separator modifier. The synthesis of the carbon/TiN composite involved two key stages: firstly, the in-situ growth of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles on the carbon surface utilizing titanium tetrachloride as a precursor; secondly, the conversion of the TiO 2 nanoparticles to TiN nanoparticles through carbothermal nitridization (thermal treatment at 1400 ℃ for 4 hours in a nitrogen medium) [3,4]. The lithium-sulfur cell employing the prepared C/TiN-25%@S cathode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1155 mAh g -1 at 0.2 C, maintaining a capacity exceeding 700 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles. Notably, the lithium-sulfur cell utilizing the C/TiN-25%@S cathode and a C/TiN-modified separator demonstrated enhanced cycling performance, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 1623 mAh g -1 with retention of over 1126 mAh g -1 after 100 charge/discharge cycles at 0.2 C.

The combustion of fossil fuels is a major contributor to rising levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere. Due to the adverse effects of climate change caused in large part by CO 2 , new technologies must be developed that contribute to a global renewable energy supply. Electrochemical reduction of CO 2 offers a viable pathway to generating value-added products and synthetic fuels to meet our future energy demands while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. By constructing electrocatalysts capable of modulating proton transfer, we are able to tune product selectivity. Previous studies have demonstrated that two-electron products (CO and HCOOH) can be produced with high selectivity, but multiple-electron transfer products (CH 4 , CH 3 OH, and C2+ products) typically are produced at much lower Faradaic efficiencies. In this work, we construct polymer-modified Cu electrodes that exhibit extraordinarily high CH 4 production (88% Faradaic efficiency). These electrodes afford a new strategy for increasing the selectivity of CO 2 reduction electrocatalysts, an attribute that is key in developing industrially-relevant CO 2 conversion devices. Nafion is a widely used fluoropolymer that is often mixed with electrocatalysts to facilitate proton transport. In contrast to these Nafion-catalyst composites, this work studies electrodes covered by Nafion overlayers for the CO 2 reduction reaction. By varying the thickness, substrates, and voltage, we perform a detailed study of the effect of Nafion overlayers on metal and carbon mesh electrodes for CO 2 reduction. Depending on the thickness of the Nafion membrane, CO 2 reduction occurs at either the polymer–electrolyte interface or electrode–polymer interface. A Nafion overlayer of 15 μm on a Cu electrode enables an extraordinarily high yield of CH 4 production (88% Faradaic efficiency) at a low overpotential (540 mV) via the stabilization of metal-bound CO intermediates. To the best of our knowledge, this yield is the highest for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 production at room temperature reported.

Titanium alloys are crucial in precision manufacturing due to their exceptional properties, but traditional machining methods lead to tool wear, deformation, and high costs. Conventional cooling fluids reduce heat but cause environmental issues, necessitating more sustainable solutions. Cryogenic Minimum Quantity Lubrication (CMQL) technology, using liquid nitrogen or carbon dioxide with minimal amounts of cutting fluid, offers an eco-friendly alternative that reduces machining temperatures and friction. This study tested the TC6 titanium alloy under conventional and CMQL conditions, focusing on tool wear, surface quality, and machining efficiency. Results showed that CMQL significantly decreased tool wear and surface roughness, with a 42% reduction in surface roughness during drilling and a 20–30% efficiency increase. The findings highlight CMQL’s potential to improve machining quality and efficiency while promoting environmentally friendly practices in the industry.

Sulfuryl fluoride (SO 2 F 2 ) has been largely used as a postharvest fumigant replacing methyl bromide (widely recognized among ozone-depleting substances). Sulfuryl fluoride, however, is a potent greenhouse gas with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of ~ 5000 for a 100-year time zone far higher than that of carbon dioxide and methane. Ongoing pilot work showed that SO 2 F 2 fumes vented from fumigation chambers can be captured and hydrolyzed by hydroxide (OH - ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) solution at pH ~12 in a scrubber with a complete conversion into SO 4 2- and F - as waste salts. The purchase, shipment, storage, and handling of concentrated stocks of H 2 O 2 and NaOH for use in SO 2 F 2 hydrolysis involve cost and safety concerns. Herein, we present an on-site, facile, and cost-effective pathway for the electrochemical production of OH - and H 2 O 2 in large enough concentrations to fully degrade ~ 95% of SO 2 F 2 captured. In that, we employed a commercial carbon catalyst that produced 250 mM H 2 O 2 at pH 12.6 within 4 h with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.8% for O 2 reduction to H 2 O 2 . We also propose a facile approach via surface oxidation of abundant carbon materials to significantly enhance both activity and selectivity for OH - and H 2 O 2 production under electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction. These findings provide new insights in the on-site production of industrial chemicals by means of clean, facile, and environmentally friendly electrochemical pathway. Moreover, the capability of recycling the hazardous SO 2 F 2 fumes and using the SO 4 2- and F - waste products as free sources of electrolyte can’t be overemphasized.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an effective strategy to tackle energy crises and mitigate greenhouse gas effects. The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts has been a research hotspot in the field. In this study, we designed four Co-doped single-atom catalysts (Co–Nχ@C) using carbon nanotubes as carriers, these catalysts included tri- and dicoordinated N-doped carbon nanoribbons, as well as tri- and dicoordinated N-doped graphene, respectively denoted as H3(H2)-Co/CNT and 3(2)-Co/CNT. The stable configurations of these Co–Nχ@C catalysts were optimized using the PBE+D3 method. Additionally, we explored the reaction mechanisms of these catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into four C1 products, including CO, HCOOH, CH3OH and CH4, in detail. Upon comparing the limiting potentials (UL) across the Co–Nχ@C catalysts, the activity sequence for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 was H2–Co/CNT > 3-Co/CNT > H3–Co/CNT > 2-Co/CNT. Meanwhile, our investigation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with four catalysts elucidated the influence of acidic conditions on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process. Specifically, controlling the acidity of the solution was crucial when using the H3–Co/CNT and H2–Co/CNT catalysts, while the 3-Co/CNT and 2-Co/CNT catalysts were almost unaffected by the solution's acidity. We hope that our research will provide a theoretical foundation for designing more effective CO2 reduction electrocatalysts.

The rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere is among the most alarming issues in today’s world: harming the environment, health, and economics of all nations on the planet. CO 2 capture and its photochemical and/or photoelectrochemical reduction to fuels are promising methodologies to reduce atmospheric CO 2 . This is a photochemistry, electrochemistry, and catalysis problem. Transition metal complexes that can be tailored to a desired function utilizing a wide range of ligands, play a crucial role in solar fuels chemistry by reducing the activation energy for catalytic CO 2 reduction to fuels. In the last decade, Mn-based complexes have sparked a significant interest owing to their abundance in Earth’s crust and lower prices compared to other transition metals. However, a catalyst that operates with high activity and turnover numbers at low overpotential is still required. We report the synthesis, characterization, and activity toward CO 2 electrochemical reduction of Mn complexes containing the photoactive, electron-donating 1-imidazole-2,4,6-tri(carbazole-9-yl)-3,5-dicyanobenzene ligand (3CzImIPN). UV-vis and photoluminescence spectra of the Mn complex containing 3CzImIPN will be reported that investigate its photophysical properties under visible light. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) studies under nitrogen and CO 2 will be reported that investigate the electron transfer between the ligand and the Mn centre, as well as the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . Evidence will be presented for a new, low overpotential pathway for the electroreduction of CO 2 by these types of complexes. Figure 1

Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) electrolysis on copper (Cu) catalysts has attracted interest for its direct production of C 2+ feedstocks. Using the knowledge that CO 2 reduction on copper is primarily a tandem reaction of CO 2 to CO and CO to C 2+ products, we show that modulating CO concentrations within the liquid catalyst layer allows for C 2+ selectivity of > 80 % at 200 mA cm -2 in a membrane electrode assembly over broad conversion conditions. The importance of CO pooling is demonstrated through residence time distribution curves, varying flow fields (serpentine/parallel/interdigitated), and flow rate. While serpentine flow fields require high conversions to limit CO selectivity and maximize C 2+ selectivity, the longer CO residence times of parallel flow fields reach similar selectivity over broad flow rates. Critically, we show that parts of the catalyst area are predominantly reducing CO instead of CO 2 as supported by CO reduction experiments and transport modelling of the reactor. In addition, higher cation crossover from the anolyte is shown to maximize C 2 + selectivity providing further evidence of cation effect on C-C coupling rates.

The future of our planet critically depends on the introduction of new or improved strategies for developing non-polluting energy production. Leading approaches are the electrocatalytic production of hydrogen gas, development of fuel cells relying on efficient reduction of oxygen and either gaseous or liquid fuels, as well as efficient reduction of carbon dioxide. Metal complexes chelated by N4 macrocycles serve as excellent catalysts in many of these processes, performed at both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. Our contributions to those aspect focused on introducing metallocorroles as catalysts for reduction of protons, oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as for water oxidation [1-5]. The common motif in these and other publications was to take advantage of the relatively easy functionalization of the macrocyclic periphery for the tuning of properties and reactivity. A significant game changer was the recently reported synthetic access to corroles with meso -CF 3 substituents and even to the parent corrole with no substituents whatsoever [6]. These developments allow for a focus on the size effect, which according to both hypothesis and fast accumulating results has a very strong effect (“smaller is better”) on the performance of electrodes modified by the corresponding metal complexes [7-9].

Reduction of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is a worldwide problem that needs to be solved urgently. Storing CO2 as CO2 hydrate in subsurface reservoirs in cold regions can be an effective way to reduce atmospheric CO2 content. In this study, we utilize the geological data for three cold regions in Northeast and Northwest China to analyze the probable thickness, area, and porosity of the CO2 hydrate stability zone. Out of 12 cold locations, eight are located in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP), three in Northwest China (NW), and one in Mohe Basin (MB). Using conservative estimates of the effective thickness, area, and porosity, we calculate the reservoir volume of the CO2 hydrate stability zones for each location. The results show that the 12 cold locations have a total CO2 storage capacity of 2052 Gt. Of this, QTP has the highest CO2 storage capacity of 518 Gt.

Abstract Dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) with atomically dispersed dual‐sites, as an extension of single‐atom catalysts (SACs), have recently become a new hot topic in heterogeneous catalysis due to their maximized atom efficiency and dual‐site diverse synergy, because the synergistic diversity of dual‐sites achieved by asymmetric microenvironment tailoring can efficiently boost the catalytic activity by optimizing the electronic structure of DACs. Here, this work first summarizes the frequently‐used experimental synthesis and characterization methods of DACs. Then, four synergistic catalytic mechanisms (cascade mechanism, assistance mechanism, co‐adsorption mechanism and bifunction mechanism) and four key modulating methods (active site asymmetric strategy, transverse/axial‐modification engineering, distance engineering and strain engineering) are elaborated comprehensively. The emphasis is placed on the effects of asymmetric microenvironment of DACs on oxygen/carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, some perspectives and outlooks are also addressed. In short, the review summarizes a useful asymmetric microenvironment tailoring strategy to speed up synthesis of high‐performance electrocatalysts for different reactions.

Surface wear of fracturing pump plungers seriously diminishes the efficiency of oil and gas production, while diamond-like carbon (DLC) film is considered to be a promising material for reducing friction and wear of oil and gas equipment due to its excellent comprehensive properties. However, the lubricating performance of DLC films is influenced by various factors, and the impact of CO2 content on their microscopic tribological behavior and mechanism under CO2 fracturing environment remains unexplored. This study employs reactive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological properties of two distinct systems under different CO2 contents in fracturing fluid environments. The results indicate that the reduction of average friction force primarily relies on the increase of CO2 content, and the increase in CO2 content enhances the mobility of medium molecules while also retarding the transformation of atomic lattice and the consumption of medium molecules. Although DLC film is encapsulated by atomic transfer layers at the later stages of sliding, atomic passivation still contributes to the reduction of friction force. Nevertheless, the application of DLC film directly and effectively diminishes the transformation of atomic lattice and shear strain, thereby reducing wear and deformation of the friction pairs. Concurrently, it significantly lowers the average temperature of the system. The findings suggest that enhancing CO2 content on the basis of applying DLC films significantly contributes to extending the service life of plungers.

Abstract The increase of global carbon dioxide concentration leads to climate change and accurate estimation of carbon sink fluxes from rock weathering in karst regions is of great significance to the current global carbon cycle and climate change. However, sulfide oxidation in coal-bearing strata in karst areas of northern China forms sulfuric acid that enters the karst groundwater system and participates in the dissolution of carbonate rocks, making carbon sink estimates potentially too high. To accurately estimate carbon sinks, we selected a typical foothill karst system in northern China. The effects of sulfuric acid on carbonate weathering and carbon sink flux were quantitatively evaluated by applying the Galy model and water chemistry methods. Twenty-nine data sets were analyzed for the dry and wet seasons. The results show that the karst groundwater ions in the spring area mainly originated from the weathering and dissolution of carbonate rocks and partly from the weathering and dissolution of silicate rocks. The total HCO3- flux in the spring area is 296.49´103mol/km2·a-1. When only carbonic acid dissolution was considered, the rock dissolution rate was 300.83´103mol/km2·a-1 and the total consumed CO2 flux was 191.82´103mol/km2·a-1. When carbonic acid and sulfuric acid were jointly involved, the rock dissolution rate was 364.33´103mol/km2·a-1 and the total consumed CO2 flux was 162.17´103mol/km2·a-1. With the participation of sulfuric acid, the rock dissolution rate was elevated by 21.11%, while the consumed CO2 flux decreased by 15%, and the sink reduction effect of sulfuric acid dissolution on karst carbon sinks was obvious. And the carbon sink rate in wet season more than doubled compared with that in dry season. This study provides a basis for the evaluation of carbon sinks in northern China.

Due to the intermediate operating temperatures (400-600 o C), protonic ceramic electrochemical cells have attracted significant attention in the last 10 years because of the demonstration of potential applications of fuel-flexible fuel cells, water electrolysis to produce hydrogen, solid-state ammonia synthesis, electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to fuels, and fuel processing (e.g., natural gas to liquids). In addition to developing specific fuel electrodes for different electrocatalytic reactions, we need to discover new electrolyte and oxygen electrode materials generically for all the protonic ceramic electrochemical cells to further decrease the operating temperatures, increase performance, and prolong the long-term stability. The recently emerging materials of high entropy perovskite oxides have been reported to be able to serve as promising electrolyte and oxygen electrode materials. In this talk, we will summarize what Clemson University has done about developing, characterizing, understanding, and demonstrating high entropy perovskite oxides as high-performance and stable electrolyte and oxygen electrode materials for protonic ceramic electrochemical cells.

On the way to carbon neutrality, directly catalyzing atmospheric CO2 into high‐value chemicals might be an effective approach to mitigate the negative impacts of rising airborne CO2 concentrations. Here, we pioneer the investigation of the influence of the H2/CO2 partial pressure ratio (PPR) on air‐level CO2 methanation. Using Ni/CeO2 as a case catalyst, increasing H2/CO2 PPR significantly improves low‐temperature CO2 conversion and high‐temperature CH4 selectivity, i.e., from 10 of H2/CO2 PPR on, CO2 is completely methanized at 250 °C, and nearly 100% CH4 selectivity is achieved at 400 °C. 100‐hour stability tests demonstrate the practical application potential of Ni/CeO2 at 250 °C and 400 °C. In‐situ DRIFTS reveal that reinforced formate pathway by increasing H2/CO2 PPR is responsible for the high CH4 yield. In contrast, even though the CO pathway dominated CO2 conversion on Ni is enhanced by rising H2/CO2 PPR, but at a high reaction temperature, the promoted CO desorption still leads to lower CH4 selectivity. This work offers deep insights into the direct air‐level CO2 resourceization, contributing to the achievement of airborne CO2 reductions.

In this comprehensive research endeavor, we introduce two groundbreaking methodologies poised to reshape the landscape of nanocomposite material synthesis, unlocking unprecedented potential across a spectrum of electrochemical applications. The Joule heating method, also known as Carbothermal Shock (CTS), emerges as a remarkably simple yet highly effective technique for generating multi-metallic nanoparticles (NPs), including high-entropy alloys (HEA). The CTS process involves loading a metal precursor onto a carbon substrate and swiftly elevating the temperature through the passage of an electric current, inducing rapid thermal shock and resulting in the formation of small and uniform NPs. While the CTS method has showcased high performance in various applications, such as rechargeable energy storage systems and catalytic conversion, challenges persist in achieving optimal surface coverage of NPs, particularly for electrochemical applications. For example, metal NPs formed through the CTS method have not been used for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or nitrogen (N 2 ) reduction reactions because the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and unwanted reactions occur on the exposed carbon substrate as a competing reaction To overcome this challenge, we present a pioneering approach involving the utilization of partially carbonized cellulose as a novel carbon substrate. The cellulose matrix, distinguished by its unique structural characteristics, including interconnected aromatic rings and numerous edge sites, facilitates an unprecedented high surface coverage of various single and copper (Cu)-based polyelemental alloy NPs. The controlled manipulation of defect sites, such as vacancies and dangling bonds, within the carbonized cellulose plays a pivotal role in the nucleation and stabilization of metal NPs during the CTS process. The study underscores the correlation between defect sites on the carbon substrate and the resulting surface morphology of metal NPs, providing valuable insights for future advancements in nanocomposite material synthesis through the CTS method. Moreover, the cellulose-enabled high surface coverage Cu NPs exhibit remarkable potential in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reactions. The Cu NPs on cellulose/carbon paper (Cu/cellulose/CP) demonstrated a high ethylene selectivity of 48.92% at a potential of −0.529 V versus the reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE), maintaining stability over 30 hours of reaction in a 10 M KOH electrolyte. This study presents an exciting prospect for expanding the applications of polyelemental alloy NPs synthesized via the CTS method in diverse electrochemical applications. Transitioning to the second part of the research, we explore the application of MXenes, a recently discovered family of two-dimensional materials composed of transition metal carbides and carbonitrides. These atomically thin layers exhibit a unique combination of metallic conductivity and high surface area due to their layered structure. To enhance the properties of MXenes and broaden their applications, various components, including organic small molecules, polymers, metals, and semiconducting materials, have been incorporated into their intrinsic nanostructures. However, existing methods for fabricating MXene composite hybrid materials predominantly rely on solution processing techniques, introducing challenges such as severe MXene oxidation and nanoparticle aggregation. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a revolutionary rapid Joule heating approach, a solution-free method designed to synthesize a diverse range of MXene hybrid nanocomposites. This approach minimizes MXene oxidation on the surface and ensures a uniform distribution of nanoparticles on MXene surfaces without the drawbacks of severe aggregations. It became possible to synthesize metal NPs from unary to senary combinations (including Pt, Co, Ni, Fe, Cu components) with minimal MXene oxidation through rapid heating. The ability to easily modify the precursor ratio and synthesize unlimited combinations of MXene composite hybrid nanostructures enables the modulation of material properties to achieve high performance in diverse electrochemical applications. The resulting Pt-MXene hybrid nanostructure, synthesized through this novel approach, exhibits promising electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by minimizing MXene oxidation during the synthesis process. This breakthrough method holds immense potential for a wide range of catalytic applications, where the synergistic effects of MXene composites can significantly contribute.

Abstract Atomic Fe sites enabled electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction (ECO 2 R) to carbon monoxide (CO) at low overpotentials. However, the narrow potential ranges for selective CO 2 conversion on atomic Fe sites hindered the CO production at high current densities. Therefore, unveiling the CO 2 electroreduction processes and clarifying the catalytic mechanisms on different atomic Fe sites are important for better design of atomic Fe catalysts toward efficient ECO 2 R. Herein, the ECO 2 R processes on single‐atom, dual‐atom, and cluster Fe sites are systematically investigated, and clarify that the balanced water dissociation and CO 2 protonation on dual‐atom Fe sites promote the efficient CO production. The dual‐atom Fe catalyst achieves Faradaic efficiencies of CO ( FE CO ) above 92% over a wide potential range of −0.4–−0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and maintains FE CO of 91% after 153‐h electrolysis in H‐type cell. Benefitting from the favorable CO 2 protonation for ECO 2 R on dual‐atom Fe sites, pH‐universal CO 2 electroreduction is achieved in alkali‐/acid‐/bicarbonate‐fed membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, with FE CO exceeds 98% in strongly acidic/alkaline and neutral mediums. The work reveals a water dissociation‐promoted CO 2 electroreduction on dual‐atom Fe sites and presents a feasible regulation of atomic Fe sites for highly active/selective ECO 2 R.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is a meaningful way for CO2 depletion and value addition. And electrocatalysts play great roles in the CO2 reduction product selectivity. SnOx-based catalysts have been widely used in formate production. However, the activity and selectivity are still unsatisfying, especially at the industrial level current density (>0.2 A cm–2) for pure HCOOH production. In this work, we proposed a triple-metal composite electrocatalyst with high oxygen vacancy contents and an abundant grain-boundary strategy for the eCO2RR. In particular, oxygen vacancies in the designed catalyst reached 13.9%. When catalysts were employed as catalysts for eCO2RR, both high HCOOH FE and long-term electrolysis stability under acid electrolytes were obtained. The FE of HCOOH was around 87.9% at 0.3 A cm–2 and was stable even after 15,000 s of electrolysis. This work provides a new path for electrocatalyst design and highly efficient HCOOH production.

Direct solar-driven conversion of carbon dioxide to chemicals and fuels requires identification of efficient, durable, and selective photocathodes. Chalcogenide p-type semiconductors, exemplified by chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 (CIGS), have been effectively deployed as photocathodes. However, selectivity toward CO 2 reduction and durability of the commonly used CdS buffer layer remain unsolved challenges. We have demonstrated that for the wide band gap CuGa 3 Se 5 chalcopyrite absorber these challenges are well addressed by an organic coating generated in situ from an N,N′-(1,4-phenylene)bispyridinium ditriflate salt in the electrolyte. The molecular additive provides a 30-fold increase in selectivity toward CO2R productscompared to the unmodified system and lowers Cd corrosion at least 10-fold. This dual functionality highlights the promise of hybrid solid-state-molecular photocathodes for enabling durable and efficient solar fuel systems.This presentation will highlight the variations in product selectivity and durability observed for different combinations of coatings derived from molecular precursors in the electrolyte with photocathodes includingCuGa 3 Se 5 and Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 , with and without CdS buffer layers.

Copper-silver (Cu-Ag) bimetallics and alloys are attractive due to their enhanced performance compared to their parent metals in various fields including electronics, batteries, biomedicine, solar technology, energy storage, and catalysis.[1] Existing methods for synthesizing Cu-Ag bimetallics suffer from major drawbacks such as intense temperature and pressure conditions, pre and post-treatment processes, and multiple time-consuming steps.[2, 3] In this work, Cu-Ag bimetallic films were synthesized under various ratios for the first time using a newly developed Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ) system. Synthesis was done in a single step, in under 15 minutes. The samples exhibited strong adhesion onto various substrates such as glass and glassy carbon. This direct-deposition technique requires low power input (<50 W) without the need for any pre- or post-treatment processes and with little to no waste. This contrasts with wet chemistry, where deposition normally takes 12-24 hours followed by thermal processes that produce several waste products.[4] Considering the high melting points (MP) of pure Cu and Ag (MP of Cu is ca. 1,085 °C and MP of Ag is ca. 962 °C), and the fact that they are immiscible, the formation of Cu-Ag alloys usually requires a high amount of energy under intense conditions.[5] These Cu-Ag films were characterized via cyclic voltammetry (CV), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Here, we demonstrate that by only mixing low-concentration metal salt solutions and using a neutral gas (helium), we can readily synthesize metal alloys while controlling their thickness, shape, composition, and metal ratios. From an electrochemical point of view, APPJ drives the reduction of metal cations from the presence of free electrons. This suggests the presence of a medium that is considered either as an electrode, due to the presence of electrons, or as an electrolyte, due to their electrical conduction.[6] These plasma-synthesized materials were tested as electrocatalysts for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) under various potentials. The performance of these catalysts was assessed via electrochemical surface area (ECSA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and pulse voltammetry techniques. Copper is the only heterogeneous catalyst that converts CO 2 into valuable chemicals, such as hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and alcohols.[7] Interestingly, we illustrate that the addition of silver improves the catalytic activity of copper toward CO 2 reduction under low potentials. This is a desirable property given the anticipated transition to green energy.

CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is a crucial method for CO2 utilization and sequestration, representing an important zero-carbon or even negative-carbon emission reduction technology. However, the low viscosity of CO2 and reservoir heterogeneity often result in early gas breakthrough, significantly reducing CO2 utilization and sequestration efficiency. A water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection is a technique for mitigating gas breakthrough and viscous fingering in CO2-EOR. However, it encounters challenges related to insufficient mobility control in highly heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs, resulting in gas channeling and low sweep efficiency. Despite the extensive application and research of a WAG injection in oil and gas reservoirs, the most recent comprehensive review dates back to 2018, which focuses on the mechanisms of EOR using conventional WAG. Herein, we give an updated and comprehensive review to incorporate the latest advancements in CO2-WAG flooding techniques for enhanced sweep efficiency, which includes the theory, applications, fluid displacement mechanisms, and control strategies of a CO2-WAG injection. It addresses common challenges, operational issues, and remedial measures in WAG projects by covering studies from experiments, simulations, and pore-scale modeling. This review aims to provide guidance and serve as a reference for the application and research advancement of CO2-EOR techniques in heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs.

Solar thermochemical CO2 splitting using metal oxides is considered as a promising approach to produce solar fuels since it is capable to tap abundant sunlight directly and store solar energy in the renewable fuel. It remains a grand challenge to achieve highly efficient CO2 splitting at low temperature (<800 oC) due to insufficient activation of metal oxides for CO2.Herein, the introduction of a small amount of Pt was found to be able to greatly increase the performance of CO2 splitting with the highest peak CO production rate of about 65 mL min‐1 g‐1, CO productivity of about 53 mL g‐1, nearly 100% CO2 conversion and long‐term stability for 0.5Pt/CeO2 which exceeded most of the state‐of‐the‐art transition metals‐based oxides even at lower temperature (700 oC). This could be attributed to the addition of Pt leading to the formation of an interface (Pt0‐Ov‐Ce3+) after CH4 reduction, which improved CO2 activation and dissociation due to beneficial breakage of C=O bond by the cooperation of Pt0 and oxygen vacancies in the interface.

This additional external CA had no discernible effect on the adaptive responses and physiology of cells exposed to changes similar to those found in S. elongatus natural habitats, such as fluctuating CO2 and HCO3− concentrations and ratios, oxidative or light stress, and high CO2. The transformant had a disadvantage over wild-type cells under certain conditions (Na+ depletion, a reduction in CO2). S. elongatus cells lacked their own EcaASyn in all experimental conditions. The results suggest the presence in S. elongatus of mechanisms that limit the appearance of EcaASyn in the periplasm. For the first time, we offer data on the expression pattern of CCM-associated genes during S. elongatus adaptation to CO2 replacement with HCO3−, as well as cell transfer to high CO2 levels (up to 100%). An increase in CO2 concentration coincides with the suppression of the NDH-14 system, which was previously thought to function constitutively.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (eCO 2 R) has emerged as a promising approach to produce high-value fuels and chemicals using renewable energy sources. In particular, Cu catalysts can convert CO 2 to a wide range of hydrocarbon and oxygenate products, including CO, formate, ethanol and ethylene. However, the activity and selectivity of eCO 2 R is highly dependent on mass transport and the corresponding reaction microenvironment present under operating conditions. In this talk, we present an integrated framework that combines experiments with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and density functional theory (DFT) based microkinetic modeling to predict the effect of varying mass transport on eCO 2 R in a custom-designed flow cell. The flow cell is designed with multiple electrolyte jets impinging onto the electrocatalyst surface for rapid and homogeneous reactant transport. We first demonstrate the effect of mass transport in a flow cell architecture by controlling the flow rate of CO 2 -saturated 0.1 M KHCO 3 to a Cu electrocatalyst. Significant increases in the production rates of formate and CO are observed with increasing flow rate, as well as an enhancement in multi-carbon products at high overpotentials. Increasing flow rate promotes hydrogen evolution at low overpotentials but has little effect at large overpotentials, suggesting a transition from HCO 3 - to water as the dominant proton donor with increasing overpotential. CFD simulations are employed to model the distribution of boundary layer thicknesses within the flow cell, which subsequently set the boundary conditions for the coupled 1D transport-microkinetic model. The calculated boundary layer thickness values are corroborated by experimentally measured transport-limited currents. Our model successfully predicts experimentally observed trends in selectivity with mass transport, such as an increase in the production of ethylene and ethanol at high flow rates due to enhanced CO 2 transport. The slight suppression of hydrogen reduction at higher flow rates due to an increase in *CO coverage is also predicted and supported by experimental results. This work demonstrates the importance of incorporating transport processes in the CFD-DFT coupled modeling of device performance for electrochemical CO 2 reduction.

The activity and product selectivity of electrocatalysts for reactions like the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide reduction reactions (CO2RR and CORR) are intimately dependent on the catalyst’s structure and composition. While engineering catalytic surfaces can improve performance, discovering the key sets of rational design principles remains challenging due to limitations in modeling catalyst stability under operating conditions. Herein, we perform first-principles density functional calculations adopting implicit solvation methods with potential control to study the influence of adsorbates and applied potential on the stability of different facets of model Cu electrocatalysts. Using coverage dependencies extracted from microkinetic models, we describe an approach for calculating potential and adsorbate-dependent contributions to surface energies under reaction conditions, where Wulff constructions are used to understand the morphological evolution of Cu electrocatalysts under CO2RR and CORR conditions. We identify that CO*, a key reaction intermediate, exhibits higher kinetically and thermodynamically accessible coverages on (100) relative to (111) facets, which can translate into an increased relative stabilization of the (100) facet during CO2RR. Our results support the known tendency for increased (111) faceting of Cu nanoparticles under more reducing conditions and that the relative increase in (100) faceting observed under CO2RR conditions is likely attributed to differences in CO* coverage between these facets.

This study identifies factors that drive the changes in CO2 emissions from personal travel in urban areas during 2006 and 2016 using repeated cross-sectional household travel surveys conducted in Seoul, Korea. We first estimated the daily travel CO2 emissions of every survey participant for each year based on travel itinerary records and estimated CO2 intensity for the travel mode. The results suggest that total CO2 emissions from personal travel in Seoul declined remarkably between 2006 and 2016, potentially due to reduced vehicle use, transition to non-motorized travel, improved vehicle technology, and eased traffic conditions. Two multilevel mixed-effect Tobit regression models were developed to identify the factors affecting CO2 emissions from personal travel for each year. The results suggest that some cohorts (e.g. males, 30s and 40s, small households, high-income groups, car owners) are likely to produce more CO2 emissions from personal travel consistently in 2006 and 2016. The changes in the estimated coefficients between the two years were also evaluated statistically, suggesting that some population groups (e.g. elderly, large households) are likely to reduce CO2 emissions from personal travel. The reduction in CO2 emissions by these groups may be correlated with continued investment in the public transportation system in Seoul. These findings provide an opportunity to gain a clear understanding of travel behavioral changes related to CO2 emissions from personal travel, with insights toward sustainable development.

In this study egg white was used as a source of natural amino acids to modify the surface properties of palm shell activated carbon towards enhancing its CO2 capture performance. A simple impregnation method was employed for this purpose. Characterisation analysis was performed on the egg white-impregnated activated carbon to examine any changes on its surface properties prior to CO2 adsorption test. The modified adsorbent showed high thermal stability below 300°C and comprised of new amide functional group. Furthermore, the modified adsorbent exhibited 31% higher breakthrough time and maintained its CO2 adsorption capacity at 0.3 mmol/g in comparison to raw activated carbon, regardless of the reduction of surface area and micropore volume by 17% and 18% respectively. These findings provide evidence on the prospect of egg white-impregnated activated carbon for CO2 adsorption application which could pave the way for a new generation of affordable and eco-friendly adsorbents.

Sustainable development, corporate social responsibility and social sustainability, joint efforts for the benefit of society, reduction of carbon dioxide emissions are among the most discussed topics in modern economic literature and articles. Events, discussions and debates are held in this direction. Companies, regardless of size, join this trend and try to make CSR a major part of their strategy. The group of companies really does it and strives to take care of their employees, their families, other stakeholders and society as a whole, and does it with a true sense of social responsibility. Their only goal is to improve the social well-being of their employees, create equal, comfortable working conditions, provide social comfort in society and transmit positive energy. This can be considered an activity that has achieved its goal.On the other hand, some companies approach this work as a part of their marketing activities only to raise their reputation. Sometimes they use CSR to attract customers and partners who are sensitive to sustainable development and the environment, sometimes to increase the attractiveness of their brand, sometimes to avoid sanctions imposed by the government.The real value of CSR lies in honest intent and a long-term commitment to doing the right thing. Transparency, consistency and a focus on measurable impact are key. When businesses approach CSR with integrity, they not only improve their reputation, but also play a vital role in creating a sustainable and fair world for all.

This paper uses a bottom-up national energy technology model to study the optimization of China’s energy transformation pathway. The model clarifies specific action plans for China’s energy transformation pathway from 2020 to 2060, total carbon emissions, industry emission reduction responsibilities, and other dimensions. The results show that: (1) The proportion of renewable energy consumption in China’s entire energy system from 2020 to 2060 will gradually exceed that of fossil energy under ideal circumstances, and the energy system will transition from traditional fossil energy to renewable energy. Meanwhile, the proportion of low-carbon energy sources, such as renewable energy, in primary energy demand will jump from 15.9% in 2020 to over 80% by 2060. (2) China’s CO2 emissions will be approximately 3 billion tons, 2 billion tons, and 1 billion tons under three different socio-economic development scenarios of low, medium, and high speed in 2060. At that time, China will still need to absorb CO2 through carbon sinks in forests, oceans, and wetlands. (3) The electricity industry has the highest CO2 emissions compared to other industries. The electricity industry must bear significant responsibility for carbon reduction in future energy transformation and economic development.

Abstract We have developed a bilayer film comprising cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) underlayer and manganese dioxide (MnO2) upper layer, which are active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. The bilayer bifunctional catalyst is synthesized by electrodepositing cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) on a porous carbon paper (CP) and subsequently immersing the obtained Co(OH)2/CP in a potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution without binders or conductive additives. Specifically, electron transfer between the already-deposited Co(OH)2 and MnO4– proceeded in the solution, yielding MnO2, until all the Co ions become trivalent, after which self-terminates. The proposed method only allows for the construction of the minimum required bifunctional catalyst only at the reaction site of the gas-diffusion electrode, i.e., at the so-called three-phase interface, thus remarkably increasing catalyst utilization while improving reactant and product diffusions. The developed catalyst shows stable MnO2/CoOOH cycles at |20| mA cm–2 with a minimal difference (0.764 V) between the OER and ORR potentials, reflecting the structural advantage of the proposed catalyst. This work proposes efficient bifunctional catalysts having spatially separated OER/ORR reactive sites that can be synthesized via the simple and scalable electrochemical method, which does not require the skill and optimization of binder and electron-conducting additives.

Abstract Recovery of natural gas liquid (NGL) from flared gas is considered one of the techniques of emissions reduction, the recovered quantity depends on several factors including the natural gas composition, operating pressure, and temperature. Process simulation is required to measure the recovery of NGL from the flared gas, and process simulation cases are required to predict the NGL productivity, these cases should be generated at several operating conditions for optimization purposes. In this paper, 12873 data sets are generated using Aspen HYSYS for different natural gas compositions collected from 11 natural gas fields. These huge data sets are used to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting the NGL recovery. The developed model was trained based on 70% of the data sets, validated based on 15%, and tested using 15 % of all the data sets. The results show that the developed NN model can accurately the NGL recovery based on the natural gas composition, and the operating pressure and temperature with a coefficient of determination of 0.9999 and an absolute average error of 4%. The proposed model for estimating NGL production rates is a feasible environmental issue. The availability of changing the operating pressure and temperature could help in selecting the proper equipment such as recovery compressors and refrigeration unit size. This approach also could allow production companies to join the project quickly, eliminate carbon dioxide emissions, and start to gain money in a short time.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, almost 200 nations have committed to the global goal of limiting the rise in average temperatures to 2.0 °C above preindustrial levels, with an even more ambitious aim of striving for 1.5 °C. Achieving the 1.5 °C objective requires a 45% reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, ultimately reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Numerous industries are increasingly making commitments to combat climate change by minimizing their CO2 emissions. However, certain sectors face challenges due to the current high costs associated with emissions reduction through available technologies, though these costs are expected to decrease over time. Moreover, in specific industries like cement production, there are emissions sources that cannot be entirely eliminated, such as those arising from the inherent calcination process. Given these constraints, realizing the emissions reduction pathway to the 1.5 °C target requires the adoption of negative emissions processes, including technologies like direct air capture (DAC), to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The operational concept of the DAC process explored in this study is based on the utilization of both the solvent-based method and alkaline water electrolysis. This involves regenerating the solvent through pH fluctuations generated by a carbonate electrolyzer. As depicted in Figure 1, the consumption of OH- ions during O2 evolution leads to a decrease in pH at the anolyte loop, while the production of OH- ions through water splitting causes an increase in pH at the catholyte loop. Consequently, the lowered pH environment facilitates the release of CO2 gas from dissolved carbon species such as CO32-, while the heightened pH environment promotes the formation of alkaline hydroxides for carbon capture in an air absorber. In this work, we will aim to analyze the energy consumption per mole of CO2 released from the anolyte loop of a flow electrolyzer. Utilizing a combination of theoretical predictions and experimental validations, significant insights were obtained for optimizing the DAC solvent. This optimization involves minimizing energy consumption by adjusting alkalinity levels and incorporating supporting electrolytes. Figure 1

An analysis of the pressure factors that influence the sustainable tourism in the Tremiti Islands (TI) has been performed. Tourist's fluxes have been investigated in terms of monthly arrival and presences showing a high value of the territorial exploitation index with high number of arrivals, particularly in August, and low occupancy rate. Effects of climatic change has been analyzed in TI with reference to the increase of average air and sea temperature in the islands. Some measures of contrast to climate change and to favour sustainable tourism have been discussed also. The CO2 emissions by ferries transport, solid waste and wastewater treatment have been calculated. Environmental taxation for sustainable tourism aimed tat CO2 content reduction is also assessed identifying the value in 1.47 €/capita on the basis of the tourist arrivals and presences considering the environmental cost for CO2 removal and showing that tourism taxation should be well accepted if funds are destined to environmental purposes.

Since the Industrial Revolution, nearly 700 GtC of carbon have been emitted into the atmosphere as CO2 derived from human activities, of which 292 GtC remain uncontrolled. Furthermore, the emission rate is increasing yearly, with the latest value (2022) of 11 GtC. By the end of this century, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is predicted to surpass 700 ppm. The effects of this sudden carbon release on the worldwide biogeochemical cycles and balances are not yet fully understood, but it is undeniable that global warming and climate change are already a fact, with this gas playing a starring role. Governmental policies and international agreements on emission reduction need to produce results quickly enough, and the deadline to act is running out. Besides the agreements to reduce emissions, alternative strategies to reverse this trend must be sufficiently promoted. Biological CO2 capture is a speedy flow of the carbon cycle capable of capturing over 115 GtC annually through photosynthesis. An increase of 6.5% in this capture and the subsequent stabilization of produced biomass could counteract the current CO2 emission rate. In this overview, the artificial culture of phytoplankton is considered a potential alternative to conducting this large-scale capture. A production system model is suggested and the main technological and political challenges for using large areas as partially-natural photobioreactors are discussed. The global implementation of these large CO2 sinks and the associated infrastructure would stabilize the carbon cycle while it is developed as a new source of richness.

Direct electrochemical conversion of captured carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is gaining interest as an efficient method for capturing and utilizing CO 2 , eliminating the need for energy-intensive CO 2 separation process. [1] The integrated electrolyzer with bicarbonate feed operates on the principle of spontaneous reduction of CO 2 released from bicarbonate within the electrolyzer. The key to the on-site decomposition of bicarbonate into CO 2 is to acidify the bicarbonate within the electrolyzer through the deliberately generated pH gradient. Bipolar membrane has been extensively used to generate pH gradient and acidify the bicarbonate feed. [2] However, the high ionic resistivity of bipolar membrane and slow kinetic of water dissociation reaction can result in a high operation cell voltage. In this study, we demonstrate proton exchange membrane based-bicarbonate electrolyzer which produces carbon monoxide from bicarbonate feedstock with high CO production selectivity and low cell voltage that are comparable to the conventional gas fed CO 2 electrolyzer. To achieve highly selective CO production selectivity, a nickel single atom catalyst (Ni SAC) where the atomically dispersed nickel active sites decorated on the nitrogen doped carbon was prepared and utilized. Ni-SAC showed high CO production selectivity even in bicarbonate feed electrolyzer. To further improve the performance of this integrated electrolyzer, significant attention was given to the optimization of electrode structures. Due to the complexity of the reaction environment within the integrated electrolzyer, the performance of the electrolyzer is heavily dependent on the porosity of electrodes and distribution of catalyst on the electrodes. By optimizing the fabrication of electrodes with Ni-SACs, the optimal catalyst coated electrode showed high CO production selectivity over 90% with current density of 100 mA/cm 2 at low operating cell potential of 3 V.

Abstract The degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) was studied using advanced electrochemical oxidation processes (EAOP): electro-Fenton (EF), anodic oxidation (AO) and electro-Fenton coupled with anodic oxidation (EF/AO) on a carbon felt (CF) cathode paired with either a sub-stoichiometric titanium dioxide Magnéli phase (Ti4O7) anode or a platinized titanium (Ti/Pt) anode. The study revealed that operating conditions significantly impacted the kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Increasing the current density from 10 to 50 mA cm− 2 significantly accelerated the degradation of RhB, with 30 mA cm− 2 identified as the optimal current density, balancing energy consumption and degradation efficiency. The RhB concentration also influenced the degradation kinetics: higher concentrations required longer treatment times. The EF/AO coupling process proved particularly effective in degrading higher concentrations of RhB. Toxicity evaluation using the Microtox® bioluminescence inhibition test showed reduced toxicity during the electrochemical degradation of the pollutant, with EF/AO presenting the most significant reduction. The EF/AO coupling also demonstrated superior total organic carbon (TOC) removal, reaching 90% at pH 3 compared to EF and AO alone, suggesting efficient mineralization of RhB and its by-products. Energy consumption (EC) remained relatively stable across all processes during a 480 min electrolysis period. High-resolution mass spectrometry confirmed the degradation pathways of RhB, involving chain oxidation reactions leading to the formation of intermediate products and mineralization to CO2 and H2O. This study demonstrates the potential of EF, AO and EF/AO coupling as effective methods for mineralizing Rhodamine B (RhB) from wastewater, contributing to sustainable and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment strategies.

The N‐formylation of amines using CO2 hydrogenation, conducted under additive‐free conditions, represents a crucial methodology in organic synthesis. Herein, we demonstrated a highly efficient ruthenium pincer complex for the selective conversion of a wide array of amines into their corresponding formamides under additive‐free condition with a turnover number (TON) of 980,000 within a single‐batch. Controlled studies suggested the initial reduction of CO2 to carbamate, followed by dehydration to generate formamide. NMR experiments revealed the potential intermediates and indicated the involvement of metal‐ligand cooperativity of catalyst during substrate activation. In addition, this methodology was examined to establish a carbon neutral hydrogen storage cycle by capitalizing on the reversible transformation of formamides.

Interfaces play an essential role in nearly all aspects of life and are critical for electrochemistry. Electrochemical systems ranging from high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) to batteries to capacitors have a wide range of essential interfaces between solids, liquids, and gases, which play a pivotal role in storing, transferring, and converting energy. This talk will focus on using ambient pressure XPS (APXPS) to probe the solid/gas and solid/liquid electrochemical interface directly. APXPS is a photon-in/electron-out process that can provide both atomic concentration and chemical-specific information at pressures greater than 20 Torr. Using synchrotron X-rays at Lawrence Berkeley Nation Laboratory, the Advanced Light Source has several beamlines dedicated to APXPS endstations that are outfitted with various in situ / operando features such as heating to temperatures > 500 °C, pressures greater than 20 Torr to support solid/liquid experiments and electrical leads to support applying electrical potentials support the ability to collect XPS data of actual electrochemical devices while it's operating in near ambient pressures. This talk will introduce APXPS and provide several interface electrochemistry examples using operando APXPS, including the probing of a well-defined metal electrode to complex composite polymer/nanoparticle electrodes undergoing water-splitting or carbon dioxide reduction reactions. These studies provide new insight to guide the design and control of future electrochemical interfaces.

Advances in the theoretical understanding of electrochemical systems have, over the past decade, led to growing use of periodic Density Functional Theory studies to treat a surprisingly large ensemble of electrocatalytic reactions, ranging from carbon dioxide electroreduction to oxygen evolution. Many such studies have employed simplified models of the electrochemical environment to determine reactivity trends across a broad space of catalytic materials, while other efforts have focused on developing detailed descriptions of electrochemical phenomena, such as the structure of electrochemical double layers, on model catalyst structures. An emerging challenge is to combine these approaches to ultimately enable theoretical design of electrocatalysts for reactions of significantly expanded chemical and materials complexity. In this talk, I will begin by discussing how we have applied strategies from computational heterogeneous catalysis to design enhanced electrocatalysts for the classic oxygen reduction reaction. In such treatments, we have effected highly detailed analyses of the catalyst surface structure and have employed machine learning-based methods to describe interactions between the various ORR reaction intermediates that are present at significant surface coverages. I will then explore challenges in obtaining more detailed descriptions of the electrocatalytic reaction environment, including the structure of catalysts with solid/solid interfaces, the distribution of charges in electrochemical double layers, and the structure and entropy of solvents near the electrocatalyst surface. I will conclude with some perspectives on how these complexities may be incorporated into traditional computational catalyst screening approaches to identify improved materials for more complex electrocatalytic systems.

Carbon dioxide emission from fossil fuel combustion poses a major threat to global environment and ecological systems.Carbon capture, sequestration and conversion technologies are widely pursued as possible solutions to mitigate negative impact by CO 2 . The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to fuels and chemicals using renewable electricity offers attractive “carbon-neutral” and “carbon-negative” mitigation strategies. Various catalysts have been investigated as the electrocatalysts for CO 2 RR. Key challenges facing the current catalyst and electrolyzer designs include insufficient energy efficiency and low single product selectivity. CO 2 RR to C 2 + chemicals represent a highly important area for CO 2 reduction and utilization. For example, ethanol, ethylene, propanol, etc. are among the most produced chemicals by the industry and are widely used for various applications. Using CO 2 as raw material for chemical production through electrocatalysis not only improves the carbon cycling, but also reduces the overall emissions from chemical production. While CO 2 RR via two proton-electron pairs (PEPs), such as the conversion of CO 2 to CO or formate, have been proven high selective with fast kinetics, conversions to C 2 + chemicals are significantly more difficult due to the rapid escalation of required PEPs to much higher numbers (for example, 12 for ethanol and 18 for propanol), in addition to C-C bond coupling. The increased PEPs substantially complicate the conversion by required multiple steps along the electrochemical coordinate, leading to a high probability of branching reactions and low single product Faradaic efficiency (FE). To address these challenges, the design criteria for CO2RR to C 2 + chemicals should be based on high uniformity of active center for directing identical catalytic path and suppressing competing reactions, strong catalyst-reactant binding in capturing the transient species through multiple PEP transfers, and microenvironment with nanoconfinement for retaining reaction intermediates during extended catalytic processes. Recently, we developed a new amalgamated lithium metal (ALM) synthesis method of preparing highly selective and active CO 2 RR catalyst and achieved > 90% FE for conversion of CO 2 to ethanol [1]. Our have since expanded the approach to other C 2 + chemicals including acetate, acetone, glycerol, isopropanol, etc., all with FE at or higher than 80%. To better formulate our catalyst design strategy, we not only measured the CO 2 RR performance over a variety of electrocatalysts, but also investigated their activity-structure relationship through advanced material characterizations, combined with the first-principle computation. We found many interesting properties uniquely associated to CO 2 RR mechanism and kinetics, such as catalyst-size and electro-potential modulated single selectivity. In this presentation, we will share our recent discoveries and future perspective on the development of highly selective CO 2 RR catalysts for C 2 + chemical conversions.

Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.

This study evaluated the possibility of producing high strength concrete (HSC) by replacing Portland cement (PC) with high levels of limestone filler (LF) in binary mixtures and ternary mixtures of PC, LF and fly ash (FA) in contents varying from 50 % to 80 %, with the objective of reducing CO2 emissions during manufacture. Parameters evaluated were axial compression strength, CO2 emissions of the constituent materials and cost per m³ of concrete with focus on reductions in environmental impact. Results indicated the possibility of producing HSC with high LF and FA contents, reduced water/binder content (w/b = 0.25) and workability of 100 mm ± 20 mm through particle packaging and the use of a superplasticizer additive. The resulting concrete had axial compression strength of 51.8 MPa at 91 days with 77 kgco2/m3 of concrete for a mixture with 80 % of PC replaced with 70 % LF and 10 % FA. These amounts corresponded to the use of only 97 kg/m3 of PC (87 kg/m3 of clinker) and 104 L/m3 of water. Thus, it was demonstrated to be possible to obtain a HSC with fck of up to 80 MPa and low CO2 emissions.

The double carbon goal is a wide and profound economic and social systematic change. It is also crucial to China's sustainable development. How to promote emission reduction, the National High-Tech Industrial Development Zones(NHTDZs) policy is the key to addressing this problem. Based on urban data from 2003 to 2019 from China, this paper uses the multi-time point asymptotic difference method to explore the impact of the NHTDZs establishment on carbon emissions. The establishment of NHTDZs reduces CO2 emissions, which remains valid through robustness tests. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that the construction of NHTDZs reduces CO2 emissions by increasing innovation levels, increasing research expenditures and emphasizing human capital. Further analysis shown that geographic location, initial resource endowment, population size, and level of green finance development are difference in different cities. This provides guidance promoting the development of NHTDZs and future layout.

In the current landscape of escalating global environmental challenges, the development of sustainable energy solutions has become increasingly critical. A pivotal area in this endeavor is the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) technology, which holds the promise of converting CO 2 , a major greenhouse gas, into valuable chemicals and fuels. The intricate nature of CO 2 RR, characterized by complex reaction pathways and a plethora of intermediates, presents significant scientific and engineering challenges. Key to surmounting these challenges is the accurate and comprehensive modeling of CO2RR processes. However, traditional computational models often overlook a crucial aspect – the influence of electrolyte interactions with CO 2 RR intermediates. This omission leads to models that inadequately capture the true dynamics of the electrochemical environment, resulting in less accurate predictions. In this work, we introduce CatEnergy, a Python module that enhances our existing microkinetic modeling tool, CatMAP[1], focusing on CO 2 RR. CatEnergy specifically addresses the complexity of CO 2 RR by integrating electrolyte interaction data. This integration enables a more accurate representation of the electrochemical environment, improving the predictive power and efficacy of CO 2 RR models. By generating essential electrolyte interaction data for microkinetic modeling, it facilitates more effective catalyst design and optimization of reaction conditions. This development is key in advancing the accuracy of microkinetic modeling for CO 2 RR and underscores our commitment to sophisticated tool development in sustainable energy research. [1] Medford, A.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 R) constitutes a promising CO 2 utilization technology, allowing the production of valuable fuels and chemicals by using electrical energy from renewable sources. Nevertheless, poor selectivity and high required overpotentials hamper practical applications of the CO 2 R, which highlights the need for the development of more efficient electrocatalysts. Different copper-based materials have been extensively studied as electrocatalysts for CO 2 R. Particularly, copper complexes exhibited interesting properties under operational conditions: many of them undergo structural modifications (e.g. changes in oxidation state and/or coordination number), which potentially affect activity, selectivity and stability. Interestingly, some complexes exhibit reversible restructuring under specific conditions, which can be an interesting property to reach higher stability. In this presentation, we will show the results obtained for the electrocatalysis of water-insoluble copper complexes for the CO 2 R. The activity, selectivity and stability of both [Cu(bzimpy)Cl 2 ] and [Cu(pyrben) 2 (NO 3 )]NO 3 were investigated in K 2 SO 4 0.1 mol L -1 (CO 2 sat.) under different electrochemical conditions. Here, bzimpy and pyrben stand for 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazolyl)pyridine and 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole, respectively. Qualitative EC-MS (Electrochemistry Coupled to Mass Spectrometry) analysis evidenced that both complexes are active for CO 2 reduction and that product distribution changes according to the applied potential. Quantitative gas chromatography measurements revealed that, at -1.24 V vs. RHE, [Cu(bzimpy)Cl 2 ] promotes the formation of H 2 , CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 with faradaic efficiencies of 26, 3.4, 9.2 and 31%, respectively. On the other hand, [Cu(pyrben) 2 (NO 3 )]NO 3 shows FE values of 24, 8.8, 15 and 24% for H 2 , CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 , respectively. After 1.6 h of electrolysis, the former exhibited stable current and FE of ~42% towards ethylene formation.

All-aqueous thermally regenerative battery (ATRB) is a promising electrochemical device for converting low-grade waste heat into electrical energy, while the low specific surface area of electrodes limits its performance. To improve the performance, the carbon nanotube/carbon cloth (CNT/CC) composite electrode with a highly specific surface area is proposed for ATRB in this study. The use of the CNT/CC composite electrodes induces a 37.4% higher maximum power density of ATRB (409.6 W/m2) compared with that of ATRB with the carbon cloth (CC) electrodes. The optimal CNT loading amount is determined to further enhance ATRB performance. Increasing the flow rate helps facilitate mass transfer, the optimal flow rate (50 mL/min) is selected considering the influence of the hydrodynamic loss. Concerning the expend application, a series stack of ATRB is constructed to successfully drive an electrochemical CO2 reduction device, resulting in a comparable Faraday efficiency for the conversion of CO2 to CO.

This paper identifies patterns in total and per capita CO2 emissions among 208 countries considering different emission sources, such as cement, flaring, gas, oil, and coal. This research uses linear and non-linear dimensional reduction techniques, combining K-means clustering with principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which allows the identification of distinct emission profiles among nations. This approach allows effective clustering of heterogeneous countries despite the highly dimensional nature of emissions data. The optimal number of clusters is determined using Calinski–Harabasz and Davies–Bouldin scores, of five and six clusters for total and per capita CO2 emissions, respectively. The findings reveal that for total emissions, t-SNE brings together the world’s largest economies and emitters, i.e., China, USA, India, and Russia, into a single cluster, while PCA provides clusters with a single country for China, USA, and Russia. Regarding per capita emissions, PCA generates a cluster with only one country, Qatar, due to its significant flaring emissions, as byproduct of the oil industry, and its low population. This study concludes that international collaboration and coherent global policies are crucial for effectively addressing CO2 emissions and developing targeted climate change mitigation strategies.

With the increasing environmental impacts of human activities, the problem of polygenic multipollutants in groundwater has attracted the attention of researchers. Identifying the hydrobiogeochemical characteristics of the surface sewage that replenishes groundwater is crucial to addressing this problem. The input of polygenic multipollutants into groundwater leads to not only the mechanical superposition of pollutants but also the formation of secondary pollutant types. The evolution of polygenic multipollutants is influenced by aquifer characteristics, carbon sources, microbial abundance, etc. Therefore, this study took a sewage leakage point in Northwest China as the research object, carried out a controlled laboratory experiment on the impact of sewage discharge on groundwater, and, combined with long-term field monitoring results, determined the main hydrobiogeochemical processes of polygenic multipollutants and their secondary pollutants. The results showed that the redox environment and the gradient change in pH were identified as the most critical controlling factors. In oxidative groundwater during the early stage of vertical infiltration, sewage carries a substantial amount of NH4+, which is oxidized to form the secondary pollutant NO3−. As O2 is consumed, the reduction intensifies, and secondary pollutants NO3−, Mn (IV), and Fe(III) minerals are successively reduced. Compared with the natural conditions of rainwater vertical infiltration, the reaction rates and intensities of various reactions significantly increase during sewage vertical infiltration. However, there is a notable difference in the groundwater pH between sewage and rainwater vertical infiltration. In O2 and secondary pollutant NO3− reduction, a large amount of CO2 is rapidly generated. Excessive CO2 dissolves to produce a substantial amount of H+, promoting the acidic dissolution of Mn (II) minerals and generation of Mn2+. Sewage provides a higher carbon load, enhancing Mn (II) acidic dissolution and stimulating the activity of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, which exhibits a higher contribution to NO3− reduction. This results in a portion of NO3− converted from NH4+ being reduced back to NH4+ and retained in the groundwater, reducing the denitrification’s capacity to remove secondary NO3−. This has important implications for pollution management and groundwater remediation, particularly monitored natural attenuation.

Enhanced weathering (EW) is a CO2 removal (CDR) and sequestration strategy that accelerates the natural reactions of minerals that can store carbon from the atmosphere and biotic reactions. One method of EW is to apply finely ground silicate rocks to agricultural lands. EW has been demonstrated in laboratory and field tests, but great uncertainty remains regarding the life-cycle of using locally available rocks on candidate soils. We evaluate the life-cycle impacts, job creation, and cost of scenarios where fines and rocks mined from quarries in Oregon and Northern California are transported by truck and tilled into agricultural soils. Candidate quarry dust samples were classified as dacite, andesite, and olivine-bearing rocks, with EW potentials ranging from 125-760 kg CO2/metric tonne rock. We determined the olivine-bearing rock from Southern Oregon could achieve a levelized cost of CDR under the DOE Earthshot target of $100/t CO2, as long as application rates are 25 t/ha or more. Even andesite and dacite materials reach lower costs than commercial direct air capture technologies, with reduction in fines purchase and transport costs critical for achieving the Earthshot target. The results suggest that low-cost EW can be achieved using natural quarry materials, with average removal up to 2.2 t CO2e per hectare per year.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize the architectural design and energy management of green buildings, offering significant advancements in sustainability and efficiency. This paper explores the transformative impact of AI on improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions in commercial buildings. By leveraging AI algorithms, architects can optimize building performance through advanced environmental analysis, automation of repetitive tasks, and real-time data-driven decision-making. AI facilitates precise energy consumption forecasting and integration of renewable energy sources, enhancing the overall sustainability of buildings. Our study demonstrates that AI can reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions by approximately 8% and 19%, respectively, in typical mid-size office buildings by 2050 compared to conventional methods. Further, the combination of AI with energy efficiency policies and low-emission energy production is projected to yield reductions of up to 40% in energy consumption and 90% in CO2 emissions. This paper provides a systematic approach for quantifying AI's benefits across various building types and climate zones, offering valuable insights for decision-makers in the construction industry.

The need to limit anthropogenic climate change to 1.5–2 °C, as agreed in the Paris Agreement, requires a significant reduction of CO2 emissions resulting from the use of fossil carbon. However, based on current knowledge, carbon is expected to remain crucial in certain industrial sectors, e.g., the chemical industry. Consequently, it is essential to identify and utilize sustainable carbon sources in the future. In this context, various carbon sources were examined and classified in terms of their disruption of the Earth’s (fast) carbon cycle. Furthermore, the examined carbon sources were qualitatively analyzed with regard to their technical readiness level, their energy expenditure, and their current and future availability, as well as legal regulation within the European Union. As a result, only biogenic and mixed carbon from the ambient air can be considered genuinely sustainable within the Earth’s (fast) carbon cycle. Mixed carbon streams, e.g., from waste recycling, fall into a gray area. The same applies to certain process-related emissions that originally descend from fossil fuel energy. In terms of energy considerations, technical maturity, and exploitable potentials, prioritizing the utilization of biogenic carbon sources is advisable for the time being, especially for CO2 produced as a by-product originating from biogenic carbon carriers.

Cathodic Cu corrosion has been reported to occur in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in aqueous electrolytes and while the mechanism is not understood well it implies carbide-, hydride- and hydroxide-formation mediated pathways. Corrosion leads to roughening, which creates local pockets of electrolyte that are somewhat disconnected from the bulk. In this talk, we describe a combination of theoretical studies to identify reaction pathways, and kinetics modeling of them to obtain a working description of corrosion in water. Corrosion at metal surfaces is both influenced by and influences the formation of nanoscopic aqueous pools by trapping electrolyte solution in microscopic pockets. Such electrolyte nano-pools exhibit non-bulk behavior, and the lifetime of locally trapped ions can be significantly different than in the bulk. This can potentially have an effect on the chemistry in the local microenvironment. Stochastic reaction-diffusion models can be used to model kinetics of electrochemical processes at length and time scales relevant to laboratory experiments, allowing a direct comparison of transient observable quantities to time-resolved experimental data. Atomistic simulations employ methods of electronic structure theory (such as density functional theory (DFT)) and molecular dynamics (both classical and ab initio ) to describe a detailed picture of the (electro-)chemistry at microscopic time and length scales. Scaling up these methods to macroscopic levels is not trivial but required for direct comparison to experiment. By using Gibbs free energies obtained from atomistic simulations it is possible to calculate rate constants for individual elementary steps in reaction schemes describing kinetics of relevant processes. We use Kinetiscope to implement stochastic kinetics models of two reaction schemes describing: 1. cathodic Cu surface corrosion through formation of copper hydroxides, through which we aim to describe essential steps in the cathodic corrosion mechanism of metal surfaces; 2. interactions between bicarbonate and hydronium ions, both present in the bicarbonate salt buffers used routinely in electrochemical reduction at copper surfaces, in a nanoscopic water droplet to understand time-dependent changes in the local concentrations of electrolytes trapped at or near metal surfaces.

Many European buildings require renovation, often involving window replacements and improved airtightness, leading to increased mold risk and indoor air quality (IAQ) issues. Solutions include adjustable air inlets with mechanical exhaust or balanced heat recovery ventilation. Using building performance simulations, we studied control strategies for renovated apartment building with natural or mechanical ventilation. CO2 - controlled air inlets proved most effective for IAQ and energy reduction. In different apartment positions, air inlet performance varied based on available stack effect. Mechanical exhaust cases were less affected by airtightness changes. Altogether, the mechanical ventilation was more robust, but all strategies were sensitive to closed doors.

Access to clean water is a pressing environmental and public health concern. Excess nitrate (NO 3 - ) from the overuse of fertilizer finds its way into our surface water and groundwater, which leads to adverse health effects such as cancer and causes significant damage to ecosystems. 1-4 The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) has emerged as a promising water treatment approach to address this issue. The NO 3 RR involves the transformation of waste NO 3 - into value-added nitrogen species, such as ammonia (NH 3 ), via reduction. NH 3 serves as a valuable chemical in various applications, including its use as a fertilizer, chemical precursor, fuel, and a potential hydrogen (H 2 ) carrier for energy storage and transportation. 5-7 Leveraging renewable energy, the NO 3 RR provides a sustainable approach to distributed NH 3 production, which stands in stark contrast to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. 8-10 As a result, there is growing interest in designing catalysts for the selective reduction of NO 3 - to NH 3 . However, this requires that we obtain a clear understanding of the role of each component in the catalyst structure. Molecular catalysts have unique advantages over other electrocatalytic materials due to their well-defined structures, which can be tailored through the choice of the metal center and ligands. 11,12 Moreover, molecular catalysts can be immobilized on substrates to create heterogeneous electrocatalysts capable of achieving a high current density. 13,14 In previous investigations, we showcased the efficacy of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a catalyst support for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. 13,15 In heterogenized molecular catalysts, CNTs are generally believed to provide high surface area and electron conduction. However, our recent investigation reveals that CNTs can serve as catalysts themselves for the NO 3 RR, 16 which expands our understanding of the diverse roles CNTs play in NO 3 - reduction electrocatalysis. A major challenge in the field of electrocatalysis is the development of catalyst design strategies to control the reaction selectivity. We report on an underexplored approach to overcome this challenge by tuning the CNT support for a cobalt complex. With pristine CNTs as the support, the cobalt complex/CNT hybrid catalyst is selective for NO 3 - reduction to NH 3 with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 70%. In contrast, the cobalt complex supported on oxidized CNTs (OCNTs) generates mostly H 2 under the same conditions. On the basis of kinetic measurements which reveal that the rate-determining step of NO 3 – reduction is limited by the first electron transfer without involving a proton, we propose that the oxygen functional groups on the OCNT support help deliver protons and steer the supported cobalt complexes from catalyzing NO 3 - reduction to H 2 evolution. The performance of both of these hybrid catalysts is compared with the controls of bare CNTs and OCNTs. Additional control experiments include tests conducted in the absence of NO 3 - . These control experiments together with the rest of the experimental data provide strong evidence to support the notion that the product selectivity of the NO 3 RR catalyzed by cobalt complexes can be controlled via the CNT support. This study demonstrates the importance of tailoring the catalyst support to advance reactivity in catalysis for environmental remediation. References: Follett, R. F., et al.

In an era of shifting the energy paradigm from fossil fuels to renewable energy, CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) emerges as a promising approach to covert greenhouse gas into valuable chemical fuels and close the carbon cycle for a sustainable energy supply. Since Cu remains the sole element for CO 2 RR to multicarbon products (C 2+ ), significant efforts have been devoted to developing Cu electrocatalysts with higher selectivity and activity. However, the complex nature of active sites and the intrinsic structures under reaction conditions have remained largely elusive due to the lack of operando / in situ methods. 1-3 In our previous studies, we reported that small Cu nanoparticles (sub-10 nm NPs) showed superior C 2+ superior C 2+ selectivity, relative to the larger sized Cu NPs, especially at low overpotentials. 4,5 In this work, we present a comprehensive operando correlative study of dynamic evolution during the life cycle of a family of monodisperse Cu NP ensemble electrocatalysts under CO 2 RR. 1 Operando electrochemical liquid-cell scanning transmission electron microscopy (EC-STEM) and 4D-STEM resolves microscopic dynamic morphological and structural evolution at the nm scale. Correlated operando high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detector (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) 6 reveals dynamic macroscopic changes in valence states and coordination environment. Statistical analysis of interparticle dynamics was probed by operando resonant soft X-ray-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 2 The operando correlative strategies, described herein, elucidates the longstanding enigmatic nature of Cu active sites as metallic Cu nanograins for selective CO 2 electroreduction (Fig. 1). The strategy described herein can serve as a general platform to resolve the electrocatalytic interface of nanoparticle catalysts under real-time operating conditions across multiple time and length scales, thus serving the fundamental understanding necessary to development of many other electrochemical reactions for renewable energy technologies.

The sand from the processing of iron ore has been widely used in civil construction in Brazil, especially in the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and São Paulo. It is used as fine aggregate in the production of mortars, cement products and concrete. With the possibility of producing new sand in several iron ore mines in the state of Minas Gerais, the present study aimed to develop and analyze concrete dosages with various ore sands and sands present in the industrial market in the Belo Horizonte region. The replacement of natural river sand with mining sand in concrete dosages was evaluated and the Abrams curves were analyzed for the various dosages developed. It was possible to observe a performance gain in the dosages carried out with ore sands, with a reduction of up to 7% in cement consumption in the mixes. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of mining sand in the production of concrete is efficient, with technical and productive gains, promoting sustainable construction, reducing CO2 and promoting the circular economy in the construction chain.

development and employment trends in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs). Cement-based materials are the most consumed in infrastructure projects, and embodied carbon in construction materials contribute approximately to 13% of the global GHG emissions. This paper presents findings of an experimental and environmental impact evaluation, conducted on Normal Strength Concrete (NSC) mixtures dosed with Opuntia ficus-indica mucilage (Ofim) as a bio-additive by mass-replacement of the mixing water. A 15% mixing-water mass-replacement resulted in 20% enhancement of compressive strength relative to the conventional mix. In addition, it achieved an average reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 9.6% with a notable decrease in CO2 equivalents resulting from a lower cement content in the Ofim-modified mix. Moreover, enhancement in durability properties of concrete elongates maintenance cycles reducing the demand for materials that would otherwise be used for frequent repairs. The study concluded that Ofim-modified concrete is an environmentally improved material.

The reactions of radicals with human serum albumin (HSA) under reductive stress conditions were studied using pulse radiolysis and photochemical methods. It was proved that irradiation of HSA solutions under reductive stress conditions results in the formation of stable protein aggregates. HSA aggregates induced by ionizing radiation are characterized by unique emission, different from the UV emission of non-irradiated solutions. The comparison of transient absorption spectra and the reactivity of hydrated electrons (eaq−) with amino acids or HSA suggests that electron attachment to disulfide bonds is responsible for the transient spectrum recorded in the case of albumin solutions. The reactions of eaq− and CO2•− with HSA lead to the formation of the same products. Recombination of sulfur-centered radicals plays a crucial role in the generation of HSA nanoparticles, which are stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds. The process of creating disulfide bridges under the influence of ionizing radiation is a promising method for the synthesis of biocompatible protein nanostructures for medical applications. Our Raman spectroscopy studies indicate strong modification of disulfide bonds and confirm the aggregation of albumins as well. Low-temperature measurements indicate the possibility of electron tunneling through the HSA protein structure to specific CyS-SCy bridges. The current study showed that the efficiency of HSA aggregation depends on two main factors: dose rate (number of pulses per unit time in the case of pulse radiolysis) and the temperature of the irradiated solution.

Purpose Today’s one of the most important difficulties is tackling climate change and its effects on the environment. The Paris Agreement states that nations must balance the amount of greenhouse gases they emit and absorb until 2050 to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gases and to support sustainable development. According to the agreement, each country must determine, plan and regularly report on its contributions. Thus, it is important for the countries to predict and analyze their net zero performances in 2050. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate European Continent Countries' net zero performances at the targeted year. Design/methodology/approach The European Continent Countries that ratified the Paris Agreement are specified as decision making units (DMUs). Input and output indicators are specified as primary energy consumption, freshwater withdrawals, gross domestic product (GDP), carbon-dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrous-oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Data from 1980 to 2019 are obtained and forecasted using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) until 2050. Then, the countries are clustered based on the forecasts of primary energy consumption and freshwater withdrawals using k-means algorithm. As desirable and undesirable outputs arise simultaneously, the performances are computed using Pure Environmental Index (PEI) and Mixed Environmental Index (MEI) data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. Findings It is expected that by 2050, CO 2 emissions of seven countries remain constant, N 2 O emissions of seven countries remain stable and five countries’ both CO 2 and N 2 O emissions remain constant. While it can be seen as success that many countries are expected to at least stabilize one emission, the likelihood of achieving net zero targets diminishes unless countries undertake significant reductions in emissions. According to the results, in Cluster 1, Turkey ranks last, while France, Germany, Italy and Spain are efficient countries. In Cluster 2, the United Kingdom ranks at last, while Greece, Luxembourg, Malta and Sweden are efficient countries. Originality/value In the literature, generally, CO 2 emission is considered as greenhouse gas. Moreover, none of the studies measured the net-zero performance of the countries in 2050 employing analytical techniques. This study objects to investigate how well European Continent Countries can comply with the necessities of the Agreement. Besides CO 2 emission, N 2 O emission is also considered and the data of European Continent Countries in 2050 are estimated using ARIMA. Then, countries are clustered using k-means algorithm. DEA models are employed to measure the performances of the countries. Finally, forecasts and models validations are performed and comprehensive analysis of the results is conducted.

Belite calcium sulfoaluminate (BCSA) cements are environmentally friendly binders inasmuch as they can allow a significant reduction in CO2 emissions thanks to the saving of both fuel consumption and limestone requirement. Compared to the production of ordinary Portland cement, the manufacture of BCSA cements is characterized by further relevant sustainable features, namely: (i) lower synthesis temperature (1250°-1350°C), (ii) easier clinker grindability and (iii) larger use of industrial wastes. Moreover, their environmental sustainability can be increased by the addition of supplementary cementitious materials. The aim of this paper is to compare the hydration behaviour and the technical properties of a blast furnace slag (17.5% by mass) or a coal fly ash (17.5% by mass)-blended BCSA binder with a plain BCSA-system. All the binders, containing 2.5% by mass of slaked lime, were investigated by means of calorimetric, X-ray diffraction and differential thermal-thermogravimetric analyses, mercury intrusion porosimetry, expansion/shrinkage tests and mechanical compressive strength measurements.

CO 2 capture and conversion represent one of the most critical challenges of our society. One sustainable approach to tackle it is the development of electrochemical processes coupling a solar-driven carbon dioxide reduction to CO/water oxidation to O 2 with reactions leading tohigh-value products . In such photoelectrochemical reactors, (photo)electrocatalysts and membranes play a crucial role to achieve high CO 2 conversion with minimum energy. The aim of this study is developing polymer membranes with high stability, mechanical resistance and ion conductivity, that can work in the broad pH operation range of CO 2 /H 2 O co-electrolysis cells. Consistently with the use of KOH at the anode, the used membrane is often an anion exchange membrane (AEM). However, carbonate crossover through AEM occurs during CO 2 electrolysis via diffusion and migration. [1] The use of a bipolar membrane (BPM) allows to mitigate this issue, bringing novel challenges of stability and performance. The BPM consists in a cation exchange layer (CEL) and an anion exchange layer (AEL), with a bipolar junction formed at their interface. Such membrane must guarantee a constant pH level generating H + and OH - by water dissociation at the junction, avoid product crossover, and optimize mass transfer and reactivity of coupled anodic and cathodic reactions. A crucial point is the control of the electrochemical behavior at the CEL/AEL interface. With this aim, a 3D-structure made of a network of fibers was developed [2, 3] providing a great interfacial area and mechanical interlocking of the anion and cation exchange ionomers preventing delamination and facilitating the exchange of ions and matter at the interface. Furthermore, such fiber webs allow the controlled deposition of inorganic or organic catalysts to enhance the water dissociation rate at the bipolar junction. The bipolar membrane was prepared interposing a web of electrospun fibers bearing water dissociation nanocatalysts at the interface between anion and cation exchange polymer layers. The prepared BPMs were characterized for their morphology, composition, ion conductivity, and performance.

The electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO2R) to ethylene on copper-based catalysts has garnered significant attention for its potential in sustainable industrial practices. While substantial progress has been achieved in the development of small-scale electrolyzers with geometric areas ranging from 1 to 5 cm 2 , the imperative to address larger scales for industrial decarbonization necessitates a shift in focus. There are inherent critical risks when scaling a nascent technology like CO 2 electrolysis. There can be emergent phenomena observed only at larger scales, that can prevent it from reaching commercialization, such as change in local CO 2 concentration, defects in the porous transport layer, and temperature gradients The optimized conditions for operating a 5 cm 2 electrolyzer may not work well with a 25 cm 2 electrolyzer leading to failures. Therefore, there is a need to develop a systematic way to test for these phenomena to address these challenges to successfully operate a CO2R electrolyzer at an industrially relevant scale. In this work, we highlight the performance of a Cu-based catalyst designed for the selective reduction of CO2 to ethylene across varying scales, ranging from 5 to 100 cm 2 . This investigation shows the changes in the electrolyzer performance at different scales. Our findings highlight the critical importance of implementing engineering controls to overcome challenges associated with the scaling of electrolyzers. Specifically, we explore the impact of anolyte flow rate, gasket compression, and electrochemical pulsing techniques on maintaining the desired selectivity of the electrocatalyst across different scales. By systematically adjusting these parameters, we demonstrate the ability to mitigate non-linear effects and uphold the efficiency of CO 2 reduction to ethylene, even on larger electrode surfaces.

Urban green spaces (UGSs) provide numerous ecosystem services (ESs) that are essential to the well-being of the residents. However, these services are often neglected in regional urban development and spatial planning. This study quantified the ESs of a 10.25 ha UGS at Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, comprising 27 species with 287 tree individuals, using i-Tree Eco. Key regulating ESs investigated included air pollution removal, carbon storage and sequestration, oxygen production, energy use reduction, avoidance of surface runoff, and replacement and functional values. Results revealed significant annual environmental benefits: 131 kg air pollutants removed (USD 3739.01 or ₩5.16 M), 1.76 Mg carbon sequestered, which is equivalent to 0.18 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 (USD 289.85 or ₩0.40 M), 2.42 Mg oxygen produced, energy savings (including carbon offset) valued at USD 391.29 (₩0.54 M), and 203 m3 reduction in surface runoff (USD 413.09 or ₩0.57 M). The annual total benefits of these urban trees amounted to USD 4833.86 (₩6.67 M), USD 16.83/tree, or USD 0.089/capita. Additionally, these trees had replacement and functional values estimated at USD 311,115.17 (₩429.3 M). The study underscores that species selection and abundance of urban trees are fundamental for maximizing the ES delivery in urban areas, highlighting the role of UGSs in ecological and economical sustainability in cities. These insights are valuable for urban planners and policymakers to optimize benefits of UGSs in cities.

Transition-metal-based solid-state electrocatalysts undergo dynamic phase transformation governed by the local electrochemical environment during operation, e.g., oxygen evolution/reduction( 1,2 ), hydrogen evolution( 3 ), and carbon dioxide reduction( 4 ). Electrochemical active species, often hidden before operation, can become evolved due to the applied electrochemical potential and/or surrounding chemicals. These species are stabilized under the local environment dynamically generated by the reaction product, e.g., proton (H + ) or hydroxyl (OH - ) group( 5,6 ). Active species often account for a small fraction (i.e., minor motif) of the entire catalyst volume, and the nanoscale morphology and chemical composition of the electrocatalyst are inhomogeneous and continuously change during the electrochemical reaction. Thus, capturing the active species remains a major challenge. Spatiotemporal observation of the structural/chemical changes of the electrocatalyst and the correlation with the local electrochemical environment may reveal the active species and elucidate the governing step toward their formation. Furthermore, identification of the key intermediate step of catalyst phase transformation allows the redirection of low- to high-active catalysts; however, this remains challenging. During electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECR), (hydr)oxide-derived Cu electrocatalysts experience significant phase transformation and show high activity and selectivity for carbon dimerization (C–C coupling)( 7,8,9 ). The location and chemical composition of the active species evolving during electrochemical phase transformation may be strongly heterogeneous; however, these species have not been clearly determined. Recent studies have employed operando characterization techniques, e.g., fluorescence hard/soft X-ray( 4,10 ), X-ray photoelectron( 11 ), and Raman spectroscopy( 6 ), to elucidate the active species responsible for high C–C coupling activity. However, although these techniques could track the changes in chemical composition of the electrocatalysts during operation, they did not reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of the active species or existence of minor motifs, owing to their inefficient chemical sensitivity. Thus, it is imperative to develop an operando analysis technique that can probe the nanoscopic chemical composition with high spatial/temporal resolution and sufficient detection limit. By observing the chemical and morphological evolution of highly efficient ECR catalysts during operation, we identified the key intermediate species toward highly active surfaces and significantly enhanced the C–C coupling activity. Operando transmission soft X-ray microscopy( 1,12,13 ), which visualizes the nanoscale chemical composition distribution of Cu-based catalysts during ECR, revealed that partially evolved Cu + phases and surface Cu 2+ phases are responsible for the dynamic dissolution–redeposition process( 4,8 ) and improvement of C–C coupling activity, respectively. We further demonstrated that the dissolution–redeposition process is electrochemically triggered by inducing Cu + phases, which are redirected to copper-carbonate-hydroxide species( 6,14,15 ) even under high cathodic potentials. DFT calculations suggest that these cationic Cu species potentially serve as active species and/or assistive sites for enhancing C–C coupling activity. (1) Mefford, J. T., et al.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful experimental technique used to study the electronic structure and local environment of atoms in a material. It provides valuable insights into the chemical bonding, oxidation states, and coordination geometry of elements. XAS has been widely applied in various fields of electrochemistry, including popular topics like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).Despite the growing recognition of the practical importance of XAS techniques, correlating experimental spectroscopy with the working mechanisms and deciphering the structure of the electrochemical interface under reaction conditions remains challenging. In the case of CO2RR, we utilized operando XAS to investigate multiple Cu-based catalysts in different cell configurations. Our findings revealed that altering the reaction environment can induce an alternative pathway for catalyst structural changes. Moreover, operando XAS demonstrated that the reduction of Cu oxide catalysts is not solely governed by applied potentials but is also influenced by mass transport and other parameters. For ORR, in situ XAS not only provides information about the local environment changes of Pt-based catalysts but also unveils surface properties through △μ-X-ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy (△μ-XANES). This further aids in the discovery of degradation mechanisms in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In the case of HER, in situ XAS enables characterization beyond catalysts and extends to the electrochemical interface. Overall, XAS techniques play a crucial role in understanding the electronic structure and local environment of atoms in electrochemical systems, shedding light on reaction mechanisms and catalyst performance under realistic conditions Acknowledgement The authors thank the funding source from Liquid Sunlight Alliance under the U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels Award Number DE-SC0021266 and the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under the U.S. DOE Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

The sustainable management of pig slurry (PS) in intensive farms is essential to reduce adverse environmental impacts and reduce the ecological footprint. If not managed properly, PS can release GHG/NH3 gases into the atmosphere and contaminate waters. This study evaluates the impact of an integral management system with physical and biological stages to mitigate the impact of PS. The system resulted in effective PS traceability, studying its physicochemical properties. The synergism in the whole system allowed a decrease in the most analyzed parameters during the autumn, spring, and summer. The pretreatment contributed significantly to obtaining an appreciable percentage of reduction in the constructed wetlands of SS (99–100%), COD (56–87%), TN (50–57%), and PO43− (88–100%). The emission values (g/m2/day) were 0–2.14 (CH4), 0–473.76 (CO2), 0–179.77 (H2O), 0–0.265 (N2O), and 0–0.195 (NH3), highlighting the raw, separated and manure fractions with the highest values. It is concluded that the system proves to be a practical, low-cost, and efficient technique for the treatment of PS. It significantly reduces the concentration of nutrients, and the intercepted byproducts can be valuable for application to the soil. In addition, the system effectively reduces GHG/NH3 emissions in decanted, purified, and wetland PS fractions.

Ice accumulation poses considerable challenges in transportation, notably in the domain of general aviation. The present study combines the strengths and limitations of conventional aircraft deicing techniques with the emerging trend toward all-electric aircraft. This study aims to utilize laser-induced graphene (LIG) technology to create a multifunctional surface, seamlessly integrating hydrophobic properties with efficient electrical heating to mitigate surface icing effectively. We investigated the utilization of a 10.6 μm CO2 laser for direct writing on polyimide (PI), a widely used insulating encapsulation material. From the thermomechanical perspective, our initial analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics software (V5.6) revealed that when the laser power P exceeds 5 W, the PI substrate experiences ablative damage. The experimental results show that when P ≤ 5 W, an increase in power has a positive impact on the quality, surface porosity, roughness reduction, line-spacing reduction, and water contact-angle enhancement of the graphene. Conversely, when P > 5 W, higher power negatively affects both the substrate and the graphene structure by inducing excessive ablation. However, it influences the graphene line height positively and is consistent with overall experimental–simulation congruence. Furthermore, the incorporation of high-quality graphene resulted in a surface that exhibited higher contact angles (CA > 120°), lower energy consumption, and higher heating efficiency compared to the use of traditional electrically heated materials for anti-icing applications. The potential applications of this one-step fabrication method extend across various industries, particularly aviation, marine engineering, and other ice-prone domains. Moreover, the method has extensive prospects for addressing pivotal challenges associated with ice formation and serves as an innovative and efficient anti-icing technology.

Nearly zero energy buildings (NZEBs) might play a significant role in addressing current global environmental problems, i.e., greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Buildings are one of the main electricity consumers. With current electricity production coming mainly from fossil fuel power plants, buildings contribute indirectly to GHG emissions. This report shows potential energy-saving alternatives (thus reducing the carbon footprints) for an 18-story office building in South Jakarta’s central business district. Four alternatives are considered, namely cooling tower and CWP pump replacement, BAS installation, LED dim light replacement, and solar panel installation. The project that implements all four alternatives indeed produces the biggest emissions savings. However, its net present value (NPV) is negative, which means the project is not economically feasible. Furthermore, any combination of projects involving solar panel installation will produce negative NPVs. The combination of cooling tower and CWP pump replacement, BAS installation, and LED dim light replacement will be the best option, with an NPV of IDR 437,853,822, an energy consumption index (IKE) value of 11.76 (meaning the “efficient” building category) and a carbon emissions reduction of 1172.65 tons of CO2.

The most challenging deal we face today is the need to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and tackle climate change. Though calls to reduce them are growing louder yearly, emissions remain unsustainably high. CO 2 is the key contributor to global climate change in the atmosphere. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (EC CO 2 R) into chemicals or fuels holds great research interest as a promising approach to mitigate CO 2 emissions and reach a carbon-neutral future. 1 In this regard, an extraordinary effort has been made to discover new efficient and sustainable catalysts at the laboratory level over recent years. High-performance electrocatalysts in aqueous electrolytes often rely on noble metals, which may hinder their industrial applications. Herein, we successfully synthesized core-shell Cu 2 O/SnO 2 nanoparticles 2–4 functionalized with a silane group, using a simple and versatile methodology based on a three-step scalable synthesis method involving wet precipitation followed by salinization and, finally, a rhenium-based complex has been assembled by electro-polymerization. 5 The carbon paper-supported Cu 2 O/SnO 2 -Re electrocatalyst was characterized at 10 cm 2 scale achieving a CO:H 2 ratio from 3 to 9, and demonstrating an stable syngas production up to 24 hours at -20 mA·cm -2 . To translate those developments from the laboratory level to a higher TRL towards the practical application of CO 2 capture and utilization 6 , an additional chamber was added to the system for the continuous CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion, increasing the electrode area from 10 cm 2 to 100 cm 2 . Captured CO 2 co-electrolysis to syngas (H 2 :CO ratio of 5) in one step was demonstrated with a high CO 2 conversion at a current up to -2 A, indicating the scale-up potential of this intensified system. The technology is currently under validation in a TRL4 reactor composed of an array of 5 modules ( i.e. , 4 x 5 cells x 100 cm 2 ) with a total active area of or 0.2m 2 for direct CO 2 conversion from simulated anthropogenic sources. The design integrates low-cost photovoltaic (PV) cells to provide any required additional bias to drive the reaction, thus, Perovskite PV panels with a cost of up to 5 times lower (10 €/m 2 ) than Si PV cells were used. The TRL5 demonstration of the developed technology will be done with real flue gas emissions the first semester of 2024.

With urgency and incentives to cut CO2 emissions, alongside increasing demand for steel, there is a need for technologies that use solely electricity for iron ore reduction, eliminating the role of carbon as a reductant. Herein, we propose the electrolytic production of liquid cast iron using a novel sulfide route, molten sulfide electrolysis (MSE). The process operates using sulfide chemistry and an inert anode. Sulfides are well known from non-ferrous metallurgy1 and the exclusion of oxygen supports a virtual elimination of green-house gases(GHG) emissions from the reduction step. The electrolytic decomposition of iron sulfide into iron and elemental sulfur gas operates in a multi-component molten sulfide electrolyte. The underlying thermodynamics suggests the absence of trivalent iron species (Fe3+) in such conditions, supporting the reduction of only divalent iron (Fe2+) and reducing the energy need proportionally, as compared to other oxide-based routes. Iron sulfide deposits or tailings, as well as conventional iron oxide ores after sulfidation 2 are some of the suitable feedstocks for MSE. Both thermal only, and galvanostatic electrochemical experiments were carried out on electrolyte droplets (~200mg) in a thermal imaging furnace, to confirm the electrolytic deposition of Fe and the evolution of sulfur in a 2-electrode set-up. Faradaic efficiency estimates based on mass-loss measurements – i.e. with respect to gaseous sulfur anodic evolution – are of the order of 90%. Key electrochemical attributes of MSE to be reported include impedance measurement at various fixed DC potentials, measurements at various current densities up to 2A/cm2, and the role of the total charge passed, to highlight the potential limitations observed in such an experimental set up. Characterization of the electrochemical deposits are also presented.

The electrification of chemical manufacturing is an important pathway toward reduced CO 2 emissions. Direct electrochemical CO 2 reduction can thereby become a key technology. CO 2 electrolyzers produce cathodically platform chemicals as CO, format, ethanol or ethylene. The state-of-the-art anode process is the oxygen electro evolution which suffers from high over potentials and moderate valorization. An alternative is the anodic oxidation of biomass to valorized carbonaceous products, such as the oxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to the biopolymer precursor 2.5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). In this work we report the design of electrolyzers flow cells with paired valorization of biomass and CO 2 . NiNC cathode GDEs are used for CO 2 reduction to CO and NiFe-LDH anodes for the HMF oxidation in a zero-gap membrane electrolyzer flow cells. We used a bipolar membrane to separate and optimize either half-cell reactions. Inside the membrane, water is dissociated and the protons will neutralize carbonates on the cathode which is beneficial for a higher CO 2 utilization and single pass. So, we can report close to 95% FE and 100% utilization efficiency towards CO. On the other hand, the hydroxide will stabilize the anode pH and enable PGM-free anodes compared to AEM CO 2 electrolyzer. State-of-the-art HMF oxidation is a semi-batch setup, in which the HMF containing anolyte is recycled to complete HMF depletion and utilization. This design suffered from severe mass limitations. Therefore, we modified the semi-batch process into a continuous process and made tradeoffs between faradaic efficiency and utilization. As HMF is not stable in alkaline solutions we decided that a high utilization is beneficial because the intermediates are stable and could be recycled. We can report a single pass conversion of around 70 % towards FDCA at 200 mA cm -2 at a total utilization of 90%. Figure caption: Paired continuous HMF/CO2 electrolyzer with performance parameter.

This study addresses the urgent need to focus on the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2–RR) to ammonia (NH3). A ternary-metal Prussian blue analogue (CoCuFe-PBA) was utilized as the template material, leveraging its tunable electronic properties to synthesize CoCuFe oxide (CoCuFe-O) through controlled calcination. Subsequently, a CoCuFe alloy (CoCuFe-A) was obtained via pulsed laser irradiation in liquids. The electrochemical properties of CoCuFe-O, derived from the PBA crystal structure, demonstrated a high yield of NH4+ at a rate of 555.84 μmol h–1 cm–2, with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 91.8% and a selectivity of 97.3% during a 1-h NO2–RR under an optimized potential of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the collaborative role of redox pairs (Co3+/Co2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+) as proton (H+) suppliers, with Cu centers serving as NO2– binders, thereby enhancing the reaction rate. Additionally, theoretical studies confirmed that Fe and Co atoms are more reactive than Cu toward intermediates playing crucial roles in hydrogenation, while Cu primarily activates NO owing to hydrogenation by the Fe and Co atoms and a high kinetic barrier in H2O* adsorption. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insights into the electrochemical NO2–RR, establishing a foundation for efficient and sustainable NH3 synthesis strategies.

The expansion of the digital economy is crucial for halting climate change, as carbon emissions from urban energy use contribute significantly to global warming. This study uses the Difference-in-Differences Model and the Spatial Durbin Model determine whether the digital economy may support the development of reducing carbon emissions and its geographic spillover effects in Chinese cities on the east coast. In addition, it looks more closely at the effects of lowering carbon emissions in space by separating them into direct, indirect, and spatial impact parts. The findings show that (1) from 2012 to 2021, the digital economy favored carbon emission reductions in China’s eastern coastline cities, as supported by the robustness test. (2) The link between digital economy growth and carbon emissions is highly variable, with smart city development and urban agglomeration expansion both cutting city carbon emissions considerably. Successful digital economy strategies can lower CO2 emissions from nearby cities. (3) Eastern coastal cities have a considerable spatial spillover impact, and the digital economy mitigates local energy consumption and carbon emissions while simultaneously enhancing environmental quality in nearby urban areas. This analysis proposes that the peak carbon and carbon neutrality targets can be met by increasing the digital economy and enhancing regional environmental governance cooperation.

Abstract Dual Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) have gained widespread adoption across the oil industry. While current applications are predominated by identical size systems to achieve the sole goal of extended run life, incorporating different-sized systems can open the door for expanded applications and operational benefits. This paper introduces various novel applications of dual ESPs that can lead to sustained production target and minimized carbon footprint. The procedure includes gathering reservoir, wellbore, and surface network data. Subsequently, simulation models are used to select and evaluate ESP units of varying capacities, leading to an optimized design for enhanced efficiency. The system incorporates non-return valves (NRVs), facilitating seamless alternation between the two systems and eliminating the need for well intervention and associated carbon emissions. Throughout the ESP operation cycle, an integrated reservoir and network surveillance system is essential for continuous monitoring and analysis of data to determine the most efficient system for prevailing conditions. The comprehensive simulations cover various application scenarios for different-sized ESPs, revealing compelling results such as around 20% reduction in power consumption and a substantial annual cut of around 100-200 metric tons of CO2 emission reduction per system. Furthermore, the study explores the potential application in addressing reservoir parameters uncertainty, showcasing how ESPs of different sizes can offer wider operating ranges. Additional benefits include the ability of dual systems to achieve target rates within maximum allowable network pressures, eliminating the need for surface network upgrades. In conclusion, integrating real-time reservoir data with the novel application of dual ESP illustrates numerous energy and production optimization opportunities. This study emphasizes the significance of data-driven decision-making to provide a path towards more eco-friendly and efficient ESP applications. Additionally, it offers a robust foundation for enhancing environmental stewardship while maintaining ESP operational excellence.

The oscillatory fields near the electrode surface are not considered in the classical models of electrical double layer (EDL), while holding immense importance for stability, activity, and selectivity of interfacial reactions. Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework for oscillatory fields in the EDL under constant potential conditions, combining an orbital-free DFT treatment of electrons on the metal side and a statistical field theory of charged fluids on the electrolyte side. The resulting grand potential is a hybrid functional of electron density, electric potential, and solvent polarization, referred to as density-potential-polarization functional theory (DPPFT). Built on the DPPFT, an EDL model for the Ag(110)-KPF6 aqueous interface is parameterized with experimental double layer capacitance (Cdl) data. The calibrated model is then employed to study the influence of electronic, ion, and solvent properties on the EDL structure and capacitance. Cdl profiles at different crystal faces and in various electrolyte solutions are rationalized coherently. We reveal that intensified ion layering leads to elevated capacitances at the potential of zero charge (PZC) and narrowed ionic peaks in the Cdl profile. Contrary to classical models, the DPPFT model allows co-ions to have an appreciable density near the electrode surface, opening an avenue to decipher the origin of the anomalous anion effects on electrochemical CO2 reduction. The presented framework adds much-needed realism to the modelling of EDLs.

Carbon-supported nitrogen-coordinated single-metal site catalysts (i.e., M−N−C, M: Fe, Co, or Ni) are active for the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. (1) We comprehensively engineered FeN 4 and NiNx sites for electrochemical CO 2 reduction to CO considering the particle sizes of the catalysts, metal content, and the M−N (M: Fe or Ni) bond structures. (2, 3) The unique M-N-C model allows us to elucidate each factor′s role exclusively regarding the promotion of CO 2 reduction. (4) Optimal particle sizes and Fe content provide favorable external factors to improve mass activity. Structural changes of M−N bonds controlled by thermal activation temperatures can intrinsically enhance CO selectivity and kinetic activity. Notably, the NiN 3 active sites with optimal local structures formed at higher temperatures ( e.g. , 1200 °C) are intrinsically more active and CO-selective than NiN4, providing a new opportunity to design a highly active catalyst via populating NiN 3 sites with increased density. Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N−M bond structures and coordination is limited. We further expand the coordination environments of M−N−C catalysts by designing dual-metal active sites. (5) The Ni-Fe catalyst exhibited the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N-coordinated dual-metal site configurations are 2N-bridged (Fe-Ni)N 6 , in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual-metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single-metal sites (FeN 4 or NiN 4 ) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.

Understanding the molecular level foundations of CO 2 capture and conversion might unveil design strategies for efficient materials for these key decarbonization technologies. The control over the reaction channel in the complex network of reactions to produce selectively and on-demand chemicals from CO 2 via electrocatalysis is appealing to scientists worldwide on a fundamental and technological level. Operando techniques have become very popular to help achieve this goal as demonstrated by a flourishing number of dedicated studies [1-3] and other initiatives for discussion [4-6]. In this contribution, I will present recent work on the spectroscopic characterisation of the CO 2 interaction with several prototypical nanostructural systems of relevance, [7-11] emphasising characteristic spectroscopic fingerprints and their critical assessment.

The electrochemical CO 2 reduction in membrane electrolyzer devices can become a key technology to close the anthropologic carbon cycle. For industrialisation of CO 2 electrolyzers, however, performance shortcomings of today’s state-of-art electrolyzer designs and cathodes have to be addressed. Alkaline Membrane CO 2 electrolyzers suffer from low utilization efficiency of CO 2 due to an acid-base CO 2 loss to carbonates, which limits the CO 2 utilization efficiency and single pass conversion to 50% in AEM CO 2 -to-CO electrolyzer. Bipolar Membrane CO 2 electrolyzers suffer from high cell voltage and lower Faradic efficiencies due to the acidic environment. All thoses designs suffer from layer flooding or salting events which limit the durability of the cells. New cell designs and new diagnostic tools are needed to predict, diagnose, and eliminate detrimental operating regimes of CO 2 electrolyzers. In this work, we report on NiNC catalyst-based cathode GDEs for CO 2 reduction to CO in a zero-gap membrane electrolyzer cell. We compare AEM and BPM cell designs. We propose the carbon crossover coefficient, CCC, as a new diagnostic analysis tool to monitor and understand through- or in-plane mass transport limitations in AEM and BPM cells. We also demonstrate how N2 bleeds can be used as diagnostic tools to recognize salting inside the electrolyzer cell. In our AEM studies, we show that sufficient CO 2 access to the catalyst surface sites is important to achieve a high performance. Under near neutral conditions on the anode we report 85% FE towards CO at 300 mA cm -2 at 3.6 V with single pass conversion of 40% which is very close to the theoretical maximum. In addition, we can report high energy efficiency but only a utilization efficiency of around 50%. In our BPM studies, we show that NiNC GDEs are active and stable cathodes in zero-gap membrane electrolyzer. Protons raise the utilization efficiency as the carbonate will decompose into CO 2 and water. To handle the changed electro osmotic water drag we replaced the ionomer with PTFE and could achieve 82% FE and 69% single pass conversion at 500 mA cm -2 with close to 100% CO 2 utilization efficiency towards CO. We show that using a either an AEM or BPM electrolyzer design we can reach over 100h stable performance at 100 mA cm -2 .

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO2RR) is a leading sustainable approach for transforming atmospheric CO 2 into valuable chemicals. This electrocatalytic process relies on a delicate balance of electron and proton transfer steps, resulting in the formation of diverse 1-carbon and some 2-carbon products, contingent on the surface properties. Extensive exploration of various transition metals for CO2RR has revealed that the binding strength of reaction intermediates on these metals significantly influences product selectivity. Notably, metals such as Au, Ag, Pd, Zn, Cd, Bi, Sn, and In, recognized for their activity in CO2RR, exhibit lower binding strengths for CO 2 intermediates, leading to the predominant production of either HCOOH or CO as sole products. In contrast, Cu, with its moderate ability to bind CO2RR intermediates, yields multiple products during CO2RR, albeit with reduced selectivity [1]. Moreover, the overall efficiency of CO 2 conversion is hampered by the simultaneous occurrence of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the potentials required for producing desired products. Thus, it is imperative to develop new, effective catalysts. Catalysts capable of suppressing HER while enhancing selectivity are essential for advancing the overall efficiency of CO 2 conversion [2]. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are a relatively new class of materials that hold great promise due to their high specific activity and maximum atom utilization [3]. These catalysts often provide singular types of active sites, enhancing selectivity in reactions. However, the vast array of possible SACs, deployable on various supports, makes it impractical, if not possible, to use the traditional trial-and-error studies to yield high performing catalysts within reasonable timeframes. To navigate this complexity, theoretical investigations, especially DFT computations and machine learning techniques, have emerged as powerful tools. They can facilitate the identification of suitable catalyst structures and enable the precise engineering of atomic arrangement, therefore achieving targeted product formation from CO 2 with enhanced conversion efficiency. Additionally, conventional synthesis methods suffer from various drawbacks, involving multiple steps, harsh conditions, and a lack of control over the metal site distribution in the carbon matrix, limiting the desired coordination structure [4, 5]. Therefore, the work presented in this talk represents our combined experimental-theoretical effort. Specifically, Cu single atoms were strategically deposited onto defective carbon supports and systematically investigated for their performance as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts. These catalysts were inspired by DFT results showing how the product profile could be manipulated on catalyst surfaces, along with a prediction of the most likely products that would arise from the reaction. These catalysts were synthesized using a novel method denoted as switched solvent synthesis. This approach involves initially impregnating metals onto a carbon support, followed by switching the solvent from aqueous to an organic solvent with a higher dipole moment, and subsequently reducing the resulting mixture under an H 2 environment. This innovative method offers notable advantages, enabling the efficient production of SACs in less time, at lower temperatures (~100-500 °C), and with high yields. In this study, Cu SACs were synthesized, and the influence of reaction parameters on the distribution of Cu metal atoms was systematically examined. The confirmation of SAC formation was achieved through various characterization techniques, including aberration-corrected STEM, XRD, and XPS. To assess the electrochemical activity and CO 2 reduction abilities of the Cu SACs, electrochemical characterization techniques were employed under both He and CO 2 -saturated 0.1 M KHCO 3 electrolytes. Furthermore, the product distribution and CO 2 conversion efficiencies, including activity, stability, selectivity, and faradaic efficiency, of the Cu SACs were rigorously evaluated through electrolysis in a flow cell setup. Quantification of the results was performed using an integrated GC/MS instrument. References: [1] V.S.S. Mosali, A.M. Bond, J.

Conventional low-temperature water electrolysis processes operate either at high or low pH to enhance conductivity, minimizing electrical resistance. Neutral water electrolysis in a buffer solution is considered non-competitive due to higher energy consumption. Nevertheless, interest in water electrolysis using a salt-based electrolyte has grown due to its ability to generate a pH gradient inside the cell. Electrolysis using a neutral salt-based electrolyte has higher operating costs due to its higher standard equilibrium potential (due to the pH gradient) and lower conductivity. Although this approach incurs higher operating costs, it presents a unique advantage: the production of additional valuable elements thanks to the pH gradient generated. In 2019, Ellis & al. [1] highlighted the possibility to use this pH gradient to electrify the production of hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide). Lime has applications in different areas such as the removal of impurities during steel production and aqueous or gaseous effluent treatments. It can also be used as a precursor of cement. Cement production is accounting for 8% of global CO 2 emissions. The acidity generated by water oxidation at the anode dissolves the calcium carbonate inserted. Carbon dioxide from the dissolution is recovered with the oxygen generated. The calcium cations migrate through the cationic membrane towards the cathodic compartment to react with the hydroxide ions generated by water reduction at the cathode. Calcium hydroxide is finally collected after precipitation. Figure 1 compares the conventional process with the electrochemical way and describes more precisely the steps involved in Figure 1. More recently, another way of exploiting this gradient has been proposed by Ni & al. [2] for the recycling of spent Li-ion batteries. With the growing interest in process electrification, other applications may emerge. In this paper, this hybrid electrochemical system for the simultaneous production of hydrogen, oxygen and calcium hydroxide has been intensively studied. Water electrolysis has been performed in a two-compartment cell at different applied currents. Calcium concentration and pH measurement enabled the study of the sub-step efficiencies and equilibria in anodic and cathodic chambers. Perfect faradic efficiencies were obtained with perchlorate salt electrolytes and platinum-free electrodes. The establishment of the pH gradient has been proven and correlated with the transport number of protons through the cationic membrane. Finally, the kinetics of calcium ion migration and calcium hydroxide precipitation have been investigated as well. Continuous addition of calcium carbonate as opposed to a single excess addition was shown to be able to tune the working pH in the anodic compartment and thereby reducing the risk of precipitation on the membrane. Our experimental results lead to the formulation of practical recommendations for achieving optimal reaction stoichiometry in each stage. These findings pave the way for scaling up a promising new sustainable process for lime and cement production. [1] L. D. Ellis, A. F. Badel and M. L.

Oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are critical reactions for efficient sustainable and renewable energy storage. However, the limitation of ORR is a slow kinetic reaction due to the multi-step transfer mechanism of electrons. Therefore, electrocatalysts with high ORR activity and stability are needed to overcome the reaction limitations. Zeolitic imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) has attracted attention in electrochemical applications due to its multiple redox-active sites and high stability in alkali conditions. The Co-doped porous carbon catalysts derived from ZIF-67 have the potential to be used as ORR catalysts with high performance, while pure phase ZIF-67 electrocatalyst for ORR is rarely studied. The work studies the importance of crystal facets on ORR reactivity. The results show that ZIF-67 nanocube exhibits excellent ORR activity with lower half wave-potential and faster kinetics process compared to its bulk structure. It is proposed that ZIF-67 nanocube provides improvement of selectivity for the four-electron pathway, which is a favorable process with higher reaction efficiency. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest unsaturated Co2+ active sites with enriched (100) facets in the cubic crystal. Therefore, the fast diffusion of oxygen molecules to active sites and strong interaction with intermediate are observed in a cubic structure. The correspondence between experiment and calculation offers enhancement of ORR activity and selectivity from control-specific growth of (100) facet with cubic shape. The work introduces a new strategy for designing highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts with facet-controlled, allowing further study in other electrochemical reactions.

Water electrolysis, a key process for hydrogen production, holds immense potential in mitigating carbon dioxide emissions when powered by renewable energy sources, thereby contributing to a sustainable and clean energy future. Commercially available and widely recognized technologies for water electrolysis include the proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) and the traditional alkaline water electrolysis (AWE). In order to use the benefits of both systems, the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) method is proposed, enabling the utilization of non-noble catalyst materials and achieving high current densities at low cell voltages [1]. In the present work, the influence of a spray-drying approach compared to a co-precipitation method on the bimetallic non-noble NiFe 2 O 4 catalysts on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is systematically investigated. State of the art catalyst for OER is Iridium oxide and so far, the best non-noble catalyst has not been found yet. A widely used non-noble catalyst is NiFe- layered double hydroxide but it suffers from low electric conductivity [2]. Another promising catalyst is the NiFe 2 O 4 , which also provides low OER overvoltage. However, amorphous oxides are said to have a higher activity than crystalline [3]. Furthermore, the use of a spray drying approach is highly reproducible, with which the crystallinity can be set very easily [4, 5]. The experimental study of the catalysts was carried out in a commercial Baltic-Fuel Cell with a geometrical area of 25 cm² at 60 °C in 1 M KOH electrolyte and a contact pressure of 1.25 MPa. The electrodes were prepared by directly spray coating the desired amount of catalyst onto the anode and cathode substrates. A Bekipor® 2NI 18-0.25 nickel felt was used as the substrate for the anode, while AvCarb MGL370 carbon paper was employed for the cathode. As cathode catalyst Pt/C from Tanaka (TEC10E40E, 37.2 % Pt) was used, while a loading of 0.5 mg cm -2 Pt was targeted during the spraying procedure. On the anode, the NiFe 2 O 4 loading was set to 2 mg cm -2 . Both electrodes were separated by a Sustainion® X37-50 Grade T membrane. For determination of relevant catalyst activity data chronopotentiometry (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out. Figure 1 reveals that the spray-dried NiFe 2 O 4 (amorphous, red curve) has a superior performance compared to the precipitated NiFe 2 O 4 (green curve) , which is partly crystalline. With the spray-dried catalyst, a reduction in overvoltage of approx. 60 mV at 1 A cm -2 can be achieved. With a cell voltage of less than 1.7 V at a current density of 1 A cm -2 , our recently developed catalyst ranks among the most outstandingly described in the literature to date [6]. These findings can contribute to a further development of amorphous catalysts with even higher activity. [1] Cossar, E., Murphy, F. and Baranova, E.A.

CO 2 electrolysis (CO2E) and anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) have both been identified as promising technologies for reducing emissions from the industrial and energy sectors in pursuit of achieving net-zero goals. 1,2,3,4 Recent developments of electrocatalysts, membranes, and electrolyser cell design have resulted in rapid progress of CO2E and AEMWE, achieving high current densities and faradaic efficiencies at the laboratory scale. 1,2 However, the long-term stability of these technologies requires improvement if they are to be deployed at commercially relevant scales. 2,5 Unfortunately, degradation phenomena such as; cathode flooding 6, 10 , catalyst degradation 7 , membrane instability 8,9 , and salt precipitation 10 are difficult to diagnose electrochemically, without the ability to decouple resistance contributions in-situ .We have therefore developed a 3-electrode technique and explored protocols that allow for the decoupling of cathode and anode overpotentials during long-term stability measurements. By using an edge-type reference electrode connected to the membrane through a liquid electrolyte bridge, we successfully demonstrate the ability to assess the performance of individual components within different membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. We highlight instabilities with using edge-type reference electrodes such as changes in the pH of the electrolyte bridge, and discuss efforts to mitigate these issues to permit long-term stability testing. We then demonstrate how this method can be used to provide more insights into degradation phenomena in both CO 2 and AEM water electrolyser cells, showing early diagnosis - up to 7 hours before detection from a conventional 2-electrode set-up - of failure mechanisms during stability testing. The proposed 3-electrode technique is capable of separating anode and cathode overpotentials over the course of extended testing periods and provides a platform to study the electrochemical response of individual electrolyser components to various degradation phenomena, and the durability of CO2E and AEMWE materials. Critical gaps in knowledge surrounding these issues can be better understood, which will enable these technologies to advance to the next stages of development.

The impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems are profound and far-reaching, influencing not only the physiological responses of individual trees but also the ecological services and overall health of forests worldwide. This review synthesises current knowledge on climate change's physiological and ecological implications for forest health, underscoring forests' critical role in carbon sequestration, biodiversity maintenance, water cycle regulation, soil conservation, disaster risk reduction, and climate regulation. Forests, covering about 31% of the Earth's land area, are vital carbon sinks and pivotal in sustaining biodiversity, with over three-quarters of terrestrial biodiversity residing within them. Climate change, characterised by rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events, poses significant threats to these ecosystems. These include altered forest structure and function, degradation of soil quality, changes in phenology, increased pest attacks, and heightened susceptibility to wildfires, all of which compromise the forests' ability to deliver essential ecological services. The physiological responses of forests to changing climatic conditions—such as variations in photosynthesis rates, respiration, and water use efficiency—play a key role in determining their health and capacity to support biodiversity and ecosystem services. Changes in abiotic factors like temperature, moisture, O2 and CO2 levels directly affect these physiological processes, subsequently influencing forest productivity and resilience. The review highlights the importance of understanding these dynamic interactions to develop effective forest conservation and climate change mitigation strategies. Moreover, the review delves into the multifaceted impacts of climate change on various ecosystem services provided by forests, including biodiversity support, water cycle regulation, soil conservation, and climate regulation through carbon sequestration. As climate change continues to alter these vital ecosystems, understanding their physiological responses and the consequent effect on ecological services becomes imperative.

The unique properties of nanowire materials like fast charge transport, short diffusion length, controlled surface sites and single crystal nature make them ideal for designing high performance catalysts, adsorbents and electrocatalysts by design. To realize any of these applications, one would need either large quantities of nanowire powders or nanowire arrays on large areas. In this presentation, we will highlight our group’s efforts with scalable methods for continuous manufacturing of nanowire powders and arrays for oxides 1 and III-nitride materials. 2 The process for producing metal oxide nanowires has been scaled up to ton-scale. The resulting nanowire powders can be used to formulate unique catalyst and adsorbent products. Zinc oxide nanowires alloyed with catalytically active metals and have been formulated into ultra-deep desulfurization catalytic adsorbents. 3,4 These materials exhibited ultra-deep desulfurization with sulfur removal down to 1 ppm or below for liquid hydrocarbons (diesel, gasoline and naphthalene) and to less than 1 ppb for natural gas. The desulfurization mechanism does not involve formation of H 2 S species unlike that typically observed with hydro-desulfurization process involving sulfided catalysts. Titania nanowires supported with nickel and molybdenum clusters have also shown to exhibit high activity and durability as hydro-desulfurization catalysts for removal of sulfur from hydrocarbons by forming H 2 S. 5 The synergistic activity with MoS 2 and titania are expected to contribute to enhanced activity with desulfurization. Alloying of nanowires with other elements is also studied to produce compound and alloyed nanowires. Fundamental studies have shown that alloying process occurs at much lower temperatures than decomposition temperatures for precursors used. Alloying studies have clearly shown that the solubility in nanowires to be much more than that expected for bulk materials systems. This presentation will provide several examples in which nanowires were alloyed with elements at compositions more than that expected for thermodynamic solubility. In the case of CO 2 sorbents, alkali metal oxide nanowires have shown high capacity for CO 2 sorption as high as 75% by wt. The alkali metal oxide nanowires have been alloyed with alkali hydroxides to produce alkali metal oxide compound nanowires. These solid sorbents showed selective CO 2 sorption from a variety of streams including air, exhausts containing CO 2 at various concentrations. Nanowire geometry for these nanowires allow for non-sinterability, and smaller length scales for rapid diffusion of alkali ions allow for fast kinetics and regenerability. 6,7 Acknowledgements: Authors also acknowledge contributions from Drs.

Recent spectra of protoplanetary disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS), captured by the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), reveal a rich carbon chemistry. Current interpretations of these spectra are based on 0D slab models and provide valuable estimates for molecular emission temperatures and column densities in the innermost disk ($ radius au$). However, the established fitting procedures and simplified models are challenged by the many overlapping gas features. We aim to simultaneously determine the molecular and the dust composition of the disk around the VLMS Sz\,28 in a Bayesian way. We modelled the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz\,28 up to $17\ m$ using the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas (DuCKLinG). Systematically excluding different molecules from the Bayesian analysis allowed for an evidence determination of all investigated molecules and isotopologues. We continued by examining the emission conditions and locations of all molecules, analysing the differences to previous 0D slab fitting, and analysing the dust composition. We find very strong Bayesian evidence for the presence of C2H2 HCN C6H6 CO2 HC3N C2H6 C3H4 C4H2 and CH4 in the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz\,28. Additionally, we identify CH3 and find tentative indications for NH3 . There is no evidence for water in the spectrum. However, we show that column densities of up to $2 $ could be hidden in the observational noise if assuming similar emission conditions of water as the detected hydrocarbons. Contrary to previous 0D slab results, a C4H2 quasi-continuum is robustly identified. We confirm previous conclusions that the dust in Sz\,28 is highly evolved, with large grains ($5\ m$) and a high crystallinity fraction being retrieved. We expect some of the stated differences to previous 0D slab fitting results to arise from an updated data reduction of the spectrum, but also due to the different modelling process. The latter reason underpins the need for more advanced models and fitting procedures.

Lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction (Li-N2R) can be distributed and powered by renewable energy, making it a sustainable ammonia production alternative to the Haber Bosch process. While Haber Bosch is responsible for 1.3% of CO2 emissions yearly and requires centralized facilities with high temperatures and pressures, Li-N2R works at near-ambient conditions and therefore allows for decentralized production. 1 First, lithium (Li + ) ions electroplate as lithium metal on the working electrode. Second, the deposited lithium reacts with N 2 gas to form lithium nitride (Li 3 N). Lastly, Li 3 N reacts with a proton source to form ammonia (NH 3 ) (Figure Right). During Li-N2R, the NH 3 selectivity is controlled through the mass transport of N 2 , Li + , and protons to the working electrode electrode (WE). The transport of these species is limited by the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), a passivation layer formed on top of the WE. 2 The thickness and ratio of organic and inorganic species in the SEI change at different cycling temperatures, thus affecting the rates of transport between charge and uncharged species traveling to and from the electrode. Here, we study the impacts of temperature on FE and SEI composition in 1M LiBF 4 in both diglyme (DG) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a 1v% ethanol (EtOH) proton source (Figure Left). Using ion chromatography (IC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on the SEI dissolved in D 2 O, we quantify the SEI species formed at different cycling temperatures. Our correlation of temperature and SEI compositions to FE provide opportunities to engineer the SEI for improved Li-N2R FE and stability. 1 J. W. Erisman et al., Nat. Geosci 2008. 1, 636–639 2 K.

In Li-N2R, Li ions are plated as Li metal on the working electrode, which then reacts with N 2 gas to form lithium nitride (Li 3 N). Lithium nitride reacts with a proton source to form ammonia (NH 3 ) (Figure left). Past research indicates that the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed in the electrochemical system has a large impact on the NH 3 faradaic efficiency (FE) of the cell. 2 Variations in the temperature during cell cycling can influence both the thickness and composition of the SEI. This, in turn, alters the kinetics of species transport to and from the electrode. Consequently, SEIs formed at different temperatures lead to varying proportions of products in the reaction, and are a helpful tool to tune the system towards NH 3 selectivity. We elucidate temperature effects on SEI formation and FE for electrolytes with 1M LiBF 4 in two common solvents, Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diglyme (DG), with a 1v% ethanol (EtOH) proton source (Figure right). We also confirm the validity of our results with an Ar control. By dissolving SEI species in a D 2 O rinsate, we can quantify the composition of the SEI formed at different temperatures using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and ion chromatography (IC). With our strategy, we correlate SEI composition trends with changes in FE, and provide pathways towards engineering the SEI for enhanced Li-N2R FE to NH 3 and improved electrolyzer lifetime. 1 J. W.

The inception of the European Union's (EU's) 'Green Deal' – a flagship project of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launched to much acclaim in December 2019 – contrasts with its adoption in the final years of the Commission's term in office in 2023–2024. In 2019, unprecedented climate protests and mobilisations across Europe and the world – from the 'Fridays for Future' school strikes to climate marches and to more radical actions by groups like the Extinction Rebellion (XR) – pushed climate change and the energy transition to the top of the EU's political agenda. In this context, the 2019 European elections saw unprecedented successes for Green Parties across the continent, boosting the Greens/European Free Alliance (EFA) parliamentary group to a record 72 members (Pearson and Rüdig, 2020). With the main centre-left and centre-right groups together failing to command a majority in Parliament, the Greens were able to pressure Ursula von der Leyen to commit to ambitious policies. The EU 'Green Deal' stemmed directly from this context marked by 'enabling politicisation' of the climate issue (Dupont et al., 2024). The EU climate law (Regulation EU 2021/1119, 2021), formally adopted in July 2021, committed the block to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and reducing net emissions by 55% by 2030, whilst a large legislative package explicitly called 'Fit for 55' was proposed by the Commission that same month to achieve the headline targets. Although the Green Deal has been developed in times of crisis, the Commission and EU have held steady in their commitments (Eckert, 2021; Von Homeyer et al., 2022). Yet, the finalisation of the legislative proposals aimed at turning lofty goals into action in 2023–2024 – before the Commission's end of term and EU Parliament elections – has taken place in a starkly different context. Energy and cost of living crises, initially triggered by post-COVID-19 supply chain disruptions and dramatically heightened by the war in Ukraine leading to energy supply disruptions and commodity price hikes across Europe, have increasingly fuelled concerns about the costs of climate and energy transitions (Goldthau and Youngs, 2023; Kuzemko et al., 2022). Although energy prices have fallen since the end of 2023, cost of living and energy security issues have remained salient. Politically, this context has been instrumentalised by populist and radical right parties to mobilise against the climate and energy transitions (Yazar and Haarstad, 2023), whilst the centre has also become increasingly cautious, especially the centre right. At the European level, this is most evident for the European People's Party (EPP), which has increasingly contested Green Deal legislation, most notably the Nature Restoration Law (Regulation EU 2024/1991, 2024) (Tosun, 2023). This shift is in part a response to protests and contestations of energy and climate legislation across the continent, notably the highly covered farmer's protests starting in late 2023 and continuing throughout the spring of 2024 (Politico, 2024; Reuters, 2023). The June 2024 European Parliament elections reflect this new context, with a rise of far-right groups, whilst the Greens were the main losers along with the liberals (Hix et al., 2024). Against this background of 'constraining politicisation' of climate policy (Dupont et al., 2024), this article asks whether 2023–2024 represents a turning point for EU commitments to the climate and energy transitions. As a new European Commission and Parliament set in, it is a good time to assess progress and challenges for the EU 'Green Deal'. Has it been faltering? What are the prospects for its implementation and for renewing the EU's green ambitions? I argue that, overall, the agenda for climate action and energy system decarbonisation has proved remarkably resilient. EU institutions and member states have remained committed to delivering the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal agenda by the end of the von der Leyen Commission's term and have mostly delivered. Yet, cost concerns, protests and their political use by right-wing populists also raise questions for implementation, possibly dampening ambitions going forward. This article first reviews the progress of the Green Deal legislation and whether the EU has delivered on its ambitions, focusing in particular on energy and climate change. It then assesses the seemingly waning momentum for climate action and the recent 'green backlash'. Finally, it reflects on the prospects for Green Deal implementation and renewal, drawing insights from past crises and their effects on EU environmental and climate policies. It concludes that, whilst the energy and climate transition agenda is likely to prove resilient, its framing and focus may be changing in the context of domestic politicisation of the climate and energy transition and global geopolitical competition. In its initial communication launching the 'Green Deal', the European Commission (2019) presented a wide-ranging strategy to 'make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050', protect biodiversity, create a circular economy, curb pollution and mobilise finance for the green transition, all whilst boosting the competitiveness of European industry and ensuring a just transition for the affected regions and workers. The implementation of this strategy has led to the proposal and subsequent adoption of a wide range of policy packages and individual laws across different sectors, from climate and energy to agriculture, transport and the environment. Since its launch as a core priority of the 'geopolitical Commission' and over the course of its evolution, the contours of the Green Deal as a political object have remained ill-defined. This is in part because it is a cross-cutting strategy reflecting the multisectoral, complex and evolving nature of the climate crisis, which requires climate policy integration across all areas (Dupont et al., 2024). This is also politically deliberate: to reframe and aggregate new and related initiatives as part of an all-encompassing, purposeful and popular narrative. The EU steamed ahead throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024 to finish off the negotiation and adoption of remaining Green Deal files ahead of the June 2024 EU elections, marking the end of the term of both the ninth legislature of the European Parliament and the first von der Leyen Commission. Uncertainty arose when the Commission Vice President and Green Deal chief, Frans Timmermans, known as a heavyweight skilled negotiator and vocal proponent of the Green Deal, left his post to compete in Dutch elections and lead a left-green alliance (Euractiv, 2023a). He was replaced by Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič and the new controversial Dutch appointee Wopke Hoekstra, criticised for his past employment at Shell and lacklustre record on climate (Taylor, 2023a). Yet, this did not derail work on finalising the Green Deal, which was successful overall with a majority of files adopted and a few blocked or withdrawn due to delays or intractable divisions.1 Looking specifically at the 'Fit for 55' package, which implements the headline emission reduction targets and energy transition objectives, it was originally composed of 13 legislative proposals, later extended to 19.2 As of July 2024, all proposals but one had been adopted by the co-legislators. Some of the legislation updates and strengthens pre-existing legislation, whilst new policies are also introduced. A significant step was the reform of the flagship EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), adopted in April 2023, along with a raft of associated laws. It accelerates the reduction of emission allowances for energy-intensive industries and the power sector; progressively phases out free allowances; progressively includes shipping within the ETS; strengthens the rules for aviation emissions by phasing out free allowances for domestic flights and implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) for extra-European flights; and revises the market stability reserve that aims to maintain stable and effective carbon prices. The reform aims to achieve an emission reduction of 62% in covered sectors by 2030, compared to 2005, a reduction slightly higher than initially proposed by the Commission. In addition, a new and distinct ETS is introduced for buildings, road transport and additional sectors – all considered hard to decarbonise – that apply to fuel distributors from 2027. A new Social Climate Fund, mostly supplied by revenues from the new ETS, aims to help vulnerable households, small companies and transport users cope with associated costs. This is a recognition of the concrete impacts and justice implications of this new scheme and an attempt at diffusing contestation to avoid a replay of protracted opposition, such as the 'Yellow Vest' protests that rocked France in 2018–2020 following an increase in fuel taxes. An innovative and internationally controversial piece of legislation is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which imposes a carbon tax on imports of products in carbon-intensive industries. CBAM is to be progressively phased in from 2026 in line with the phasing out of free allowances within the ETS, aiming to put EU and third-country industries on a level playing field and avoid carbon leakage – the outsourcing of industrial emissions to jurisdictions with lower emission standards and costs. In sectors not covered by the ETS (road and domestic maritime transport, buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries), emission reductions are defined by the Effort Sharing Regulation. The revision, adopted in March 2023, increases the 2030 EU-wide target from 29% to 40%, compared with 2005, and distributes the effort with binding national targets. Along with this, the revised Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) regulation of March 2023 includes an increased EU-level target of at least 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent net removals of greenhouse gases for 2030, with associated and binding national targets. A new regulation on tracking and reducing methane emissions in the energy sector, adopted in November 2023, aims to implement the Global Methane Pledge signed along with over 100 countries at the UN Climate COP26. It requires the oil, gas and coal industries to measure, report and verify methane emissions and to put in place mitigation measures for leak detection and repair, as well as for closed wells and mines. For transport, a hard-to-decarbonise sector, a number of new laws were passed in addition to ETS provisions. The regulation on CO2 emission standards for cars and vans, updated and finally adopted in March 2023, introduces progressive emissions reduction targets, including a 100% emission reduction target for 2035, which effectively amounts to a complete phase-out of combustion car and van sales. In parallel, and to facilitate the growth of electric vehicles, the regulation on alternative fuel infrastructure finalised that same month mandates the installation of recharging stations for cars and vans every 60 km, as well as hydrogen refuelling stations for cars and lorries in all urban nodes from 2030 onwards. For shipping, a July 2023 agreement on the FuelEU maritime initiative mandates a reduction of greenhouse gas intensity for the energy used on-board ships by up to 80% by 2050, whilst promoting the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Concerning aviation, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative adopted in October 2023 aims to promote sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) (e.g., advanced biofuels, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and recycled fuels meeting sustainability and emissions-saving criteria). It sets obligations for fuel suppliers to ensure that aviation fuels contain minimum shares of SAF (from 2025) and synthetic fuels (from 2030), increasing progressively until 2050. The energy sector also saw key proposals updated. The revision of the flagship renewable energy directive, finally adopted in October 2023, sets a binding target of 42.5% renewable energy in EU final energy consumption by 2030 (up from a paltry 32.5%), with an extra 2.5% indicative top-up to reach the 45% supported by the most ambitious member states and European Parliament. The directive does not set binding national renewable energy targets but introduces a mix of binding and non-binding renewable sub-targets in transport, industry, buildings and district heating and cooling, whilst also mandating faster permitting procedures for renewable energy projects. Increased ambitions are in part the results of the REPowerEU plan of 18 May 2022, adopted in the context of the war in Ukraine and aiming at reducing EU dependence on Russian gas (Von Homeyer et al., 2022; Wendler, 2023). It introduced targeted emergency amendments to increase overall ambitions to 45%. As pointed out by Buzogány et al. (2023), the revised renewable energy directive also introduces a high level of flexibility for member states regarding the various sub-targets as a condition of its adoption. Ambitions have also been upgraded for energy efficiency. The revised energy efficiency directive, agreed upon in July 2023, sets a target to reduce final EU energy consumption by 11.7% in 2030 compared to 2020 projections. This is less than the 13% proposed under the REPowerEU plan and, in typical fashion, a middle ground between the more ambitious Parliament and the more cautious Council (Kurmayer, 2023). The directive also includes indicative national contributions for member states, a gradual increase of the annual energy savings target and a specific annual energy consumption reduction for the public sector (including the yearly renovation of a set share of public buildings). The energy efficiency directive is complemented by a revision of the energy performance of buildings directive, completed in 2024, which aims for all new buildings to be zero emission by 2030 and for existing buildings to be retrofitted to have zero emissions by 2050, with mandates for solar energy in buildings and rising minimum energy performance standards and renovation targets. Finally, a regulation and a directive adopted in December 2023 aim to facilitate the shift from natural gas to renewable and low-carbon gases by setting common rules for hydrogen infrastructures and markets. Of the 19 proposals associated with the 'Fit for 55' package, only one remains pending. The proposed revision of the Council directive on the taxation of energy products and electricity aims to switch from energy taxation based on volume to taxation based on energy content. Fossil fuels would be taxed at the highest rate and electricity at the lowest. Energy taxation is a sovereign, sensitive matter and the exclusive competence of the member states under the Lisbon Treaty, decided by the Council subject to unanimity, which has proved a perennial challenge. The 2003 directive sets minimum levels of taxation on energy products, fuels and electricity but places energy sources on an equal footing irrespective of their carbon content. Despite agreement that an update is much overdue, a previous attempt started in 2011 failed in the face of member states' opposition, leading the Commission to withdraw the proposal in 2015. Once again, despite the last-ditch efforts from the Belgian Presidency in the winter of 2024, no agreement could be reached, and its adoption has been postponed to the next legislature (Messad, 2024). Overall, then, despite the challenges associated with post-COVID-19 recovery and the war in Ukraine, from energy supply disruptions to high energy prices, the momentum for climate action and energy system decarbonisation has not evaporated, showing remarkable resilience. EU institutions and member states have remained committed to delivering the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal agenda during the term of the von der Leyen Commission and have mostly delivered. Indeed, as many have pointed out, the crises have been reframed into 'windows of opportunity' for furthering the Green Deal agenda (Eckert, 2021; Von Homeyer et al., 2022). The COVID-19 NextGenEU recovery programme of €750 billion and the associated Recovery and Resilience Facility make new funding available in the form of loans and grants. With member states required to spend at least 37% of their National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRPs) in support of the green transition, this additional funding has tended to accelerate ongoing policies and projects rather than new initiatives (Bocquillon et al., 2023). Similarly, the EU's response to the war in Ukraine, in particular the REPowerEU plan to reduce dependence on Russia, has mostly accelerated pre-existing Green Deal dynamics rather than initiated a change of course (Wendler, 2023). It has led to a Commission's legislative proposal for an upgrade of the Green Deal's renewable and energy efficiency targets for 2030 to foster homegrown renewables and reduce imports; additional investments of €210 billion until 2027 to be defined in new REPowerEU chapters added to NRRPs [with the possibility of financing liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure]; and various soft mechanisms to help diversify supplies (e.g., external engagement strategy, establishment of a new voluntary EU Energy Platform to co-ordinate energy purchases and hydrogen strategy). None of this has upended and, in fact, reinforced the Green Deal's agenda. The jury is still out, however, as to the overall effect of the energy crisis in view of national efforts to shore up short-term fossil fuel supplies with new contracts and infrastructure (Goldthau and Youngs, 2023; Kuzemko et al., 2022). As most energy and climate legislation has been adopted, at least in this first phase of an ever-evolving agenda, attention turns towards implementation, which is crucial to effectiveness and legitimacy. Looking at the period covering the Eurozone crisis for insight, when the salience of and appetite for ambitious environment and climate policies receded, several studies tracked environmental policy dismantling and found real but limited instances in the face of institutional resilience (Gravey and Jordan, 2016). They also point out that there is a risk of policy dismantling 'through the back door' in implementation, notably via delegated and implementing acts (Burns and Tobin, 2020). As is evident from the cursory overview above, adopted legislation is ridden with flexibility mechanisms, such as indicative targets, exemptions and optionality, which may be justified in view of national diversity and indeed necessary to reach agreements, but can also make effective implementation challenging. This is clearly the case with the revised renewable energy directive, with its various sub-targets and differentiated options (see Buzogány et al., 2023). Various policies also have phase-in periods and start to kick in progressively, with stringency increasing over time, often beyond 2030 (Von Homeyer et al., 2022). For instance, targets for reducing and phasing out combustion cars will increase, reaching 100% in 2035. This is also the case for CBAM, which has only reporting obligations during a phase-in period, with its tax component entering into force in 2026 in parallel with the phasing out of free ETS allowances. The new ETS enters into force from 2027 onwards. These phase-in and phase-out periods create multiple points where legislation starts 'to bite' for stakeholders. Some of the legislation, like the ban on new combustion engine sales in 2035 or the new building standards, directly impacts European citizens. There is, therefore, potential for politicisation and contestation of the implementation process, which policy-makers may be particularly concerned about. Certain pieces of legislation in the 'Fit for 55' package also have extra-territorial effects, most notably CBAM. It has been actively discussed, criticised and challenged in international forums. For instance, India has threatened a legal challenge under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules against a trade barrier considered especially disadvantageous to developing countries (Euractiv, 2023b). The EU's unilateral approach may trigger international tensions, making implementation challenging (Smith et al., 2024). In a context of geopolitical competition over who controls the energy transition, the Green Deal has increasingly taken a new turn towards green industrial policy. In response to the United States's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and as part of its Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Commission proposed in May 2023, and the co-legislators adopted in March 2024, a new Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) establishing a non-binding target of 40% strategic 'net-zero' technologies to be produced within the EU, as well as a European Critical Raw Material Act that sets benchmarks for domestic production of key minerals, all whilst aiming to speed up projects. The goal is to secure and reduce dependence on key raw materials and technologies, from the production and import of critical minerals essential for green technologies to battery and electric vehicle production. This industrial and geopolitical framing is likely to become more prominent in the Green Deal to achieve both economic growth and reduced dependence, but it may also fuel international frictions. The economic crisis of the early 2010s showed that, beyond implementation challenges, economic imperatives and environmental objectives could conflict with each other and dampen EU ambitions (Burns et al., 2020; Skovgaard, 2014). Citizens, stakeholders and governments may become less willing to bear the costs of climate action or more cautious about what they can commit to. Crises also offer an opportunity for those against ambitious action to challenge, mobilise and gain legitimacy. Although the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal proved relatively resilient with the finalisation of most proposals, the years 2023–2024 also saw the emergence of a wave of opposition and protests against green policies, including parts of the Green Deal. These protests were widely covered in European and national media, often presented as a 'green backlash' or 'greenlash' (e.g., Politico, 2024; Reuters, 2023; Tash, 2024). Discontent focused on the costs of green policies in a period of cost-of-living crisis and economic downturn, with businesses denouncing the 'regulatory burden' imposed on them. Protests took place across Europe, the West and East and the North and South. Most prominent and widely covered were the farmers' protests that spread across the EU, from Belgium to Germany, France to Spain and Poland to Romania. Often blocking roads, their demands were diverse but tended to focus on costly regulation, notably as part of the greening of the Common Agricultural Policy and biodiversity protection. These protests led to the Commission scrapping a proposal to halve pesticide use in the EU (Tash, 2024). In the Netherlands, plans to cut nitrogen pollution fuelled discontent and the surprise rise of a new farmers' protest party. The backlash was not only limited to farming and conservation, however, with discontent emerging on other issues directly related to energy and climate, such as the phasing out of oil and gas boilers, which nearly broke the German coalition, or the particularly inflammatory phasing out of combustion cars.3 The backlash has been driven by the right and far right (Yazar and Haarstad, 2023). Radical right populists tend to be inimical to climate ambitions, largely on ideological grounds (Lockwood, 2018), even though there is mixed evidence as to their ability to influence EU policy when in power (Huber et al., 2021). Climate policy has become a 'wedge issue' (Dickson and Hobolt, 2024) for these parties, which have politicised it to split and polarise the electorate and shore up support from their climate sceptic base. At the EU level, the far-right grouping of the European Conservatives and Reformists and Identity and Democracy, as well as the centre-right EPP, which is part of the majority coalition, have challenged the purpose and content of pending legislation. The EPP's principal target was the controversial Nature Restoration Law, which sets a target of restoring at least 20% of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030. Building on farmer protests, it failed to block it but was able to considerably weaken the text (Taylor, 2023b). Governments, in turn, responded to domestic pressure or a perceived change of mood. French President Macron's call for a 'European regulatory pause' in the adoption of new green legislation to protect industries (Messad, 2023), supported by other leaders such as Belgian Prime Minister de Croo, came as a shock. The final phase of the negotiations on several files, from car emissions to the energy performance of buildings, saw rising member-state opposition. Poland even initiated legal proceedings against the EU ban on combustion cars in 2035 (Politico, 2023). This picture needs to be nuanced. First, not all parts of the Green Deal have been equally affected. Opposition has tended to concentrate on agriculture reforms and the conservation of nature. Second, the perceived importance of, and support for climate action remain high across member states, at levels broadly similar to 2019, even though climate may have gone down the pecking order of priorities (Eurobarometer, 2023). Despite disruptions and high energy prices due to the war in Ukraine, a majority of respondents to the 2023 special Eurobarometer survey on climate change considered that the transition to a green economy should be sped up. Similarly, Abou-Chadi et al. (2024), based on a representative survey across three countries, argue that the backlash narrative is overblown and largely confined to the far right, with widespread support for climate action and climate policies, provided costs are mitigated through green industrial policies and offsetting measures. Still, the June 2024 European elections indicate challenges ahead for the Green Deal. The main winners were the far-right parties (European Conservatives and Reformists 78, Patriots for Europe 84 and Europe of Sovereign Nations 25) and the centre right (EPP 188), with the main losers being the Greens (Greens/EFA 53) and the liberals (Renew Europe 77). Compared to 2019, when a key signal was a shift towards pro-environment parties and policies, 2024 heralds a shift towards parties with critical positions towards an ambitious environmental agenda, even if the results were arguably not driven by environmental issues. As Hix et al. (2024) and others have pointed out, the new majority will not unravel already adopted legislation, but it could settle for less ambitious climate policies going forward, given the EPP's increasingly critical stance and the fact that the relatively ambitious bloc of the Socialists & Democrats, the liberals and the Greens no longer commands a majority of seats. In her speech to the European Parliament ahead of the vote on her reappointment, which was eventually successful based on a grand coalition against the far right, Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed her commitment to the bloc's climate objectives, including a yet-to-be-agreed 90% reduction target for 2040, and to further the Green Deal agenda. However, the language suggested a framing focused more on competitiveness and green industrial policy with the promise of a 'Clean Industrial Deal', whilst nature and the environment were only mentioned in general terms (Cagney, 2024). The EU Green Deal illustrates, from its inception to its adoption, the promises and perils – or inherent tensions – of the politicisation of climate change (Dupont et al., 2024; Paterson et al., 2022). In 2019, climate movements pushed climate change – an already well-established and institutionalised policy area – on top of the EU's political agenda. In this context, the Commission proposed a novel, cross-cutting and relatively ambitious Green Deal, receiving wide support across member states and the political spectrum. In this case, politicisation proved enabling. In contrast, the completion of the Green Deal ahead of EU elections has been marked by a different context, with a section of the impacted stakeholders as well as the radical right and centre right politicising the Green Deal agenda to undermine it – a form of 'constraining politicisation' (Dupont et al., 2024). The Green Deal has proved relatively resilient to the COVID pandemic and the energy crisis, and implementing legislation has been mostly adopted in 2023 and the first half of 2024 – at least its energy and climate component. Therefore, it would be hard to undo and unlikely to unravel. Climate and energy policies are well established, benefit from high legitimacy and are deeply institutionalised; in contrast, the biodiversity and farming components of the Green Deal have been subject to deeper challenges. Yet, implementation could prove a challenge for climate and energy, with dismantling through the back door via executive acts; policies that are due to be reviewed and could be weakened; and perhaps most importantly, a lack of ambition and stagnation moving forward. There is, therefore, considerable uncertainty, just as a new cycle of negotiations is opening over the 2040 targets. The Green Deal remains fundamentally a moving political object with blurry boundaries, rather than a 'done deal'. More likely than its faltering, one can expect a change in its framing and focus – on competitiveness and green industrialisation in particular – in the context of domestic politicisation of the climate and energy transition and global geopolitical competition. The author would like to thank the Annual Review editors for their support, patience and constructive feedback in producing this piece.
