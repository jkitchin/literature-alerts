This study explores the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn) catalyst-loaded gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs). The research explores the influence of electrolytic potential and catalyst loading on the efficiency of CO2 conversion to valuable chemicals, specifically formic acid and carbon monoxide. The best Sn loading for Sn-loaded GDEs, according to the morphological study, is 7 mg.cm-2, which results in higher current density (0.33 mA.cm-2) and current efficiency (36%). An electrolytic potential of -1.3 V Vs. Ag/AgCl is identified as optimal for Sn GDEs, offering a balance between high current efficiency (35%) and controlled current density. For Zn-loaded GDEs, an optimal loading of 5 mg.cm²- yields the highest current efficiency of 19.4% and a peak current density of 0.28 mA.cm²- at an electrolytic potential of -1.55 V Vs. Ag/AgCl, in addition to highlighting the crucial role that catalyst loading and electrolytic potential play in enhancing CO2 reduction efficiency, this research offers insightful information for environmentally friendly CO2 conversion technology.

Abstract Constructing a built‐in interfacial electric field (BIEF) is an effective approach to enhance the electrocatalysts performance, but it has been rarely demonstrated for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to date. Herein, for the first time, SnO 2 /LaOCl nanofibers (NFs) with BIEF is created by electrospinning, exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 100% C 1 product (CO and HCOOH) at −0.9–−1.1 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a maximum FE HCOOH of 90.1% at −1.2 V RHE in H‐cell, superior to the commercial SnO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) and LaOCl NFs. SnO 2 /LaOCl NFs also exhibit outstanding stability, maintaining negligible activity degradation even after 10 h of electrolysis. Moreover, their current density and FE HCOOH are almost 400 mA cm −2 at −2.31 V and 83.4% in flow‐cell. The satisfactory CO 2 RR performance of SnO 2 /LaOCl NFs with BIEF can be ascribed to tight interface of coupling SnO 2 NPs and LaOCl NFs, which can induce charge redistribution, rich active sites, enhanced CO 2 adsorption, as well as optimized Gibbs free energy of *OCHO. The work reveals that the BIEF will trigger interfacial accumulation and stability enhancement effects in promoting CO 2 RR activity and stability of SnO 2 ‐based materials, providing a novel approach to develop stable and efficient CO 2 RR electrocatalysts.

Electrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction are important processes to produce hydrogen and low–carbon fuels as renewable energy sources. Here, nanostructured MnMoO4, prepared by the reflux precipitation method, was investigated as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions. Using a combination of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results, a direct band gap of 3.05 eV was obtained experimentally for the prepared MnMoO4. An overpotential of 0.36 V at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec-1 were obtained for the oxygen evolution reaction. At a current density of 3 mA cm-2, overpotentials of 0.39 V and 0.58 V were achieved in the absence and presence of CO2 bubbling into a 0.1 M KOH solution, respectively, emphasizing the poisoning effect of CO2 reduction intermediates for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Based on the obtained results, MnMoO4 could be a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions.

The development of highly efficient catalysts for the selective electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (eCO2RR) to high-valued formate remains a challenge in achieving carbon neutrality and renewable energy conversion. In this study, ultrathin Bi4Cl2S5 nanowires, synthesized using different branched-chain thiols as sulfur sources, were reported for the first time as precatalysts for eCO2RR to formate. Systematic material characterization demonstrated that Bi4Cl2S5 can undergo in-situ evolution into Bi2O2CO3 nanowires, serving as the genuine electrocatalyst for eCO2RR. Through the fine-tuning of ligands during the synthesis of Bi4Cl2S5 nanowires, the optimized Bi4Cl2S5-derived Bi2O2CO3 nanowires exhibited a maximum formate Faradaic efficiency (FEformate) of 95.3 % in eCO2RR using a traditional H-cell, surpassing other prepared samples. Furthermore, an FEformate of over 92.9 % was achieved in a wide potential window of 500 mV, and high performance was maintained over 20 h. This outstanding performance is attributed to the high intrinsic activity, accelerated charge transfer, and the large electrochemical active surface area associated with the characteristic sub-10 nm diameter nanowire structure. Moreover, density function theory calculations further revealed that Bi2O2CO3 can reduce the energy barriers for the formation of *OCHO intermediate and bolster formate production. Our work provides a novel synthesis strategy for excellent Bi-based catalysts in electrocatalysis.

The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction is severely limited by sluggish charge kinetics. To address this issue, a strategy utilizing non-metal-doped layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been developed to control the electronic structure of spindle-shaped nanoflowers, resulting in efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The results demonstrate that the designed catalyst yields 263.16 μmol g−1 h−1 for the photoreduction of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, the in situ FT-IR analysis demonstrate that the specific S-ligand (S-bridge) facilitates CO2 activation, ensuring the continuous production of *COOH. The hydrothermal-assisted ionic liquid method proposed in this study offers guidance for modifying catalysts.

Engine downsizing is considered a strategic idea in fuel economy enhancement as well as reduction. It is defined in the literature as the decrease in engine geometrical dimensions besides its performance being fixed. In this research, the Iranian gasoline-fueled national engine, EF7, has been investigated for 25% downsizing. After introducing the gasoline-fueled and CNG-fueled versions of downsized engines, their performance, besides release rates are studied in detail. A one-dimensional engine simulator coupled with a 3D-CFD model is developed to carry out such an investigation, an experimental test setup is provided to evaluate the accuracy of the provided numerical model, as well. The first version of presented downsized engines, called EF7, is a 3-cylinder engine with the same geometrical characteristics as the base engine, which is equipped with a turbo-charger and dual CVVT technologies. The EF7 is then introduced by fuel shifting to CNG as the second version of downsized engines, and finally, increasing the compression ratio, the EF7 is presented as the third version of studied-downsized engines. The results show almost the same rate of BSFC besides a 3.4% reduction in concentration for EF7, 20.6% fuel economy enhancement, besides 20.8% reduction in the specific release rate for EF7, and 28.8% fuel economy enhancement, besides 25.3% reduction in the specific release rate for EF7 in comparison with the base engine.

Using photoelectrochemical technology to construct efficient photoelectric materials has aroused extensive research interest. In this study, we propose a two-dimensional porous CuSe@BiOI isotype heterojunction photocathode for CO2 reduction to formic acid. The heterojunction was constructed by the epitaxial growth of high-quality oriented BiOI nanosheets onto the porous CuSe framework. The CuSe framework as a template to ensure the formation of the (1 0 2) facets of BiOI and the isotropic charge transport characteristics of the (1 0 2) surface greatly improve the efficiency of charge separation and transfer. This CuSe@BiOI isotype heterojunction electrode can efficiently reduce CO2 to formic acid with a selectivity of up to 80.5 % in 0.5 M potassium bicarbonate aqueous solution. Meanwhile, the performance of the photodetector based on CuSe@BiOI heterostructure is 6.97 × 1011 Jones and a response rate of 87.13 mA W−1. This finding provides a new approach to designing stable heterojunction photoelectrocatalysts with isotropy

The article touches upon the issues of global warming associated with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere from vehicle internal combustion engines (ICE). To neutralize existing greenhouse gases emitted by ICE, in particular CO2, the interaction of the latter with various chemicals has been studied. The dynamics of exhaust gas emissions from ICE cylinders were observed. The experimental research was conducted to develop a greenhouse gas neutralization technology. Carbon dioxide neutralization converter with three neutralization batteries and a homogenization device is presented. This converter can guarantee CO2 neutralization of up to 92%. The formation of CO2 in the cylinders of modern petrol engines is due to the final combustion of the air-petrol fuel mixture. The combustion of the latter in the cylinder can be heterogeneous and diffusive. In addition, CO2 is generated in large quantities during diffusion combustion. The most effective method of diffusive combustion was chosen by the constructors of modern ICE, which is the formation of an artificial turbulent gas-dynamic condition for the fuel mixture due to the increase in the temperature of the air adsorbed in the cylinder, which ensures the engine's thermal energy efficiency coefficient of up to 35%. The CO2 volume in the exhaust gases of such engines reaches up to 16%. Thus, considering the perfection of modern ICE design for providing a high-efficiency reaction for the hydrocarbon oxidation in the fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, it becomes apparent that the presence of about 16% CO2 in the fractional composition of emitted dissolved gases is a serious problem in terms of increasing the volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Therefore, the goal of this article is to develop a reduction technology.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is considered an effective measure to mitigate climate change, used to reduce CO2 emissions from industrial sectors, especially for coal-fired power plants. In our previous work, a novel water-based CO2 capture (WCC) method based on adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES) was developed. This method is simple and environmentally friendly. However, unlike the widely used monoethanolamine (MEA)-based CO2 capture (MCC) technology, which consumes low-grade thermal energy, the WCC technology consumes high-grade electrical energy. Therefore, in this work, a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of the WCC technology is conducted and compared with the MCC technology from the perspective of carbon emission reduction. A universal economic assessment criterion of CO2 capture cost based on electricity prices is proposed, and the techno-economic analysis is based on the cost in 2022 USD ($). The result shows that the CO2 capture cost of the WCC system ranges from 53.74 to 71.70 $/tonne CO2 due to the different factors considered in computational models, taking 63.57%∼84.81% of the MCC system under the same capture rate (85%). The dynamic payback period of the WCC system ranges from 7.14 years to 20.52 years, while the MCC system failed to recover capital throughout the entire lifecycle. Moreover, the CO2 capture cost of the WCC system can be reduced to below carbon tax (43 $/tonne CO2) when the CO2 concentration in the feed flue gas is above 18 vol%, achieving positive benefits with no carbon trading required, which means the WCC system can achieve positive profitability for higher CO2 concentration emission sectors. The results provide significant guidance for developing and promoting the WCC technology.

Monoethanolamine (MEA)-based carbon dioxide absorption is one of the effective carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies but is significantly restricted by the high energy consumption in the regeneration of rich amine solution. Solid acid catalysts have the potential to reduce energy consumption, while the exploration of highly active catalysts with abundant Bro̷nsted and Lewis acid sites remains needing. We developed an efficient solid acid catalyst, niobium-modified HZSM-5 (Nb/HZ), to facilitate CO2 desorption from the CO2-captured MEA solutions. The Nb/HZ catalysts with various niobium loadings were synthesized by using an impregnation method. HZSM-5 retained its pore structure and large surface area after niobium incorporation. The catalyst with 4% Nb (4.0-Nb/HZ) has the highest activity and stability, with 61% increase in the desorption rate, 50% increase in the desorbed CO2 amount, and 37% reduction of relative heat duty. According to theoretic calculations and experimental analyses, the Nb/HZ catalyst provides abundant Bro̷nsted and Lewis acid sites to facilitate carbamate adsorption, proton transfer, and carbamate breakdown, thus reducing the activation energy for CO2 desorption. This work provides a valuable solid acid catalyst for amine-based CO2 capture and also brings insights for the development of a novel solid acid for diverse catalysis.

Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is one of the most important technologies for converting carbon dioxide and methane into syngas. ZrO2-supported Ni catalysts have shown promising potential for DRM. However, their catalytic stability remains a challenge due to sintering and coking. In this work, a feasible strategy for the preparation of a highly stable ZrO2-supported Ni catalyst, Ni/ZrO2-Mt, was reported. The key points for the preparation of Ni/ZrO2-Mt were the replacement of Zr4+ in the metastable tetragonal ZrO2 with lattice Ni2+, followed by the reduction of lattice Ni2+ into metallic Ni and the phase transformation of ZrO2 support from the metastable tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase. Compared with the catalyst Ni/ZrO2-Mn (no phase transition and lattice Ni2+ reduction), Ni/ZrO2-Mt could run stably for 800 h without deactivation, with both CO2 and CH4 conversions maintaining 96%. Corresponding to its high stability, the Ni/ZrO2-Mt displayed excellent resistance to sintering and coking, which was attributed to the enhanced metal-support interaction arising from the reduction of lattice Ni2+ and the transformation of the support phase. The proposed catalyst synthetic strategy provided an optional method for preparing highly stable catalysts.

Ethanol as a renewable fuel has been applied in fuel vehicles (FVs), and it is promising in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). This work aims to investigate the emission characteristics of ethanol applied in both FVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The paper conducted a real-road test of an internal combustion FV and PHEV, respectively, based on the world light vehicle test cycle (WLTC) by using gasoline and regular gasoline under different temperature conditions. The use of E10 and E20 in FVs has been effective in reducing the conventional emissions of the vehicles. At 23 °C, E10 and E20 reduced the conventional emissions including carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbon compound (THC), non-methane hydrocarbon compound (NMHC), particulate matter (PM), and particulate number (PN) by 15.40–31.11% and 11.00–44.13% respectively. At 6 °C, E10 and E20 reduced conventional emissions including THC, CO, and PM by 2.15–8.61% and 11.02–13.34%, respectively. However, nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions increased to varying degrees. The reduction trend of non-conventional emissions including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) from FVs fueled with E10 and E20 is not significant for vehicles. Overall, the emission reduction effect of E20 is better than that of E10, and the emission reduction effect of ethanol gasoline on vehicle emissions is reduced at low temperatures. Lower ambient temperatures increase vehicle emissions in the low-speed segment but decrease vehicle emissions in the ultra-high-speed segment. HEV emissions of THC, CO, PN, and PM are reduced by 25.28%, 12.72%, 77.34%, and 64.59%, respectively, for E20 compared to gasoline, and the use of E20 in HEVs contributes to the reduction of overall vehicle emissions.

Currently, carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) can convert CO2 into many high-value hydrocarbon chemicals via electrochemical processes, contributing to achieving energy conservation and emission reduction. Importantly, this method also guides the electrocatalytic synthesis of organonitrogen chemicals via C–C and C–N coupling, such as acetamide synthesis during the coelectroreduction of CO2 and N2. Herein, we utilized density functional theory calculations to predict the C–N coupling performance of *CCO and NH3 for acetamide synthesis on lateral heterostructure (LHS) interfaces of two types of layered materials: Type-A includes NbS2/MoS2, NbS2/TaS2, NbS2/WS2, MoS2/TaS2, and TaS2/WS2; Type-B contains LHS NbS2/AlN, NbS2/GaN, NbS2/ZnO, MoS2/AlN, MoS2/GaN, MoS2/ZnO, TaS2/AlN, TaS2/GaN, TaS2/ZnO, and WS2/AlN, WS2/GaN, WS2/ZnO. However, achieving simultaneous C–C coupling and C–N coupling remains a great challenge in designing catalysts. To address this, we systemically investigated these LHS catalysts, evaluating factors such as adsorption stability, electroconductivity, catalytic activity, selectivity, and electronic properties. Our findings suggest that MoS2/WS2 and NbS2/ZnO may be potential catalysts, facilitating acetamide synthesis from CO2 and N2 reduction with low limiting potentials of −1.11 and −0.97 V, respectively. The reaction pathway of CO2RR involves the formation of CO, C–C coupling via keto−enol tautomerism to form ketene (*CCO), N2 reduction, and C–N coupling between NH3 and *CCO to produce *CC(OH)NH2, finally resulting in acetamide production. Most of these LHS junction catalysts exhibit metallic and semiconductor electronic states, except for MoS2/GaN, which possesses a large band gap of up to 3.73 eV. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that NbS2/AlN, NbS2/GaN, TaS2/ZnO, WS2/AlN, and WS2/ZnO effectively suppress competing byproducts, ensuring the formation of *CCO and promoting nucleophilic reactions leading to *CC(OH)NH2 during *CC(OH)NH2. This strategic approach enables the synthesis of organonitrogen chemicals via C–N coupling in the coreduction of CO2 and NOx, expanding the scope of hydrocarbon products derived from CO2RR. The LHS catalysts identified in this study may be employed to form amide chemicals.

The infrastructure of a country depends significantly on cement concrete as the primary construction material. The aggregate comprises a significant proportion of the overall volume of concrete. However, the ongoing extraction of granite rock to obtain coarse aggregate contributes to the escalating need for natural resources among future generations. Due to its high carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint, the cement industry is a significant contributor to global warming. An appropriate reduction in the amount of cement in concrete without affecting its key properties can result in economical and sustainable development of the construction industry. In this investigation, agricultural waste coconut shell is considered as a substitute for conventional aggregate in concrete to produce lightweight coconut shell concrete. The alccofine-1203 contains ultrafine particles with a distinctive composition that enhances the pozzolanic and hydration process in concrete. Alccofine ranging from 5 % to 15 % were added to cement. The results demonstrated that the 10 % alccofine enhanced the fresh and mechanical properties of the lightweight coconut shell concrete. Using a combination of coconut shell and alccofine in concrete would be the most environmentally sustainable option in the construction industry.

As a developing country, South Africa faces the risk of having to undertake disruptive actions to meet its internationally pledged emission reduction targets. It has become necessary to find alternative measures for South Africa to meet its climate targets without such a disruptive and aggressive transformation of its energy sector. To truly reach net-zero CO2 emissions, South Africa must ensure that residual emissions from its recalcitrant sectors are equally compensated by carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Given the potential for CDR technologies to delay the need for rapid emissions cuts, we leverage this characteristic to explore their role in helping South Africa achieve its climate targets on time, but through a less disruptive and overly aggressive pace of energy system decarbonization. Using an integrated assessment model, we show that while reaching its emission reduction targets, the presence of novel CDR (nCDR) could significantly reduce South Africa's mitigation costs, from $190-590/tCO2 without nCDR to $155-240/tCO2 with nCDR by 2050. Furthermore, the availability of nCDR may allow for a less aggressive expansion of renewable and nuclear power generation, saving about 35-55TWh/yr by 2050 compared to scenarios without nCDR. Importantly, we reveal that nCDR could help avoid the asset stranding of up to 4-6 GW and $15-25 billion in associated costs between 2016 and 2050. However, this comes at the cost of higher residual greenhouse gas emissions, as the continued reliance on fossil fuels under nCDR availability would likely lead to the perpetuation of some emissions. Overall, South Africa's priority must remain on decarbonization, especially in sectors where fuel switching and energy efficiency are feasible. Nonetheless, the complementary role of nCDR must not be underestimated, and South Africa should begin investing in these emerging technologies to support its ambitious net-zero goal.

Abstract Emissions reduction and greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere are both necessary to achieve net-zero emissions and limit climate change 1 . There is thus a need for improved sorbents for the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process known as direct air capture. In particular, low-cost materials that can be regenerated at low temperatures would overcome the limitations of current technologies. In this work, we introduce a new class of designer sorbent materials known as ‘charged-sorbents’. These materials are prepared through a battery-like charging process that accumulates ions in the pores of low-cost activated carbons, with the inserted ions then serving as sites for carbon dioxide adsorption. We use our charging process to accumulate reactive hydroxide ions in the pores of a carbon electrode, and find that the resulting sorbent material can rapidly capture carbon dioxide from ambient air by means of (bi)carbonate formation. Unlike traditional bulk carbonates, charged-sorbent regeneration can be achieved at low temperatures (90–100 °C) and the sorbent’s conductive nature permits direct Joule heating regeneration 2,3 using renewable electricity. Given their highly tailorable pore environments and low cost, we anticipate that charged-sorbents will find numerous potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis and beyond.

Reducing carbon dioxide emissions has become a prominent issue in city construction. Here, with the objective of spatial pattern optimization, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for low-carbon cities. To shed further light on the mechanism by which green finance facilitates the low-carbon transformation of the economy, we chose Xi'an as a study area, used the system dynamics model, simulated the relationship between different factors in the development of low-carbon cities, and provided guidance for spatial planning of low-carbon cities. Through systematic analysis of results, we found that with the progress of urbanization and the improvement of people's living standards, the carbon emissions from urban buildings in Xi'an will increase annually and reach 2.47 million tons by 2030. In scenario 1, the faster pace of urbanization raises carbon emissions from urban buildings by 3%, to 2.5543 million tons from the base. In contrast, in Scenario 2, the reduction in urbanization rate results in a decrease in urban building carbon emissions to 2.4243 million tons, a reduction of 2.26% compared to the baseline scenario. Thus it can be seen that diverse modifications of parameters exert distinct effects on the ultimate carbon emissions from urban buildings.

Geological storage of carbon dioxide is a cornerstone in almost every realistic emissions reduction scenario outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our ability to accurately forecast storage efficacy is, however, mostly unknown due to the long timescales involved (hundreds to thousands of years). To study perceived forecast accuracy, we designed a double-blind forecasting study. As ground truth, we constructed a laboratory-scale carbon storage operation, retaining the essential physical processes active on the field scale, within a time span of five days. Separately, academic groups with experience in carbon storage research were invited to forecast key carbon storage efficacy metrics. The participating groups submitted forecasts in two stages: First independently without any cross-group interaction, then finally after workshops designed to share and assimilate understanding between the forecast groups. Their confidence in reported forecasts was monitored throughout the forecasting study. Our results show that participating groups provided forecasts that appear bias-free with respect to carbon storage as a technology, yet the forecast intervals are too narrow to capture the ground truth (overconfidence bias). When asked to qualitatively self-assess their forecast uncertainty (and later when asked to provide an external assessment of other forecast groups), the assessment of the participants indicated an understanding that the forecast intervals (both their own and those of others) were too narrow. However, the participants did not display an understanding of how poorly the forecast intervals calibrated to the ground truth. The quantitative uncertainty assessments contrast the qualitative comments supplied by the participants, which indicate an acute awareness of the challenges associated with assessing the uncertainty of forecasts for complex systems such as the geological storage of carbon dioxide.

Determining electrocatalytic activity for reactions that involve reactants with limited solubility presents a significant challenge due to the reduced mass-transport to the electrocatalyst surface. This limitation is seen in important reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. We introduce a new approach, which we call scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy, to enable the detection and high-resolution mapping of electrocatalytic activity with low-solubility reactants at high mass-transport rates. Using a scanning probe approach, a dual-barreled nanopipette is used to precisely deliver the gas-phase reactant within micrometers of an electrocatalyst surface, which results in high mass-transport rates at the electrocatalyst surface directly under the probe. We demonstrate the scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy approach by mapping the oxygen reduction reaction on model platinum microelectrode surfaces. We anticipate that scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy will provide an effective tool for measuring the electrocatalytic activity of reactants that have limited solubility.

Due to the unclear distribution of near-surface atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in small areas, by choosing Yulin City and Xi'an City as the research areas and applying Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to carry out atmospheric CO2 concentration monitoring at multiple carbon monitoring points, this study explores the impact of ground object type, height and time on atmospheric CO2 concentration. Regarding the temporal variation, the atmospheric CO2 concentration of the vegetation-covered area in the afternoon is lower than that in the morning in summer, and only the evergreen vegetation-covered area in winter has similar characteristics as that in summer. The near-surface atmospheric CO2 concentration in the vegetated area changes greatly in summer and winter. For the characteristics of vertical distribution of CO2, the CO2 concentration gradually decreases with increasing altitude. In summer, the CO2 concentration in areas affected by human activities decreases rapidly from 0 to 50 meters and decreases slowly from 50 to 150 meters. The CO2 concentration in vegetation-covered areas decreases slightly from 0 to 150 meters. In winter, the areas affected by human activities and the vegetation-covered areas both decrease rapidly from 0–20 meters and relatively slowly from 20 meters to 100 meters. The experimental results indicate that using UAVs can accurately monitor the atmospheric CO2 concentration near the surface of typical land features in small areas. UAVs can form air-space-ground carbon monitoring networks with satellites and ground observation points, which is of great significance for quantitative analysis of carbon reduction paths to achieve peak carbon dioxide emission and carbon neutralization.

With the increase of carbon dioxide concentration, global warming has become increasingly serious, and has posed a serious threat to human survival and the ecological environment. The land use carbon emissions (LUCE) are only second to those caused by fossil fuel combustion. The affected area of the lower Yellow River (ALYR) is an essential grain producing area in China. Studying its LUCE and future development has practical significance for the low-carbon development and food security of the basin. We analyzed the characteristics and drivers of LUCE in the ALYR from 2000 − 2018 and simulated the LUCE under different scenarios in 2030. The LUCE in the ALYR were in a continuous growth trend, with a growth rate of 27.94%, and the economic efficiency and ecological carrying capacity remained stable. The built-up land area and the proportion of secondary industry in GDP can promote the LUCE, while the per capita GDP has a suppressive effect. The LUCE will decrease in 2030, with the least LUCE under the cultivated land protection scenario. The results show that it is necessary to control the built-up land and increase the area of ecological land in order to achieve carbon emission reduction. This study analyzed the LUCE in the ALYR from the different periods, providing a theoretical reference for promoting sustainable development of the basin and scientific land use management.

The 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, concluded in December 2023. The meeting discussed the overarching goal of the legally binding Paris Agreement to limit “global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels”. The COP 28 recognised recent findings of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that “limiting global warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot requires deep, rapid and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43% by 2030 and 60% by 2035 relative to the 2019 level, and reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050”.

The efficient reduction of CO2 into valuable products is a challenging task in an international context marked by the climate change crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels. Recently, the use of water microdroplets has emerged as an interesting reaction media where many redox processes which do not occur in conventional solutions take place spontaneously. Indeed, several experimental studies in microdroplets have already been devoted to study the reduction of CO2 with promising results. The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air‐water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first‐principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggests that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface‐rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.

Abstract Climate change poses manifold consequences to the world’s ecosystems and human well-being. Greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate-friendly technological innovations at the corporate level are considered effective measures to mitigate climate change. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) to analyze 178 enterprises listed in the Standard and Poor’s 500 companies from 2016 to 2021, this paper examines how companies’ climate risk-mitigating efforts can affect their market value. We found that emitted carbon dioxide negatively affects the stock price. Meanwhile, companies’ income and climate risk-mitigating efforts, including producing eco-friendly products, using renewable energy, and environmental investments, are positively associated with their share value. However, the effects of these efforts are conditional on the companies’ income. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among investors and improving their climate change knowledge can be a promising approach to promoting a corporation’s mitigation efforts.

1522 Background: Greenhouse gas emissions from healthcare are substantial and harm persons with cancer. Emissions from outpatient cancer care visits are not well described, nor are the downstream reduction in human harms that could be obtained through visit “decentralization” (telemedicine and local care when possible). Methods: This life-cycle assessment (LCA)-based study evaluated changes in emissions and downstream health harms associated with (1) telemedicine visits using retrospective observational analysis and (2) fully decentralized visits using counterfactual modeling. The retrospective observational cohort included persons receiving cancer care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and 20 affiliated facilities between 5/2015-12/2020. The main outcome was the adjusted per visit-day difference in emissions (in kilograms carbon dioxide equivalents: kgCO 2 e) between two periods: an in-person care period (5/2015-2/2020; “Pre”) and a telemedicine period (3/2020-12/2020; “Post”). Mixed effects log-linear model assessed emissions changes adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and cancer type, with random effects on person. The counterfactual model assessed emissions changes between actual in-person visits during the Pre period and a counterfactual with maximal decentralization. Visit-day eligibility for decentralization was obtained by categorizing appointments (e.g., clinician visit, infusion) as DFCI required, local care possible, or telemedicine possible. This cohort was matched to a national population diagnosed with cancer over the same period (Cancer in North America [CiNA] dataset) using mixed-effects linear modeling, through which annual changes in disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) from clinician visit decentralization were estimated using Eckelman’s mortality cost of carbon conversion. Results: There were123,890 unique patients in the DFCI cohort seen over 1.6 million visit-days (Pre N=110,180, Post N=61,691) at a median of 6 visit-days per patient (IQR 2, 15). An estimated 72,554,006 kgCO 2 e were within scope of the LCA emitted during the study period. In mixed-effects log-linear regression, the adjusted mean absolute reduction in per visit-day emissions between Pre and Post periods was 36.4 kgCO 2 e (95%CI 36.2,36.6), or a reduction of 81.3% (95%CI 80.8,81.7) compared to the baseline model. In the counterfactual decentralized care model of the Pre period, there was a relative emissions reduction of 33.1% (95%CI 32.9,33.3). When demographically matched to 10.3 million persons in the CiNA dataset, decentralized care would have reduced national emissions by 75.3 million kgCO 2 e annually; this corresponds to an estimated annual reduction of 15.0-47.7 DALYs. Conclusions: Employing decentralization through telemedicine and local care can substantially reduce emissions during cancer care delivery; this corresponds to a small reduction in human mortality.

The adsorption of CO2 by coal leads to changes in its mechanical properties, particularly when considering supercritical CO2 and water with supercritical CO2 adsorption. This is strongly linked to the efficiency of CO2-enhanced coalbed methane (CO2-ECBM) extraction and the safety of CO2 geological storage. This study focuses on 3# coal from the Datong Mine in Gaoping City, Shanxi Province. The high-rank coal's mechanical properties, including the triaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus, were examined under the combined effects of CO2 injection pressure, CO2 injection time, and moisture content. The triaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of the coal showed a decrease following CO2 injection. Increasing the CO2 injection pressure, prolonging the CO2 injection time, and increasing the moisture content were favorable for coal softening. In particular, the triaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of the coal sample after 144 h of water and supercritical CO2 softening decreased by 67.67 and 64.15%, respectively. Injecting CO2 into coal changed its failure mode. The dry raw coal sample exhibited a brittle shear failure mode, while the coal samples showed transitional shear failure after injecting 6 MPa CO2 and 8 MPa CO2 and ductile nondilatant barreling failure after injecting water and 8 MPa CO2 (with a moisture content of 3.02%). Moreover, the cumulative acoustic emission energy of the coal samples followed a similar trend to the decrease in mechanical properties under different conditions. The physical and chemical interactions among coal, CO2, and water caused the softening of coal; these included the generation of the swelling stress, the dissolution of minerals by carbonate solutions, the reduction in surface energy of coal owing to CO2 adsorption, and the extraction and plasticization reactions of organic matter in coal. The research results are of great significance for further understanding CO2-ECBM and CO2 geological sequestration.

Importance Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from health care are substantial and disproportionately harm persons with cancer. Emissions from a central component of oncology care, outpatient clinician visits, are not well described, nor are the reductions in emissions and human harms that could be obtained through decentralizing this aspect of cancer care (ie, telemedicine and local clinician care when possible). Objective To assess potential reductions in GHG emissions and downstream health harms associated with telemedicine and fully decentralized cancer care. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based cohort study and counterfactual analyses using life cycle assessment methods analyzed persons receiving cancer care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between May 2015 and December 2020 as well as persons diagnosed with cancer over the same period from the Cancer in North America (CiNA) public dataset. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to April 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures The adjusted per–visit day difference in GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) equivalents between 2 periods: an in-person care model period (May 2015 to February 2020; preperiod) and a telemedicine period (March to December 2020; postperiod), and the annual decrease in disability-adjusted life-years in a counterfactual model where care during the preperiod was maximally decentralized nationwide. Results Of 123 890 included patients, 73 988 (59.7%) were female, and the median (IQR) age at first diagnosis was 59 (48-68) years. Patients were seen over 1.6 million visit days. In mixed-effects log-linear regression, the mean absolute reduction in per–visit day CO 2 equivalent emissions between the preperiod and postperiod was 36.4 kg (95% CI, 36.2-36.6), a reduction of 81.3% (95% CI, 80.8-81.7) compared with the baseline model. In a counterfactual decentralized care model of the preperiod, there was a relative emissions reduction of 33.1% (95% CI, 32.9-33.3). When demographically matched to 10.3 million persons in the CiNA dataset, decentralized care would have reduced national emissions by 75.3 million kg of CO 2 equivalents annually; this corresponded to an estimated annual reduction of 15.0 to 47.7 disability-adjusted life-years. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that using decentralization through telemedicine and local care may substantially reduce cancer care’s GHG emissions; this corresponds to small reductions in human mortality.

Paris's policy adjustment in February, 2024, aimed at curbing the influx of large high-emission vehicles into its urban core by escalating parking fees for non-residents, embodies a sophisticated blend of urban planning, environmental quality efforts, climate action, and public health policy. This move is a nuanced approach to discourage the use of vehicles that disproportionately contribute to urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The initiative supports sustainable urban mobility, resonating with a wider European endeavour to minimise car dependency within cities.1Nieuwenhuijsen MJ Urban and transport planning pathways to carbon neutral, liveable and healthy cities; a review of the current evidence.Environ Int. 2020; 140105661Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar This policy intervention draws attention to the increasing trend of vehicle upsizing, with sport utility vehicles (SUVs) emerging as a particular concern because of their substantial environmental, climate, and, hence, health footprints. In Paris, transportation accounts for around 30% of greenhouse gas emissions,2Ministry for an Ecological and Solidary TransitionGHG information for transport services: application of article L. 1431-3 of the French transport code.https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Information_GES%20-%202019.pdfDate: 2019Date accessed: February 1, 2024Google Scholar with private vehicles, particularly diesel and petrol-powered SUVs, being major contributors. As vehicles grow in size, their emissions and fuel consumption escalate correspondingly, exacerbating urban pollution and contributing to climate change. Data indicate that the average size of an SUV has expanded, with some models now mirroring the dimensions of small tanks, exacerbating their unsustainability. For instance, the average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new cars registered in 2020 were substantially higher for SUVs, at approximately 134 g/km, which was 13 g higher than the average emissions of other new petrol cars.3European Environment AgencyAverage CO2 emissions from new cars and new vans increased again in 2019.https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/average-co2-emissions-from-new-cars-vans-2019Date: 2020Date accessed: February 1, 2024Google Scholar This shift towards larger vehicles is driven by a complex interplay of commercial interests and consumer preferences, with automotive manufacturers reaping higher profit margins from sales of SUVs.4Davis SC Truett LF An analysis of the impact of sport utility vehicles in the United States.

The move to restrict high-emission vehicles from central urban areas is a crucial step in this direction, signalling a shift towards more sustainable, health-promoting urban environments. Moreover, the policy is indicative of a broader trend in urban governance that seeks to reclaim city spaces for people rather than cars, fostering more liveable, vibrant, and healthy urban landscapes. In addition to environmental and health outcomes, the policy adjustment underscores the importance of liveability as a crucial dimension of urban sustainability. By reducing the dominance of cars in the city centre, Paris is enhancing the accessibility and enjoyment of public spaces, contributing to a more pleasant urban experience for both residents and visitors. This transformation supports the development of communities that are not only ecologically sustainable but also socially inclusive and economically vibrant, aligning with compact city principles.10Nieuwenhuijsen MJ Cities at the heart of the climate action and public health agenda.Lancet Public Health. 2024; 9: e8-e9Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar The Parisian policy could serve as a model for other cities grappling with similar challenges of pollution, congestion, and unsustainable urban growth. It demonstrates the potential of targeted policy interventions to influence consumer behaviour and automotive industry trends, encouraging a shift towards smaller, more efficient, and possibly electric public and active transportation. As such, it contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable urban development, highlighting the interconnectedness of environmental quality, climate crisis, public health, and urban liveability.

CO2 foam (CF) flooding is an effective method for enhancing oil recovery (EOR) in late-stage water drive reservoirs. However, inadequate mixing of CO2 and foaming agent solution during the injection process leads to the formation of uneven and unstable foam, thereby limited the efficient development of water drive reservoirs. Herein, we report a novel CO2 aerosol foam system (CAFS) generated by a custom-built aerosol foam generator. The CAFS development performance was systematically analyzed after water flooding and investigate the affecting factors about gas-liquid ratio, pre-injection volume, and solution concentration using flooding experiments. Evaluation parameters such as recovery, water cut, differential pressure, and resistance coefficient are employed. Additionally, we examine the microscopic EOR mechanism of CAFS through visualized microscopic flooding experiments. The results reveal that CAFS exhibits better development performance compared to conventional CF flooding. This improvement is attributed to enhanced rock wettability by hydrophobic nanoparticles and the high resistance coefficient of aerosol foam, both of which contribute significantly to the superior oil production performance of CAFS. Microscopic experiments demonstrate that CO2 aerosol generates more uniform foam and effectively expands the sweep area through trapping effects, superimposed Jamin effects, and squeezing occupation in pore throats. Moreover, the emulsification capability of nanofluid-SDS solution and viscosity reduction of oil due to dissolved CO2 after foam breakdown in the matrix further facilitate oil recovery, where the remained oil is recovered as foamy oil driven by the subsequently injected fluid.

Traffic congestion caused by left-turning vehicles in a coordinated corridor is a multifaceted problem requiring tailored solutions. This study explores the impact of shared left-turn lanes within one-way couplets, particularly during peak hours, where high left-turn volumes, limited side street storage, and the overlapped green time between pedestrians and left-turners contribute to queue spillbacks, coordination interruption, and network congestion. The focus of this paper is on the solutions that can be easily analyzed by practitioners, here called “analyzable solutions”. This approach stands in contrast to solutions derived from “non-transparent” optimization tools, which do not allow for a clear assessment of the solution’s adequacy or the ability to predict its impact in real-world applications. This paper investigates the effects of employing two analyzable signal timing strategies: Lagging Pedestrian (LagPed) phasing and Left-Turn Progression (LTP) offsets. Using high-fidelity microsimulation, the authors evaluated different scenarios, assessing pedestrian delays, queue lengths, travel time index, area average travel time index, and environmental impacts such as Fuel Consumption (FC) and CO2 emissions. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies was comprehensively evaluated against the base case scenario, demonstrating considerable improvements in various performance measures, including approximately a 5% reduction in FC and CO2 emissions. Implementation of the LTP strategy alone yields substantial reductions in delays, the number of stops, the queue length for left-turning vehicles, travel times for all road users, and ultimately FC and CO2 emissions. This study offers innovative approach to addressing the complex and multifaceted problem of left-turn-centered congestion in urban grid networks using efficient and down-to-earth analyzable solutions.

The microstructure and reactivity of Ni-GDC cermet under cyclic oxidation in CO2 conditions were investigated using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD results revealed that NiO was formed during the re-oxidation process in CO2. SEM and TPR results demonstrated that nanostructured NiO aggregates were formed on the surface of the sample after being re-oxidized at 400 °C for 1200 min, resulting in an α peak with high reduction activity and a conversion of only 16% from Ni to NiO. In contrast, the samples re-oxidized at 600 °C for 600 min and 800 °C for 240 min were completely oxidized, resulting in reconstructed and sintered NiO with larger particle size, and a β peak with lower reactivity and a conversion of 100%. Redox cycling was further conducted on completely oxidized samples, which showed a decrease in β peak temperature from the first to seventh cycle. The migration and redistribution of sintered NiO towards the exterior were confirmed by comparing SEM images after the first and fourth cycles, which favored an increase in the reactive area. Therefore, this study reveals that lower re-oxidation temperatures (≤400 °C) and an appropriate increase in redox cycles are beneficial for forming surficial nanostructures while hindering the formation of large sintered NiO particles.

Bismuth‐based materials have emerged as promising catalysts in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate. However, the reasons for the reconstruction of Bi‐based precursors to form bismuth nanosheets are still puzzling, especially the formation of defective bismuth sites. Herein, we prepare bismuth nanosheets with vacancy‐rich defects (V‐Bi NS) by rapidly reconstructing Bi19Cl3S27 under negative potential. Theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of chlorine induces the generation of intrinsic electric field in the precursor, thereby increasing the electron transfer rate and further promoting the metallization of trivalent bismuth. Meanwhile, in situ Raman and ex situ XRD tests verify that Bi19Cl3S27 has a faster reconstruction rate than Bi2S3. The formed V‐Bi NS exhibits up to 96% HCOO‐ Faraday efficiency and 400 mA cm‐2 HCOO‐ partial current densities, and its ECSA normalized formate current density and yield are 2.2 times higher than those of intact bismuth nanosheets (I‐Bi NS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that bismuth vacancies with electron‐rich aggregation reduce the activation energy of CO2 to *CO2‐ radicals and stabilize the adsorption of the key intermediate *OCHO, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics of formate production.

In order to evaluate the effects of CO and H2 for the gas-solid reaction behavior of the ferrous burden and coke in blast furnace shaft, a near-steady-state simulation test method of the blast furnace shaft was designed. The reduction behavior of the ferrous burden, carbon solution loss reaction under different temperatures and atmospheres, and the effect of hydrogen enrichment on the CO gas utilization ratio were investigated. The results show that above 830°C, the reduction degrees of different ferrous burden structures under H2 atmosphere are higher than that under CO atmosphere. Better reduction degradation behavior could be obtained under the hydrogen-rich atmosphere. The H2O generated under H2 atmosphere could promote the carbon solution loss reaction. The solution loss ratio reaching the maximum at 950°C. Under hydrogen-rich atmosphere, CO gas utilization ratio increased with the increased of H2 concentration due to the effects of the products H2O and CO2.

This paper studies the intra-day impacts of wind power on wholesale electricity prices and carbon emissions in Great Britain. Exploiting hourly variations across years from 2008 to 2019, we differentiate the longer-term impact of wind power, largely due to capacity increases, and the short-term impact driven by weather conditions. The results show that the expansion of wind energy significantly decreases wholesale electricity prices in most hours, although the effect is not uniform. The prices decrease more during peak hours than during off-peak hours, with no significant effect during the ramping-up and ramping-down hours. However, over the sample period, the negative effects of wind expansion and load reduction on wholesale electricity prices are more than offset by the increases in carbon and fuel prices. Wind expansion, load reduction, and increases in carbon prices all contributed to the significant reduction in CO2 emissions.

Although manifold empirical studies have identified the mechanical properties of crumb rubber concrete (CRC), a comparative analysis of economic and environmental benefits between CRC and ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPCC) is not explored. In this paper, a quantitative meta-analysis between CRC and OPCC is conducted to explore optimized design strength, and a comparative analysis of the economic and environmental benefits of the two materials is undertaken. Considering cost price as the economic index and CO2 emissions per cubic meter of concrete as the environmental index in the materialization stage, CRC and OPCC were compared with different mix designs to achieve grades of similar strengths. Upon replacing less than 20% of natural fine aggregates in concrete with crumb rubber, while retaining the cement content, an increase of 6% in the cost price was achieved for CRC with 30–40 MPa strength grade. Apart from the aspect of mining and transportation of natural aggregates, the reduction of CO2 emissions by means of CRC adoption was verified in the treatment process of waste tire incineration. The results show that CO2 emissions from CRC decreased by 15–17% when compared with OPCC for 30~40 MPa grade concrete. The research conclusion can serve as a theoretical basis for the engineering application of CRC with the same strength, and make certain contributions to the industrial application of crumb rubber aggregates and the sustainable treatment of waste tires.

In this study, we synthesize a series of active Ni3Co–Al2O3 catalysts, calcined at 850 °C for 5 h, to examine the effects of (i) substituting Ni with Co on the catalytic performance of the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst and (ii) the total metal amount on the catalytic activity of Ni3Co–Al for the flue gas reforming of methane (FGRM) reaction at 600 °C. We maintain high calcination temperatures to ensure strong alloy–support interactions. We also synthesize a Co–Al2O3 catalyst and use the data of a previously synthesized Ni–Al2O3 catalyst to analyze the effect of cobalt promotion. In the Ni3Co–Al catalysts, we maintain the Ni/Co ratio to be 3 and increase the Ni+Co amount from 5 to 25 wt % to examine the effect of total metal loading. The H2-reduction profiles reveal that the temperature where the consumption of H2 was maximum, Tmax temperature, is a function of the total metal loading. Comparison of the catalytic activities appears to suggest that in situ reduction of the catalyst at Tmax was better than the reduction at higher temperatures, since a larger number of surface active sites are available. The CH4 and CO2 conversions and H2 and CO yields increase when nickel is substituted with cobalt due to Ni–Co nanoalloy formation. However, the dispersion of the nanoalloy varies with the metal loading, and the optimum dispersion is when Ni+Co = 10 wt %. This 10Ni3Co–Al catalyst exhibits optimum CH4 (89%) and CO2 (30%) conversions and H2 (79%) and CO (46%) yields for the FGRM reaction at 600 °C for a GHSV of 120,000 mL g–1 h–1. The conversions, yields, and particle size of the alloy of this 10Ni3Co–Al catalyst do not change significantly, and an insignificant amount of carbon is formed during 24 h of operation. Thus, after using a promoter, it is necessary to optimize the loading of the active phase to obtain the best catalyst for FGRM.

About 20% of the world’s CO2 emissions originate from transport. Many countries are committed to decarbonizing their transport sector. Singapore pledged to electrify a whole host of its land transportation fleet, which includes private cars, public buses, ride-hail vehicles, and motorcycles. This paper proposes a simple empirical framework to estimate the future energy demand after 100% electrification has been realized for nine selected road transport vehicle sub-classes and to calculate the carbon emission reduction potential based on various scenarios. The present energy demand for each vehicle sub-class is first calculated based on parameters like petrol and diesel consumption, heat value and density of petrol and diesel, population of vehicle type, and average mileage per vehicle sub-class. Several scenarios are presented, and an analysis is carried out to derive a range of emission factors which are used to estimate the carbon emission reduction potential. Relative to the present day, the future energy demand estimates reveal an overall reduction of 73.60%. Full electrification and a “clean” power generation mix could lead to an emission reduction as high as 93.64% across all vehicles sub-classes, with private cars having the highest reduction potential.

A 3D flower-like structure composed of porous bismuth oxychloride (p-BiOCl) nanosheets was synthesized through a hydrothermal process utilizing Bi(NO3)2, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and LiCl. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies confirmed the successful formation of the p-BiOCl. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were exploited to identify the nanosheet structure. The catalyst appeared as reduced Bi0 nanosheets at an applied cathodic potential of - 0.92 V (vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode)). The maintenance of Bi nanosheet structures, controlled by the cationic surfactant of CTAB, resulted in enhanced electrochemical activity with a favorable Tafel slope and lower charge resistance. Defects of under-coordinated Bi sites and oxygen vacancy with interconnected 3D structures possess abundant active sites that further assist the activity. In 1.0 and 2.0 M KHCO3 electrolytes, the catalyst achieved a maximum current density of - 80 and 100 mA/cm2, respectively, at - 0.92 V (vs. RHE) with Faradaic efficiency > 99% for converting CO2 to formate in H-cell electrolyzers. The substantial H/D kinetic isotope effect revealed from H2O versus D2O electrolytes, and the feature of bicarbonate concentration-dependent performance provided the mechanistic insights that bicarbonate intermediates are in equilibrium with CO2, activated by water, in the aqueous environment, together with the effects of electrode surface modulated by CTAB, are essential for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction to formate.

Economic sanctions have the potential to affect environmental factors through various channels, including income reduction and constraints on accessing finance and environmentally friendly technologies. This study aims to simulate the energy and environmental consequences resulting from international sanctions in Iran. To achieve this, we develop a System Dynamics model integrating a spectrum of variables spanning economic, social, and environmental dimensions, for the period from 2008 to 2028. Our simulation outcomes indicate that by 2028, sanctions are anticipated to precipitate a notable upsurge in CO2 emissions, ranging from 12.5% to 30% compared to the baseline scenario. The magnitude of this escalation hinges on a variety of factors, including energy intensity and scenarios related to economic growth. According to our findings, prolonging international sanctions could be a major barrier to improving energy intensity and lowering CO2 emissions. Given the potential environmental consequences of sanctions, international communities, particularly sanctioning countries, should consider the environmental impacts of sanctions in their policy-making decisions in order to reduce emissions damage.

This paper examines the transformative shift towards Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) systems in highway management, focusing on their patterns and realized gains. By analyzing the global landscape of ETC deployment and delving deeply into the case of Vietnam, it provides practical policy insights for developing countries in this strategically urgent transition.A distinctive feature of this paper is its detailed examination of Vietnam's transition from manual toll collection (MTC) to ETC, highlighting substantial gains in emissions reduction, efficiency improvement, and savings in time and costs. In 2023, the first year of Vietnam's full ETC implementation, the estimated gains included a reduction in the consumption of 60,816 tons of gasoline and diesel, 192 tons of CO2-equivalent emissions, and 37.3 million hours in manpower time, with the total monetary equivalent value in cost savings amounting to $442 million. For the next seven years, 2024-2030, as Vietnam continues to rapidly expand highway networks, these respective figures are projected to amount to 597,862 tons of gasoline and diesel, 1,886,106 tons of CO2-equivalent emissions, 917.1 million hours, and $4.352 billion.Through policy discussion, the paper emphasizes the importance of ETC in boosting productivity and sustainable development, reducing pollution, and fostering advancement towards a smart economy and society. It underscores the critical role of government leadership and private sector engagement in successful ETC deployment.Additionally, the estimation results highlight the critical urgency and enormous benefits of making major investments and leveraging digital transformation in toll facilities such as metros, tunnels, and skyways to reduce heavy traffic congestion in megacities and inter-city roads, where millions of people and vehicles could save hours of waiting time in travel.

The global shift towards sustainable transportation, primarily through vehicle electrification, is critical in addressing climate change. Qatar presents a knowledge gap with specific challenges and opportunities in this transition. This study calculates the potential reduction in CO2-eq, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions resulting from substituting Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in Qatar, considering ICEV ban scenarios in 2030, 2035, and 2040, alongside five policy pathways. A Vehicle Stock Model (VSM) simulates Qatar’s fleet evolution from 2022 to 2050, focusing on the vehicle’s operational phase. An ICEV ban in 2030 would result in a 34% cumulative emission reduction in road transport between 2022 and 2050 compared with the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario. For NOx and PM2.5, cumulative emissions for the 2030 ICEV ban pathways are approximately 20% and 9% lower, respectively, compared with BAU. This study underscores the necessity of localising environmental strategies to meet Qatar’s specific needs and climate commitments, where results indicate significant emission reductions are possible through BEVs.

Steam networks offer a practical solution to increase flexibility in energy-intensive industries, thanks to their potential for electrification and integration of various energy sources. However, effectively using this flexibility requires models that accurately represent system constraints and dynamics for control. While first-principle models provide accuracy, their complexity can hinder practical control applications. This paper proposes a data-driven model using generic buffers to model the intrinsic flexibility and dynamics of a steam network in order to efficiently leverage the available flexibility through model predictive control. Our simulations show significant weekly reductions in CO2 emissions (between 3120 and 7990 tCO2) with an emissions-oriented controller, and in costs (between 0.448 and 1.419 million EUR) with a cost-oriented controller, compared to a pressure-regulating PI controller.

Light olefins, crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, are projected to reach a market size of USD 475.8 million by 2027. Traditional methods for producing light olefins, such as cracking and the Fischer–Tropsch process, are energy-intensive and heavily reliant on fossil fuels. These production methods contribute significantly to environmental issues, emitting approximately 400 million tons of CO2 annually. Integrating solar energy into the olefin synthesis process presents a promising avenue for enhancing sustainability and efficiency. Recent research reveals the potential of utilizing solar energy to activate light-alkanes and COx, enabling solar olefin production via dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and reduction reactions. This review overviews recent advancements and evaluates the prospects of solar energy utilization in olefin synthesis, emphasizing innovative approaches and their potential implications.

The paper discusses the role of labour in the transition to a net zero economy and provides an analysis for Italy over the period 2011-2021. First, we observe that the emissions generated from production activities declined over this period. We estimate that the contribution of employment reallocation across sectors was modest, while that of sectoral efficiency – particularly the shift in the energy mix towards cleaner sources – was decisive. Second, we show that the share of employment in the environmental goods and services sector was small in 2020 and has remained broadly stable since 2014. Our results suggest that, so far, labour has not played a prominent role in the green transition. However, this trend could change in the near future, as CO2 emission reduction targets take on an increasingly key role in production activities.

Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) has become a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the waste sector in China. A comprehensive life cycle assessment model was developed for evaluating the regional and seasonal variations of GHG emissions from four MSWI plants with operational data. Subsequently, the scope was expanded nationwide to encompass carbon emission reduction pathways for MSWI plants in China. The results indicated that all plants were sources of GHG emissions, emitting between 187 and 444 kg CO2-eq/t waste, with plastic incineration exerting the most pronounced impact. The direct GHG emissions from MSWI plants exhibit distinct seasonal variations in Jiangsu and Shanghai, with emissions notably higher during the winter season. Considering the physicochemical properties of waste and the energy mix across various provinces in China, a roadmap for GHG emission reduction from MSWI was proposed. Enhanced management of low-value recyclable plastic should be reinforced in regions with higher incineration rates and direct carbon emissions, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. When building or updating MSWI plants, priority should be given to upgrading steam power generation parameters in regions with higher carbon emission factors for electricity generation, such as the northwest, northeast, and southeast. Additionally, a rational design for the peripheral heat supply network of MSWI plants could augment the energy utilization efficiency. The findings are useful for the reduction of carbon emissions from MSWI in China.

National parks act as significant carbon reserves and sinks, yet their ability to offset carbon emissions is under threat, underscoring the need for stringent greenhouse gas emission control and reduction measures. Previous research has lacked detailed spatial inventories of greenhouse gas emissions from all national park sources at a national level, impeding the development of precise carbon management strategies. In this study, we conducted a uniform analysis of greenhouse gas emissions across all five national parks in China for the year 2020 at a national scale. It quantitatively assesses the spatial distribution and characteristics of emission sources, revealing that in 2020, China's national parks released a total of 6.79 million tonnes of greenhouse gas, predominantly CO2. The majority of emissions stemmed from residential and animal husbandry activities, with emission levels demonstrating spatial coherence—areas with high emissions were clustered together, and similarly for low-emission areas. Although the emissions per unit area in most national parks were significantly lower than the national average, emission hotspots in the Three-River-Source National Park were 1.78 times above the national average. The study emphasizes the importance of employing emission maps for devising effective greenhouse gas control and reduction strategies, aiming to enhance the carbon-neutral potential of national parks.

Abstract: This review article describes the development of the use of aluminum compounds in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) over the last 14 years. It also discusses the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic applications of intermolecular, intramolecular and so‐called hidden FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases. The intrinsically higher acidity of aluminum compounds compared to their boron analogs opens up different reaction pathways. The results are presented in a more or less chronological order. It is shown that Al FLPs react with a variety of polar and non‐polar substrates and form both stable adducts and reversibly activate bonds. Consequently, some catalytic applications of the title compounds were presented such as dimerization of alkynes, hydrogenation of tert‑butyl ethylene and imines, C–F bond activation, reduction of CO2, dehydrogenation of amine borane and transfer of ammonia. In addition, various Al FLPs were used as initiators in polymerization reactions.

The increasing occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in recent years has spurred research to produce new antimicrobial compounds. However, there is currently a lack of a rapid, simple, and quantitative assay to determine the antimicrobial characteristics of new antimicrobial compounds. In this study, we demonstrated that a simple water displacement apparatus can be used to determine the effects of various metal ions on the cell viability of a model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) by monitoring the volume of CO2 (VCO2) released. Analysis on the effect of different metal ions on S. cerevisiae demonstrated a linear relationship between VCO2 and the reduction potentials and a linear–logarithmic relationship between VCO2 and the metal/ligand binding constant indicating this measurement's accuracy and quantitative nature. Due to its speed, simplicity, and accuracy, this water displacement method has the potential to be used as a pre-screening method to facilitate the rapid quantification and development of more effective antimicrobial agents for various applications including antimicrobial food preservation and packaging.

Pesticide drift is due to the transport of the active ingredient to areas not targeted by spraying, causing negative effects on the sensitive crops’ development. The aim of this study was to evaluate lettuce response to simulated 2,4-D drift. Experiments were conducted in the greenhouse, in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The treatments consisted of nine different doses of the 2,4-D herbicide, which are: 0; 1.56; 3.125; 6.20; 12.5; 25; 50; 75; and 100% from the recommended dose (670 g a.a. ha-1). The application occurred when the lettuce plants had four to six true leaves. The analyzed variables were visual injury (phytotoxicity), development parameter (phyllochron), growth (rosette diameter and dry mass of the aerial part), and photosynthetic parameters (gas exchange). The lettuce crop showed high sensitivity to the 2,4-D herbicide, with the lowest dose resulting in significant phytotoxic damage to plants, and from 12.5% of the recommended 2,4-D dose, visual injuries were greater than 90%. The plants´ development and growth were negatively affected by the increased drift doses, culminating in enhanced phyllochron and reduction in rosette diameter and dry mass of the aerial part. The gas exchange of the crop was affected from 6.20% of the recommended dose, causing a reduction in the CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and rubisco carboxylation efficiency.

This chapter examines the dynamics of energy poverty and efficiency in low-income households, particularly in the contexts of Germany and Sweden. It explores the intricacies of the landlord-tenant dilemma and the impact of energy efficiency modernisation on vulnerable social groups. The research addresses the absence of a uniform legal definition of low-income households in Germany, emphasizing the socio-cultural subsistence level and the relativity of poverty. The study highlights the critical role of energy efficiency in reducing energy poverty and contributing to CO2 reduction and climate change policies. The complex phenomenon of energy poverty is examined through various lenses, including the socio-economic, legal, and housing market perspectives. Significantly, the study provides insights into the energy poverty situation in Germany and Sweden. It reviews the performance of these countries in population-based and expenditure-based indicators of energy poverty, comparing them with the EU average. The research underscores the need for effective policies to address the challenges of energy poverty, particularly in rented housing, to achieve climate goals and EU obligations.

CuZn catalysts with various structures were synthesized for electrocatalyzing NO3- and CO2. Among them, CuZn supported on nitrogen-doped carbon exhibited the capability for directly producing urea, while after treated at higher temperature it presents the highest yield of ammonia. XAFS analysis revealed in the optimized sample, Zn existed as the single atom and Cu contained Cu-O(N) and Cu-Cu coordination structures. The Cu-O(N) species promoted the C-N coupling, while the Cu-Cu component played a crucial role in the reduction of nitrate to ammonia. Cuδ+ (1<δ<2) in the catalyst contributed to the C-N coupling. In addition, in-situ XAFS data indicated that under the optimal potential of -0.89 V, the valence state of Cuδ+ decreased slightly but remained within the range of 1<δ<2. After 8-hour stability test, the catalyst maintained a stable coordination structure. This study reveals that the Cu coordination environment is a crucial parameter for selectively producing ammonia or urea.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and they are also one of the largest energy consumption industries in urban systems. With the progression of upgrading and standard-rising, WWTPs both directly and indirectly increase carbon emissions from the increased investments in facilities and usages in electricity as well as chemical agents. Here, we collected operational data from 15 WWTPs in the key control areas of the Ziya River Basin in North China and accounted for the changes in carbon performance at different technical upgrade methods. Results showed that the average carbon emission performance increased by 0.487 kg CO2/m3 after the upgrade. Carbon emissions from electricity consumption, chemical usage, biochemical process and sludge treatment accounted for 42%, 17%, 24%, and 17% of the total improvement in carbon emission performance, respectively. Reducing energy consumption, regulating chemical use and sludge comprehensive utilization are the key to carbon emission reduction. It further proposes that the development of wastewater treatment discharge standards should fully consider the comprehensive utilization of water quality classification. Regions with favorable natural conditions should make full use of their advantages by adopting economically feasible, low-energy-consuming technologies such as constructed wetlands, which offer carbon sequestration and landscaping benefits. This study provides guidance on the selection of technological pathways for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation in the wastewater treatment industry and on achieving sustainable water resource utilization.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or utilization (BECCU) allows net zero or negative carbon emissions and can be a breakthrough technology for climate change mitigation. This work consists of an energetic, exergetic, and economic analysis of an integrated process based on chemical looping combustion of solar-torrefied agro-industrial residues, followed by methanation of the concentrated CO2 stream with green H2. Four agro-industrial residues and four Italian site locations are considered. Depending on the considered biomass, the integrated plant processes about 18–93 kg h−1 of raw biomass and produces 55–70 t y−1 of synthetic methane. Global exergetic efficiencies ranged within 45–60% and 67–77% when neglecting and considering, respectively, the valorization of torgas. Sugar beet pulp and grape marc required a non-negligible input exergy flow for the torrefaction, due to the high moisture content of the raw biomasses. However, for these biomasses, the water released during drying/torrefaction and CO2 methanation could be recycled to the electrolyzer to eliminate external water consumption, thus allowing for a more sustainable use of water resources. For olive stones and hemp hurd, this water recycling brings, instead, a reduction of approximately 65% in water needs. A round-trip electric efficiency of 28% was estimated assuming an electric conversion efficiency of 40%. According to the economic analysis, the total plant costs ranged within 3–5 M€ depending on the biomass and site location considered. The levelized cost of methane (LCOM) ranged within 4.3–8.9 € kgCH4−1 but, if implementing strategies to avoid the use of a large temporary H2 storage vessel, can be decreased to 2.6–5.3 € kgCH4−1. Lower values are obtained when considering hemp hurd and grape marc as raw biomasses, and when locating the PV field in the south of Italy. Even in the best scenario, values of LCOM are out of the market if compared to current natural gas prices, but they might become competitive with the introduction of a carbon tax or through government incentives for the purchase of the PV field and/or electrolyzer.

Aquatic ecosystems are being increasingly polluted by microplastics (MPs), which calls for an understanding of how MPs affect microbially driven biogenic element cycling in water environments. A 28-day incubation experiment was conducted using freshwater lake water added with three polymer types of MPs (i.e., polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene) separately or in combination at a concentration of 1 items/L. The effects of various MPs on microbial communities and functional genes related to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycling were analyzed using metagenomics. Results showed that Sphingomonas and Novosphingobium, which were indicator taxa (genus level) in the polyethylene treatment group, made the largest functional contribution to biogenic element cycling. Following the addition of MPs, the relative abundances of genes related to methane oxidation (e.g., hdrD, frhB, accAB) and denitrification (napABC, nirK, norB) increased. These changes were accompanied by increased relative abundances of genes involved in organic phosphorus mineralization (e.g., phoAD) and sulfate reduction (cysHIJ), as well as decreased relative abundances of genes involved in phosphate transport (phnCDE) and the SOX system. Findings of this study underscore that MPs, especially polyethylene, increase the potential of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O) and water pollution (PO43–, H2S) in freshwater lakes at the functional gene level.

Metalloporphyrins are widely used as homogeneous electrocatalysts for transformations relevant to clean energy and sustainable organic synthesis. Metalloporphyrins are well-known to aggregate due to π–π stacking, but surprisingly, the influence of aggregation on homogeneous electrocatalytic performance has not been investigated previously. Herein, we present three structurally related iron meso-phenylporphyrins whose aggregation properties are different in commonly used N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte. Both spectroscopy and light scattering provide evidence of extensive porphyrin aggregation under conventional electrocatalytic conditions. Using the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO as a test reaction, cyclic voltammetry reveals an inverse dependence of the kinetics on the catalyst concentration. The inhibition extends to bulk performance, where up to 75% of the catalyst at 1 mM is inactive compared to at 0.25 mM. We additionally report how aggregation is perturbed by organic additives, axial ligands, and redox state. Periodic boundary calculations provide additional insights into aggregate stability as a function of metalloporphyrin structure. Finally, we generalize the aggregation phenomenon by surveying metalloporphyrins with different metals and substituents. This study demonstrates that homogeneous metalloporphyrins can aggregate severely in well-solubilizing organic electrolytes, that aggregation can be easily modulated through experimental conditions, and that the extent of aggregation must be considered for accurate catalytic benchmarking.

Environmental pollution and the rapid decline in the availability of fossil fuels are the major concerns of the electric power industry in recent years. Effective utilization of electrical energy is the need of the hour in building the nation towards sustainable development. This study presents the energy consumption analysis and management performed in a diary firm located in Tamil Nadu, India. Initially, the energy usage of the firm is estimated based on its electricity bills, meter readings, and survey followed by detailed energy consumption analysis and evaluation. The study employs guidelines provided by the Indian Bureau of Energy Efficiency for energy management. The detailed analysis performed finds scopes for improvement in efficient energy usage. Numerical analysis shows that implementation of proposed action plans that include installation of automatic power factor correction, replacement of overheating equipment, and replacement of lighting systems with energy-efficient lighting would save annual energy of 123.96 kWh which in turn results in the reduction of annual CO2 emission by 117.76 tonnes. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a novel optimal process scheduling which optimally schedules different processes in the firm without affecting productivity. This makes an additional savings of INR 4,23,360 per annum in the energy cost by minimizing the maximum demand of the firm with zero investment. A comparison of the proposed approach with existing methodologies available in the literature shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

The low share of plastic recycling means significant losses for the economy as well as for the environment, especially for plastic packaging materials since they are the largest end-use market for plastics and characterized by a typical short first-use cycle. The main polymers used in packaging applications are basic polymers, such as PE, PP, PS and PET, which consist mainly of fossil carbon locked up in polymer form. This study attempts to map carbon flows across the packaging plastics value chain with the goal to optimize carbon fixation in relevant polymers over multiple life cycles and minimize carbon loss to the atmosphere via CO2 emissions. Evaluating these carbon balances in the production, consumption and end-of-life treatment phase of these polymers provides more insight in the carbon losses during their life cycle. Three case studies were considered; (1) a baseline route (BASE), representing the current linear plastics economy model which is benchmarked with two theoretical sustainable scenarios: (2) an electrified (ELEC) and (3) a biobased (BIO) route. Specific parameters and assumptions in these three cases were adapted, such as feedstock type, recycling rate, type of recycling etc. Improved recycling rates and advanced recycling methods were applied in the sustainable cases and had a positive effect on carbon retention in products. Allowing a numerical comparison, a method was developed to quantify this carbon retention via the half lifetime of carbon in materials over multiple life cycles. The half lifetime evolved from 0.3 year in the BASE route to 2.0 and 2.6 years in the BIO and ELEC route, respectively. However, even these sustainable, optimized routes remained insufficient to embed carbon in plastic products for many years without too much carbon loss. It is inevitable that an enhanced (carbon) circularity in these routes comes by a certain energy cost; about 46 GJ more energy was required per extra recycled ton carbon in the ELEC route (compared to BASE). But at the same time this intensified carbon conservation leads to a CO2 emission reduction potential of 80 %. The present work illustrates the potential of chemical recycling, and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) techniques for end-of-life treatment of plastic packaging products, but additional process development and process intensification in all facets of the value chain are needed to minimize carbon leakage over multiple lifecycles. Hence, waste management policy could be an important instrument to support further enhancement in plastics circularity.

This article presents the research results on the effectiveness of applying high-volume fly ash self-compacting concrete (SCC) in constructing environmentally influenced structures along the coast of Vietnam. SCC is designed with fly ash replacing 70% and 80% of cement. Technical criteria evaluated include workability, compressive strength, chloride ion permeability, water absorption, and dry bulk density of SCC. Additionally, the energy consumption, environmental emissions, and production costs of high-volume fly ash SCC are also assessed. The results show that SCC with 70% and 80% fly ash replacement by weight meets construction requirements, with compressive strengths at 28 days reaching 25.1 MPa and 21.2 MPa, and at 90 days reaching 49.4 MPa and 28.3 MPa respectively; chloride ion permeability is very low, electrical resistivity at 28 days is 690C and 539C; water absorption at 28 days is approximately 2.3% and 2.6%; dry bulk density at 28 days is 2239 kg/m3 and 2225 kg/m3. Compared to conventional concrete with equivalent compressive strengths of 20 MPa and 25 MPa (BT200, BT250), using high-volume fly ash SCC with 70% and 80% fly ash replacement results in energy consumption reduction by 45.28% and 53.45% respectively; CO2, NOx, SOx emissions are reduced by (52.41%, 54.26%, 53.95%) and (62.21%, 64.33%, 64.13%); material production costs decrease by 15.14% and 17.16% respectively. Utilizing high-volume fly ash SCC as a solution for coastal constructions proves to be technically feasible, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable.

Several studies have explored the use of graphene to improve the properties of cement-based materials. However, most commercially available graphenes are expensive, not amenable to mass production, and have high embodied energy and emissions, making their use in concrete less attractive, despite the beneficial mechanical property attributes. This paper discusses the use of two novel graphene types, fractal graphene (FG) and reactive graphene (RG), obtained through a cost-effective and scalable detonation synthesis, in cement-based materials. FG and RG are sheets containing 6–10 layers, with lateral dimensions of 20–50 nm and a z-axis thickness of <5 nm. RG is functionalized with carboxylic groups. An ultrasonication process is employed to ensure dispersion of graphene particles in aqueous solutions. Both FG and RG, when added at very small dosages (≤0.04% by mass of cement), enhance the compressive strength of cement mortars by >70% at early ages and up to 20% at later ages. The beneficial effect of functionalization results in better performance for RG-modified mixtures, even at dosages as low as 0.02%. Concomitant enhancements in heat of hydration, hydrate formation, and rheological response are observed. A significant reduction in porosity and critical pore size (by 50% or more) promises significantly improved concrete durability, and thus reduced life-cycle costs. A comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) is used to show that FG- and RG-modified mortars have normalized (by the 28 d strength) energy demand and global warming potential (GWP) that is up to 15% lower than those of conventional mortars. Overall, this study shows that FG and RG, manufactured through a scalable, cost-, energy-, and CO2-efficient detonation synthesis, can beneficially impact the engineering and environmental performance of concretes.

Abstract. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that, for the 2014–2023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] °C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] °C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] °C in 2023 relative to 1850–1900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] °C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2014–2023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53±5.4 Gt CO2e yr−1 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.

Background Postburn pruritus (itch) is a common and distressing symptom experienced on healing or healed burn or donor site wounds. Topical, systemic, and physical treatments are available to control postburn pruritus; however, it remains unclear how effective these are. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for treating postburn pruritus in any care setting. Search methods In September 2022, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and scanned references of relevant publications to identify eligible trials. There were no restrictions with respect to language, publication date, or study setting. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with postburn pruritus to compare an intervention for postburn pruritus with any other intervention, placebo or sham intervention, or no intervention. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 25 RCTs assessing 21 interventions with 1166 randomised participants. These 21 interventions can be grouped into six categories: neuromodulatory agents (such as doxepin, gabapentin, pregabalin, ondansetron), topical therapies (such as CQ‐01 hydrogel, silicone gel, enalapril ointment, Provase moisturiser, beeswax and herbal oil cream), physical modalities (such as massage therapy, therapeutic touch, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, enhanced education about silicone gel sheeting), laser scar revision (pulsed dye laser, pulsed high‐intensity laser, fractional CO2 laser), electrical stimulation (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation), and other therapies (cetirizine/cimetidine combination, lemon balm tea). Most RCTs were conducted at academic hospitals and were at a high risk of performance, attrition, and detection bias. While 24 out of 25 included studies reported change in burn‐related pruritus, secondary outcomes such as cost‐effectiveness, pain, patient perception, wound healing, and participant health‐related quality of life were not reported or were reported incompletely. Neuromodulatory agents versus antihistamines or placebo There is low‐certainty evidence that doxepin cream may reduce burn‐related pruritus compared with oral antihistamine (mean difference (MD) ‐2.60 on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS), 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.79 to ‐1.42; 2 studies, 49 participants). A change of 2 points represents a minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Due to very low‐certainty evidence, it is uncertain whether doxepin cream impacts the incidence of somnolence as an adverse event compared to oral antihistamine (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.25; 1 study, 24 participants). No data were reported on pain in the included study. There is low‐certainty evidence that gabapentin may reduce burn‐related pruritus compared with cetirizine (MD ‐2.40 VAS, 95% CI ‐4.14 to ‐0.66; 1 study, 40 participants). A change of 2 points represents a MCID. There is low‐certainty evidence that gabapentin reduces the incidence of somnolence compared to cetirizine (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.38; 1 study, 40 participants). No data were reported on pain in the included study. There is low‐certainty evidence that pregabalin may result in a reduction in burn‐related pruritus intensity compared with cetirizine with pheniramine maleate (MD ‐0.80 VAS, 95% CI ‐1.24 to ‐0.36; 1 study, 40 participants). A change of 2 points represents a MCID. There is low‐certainty evidence that pregabalin reduces the incidence of somnolence compared to cetirizine (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.69; 1 study, 40 participants). No data were reported on pain in the included study. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that ondansetron probably results in a reduction in burn‐related pruritus intensity compared with diphenhydramine (MD ‐0.76 on a 0 to 10 numeric analogue scale (NAS), 95% CI ‐1.50 to ‐0.02; 1 study, 38 participants). A change of 2 points represents a MCID. No data were reported on pain and adverse events in the included study. Topical therapies versus relevant comparators There is moderate‐certainty evidence that enalapril ointment probably decreases mean burn‐related pruritus compared with placebo control (MD ‐0.70 on a 0 to 4 scoring table for itching, 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.36; 1 study, 60 participants). No data were reported on pain and adverse events in the included study. Physical modalities versus relevant comparators Compared with standard care, there is low‐certainty evidence that massage may reduce burn‐related pruritus (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.86, 95% CI ‐1.45 to ‐0.27; 2 studies, 166 participants) and pain (SMD ‐1.32, 95% CI ‐1.66 to ‐0.98). These SMDs equate to a 4.60‐point reduction in pruritus and a 3.74‐point reduction in pain on a 10‐point VAS. A change of 2 VAS points in itch represents a MCID. No data were reported on adverse events in the included studies. There is low‐certainty evidence that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may reduce burn‐related pruritus compared with sham stimulation (SMD ‐1.20, 95% CI ‐1.65 to ‐0.75; 2 studies, 91 participants). This equates to a 5.93‐point reduction in pruritus on a 22‐point 12‐item Pruritus Severity Scale. There is low‐certainty evidence that ESWT may reduce pain compared with sham stimulation (MD 2.96 on a 0 to 25 pressure pain threshold (PPT), 95% CI 1.76 to 4.16; 1 study, 45 participants). No data were reported on adverse events in the included studies. Laser scar revision versus untreated or placebo controls There is moderate‐certainty evidence that pulsed high‐intensity laser probably results in a reduction in burn‐related pruritus intensity compared with placebo laser (MD ‐0.51 on a 0 to 1 Itch Severity Scale (ISS), 95% CI ‐0.64 to ‐0.38; 1 study, 49 participants). There is moderate‐certainty evidence that pulsed high‐intensity laser probably reduces pain compared with placebo laser (MD ‐3.23 VAS, 95% CI ‐5.41 to ‐1.05; 1 study, 49 participants). No data were reported on adverse events in the included studies. Authors' conclusions There is moderate to low‐certainty evidence on the effects of 21 interventions. Most studies were small and at a high risk of bias related to blinding and incomplete outcome data. Where there is moderate‐certainty evidence, practitioners should consider the applicability of the evidence for their patients.

In Scandinavia, we have a proud tradition of exercise physiology. The period from 1910 to 1920, during which August Krogh (1874–1949) and Johannes Lindhard (1870–1947) provided measurements on cardiorespiratory function and metabolism during exercise in humans, can certainly be considered its birth, at least from a merely Danish perspective. However, it is in my opinion the decades that followed the establishment of the Rockefeller Institute in Copenhagen in 1928 that comprise the formative years of Scandinavian exercise physiology. This institute, established with funds secured by August Krogh after he became a Nobel laureate, offered advanced research and teaching facilities in areas such as zoophysiology, medical physiology, gymnastics theory, biochemistry and biophysics (Asmussen, 1987). Krogh was instrumental in its design, ensuring the inclusion of facilities for Lindhard's Gymnastics Theory Laboratory on the first floor of the north wing, strategically located above his own Zoophysiological Laboratory to facilitate interaction and collaboration. It was in this environment, and under the guidance of both Lindhard and Krogh, that three scientists emerged as seminal figures in Scandinavian exercise physiology: Erik Hohwü Christensen (1904–1996), Marius Nielsen (1903–2000) and Erling Asmussen (1907–1991), fondly referred to by Krogh as 'The Three Musketeers' (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1995). The tales of these three scientists are many, and their efforts to evolve and promote exercise physiology, scientifically, pedagogically and organisationally, are certainly reminiscent of the noble characters' fight for justice in Alexandre Dumas's novel. I will try to refrain from digressing too much into the swashbuckler genre here, but Dumas's sentiment that 'the merit of all things lies in their difficulty' seems to resonate well with their scientific endeavours, as they repeatedly tackled scientific challenges that appeared insurmountable, either conceptually or methodologically (Asmussen, 1987; Åstrand, 1991). However, because a comprehensive account of their collective contributions would merit a whole monograph in its own right, I will only recapitulate one important aspect of their work from the formative years of Scandinavian exercise physiology here: the adaptative resetting of homeostasis across organ systems during exercise. Erik Hohwü Christensen, universally known as 'Hohwü', was still an undergraduate student in natural history, chemistry, geography and geology when he joined Lindhard at the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory, shortly after the Rockefeller Institute had been inaugurated in 1928. Under Lindhard's supervision, he engaged in a series of studies that followed up on Krogh and Lindhard's work from the preceding decade that demonstrated extremely rapid cardiovascular and gas exchange kinetics following exercise onset. Initially, his efforts were focused on enhancing the functionality of Krogh's bicycle ergometer (Krogh, 1913) and refining Krogh and Lindhard's nitrous oxide rebreathing technique developed for the measurement of cardiac output (Krogh & Lindhard, 1912). While doing this, Hohwü ensured an unprecedented standardisation of experimental conditions, exercising stringent control over variables such as diet, meal timings and rest periods prior to measurements. As an alternative to the nitrous oxide rebreathing technique, Hohwü adapted the relatively new acetylene rebreathing method for measurements during exercise (Christensen, 1931a, 1932a), and soon Hohwü expanded from mere methodologically based studies to mechanistic studies that focused not only on cardiac output, but also on blood glucose, respiration and thermoregulation (Christensen, 1931b, 1931c, 1931d, 1931e, 1932b). However, while Krogh and Lindhard's studies had mostly focused on exercise at moderate intensity in moderately fit men approaching middle age (themselves), Hohwü continued the longstanding Scandinavian tradition of self-experimentation within physiology, to conduct studies at (near-)maximal intensity in highly fit, young athletes, that is, himself and three fellow students that he knew from his dormitory, including Marius Nielsen. All these experiments were meticulously carried out using Krogh's now-optimised bicycle ergometer, ensuring well-defined workloads. Most critically, and unlike other contemporary studies that typically captured measurements during transitional states—such as at the onset of exercise, immediately following exertion or during short breaks—Hohwü's work was characterised by extended continuous exercise sessions that facilitated the acquisition of steady state measurements, to compare and distinguish the physiological changes that take place during rest, exercise at well-defined intensities, and recovery. Hohwü graduated in 1931, majoring in gymnastic theory, and defended his doctoral thesis based on the abovementioned studies later the same year. Marius Nielsen also graduated in 1931, majoring in natural history, and soon began conducting his experiments at the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory, focusing on the work of breathing during exercise (Nielsen, 1936a). Soon, an opportunity arose that would prove pivotal to their continued work. Since World War I, there had been an extraordinary surge in enthusiasm for sports, fuelled by the belief in athleticism as a crucial factor for health. However, some critics questioned whether these efforts genuinely contributed to improving health, highlighting the lack of clear evidence on whether athletic sports had a positive or negative impact on the body. The ambiguity surrounding the physiological effects of strenuous exercise and the safe limits of such exertion prompted the League of Nations' Health Organization to convene a meeting in Copenhagen in January 1931. Here, it was acknowledged that the specific changes occurring in the body under extreme athletic strain remained largely unexplored. To address this, experts at the meeting recommended that the Health Organization initiate a comprehensive study into various physiological responses to maximum muscular effort. Krogh and Lindhard, who attended the meeting, proposed a 2-year research programme to investigate these phenomena and subsequently received funding to continue Hohwü and Nielsen's research. The preliminary results were presented to the Health Organization in Geneva in 1934, encompassing a comprehensive 32-page report (Christensen et al., 1934), which is also an early account of the oxygen transport cascade, highlighting the convective and diffusive steps for oxygen transport from ambient air to working muscle in relation to exercise performance. The funding from the League of Nations' Health Organization enabled Krogh to hire both Hohwü and Nielsen as research assistants at the Zoophysiological Laboratory. Nielsen utilised this opportunity to also focus on the chemical regulation of ventilation (Nielsen, 1936b). These studies were not particularly focused on exercise as such, but exercise was used along with hypobaric hypoxia and experimentally induced metabolic acidosis (by orally administered ammonium chloride) as a means for uncovering the mechanisms regulating ventilation in humans. Specifically, Nielsen aimed to determine whether CO2 or H+ was the primary chemical stimulus that increased the 'excitability' of the respiratory centre to enhance breathing in these different conditions, a matter of great controversy during those years. During exercise, it was believed that either the increased CO2 or H+ production in the contracting skeletal muscle (and other working tissues) could increase P aC O 2 ${{P}_{{\mathrm{aC}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ and/or reduce arterial pH, which would then increase ventilation. Lindhard and Krogh, in particular, had both placed their bets on P aC O 2 ${{P}_{{\mathrm{aC}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ , but much to Nielsen's surprise, he found that both P aC O 2 ${{P}_{{\mathrm{aC}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ and arterial pH remained relatively constant during the prolonged strenuous exercise sessions to which he subjected Hohwü and his fellow students. When Nielsen presented this to Krogh, admitting that he did not understand how to grasp these findings, Krogh replied, 'No, I don't understand that either! You must find out!' Krogh said this in such a compelling manner that it remained a source of inspiration for Nielsen for much of his future work (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1995). Nielsen defended his doctoral thesis on the regulation of respiration in 1936. While he did not succeed in conclusively determining whether CO₂ or H⁺ was the primary stimulus governing the regulation of ventilation, much pointed towards CO2. However, the stimulus for the increased ventilation during any of the examined conditions was clearly not an increase in P aC O 2 ${{P}_{{\mathrm{aC}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ per se, but rather seemed to involve an altered sensitivity of the respiratory centre to CO₂ (Nielsen, 1936b). Curiously, Nielsen followed up with a study on thermoregulation during exercise, to challenge a common viewpoint that the increase in core temperature during exercise represents a failure of thermoregulation (Nielsen, 1938). Hohwü's previous study on core temperature during prolonged strenuous exercise, showing increases in temperature to levels that would be considered life-threatening in a clinical setting, had not done much to resolve this (Christensen, 1931c). In a room that was carefully thermoregulated to maintain consistent air temperature and humidity, the young scientists cycled vigorously at various intensities on Krogh's bicycle ergometer, which was suspended on a scale for the continuous measurement of weight loss due to perspiration, while rectal and skin temperatures were continuously measured (Nielsen, 1936a, 1936b). Rectal temperature increased proportionally with exercise intensity, independently of differences in the conditions for heat loss, while changes in skin temperature remained relatively minor (Nielsen, 1938). In fact, body temperature was kept within much narrower limits at a given exercise intensity than at rest. Nielsen could thus conclude that the rise in body temperature during exercise is a regulatory response and not the result of a failure in thermoregulation (Nielsen, 1938). Together, Nielsen's studies on ventilation and thermoregulation, conducted under carefully controlled conditions and at a well-defined steady state of exercise as established by Hohwü, pointed towards highly regulated exercise adaptations. While all this was going on, Asmussen, who was slightly younger than Hohwü and Nielsen, had started attending lectures at the Rockefeller Institute as a student of natural history. He became acquainted with Hohwü who knew that Lindhard needed an assistant to develop a method for isolating frog skeletal muscle fibres. Asmussen thus joined the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory as an unpaid assistant, and soon he was able to isolate muscle fibres from the frog's semitendinosus muscle, which then allowed him to conduct a series of studies on isometric and isotonic contractions. He continued spending his afternoons and evenings doing this after he majored in gymnastic theory in 1931 while earning his livelihood as a secondary school teacher of natural history and physical education, and in 1933 he defended his doctoral thesis on this work. By 1935, Asmussen had finally landed a position as a full-time research assistant at the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory, this time with an actual salary, so that he could quit his job as a secondary school teacher and focus more wholly on his research. However, in the meantime, Lindhard had invited the renowned German neurophysiologist Fritz Buchtal (1907–2003) to join the laboratory, in part because of the increasing hostility towards the Jewish community in Germany. Buchtal's expertise naturally drove the focus at the laboratory more in the direction of electrophysiological studies of skeletal muscle, which prompted Asmussen to concentrate on the integrative physiology of the human body in response to exercise instead. Asmussen thus conducted a study on the cardiopulmonary response to static exercise by leg presses against an angle lever with considerable loads. The study showed that oxygen uptake, ventilation and cardiac output showed variable changes during exercise depending on the workload, but they all increased sharply immediately after, which was attributed to the mechanical constraint of blood flow by the actively engaged muscles (Asmussen & Hansen, 1938). The thematic overlap between Hohwü and Nielsen were obvious to anyone, and soon the three started working closely together. Thus, by 1936, the memorable trio had finally been formed! Initially, Hohwü, Nielsen and Asmussen turned their attention towards matters deemed urgent at the time, in particular the mechanisms behind the increase in cardiac output during exercise. A prevalent theory suggested that vasodilatation in working muscle triggered a reduction in arterial blood pressure, which then led to an increase in cardiac output through baroreflex feedback. However, this could not explain the increase in stroke volume previously reported by Hohwü (Christensen, 1931e), and furthermore, the arterial baroreflex feedback loop had not been conclusively demonstrated in humans, neither during postural changes nor during steady state exercise. Moreover, the existing studies often uncritically assumed that heart rate was an accurate reflection of cardiac output, a notion also inconsistent with Hohwü's earlier studies (Christensen, 1931d, 1931e). In the basement under the north wing of the Rockefeller Institute, the trio devised an experimental set-up allowing for the manipulation of blood volume distribution through pneumatic thigh cuff inflation and deflation and by the use of a tilt table (enabling upright, supine and head-down measurements), reconstructed from a resuscitation table previously designed by Krogh in one of his less successful scientific endeavours (Krogh, 1934). This set-up also permitted the measurement of oxygen uptake, cardiac output (by Hohwü's modified acetylene rebreathing technique), and blood volume changes through water displacement plethysmography. They mostly used exercise protocols that involved rhythmic arm extensions against an elastic resistance, or by employing Krogh's bicycle ergometer. The routine was such that, after completing their teaching duties around 10 a.m., The Three Musketeers would commence the day's experiments, during which they took turns serving as experimental subjects. Following lunch, they dedicated time to analysing the data obtained. The set-up and measurements were continually refined to achieve reproducible results; even so, one experimental day would generally yield only one measurement point for a given variable (Asmussen, 1987). Therefore, although their papers often report results from relatively few, in this case three subjects, these results are usually based on several months of daily experimentation. When it came to drafting manuscripts based on the the data, they would sit together at a desk in the late afternoons and evenings; Nielsen, having the neatest handwriting, would write with a pencil as they collectively formulated each sentence of the paper, while Hohwü, who came from a Danish-minded family in Southern Jutland—a region that had not become part of Denmark until the Reunification in 1920—and had attended a German school, ensured that the paper's language, written in German, was impeccable (Asmussen, 1987). Krogh was a regular visitor, keen to showcase the experimental set-up to scientists from around the world, and in the evenings, he would often stop by to discuss results and ideas, contributing to further optimisation of the experiments (Asmussen, 1987; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1995). In their collaborative experiments conducted from 1936 and approximately 5 years forth, The Three Musketeers demonstrated that thigh cuff deflation in the sitting position and a postural change from supine to upright both result in blood displacement to the lower extremities with a concomitant increase in heart rate, and vice versa when moving from upright to the supine posture (Asmussen et al., 1938, 1939a). Despite a higher heart rate in the upright position, cardiac output was found to be lower due to a lower stroke volume than in the supine position, even though oxygen uptake was similar (Asmussen et al., 1939b). Additionally, superimposing arm exercise during postural changes while restricting venous return by thigh cuff inflation, caused heart rate to vary with posture in relation to differences in stroke volume, but it still increased with exercise in all postures (Asmussen & Christensen, 1939; Asmussen et al., 1939c). The baroreflex feedback loop could thus be effectively demonstrated in humans, and it seemed to remain equally effective for regulating heart rate during exercise compared to rest. Hence, as Nielsen had demonstrated for ventilation and thermoregulation, the changes in cardiovascular function during exercise seemed to reflect highly regulated phenomena. In another study, about half of the working musculature was isolated from the rest of the circulation by thigh cuff inflation during exercise on Krogh's bicycle ergometer. Despite a significant reduction in oxygen uptake, cardiac output and heart rate were barely affected (Asmussen et al., 1940). This indicated that the determinant of the cardiac output increase during exercise was the workload. In a subsequent study, a similar increase in cardiac output was observed, both in the healthy state and in the case of impaired proprioceptive feedback due to posterior fascicle demyelination (neurosyphilis) when muscle contractions were induced by electrical stimulation (Asmussen et al., 1943a). Together these studies showed that during steady state light-to-moderate exercise, it was not vasodilatation in the working muscle nor cortical feed-forward impulses that accounted for the increase in cardiac output. Given that no substances produced in the muscles below the inflated cuffs could enter the main circulation while the nervous connections remained intact, a neural feedback mechanism related to the volume of involved musculature, but unrelated to proprioception, seemed to be at play. Following up on the studies from Nielsen's doctoral thesis, similar observations were made regarding the ventilatory response to exercise. Thus, during light and moderate exercise on Krogh's bicycle ergometer, the reduction in oxygen uptake evoked by thigh cuff inflation did not affect the ventilatory response to exercise (Asmussen, Hohwü Christensen et al., 1943). Furthermore, a similar ventilatory response was observed during electrically induced muscle contractions, both in the healthy state and in the case of posterior fascicle demyelination (Asmussen et al., 1943b). Hence, the steady state ventilatory response to exercise also seemed to be triggered by a non-proprioceptive neural feedback mechanism. By the early 1940s, The Three Musketeers had thus demonstrated that ventilation, thermoregulation and cardiovascular function remain tightly regulated during exercise, involving feedback mechanisms originating within the working skeletal muscle that function to reset this regulation according to the given workload. However, they could not identify the exact stimulus that triggered this feedback mechanism. In 1941, that is, at the peak of The Three Musketeers' collaborative studies, Hohwü decided to depart to Sweden to pursue a professorship at the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute (GCI) in Stockholm, thus marking the end of this formative period of Scandinavian exercise physiology. Apart from a brief leave of absence from GCI in the early 1960s, Hohwü remained there until his retirement in 1970. However, to quote Dumas, 'Friendship is a sacred bond that cannot be broken by distance or time', and the trio remained in touch. Notably, Asmussen and Nielsen, who both became professors at the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory in 1961 and 1965, respectively, continued to investigate the elusive stimulus within working muscle that seemingly functioned to reset homeostatic regulation, initially naming it the 'work stimulus' (Asmussen & Nielsen, 1958), but later using the term 'work factor' (Asmussen, 1965), thus aligning with the contemporary terminology in exercise endocrinology (Goldstein, 1965; Ingle, 1955). Later, Hohwü's students, notably Bengt Saltin (1935–2014), followed up on another series of Hohwü's early studies on skeletal muscle fuel utilization during exercise, thereby integrating glucose homeostasis into this paradigm. However, that is a different story for another time. When reflecting on the collaboration between The Three Musketeers within the context of Alexandre Dumas's 1842 novel, I have often wondered: who is who? One might liken Hohwü to Athos, the noble and naturally leading figure. Nielsen could be compared to Aramis, the quieter and more thoughtful innovator. As for Asmussen, rather than resembling Porthos, the jovial and boisterous member, he might be better represented as D'Artagnan. Hence, during these formative years, the younger Asmussen grew to become Hohwü and Nielsen's equal, and subsequently a driving force for their collaboration that served as the group's visionary (Saltin, 1991). This is well-exemplified by an opening talk of his at a symposium entitled 'Physiology of Muscular Exercise' held in Dallas in 1966, in which he compiled the results of The Three Musketeers to elegantly formulate the concept of adaptive resetting of homeostasis during exercise (Asmussen, 1967): 'For every state of physical exercise, there is a carefully controlled level of pulmonary function, ventilation, cardiac output and deep body temperature. These levels are maintained at least as precisely as the resting level, and the controlling feedback systems are the same in exercise as during rest; only the set-point has been changed.' At the present day, it is evident that this adaptive resetting of homeostasis during exercise should be considered a universal phenomenon involving myriad neural and non-neural mechanisms, encompassed by the evolving concept of interorgan crosstalk (Hargreaves, 2021; Severinsen & Pedersen, 2020). Returning to the questions posed at The League of Nations meeting in 1931, it is thus clear that exercise is not merely a disturbance that organ systems must counteract, eliciting abnormal or extreme responses. Rather, every organ of the healthy body is 'designed' to accommodate to the steady state of exercise, both in its own right and through its interaction with other organs—'one for all, and all for one!'
