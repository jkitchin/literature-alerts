Constructive defect engineering has emerged as a prominent method for enhancing the performance of photocatalysts. The mechanisms of the influence of defect types, concentrations, and distributions on the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of CO2 reduction were revealed for this paper by analyzing the effects of different types of defects (e.g., metallic defects, non-metallic defects, and composite defects) on the performance of photocatalysts. There are three fundamental steps in defect engineering techniques to promote photocatalysis, namely, light absorption, charge transfer and separation, and surface-catalyzed reactions. Defect engineering has demonstrated significant potential in recent studies, particularly in enhancing the light-harvesting, charge separation, and adsorption properties of semiconductor photocatalysts for reducing processes like carbon dioxide reduction. Furthermore, this paper discusses the optimization method used in defect modulation strategy to offer theoretical guidance and an experimental foundation for designing and preparing efficient and stable photocatalysts.

In this study, a comprehensive theoretical analysis was undertaken to elucidate the remarkably efficient conversion of CO2 into HCOO– employing a coordination polymer featuring Pb–S bonds, namely [Pb(tadt)]n (where tadt stands for 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-dithiolate), referred to as KGF-9. The catalytic activity of this visible-light responsive solid photocatalyst has been carefully compared with that of PbS, a typical compound that also contains the Pb–S bond. The former shows a very high catalytic activity, while the latter shows almost no activity. The photoreduction process of CO2 on the KGF-9 surface was analyzed in detail using periodic density functional theory calculations. The reduced catalyst surface was modeled as a hydrogenated surface. The reaction at the active center of a formate dehydrogenase provides an interesting contrast, suggesting that the S–H group plays an important role in the conversion of CO2 to HCOO–. However, the S–H group on the reduced PbS surface does not facilitate the conversion to the same extent as KGF-9. This is because the electrons supplied to CO2 on the PbS surface come from deep within the solid, whereas on KGF-9, they come from the top surface. This difference is due to differences in the electronic structure of the S–H bond, band gap, and valence band maximum position between the two surfaces, accounting for the marked difference in their catalytic activity. These insights are consistent with experimental and computational results on the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the CO2 reduction reaction of KGF-9 and PbS, and provide guidance for the design of CO2 photoreduction catalysts.

Silver is one of the most studied electrode materials for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, a product with many industrial applications. There is a growing number of reports in which silver is implemented in gas diffusion electrodes as part of a large-scale device to develop commercially relevant technology. Electrochemical models are expected to guide the design and operation toward cost-efficient devices. Despite decades of investigations, there are still uncertainties in the way this reaction should be modeled due to the absence of scientific consensus regarding the reaction mechanism and the nature of the rate-determining step. We review previously reported studies to draw converging conclusions on the value of the Tafel slope and existing species at the electrode surface. We also list conflicting experimental observations and provide leads to tackling these remaining questions.

Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) have emerged as highly efficient catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), providing a promising avenue to solve the carbon dilemma. Based on density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the capability of 12 tetra-atom transitional-metal clusters anchored on g-CN (TM4@g-CN) for CO2RR and found that all clusters have good stability on the substrate. Notably, the charge variation of the top metal atom (TM4) of six SCCs is close to zero which makes them readily donate electrons to the adsorbate CO2 and subsequent reaction intermediates. Our results demonstrate that CO2 can be efficiently reduced to HCOOH on Ni4, Cu4, and Au4@g-CN with low limiting potentials of −0.21, −0.22, and −0.19 V, respectively, outperforming the corresponding single-atom counterparts. Both ΔG(∗CO2) and ΔG(∗OCHO/∗COOH) exhibit a volcano relationship with the reaction activity, and the TM4 serves as electron reservoirs throughout the entire reaction process. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of cost-effective supported single cluster catalysts.

This study investigates the utilisation of organometallic network frameworks composed of fourth-period transition metals and tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ) in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed in analysing binding energies, as well as the stabilities of metal atoms within the THQ frameworks, for transition metal TM-THQs ranging from Y to Cd. The findings demonstrate how metal atoms could be effectively dispersed and held within the THQ frameworks due to sufficiently high binding energies. Most TM-THQ frameworks exhibited favourable selectivity towards CO2 reduction, except for Tc and Ru, which experienced competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and required solution environments with pH values greater than 5.716 and 8.819, respectively, to exhibit CO2RR selectivity. Notably, the primary product of Y, Ag, and Cd was HCOOH; Mo produced HCHO; Pd yielded CO; and Zr, Nb, Tc, Ru, and Rh predominantly generated CH4. Among the studied frameworks, Zr-THQ displayed values of 1.212 V and 1.043 V, corresponding to the highest limiting potential and overpotential, respectively, while other metal–organic frameworks displayed relatively low ranges of overpotentials from 0.179 V to 0.949 V. Consequently, it is predicted that the TM-THQ framework constructed using a fourth-period transition metal and tetrahydroxyquinone exhibits robust electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 catalytic activity.

In this study, we experimentally screen a promising class of intermetallic alloys for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 toward hydrocarbon products. Based on previous DFT-based screening papers, combinations of strongly CO-binding metals such as iron, cobalt, and nickel with weakly CO-binding metals such as gallium, aluminium or zinc were selected as potentially promising catalytic materials. Despite the challenging production of these alloys, we report a general two-step synthesis method for intermetallic alloys and discuss the specific synthesis conditions that must be taken into account when synthesising these materials. After their synthesis, we use a recently developed differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) setup to rapidly quantify the CO2 reduction products over a range of potentials. Almost all newly developed intermetallic catalysts are shown to produce methane and ethylene, while the CoSn catalyst showed higher selectivity towards formate production. However, all tested catalysts mostly produced hydrogen and only reduce CO2 to a small extent, despite the favourable computational screening results. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy and outline a more holistic approach for linking future DFT studies with experiments.

The catalytic role of hydride intermediate in the CO2 reduction to formate (HCOO−) by NiII-NHC complexes is investigated in detail by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that a NiII-hydride is sufficiently hydridic to facilitate the efficient transfer of hydride to the carbon center of CO2, leading to the HCOO− production. Importantly, the direct hydride transfer path proposed here bypasses the conventional CO2 insertion into a metal-hydride bond. This mechanism is elucidated through a detailed analysis of the free energy changes of the reaction and the activation barriers, where key parameters such as reduction potentials, pKa values, and the thermodynamics of hydride transfer are thoroughly evaluated. The thermodynamic hydricity of the NiII-hydride, calculated to be ΔGH− = 19.2 kcal/mol, is in sharp contrast with the less effective NiIII-hydride with ΔGH− = 52.4 kcal/mol, highlighting the enhanced reactivity of NiII-hydride in HCOO− formation. Additionally, an examination of the competitive formation of CO and H2 reveals the preferential tendency of NiII-hydride to produce HCOO− over these byproducts. Insights into the influence of the pKa for the proton source on the feasibility of H2 production and HCOO− selectivity are also provided, suggesting a way to optimize reaction conditions for improved selectivity and efficiency. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the CO2 reduction to HCOO− by NiII-NHC catalysts, emphasizing the direct hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical CO2 insertion mechanism.

As a major emitter of CO2, China needs to take responsibility for slowing down global warming. In this paper, the potential carbon emission intensity of provinces is firstly calculated using the non-radial directional distance function under the group- and meta-frontier techniques, and then six scenarios based on two factors (economic development and carbon intensity) are set up to estimate the emission reduction potential of China and each province. Considering the goal of carbon neutrality, the calculation of CO2 emission reduction potential quantifies the amount of emissions that can be reduced and the amount of emissions that should be balanced. Additionally, the degree of difficulty in achieving abatement potential is also calculated. The findings are as follows: First, assuming that the economic growth rate is reduced to 4.4% (achieving the second “100-year goal”) and each province adopts the most advanced low-carbon technologies, China could reduce carbon emissions by 5970.56 Mt compared to 2019 levels. To achieve net-zero emissions, the remaining 3824.2 Mt of carbon emissions should be removed by carbon reduction technologies. Second, the effect of slowing down economic growth and decreasing carbon intensity varies greatly among provinces. Hebei and Shandong should be prioritized as they have the greatest potential for emission reductions under both scenarios. Third, it is more difficult for Beijing, Shanghai, Hubei, Hunan, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Chongqing, and Sichuan to achieve the abatement potential and they require more effort to reduce the same amount of carbon emissions compared to other provinces. The study provides a reference for achieving carbon neutrality and helps provinces to develop differentiated emission reduction strategies.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals has been considered as a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming. Iron porphyrins have been extensively studied for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and are well documented to promote CO2-to-CO conversion. However, the mechanism of CO2-to-HCOO- conversion by Fe porphyrin remains unclear. Here, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigated the detailed mechanism of a novel Fe porphyrin catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO- in its Fe(I) state. Our results demonstrated that the reduction of CO2 to HCOO- proceeds through the C-protonation of an FeII-OCO·- complex rather than through the hydrolysis of an FeIII-COOH complex or CO2 insertion in an Fe-H bond. Moreover, the FeIII-COOH complex is not a stable intermediate. The protonation of its hydroxyl group with concomitant C-OH bond cleavage to produce CO is thermodynamically and kinetically unfeasible. Instead, the FeIII-COOH complex can undergo a coordination switch followed by a conformational change to form the active FeII-OCO·- complex for production of HCOO-. Moreover, the single-electron reduction of FeIII-COOH gives FeII-COOH, which leads to formation of CO rather than HCOO-. The insights gained from this work may be useful for designing the electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction to formate.

Building of grain boundary (GB) in Cu-based catalysts has been demonstrated to be an efficient strategy to control the product selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). However, the fabrication and modulation of GBs in Cu are still challenging. In this study, a series of bare Cu catalysts with controllable density of Cu(111) GBs were investigated systematically for eCO2RR. These catalysts exhibit superior eCO2RR performance for syngas production with a high FE of ~80% and tunable H2/CO ratio of 0.46−2.78. Three-dimensional wormlike Cu with abundant (111) GBs displays a stable H2/CO ratio of ~0.5 over a wide potential range from −0.9 to −1.2 V (vs. RHE). In situ Raman and ATR-SEIRAS spectroscopy combined with DFT calculations reveal that Cu(111) GBs enhance the adsorption of CO2, lower the energy barriers of CO2 to ⁎COOH and ⁎CO, further highlighting the potential to control syngas production with desirable proportion over Cu-based catalysts.

Hydrogen (H2), a relatively underexplored reductant in ferromanganese (FeMn) production, offers an attractive avenue for mitigating gaseous carbon (C) emissions. The reduction behaviour of South African Nchwaning manganese (Mn) ore using gaseous CO/CO2, H2/H2O, and H2 atmospheres was investigated experimentally in the temperature variation of 700, 800, and 900 °C. The effect of different gas compositions and temperatures was studied using a vertical thermogravimetric (TG) tube furnace. During pre-reduction, two parallel reactions occurred, namely the reduction of higher Mn- and iron (Fe) -oxides, and the decomposition of carbonates. After each test, decrepitation, chemical composition, phase transformation, and porosity were characterised. Using the rate of mass loss, a kinetic model was obtained to predict kinetic constants. The oxidation state of the higher Mn- and Fe-oxides was lowered during CO/CO2 and H2/H2O pre-reduction. Only during pure H2 pre-reduction was Fe2+ reduced to its metallic state, Fe0. The majority of carbonates decomposed in the presence of the CO/CO2 atmosphere at 900 °C, whereas in the presence of H2 in the reducing atmosphere carbonates decomposed at a higher rate and at lower temperatures. Additionally, the extent and rate of mass loss were expedited by increasing the temperature, employing H2-containing atmospheres, and lowering the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) of the H2-containing atmospheres. No significant trends were observed in ore decrepitation and porosity across various atmospheres and temperatures, except for decrepitation in the water vapour-containing atmosphere. The utilisation of a pure H2 atmosphere has a significant ability for pre-reducing manganese ores with carbonate content by expediting carbonate decomposition and promoting Fe-oxide metallisation, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ore treatment in metallurgical applications.

Photobiocatalytic CO2 reduction represents an attractive approach for conversion of solar light and abundant resources to value-added chemicals. However, the design of suitable systems requires a detailed understanding of the interaction between artificial photosensitizer and biocatalyst interface. In this work, we investigate the effect of surfactant charge utilized in the preparation of a phenoxazine-based organic molecule nanorods photosensitizer on the interaction with the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase II from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans within biohybrid assemblies for photobiocatalytic CO2 reduction into CO. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay in pair with cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and detailed physicochemical characterization are conducted to understand the interaction at the biohybrid interface in order to suggest the strategy for future functionalization of nanoparticles that fulfill the needs from biocatalyst for green fuel production.

The bifunctional CO‐dehydrogenase/acetyl‐CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl‐moiety and CoA to acetyl‐CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. Here, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket‐brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.

Ni/CeO2 catalysts were synthesized to evaluate the effect of varying Ni concentration on the CeO2 structure, studying their structural and catalytic properties in the conversion of CO2 to CH4. The impact of Ni concentration on the Ni/CeO2 catalyst properties was evaluated by TG-DTA-DTG, FTIR, XRD, nitrogen physisorption, SEM, and TEM-EDS analyses. XPS analyses of Ce 3d, Ni 2p, and O 1s were conducted to understand the surface structural organization of these catalysts. In situ monitoring followed by Quick-XAS during activation was performed to obtain results on chemical species that may coexist in the catalytic reduction process and evaluate the performance of each catalyst in the reduction process. Ni-O-Ce solid solutions were identified by MCR-ALS analysis, and their importance in CO2 methanation was discussed throughout this work. The catalytic activity of catalysts with a balanced phase between Ni-O-Ce solid solutions and Ni0 metallic area proved more efficient.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low‐carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in‐situ chemical bath deposition (named as c‐CdS/a‐Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c‐CdS/a‐Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (>90%) under a wide potential window of 1.0 V, with the highest value reaching ~100% at the applied potential ranging from −2.16 V to −2.46 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c‐CdS/CP and c‐CdS/c‐Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7 mA cm−2 at −2.76 V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c‐CdS/a‐Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three‐dimensional structure and the introduction of a‐Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.

The rational design of copper (Cu)-based catalysts with different oxidation states is essential to achieve highly selective and efficient CO2 electroreduction. However, the effect of different oxide states of Cu-based catalysts has rarely been studied. Herein, the reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation into CO on Cu-based catalysts with different oxidation states, such as Cu(1 1 1), Cu2O(1 1 1) and CuO(1 1 1), was studied using the density functional theory. The most favored pathway for CO production and the rate-controlling step on the three catalyst models were determined. The results show that, Cu2O (1 1 1) shows the best catalytic activity among the three catalysts due to the lowest activation barrier. The electronic structure analysis shows that Cu2O has the proper electronic structure to activate CO2 which is further reduced to CO. This work provides an important insight on the effect of oxidation state of Cu-based catalysts on the reduction of CO2 to CO.

Bipolar membranes (BPM) are a special class of ion-exchange membranes constituted by a cation- and an anion-exchange layer, allowing the generation of protons and hydroxide ions via water dissociation. This unique feature makes them useful in a wide range of application. In this work, we have fabricated a novel BPM, with SnO2 hollow spheres used as water dissociation catalyst. Such fabricated BPM has been served as a diaphragm to construct a three-chamber electrolyzer for CO2 electro-reduction to CO in organic electrolyte. During the long-term electrolysis process, the cathodic current density has reached to ∼96.5 mA·cm-2, with the Faraday efficiency of CO stabled at ∼92.6%. Compared with widely used commercial BPM, as-prepared BPM exhibited many advantages, such as lower hydrolysis over-potential, high catalytic efficiency and low total resistance. This technology extends the prospect of BPM application in the field of CO2 reduction.

Membrane reactor processes can be used to overcome the constraints of the chemical rate equilibrium of methanol (MeOH) synthesis products. In this thermodynamics-limited work, three different selective sulfonated poly(ether ether ketones) (SPEEK) membranes were applied in an engineered unit operation with a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 surface catalyst for several CO2/CO-involving chemistries. A detailed mathematical model with micro-kinetics was developed, optimised and utilised to assess the vessel with barrier by using CERRES (Chemical Reaction and Reactor Engineering Simulations). Scaled separation tests were described by the integrated reference values of permeance. The permeability for all compound molecules (H2, H2O, CO, CO2, MeOH…) was determined by adjusting parameters to account for the experimental gas composition on the permeate, interface and retention segment side after reduction. The specific kinetic characteristics of the mechanism of elementary step reactions were analysed in fixed bed design. A comparison of the estimated data prediction for the packed system with related definite numbers showed excellent statistical agreement. Similarly, a very good reliability was obtained between the results for 3 SPEEK membrane cases. Thus, the defined particular evaluations of derived theoretical expressions were benchmarked accurately. Although (validated) performance, i.e. the yield of MeOH, was overestimated, discrepancy was not so large so as to simulate behaviour verily. The (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (polyamide) over a SPEEK layer performed best for intensification. Herein, the pressurised (>50 bar) CO2 hydrogenation pathway was not only shifted by in situ removal as a proof of concept, but also modelled intrinsically, considering transport phenomena resistances, adsorption and desorption as well. The storage of hydrogen can benefit from MeOH production reengineering.

The chapter provides significant and insightful methodological developments and strategies in the field of applied nanotechnology in particular applications in catalysis, pollution and energy. Owing to detrimental climate change and depletion of fossil fuels, we explore novel nanomaterial i.e., 'smart' metal-metal oxides and palladium-based electrocatalysts to achieve the requirements of sustainable and renewable resources. In the last decade, researchers have been engaged in the development of new and fundamental chemistries that will transform the field of nanotechnology and humans. In this view, the concept of green chemistry was coined in the early 1990s and was regarded as the engine in the development of new green nanomaterial. This transition is driving the investigation of green chemistry to mitigate environmental problems, replace traditional methods with novel designs and ultimately replace unsustainable chemistries. With this consideration, the preparation of catalytically active bio-inspired Ni/MgO and Cu/Cu2O/CuO/ZnO and Pd-based Pd-NiO/C, Pd/C and Pd-Cu/Cu2O/CuO/Zn using plant biological entities and waste materials as an eco-friendly, green route are explored. This chapter highlights the mechanism of interaction whilst exploring in-depth the leading edge of green-prepared nanomaterials in storage and energy conversion. This comprises studying the electrochemical phenomena of nanostructured materials, electrocatalysis, activity, stability, vital processes of polarisation resistance and diffusion-controlled systems at the nanostructured electrode surface through catalysis. A short overview and use of nanostructured material in energy spheres such as carbon dioxide electrochemical systems to produce energy fuels are also covered.

A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin‐2’‐one‐1,2,3‐triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2‐diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue‐green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475 nm (ε = 4500 M‐1cm‐1), which is assigned to the metal‐to‐ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin‐2’‐one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo‐driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo‐driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)‐porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge‐accumulation properties, the non‐innocent benzoquinoxalin‐2‐one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)‐based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) was investigated in either organic or aqueous/organic media by employing three newly synthesized water-soluble Rh(Cp*)(n,n’-dihydroxy-2,2’-bipyridine) (n = 4, 5, or 6) in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) and triethanolamine (TEOA). Through studying the electron-donating effects of two hydroxyl groups introduced to the bipyridyl ligand, we found that the hydroxyl group positions of the catalyst greatly affect both the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction. More importantly, the HCOOH selectivity shows a dramatic increase from 14% to 83% upon switching the solvent media from pure organic to aqueous/organic mixture, where the H2 selectivity shows a reverse phenomenon. The enhanced HCOOH selectivity and the drastic decrease in the apparent H2 yield are well rationalized by the fact that the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation by the evolved H2 simultaneously proceeds as a dark catalytic reaction, which was also separately investigated under the dark conditions. Our DFT studies unveil that the exceptionally large structural strain given by the steric contacts between the 6,6’-dihydroxyl groups and the Cp* moiety plays a significant role in bringing about an outstanding catalytic performance of the 6,6’-subsituted derivative. The intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations on the hydride transfer steps leading to generate formate together the heterolytic H2 cleavage steps leading to afford the key hydridorhodium intermediates afford the results useful to interpret the observed phenomena. This study represents the first report on the water-induced high selectivity in CO2-to-HCOOH conversion, shedding a new light on the strategy to control the efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction.

Pd based catalysts are rare metal‐based catalyst to yield tunable CO/H2 ratios for Fischer‐Tropsch synthesis. How to achieve the co‐production of CO and H2 with as little Pd as possible is extremely meaningful for Cn industry. Recent experiment revealed single Pd atom anchored on graphene exhibits high activity for CO2 electroreduction to syngas, yet the origin of activity and controllable CO/H2 ratios, especially the exact Pd coordination structure, remains elusive. Here we employ grand‐canonical density functional theory to show that Pd‐N1, rather than the commonly accepted Pd‐N4, serves as the active center, and the charge‐carrying capability is an effective descriptor. The site with more Pd‑C coordination can better submerge in graphene's delocalized π electrons for higher charge‐carrying capacity to carry excess charges that occupy Pd 4dz2 orbital and promote electron injection. Importantly, the tunable CO/H2 ratio can be explained with difference in charge‐carrying capability of transition state for *COOH and *H2 formation. This work solves the puzzle of coordinating structure of Pd active site and demonstrates the important role of charge‐carrying capability in electrochemical process, which shall provide a reference for further exploration of efficient electrocatalysts.

As prominent oil producers, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have played a significant role in the global energy market. However, as the world's attention increasingly shifts towards environmental sustainability, understanding the implications of the GCC's economic activities on CO2 emissions becomes indispensable. This research paper investigates the relationship between specific economic indicators and their impact on CO2 emissions in the GCC from 2001 to 2021. The study employs quantile regression, a powerful statistical method that estimates the conditional quantiles of a response variable given a set of predictor variables. The findings reveal several important insights: Financial institution efficiency is significant and negative at a 1% level at the lower (10th) -83537.3 and the higher quantile (90th) -549002.3. The relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions varies across quantiles, highlighting the complexity of the growth-environment nexus. Total patents exhibit a positive and significant relationship with emissions, underscoring the importance of directing innovation towards environmentally sustainable solutions. Renewable energy consumption displays a nuanced relationship with CO2 emissions, with a stronger negative impact observed at higher consumption levels. This underscores the potential of renewable energy to mitigate emissions when integrated at scale. The study's outcomes hold crucial policy implications for the GCC countries as they seek to align economic growth with environmental sustainability. The findings emphasize the importance of fostering financial institution efficiency, promoting green innovation, and expanding renewable energy sources to reduce emissions

The liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry stands at the cusp of a transformation driven by the climate imperative. Focussing on the Middle Arm Industrial Precinct, this paper shows how carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are being reduced in a proposed world-class LNG project by assessing, screening and selecting known technologies using a Marginal Abatement philosophy linked to key emissions drivers. (1) We propose a new breed of electrified LNG facilities that could deliver an up to 90% reduction in CO2 intensity. (2) We show that through developing strategic partnerships in upstream renewable power, hydrogen supply, and enabled downstream carbon capture and storage (CCS), the significant low carbon energy requirements of an LNG facility can be delivered. (3) We discuss a Marginal Abatement assessment strategy which ensures a pathway to viable lowest cost opportunities selected in an ‘Avoid & Mitigate’ first approach. This proposed strategy ensures that CO2 emission reduction opportunities are assessed and selected consistently to determine both a lifecycle cost ($) and volume (tons CO2e) of emission reduction. These innovative strategies collectively articulate a roadmap for a low carbon future for LNG and other heavy industrial industries, underlining Australia’s potential to become a leading provider of low-carbon natural resources.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is critical in Australia for future production of lower-carbon natural gas for domestic use and international export. There may also be targeted applications in other sectors, such as electricity, industrial heat generation and manufacturing, but only a small portion of the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are likely to be addressed with carbon capture. That leaves significant CO2 storage potential untapped. Wood Mackenzie’s analysis suggests that Australia’s CCS opportunity lies less in the reduction of domestic emissions, and more in enabling other countries’ net zero ambitions. This involves building hubs to transport and store CO2 at scale, using Australia’s vast geological resources. Such hubs are major capital projects and typically require billions of dollars of investment. However, supporting CO2 storage hubs with public funding may feel like a bitter policy pill to swallow, if there is not a large Australian emissions reduction number on the other side of it. So, why should Australia put its money towards this, and fast? In this paper, we will size the economic opportunity, benchmark Australia’s competitiveness with other aspiring hubs in the region and assess the amount of investment and policies required to get there.

Aerobic composting acknowledged as a crucial technology in the management of food waste, offers a potential approach to sustainable production practices by producing top-notch organic fertilizers and soil conditioners. Nevertheless, the natural process of composting contributes to environmental pollution by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. This study examines the effectiveness of adding calcium peroxide to the composting process to improve the availability of oxygen, reduce CO2 emissions, and enhance the quality of the final products. The study involved conducting experimental trials using different doses of calcium peroxide (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) to evaluate its effect on reducing CO2 levels. The results demonstrate a substantial decrease in CO2 emissions, where concentrations of 20% lead to a reduction of 36.82%while in 5%, 10%, and 15% the reductions were 19.15%,26.36%, and 36.32%, respectively. In addition, the inclusion of calcium peroxide raises the pH of food waste samples and introduces calcium ions (Ca2+) into the end product. The results emphasize the significance of dealing with carbon emissions in composting procedures to adhere to Sustainable Development Goals 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 13 (climate action), thus progressing towards more sustainable waste management techniques.

Increased world energy demand due to population and rapid technological growth, and urbanisation has induced climatic change through increased atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration, of which the atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies have been identified as the pertinent pathway towards the reduction of this GHG. These CDRs serve as an adaptation and mitigation approach to abate the impacts of climate change. Different CDR strategies are encapsulated in the term Carbon sequestration, describing natural and technological approaches by which carbon dioxide (CO2) is removed from the atmosphere. Technologically, Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) is a CDR strategy that encompasses both carbon capture and storage (CSS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies. Its developmental pathways and implementation depend on understanding the natural carbon source and sink contained in the natural carbon cycle and CO2 capture technology. CCS technologies capture CO2 from large point sources, mainly power plants and industrial processes and store it in underground geological formations that include the deep saline aquifer, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, unminable coal seams and oceanic basaltic formations. The captured CO2 is also stored through in-situ mineral carbonation and direct ocean injection. Other processes that enhance CO2 removal include ocean fertilisation, ocean alkalinity enhancement and marine/terrestrial photosynthetic conversion, which stores CO2 in the pedosphere or surface ocean relative to natural carbon sequestration. CCU is a CCS complimentary technology that converts the captured CO2 into value-added products through CO2- ex-situ mineralization, value-added storage (enhanced oil/gas recovery, enhanced geothermal system, and enhanced coalbed/shale gas recovery) and CO2- chemical feedstock and biofuels. At present, there is no CCUS project in Nigeria. However, different preliminary site characterisation studies have been carried out for CCUS project development, which is being delayed by a lack of funding, robust policies, and public awareness.

Pig farmhouses face unprecedented challenges in meeting the growing demand to feed an increasing population. To do so, these farms contribute significantly to the production of approximately 35 % of the world's NH3 emissions, a highly harmful air pollutant. In response to this critical environmental issue, the CO2 Management Pig Slurry Strategy (CO2-MPS) proposes an innovative solution to mitigate NH3 emissions by leveraging the biogenic CO2 produced within pig farmhouses. This groundbreaking Carbon Dioxide Utilization (CDU) approach based on utilizing this biogenic CO2 to form a protective blanket over pig manure lagoons promises the reduction of over 8 million metric tons of NH3 emissions annually. Such NH3 emissions are well-documented initiators of Particulate Matter, particularly PM2.5, highlighting the potential positive impact on air quality of this strategy.

Methane pyrolysis and water electrolysis offer alternative hydrogen pathways to methane reforming that utilise renewable power and avoid generating carbon dioxide (CO2). On a scope 1 and 2 basis, both technologies have the potential to generate carbon neutral emethanol fuel when combined with biogenic CO2. However, pyrolysis requires significantly less energy and has a lower capital expenditure (CAPEX). Being a more nascent technology, it also has upside potential for cost reductions and valorisation of the solid carbon by-product can yield lower hydrogen costs than the incumbent technology, however, limited demand from existing markets is a potential constraint. Industry decarbonisation is constrained due to a lack of available renewables and hydrogen infrastructure. Pyrolysis offers a potential cost-effective use of the available renewable assets in the early stages while the carbon by-product is not a constraint and until sufficient renewable infrastructure is in place to support water electrolysis at a cost-effective scale.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is central to clean energy transition. Globally, potential aggregated carbon dioxide (CO2) storage resource capacity is ~13,000 billion tonnes. Assuming global greenhouse gas emissions of 51 billion tonnes per annum, CO2 storage capacity equates to 250 years of global emissions reduction. While there is significant momentum to deploy CCS technology for meeting Paris Agreement targets, the key challenge for offering CCS to all industrial sectors is that many major CO2 emission sources are located hundreds of kilometres away from geological storage sites. To address this key challenge, there is a need to develop a long-distance and large-scale CCS value chain that utilises liquefied CO2 (LCO2) ship transportation. This paper discusses key technical, commercial, and regulatory considerations that must be addressed in parallel for developing such a CCS value chain. More specifically, it will cover the following: (1) technical – CO2 liquefaction condition, CO2 supply specification and LCO2 ship parcel size; (2) commercial – business model (ownership of CO2 retained by emitters or transferred to CCS project proponent), CO2 supply or CCS facility lease terms and conditions; and (3) regulatory – domestic versus transboundary projects and associated needs for policy and legislative underpinning.

The exploitation of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a sustainable, plentiful, and harmless C1 source for the catalytic synthesis of enantioenriched carboxylic acids has long been acknowledged as a pivotal task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a current-driven nickel-catalyzed reductive carboxylation reaction with CO2 fixation, facilitating the formation of C(sp3)–C(sp2) bonds by circumventing the handling of moisture-sensitive organometallic reagents. This electroreductive protocol serves as a practical platform, paving the way for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargylic carboxylic acids (up to 98% enantiomeric excess) from racemic propargylic carbonates and CO2. The efficacy of this transformation is exemplified by its successful utilization in the asymmetric total synthesis of (S)-arundic acid, (R)-PIA, (S)-chizhine D, (S)-cochlearin G, and (S,S)-alexidine, thereby underscoring the potential of asymmetric electrosynthesis to achieve complex molecular architectures sustainably.

The urban carbon footprint (UCF) is an important tool for assessing an organization’s ecological impacts and in guiding sustainability efforts. This calculation is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq). Calculations provide important data to determine strategies to reduce the carbon footprint and establish sustainability targets. Various standards and protocols guide UCF calculation, and many organizations aim to make these data transparent to their stakeholders and the public. This study aims to calculate the UCF of Sarıçam Municipality (SM) in the Adana Province of Türkiye. This study includes the greenhouse gas emission inventories resulting from all activities of the SM main service building, guest house, construction site service building, Cultural Center service building, and additional service buildings between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022. The calculations include generator fuel consumption, electricity consumption, the refrigerant gas leaks and refills resulting from these activities, the fuel consumed in vehicles owned by the company or whose fuel consumption is under company control, emissions originating from personal travel, emissions originating from customers and visitors, emissions originating from business travel, purchases, etc. Emissions from products purchased and emissions from waste transportation are included. The findings show that, in 2022, the total UCF of SM was equal to 10,862.46 tons of CO2-eq. The Paris Agreement aims to reduce the per capita emissions to approximately two tons of CO2-eq by 2030. The carbon footprint per employee within the municipality was calculated at 12.43 tons of CO2-eq, as derived from the analyzed data. The results reveal the importance of implementing sustainable practices and strategies within SM, such as energy efficiency measures, waste reduction, and the adoption of renewable energy sources, to mitigate its carbon footprint. This study plans to provide a basis for SM’s reduction efforts by keeping greenhouse gas emissions under control.

In candidate formations for geological Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite) are ubiquitously presented. The dynamic process of chemically induced alteration on carbonate-rich reservoirs due to the injection of supercritical CO2 holds paramount importance for achieving an economic injectivity and structural integrity of the system. How carbonate rocks undergo deterioration and particularly how microcracks develop in the presence of carbon dioxide remain largely unknown. Here we employ a powerful tool of reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, investigating into the impact of representative CO2 environments on Mode I tensile crack propagation in calcite at micro-scale. Our simulation results demonstrate that (1) both dry and wet CO2 environments favor the tensile crack propagation by lowering the fracture toughness of the pre-existing crack; (2) the wet CO2 environment promotes the growth velocity of the subcritical crack compared to the dry CO2 environment, under the same mechanical loading condition; (3) the interaction between the stressed crack and the CO2-water mixture diffusing into the crack opening leads to a small reduction of the system potential energy at an initial stage of subcritical growth; (4) The crack tip appears to be sharper in both dry CO2 and wet CO2 environments, albeit at a lower stress intensity factor than the vacuum case. The atomistic scale findings provide new insights on the process of subcritical calcite cracking induced by a reactive environment via CO2 injection, prior to the damage-enhanced dissolution phase.

Abstract Stabilizing climate requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in land or ocean systems. Soil management practices can reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester atmospheric CO2 into inorganic and organic forms. However, whether soil carbon strategies represent a viable and impactful climate mitigation pathway is uncertain. A specific question concerns the role that land-management practices and soil amendments can play in realizing California’s ambition for carbon neutrality by 2045. Here we examine the carbon flux impacts of soil conservation (i.e., compost, reduced tillage, cover crop) and enhanced silicate rock weathering (EW) practices at different areal extents of implementation in cropland, grassland, and savanna in California under two climate change cases. We show that with implementation areas of 15% or 50% of private cultivated land, grassland, and savanna in California, soil conservation practices alone can contribute 〖1.4〗_0.7^2.1 % ( -〖1.8〗_(-0.9)^(-2.7) Mt CO2eq y-1) and 〖4.6〗_2.3^6.9 % (〖-6.0〗_(-3.0)^(-8.9) Mt CO2eq y-1) of the additional emissions reduction needed (beyond previous targets) to meet the 2045 net neutrality goal (-129.3 Mt CO2eq y-1), respectively, on an average annual basis, including climate uncertainty. Including EW in these scenarios increases the total contributions of management practices to 〖4.1〗_2.5^5.6 % (〖-5.2〗_(-3.2)^(-7.3) Mt CO2eq y-1) and 〖13.5〗_8.2^18.6 % (〖-17.5〗_(-10.7)^(-24.2) Mt CO2eq y-1), respectively, of this reduction. This highlights that the extent of implementation area is a major factor in determining benefits and that EW has the potential to make a real contribution to net reduction targets. Results are similar across climate cases, indicating that contemporary field data can be used to make future projections. With EW there remains mechanistic uncertainties, however, such as rock dissolution rate and environmental controls on weathering products, which require additional field research to improve understanding of the technological efficacy of this approach for California’s 2045 carbon neutrality goal.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) miscible fracturing huff-and-puff technology now plays a pivotal role in enhancing crude oil recovery rates, particularly in reservoirs with challenging physical properties, strong water sensitivity, high injection pressure, and complex water-injection dynamics. In this study, the oil-increasing mechanism and huff-and-puff effect of CO2 miscible fracturing fluid are investigated through a comprehensive experimental approach. Specifically, experiments on PVT gas injection expansion, minimum miscible pressure, and CO2 miscible fracturing fluid huff and puff are conducted on the G fault block reservoir of the J Oilfield. The experimental findings demonstrate that injecting CO2 into reservoirs leads to an expansion in oil volume, a reduction in viscosity, and an increase in saturation pressure. Crude oil extraction is further enhanced by the addition of solubilizers and viscosity reducers. The use of solubilizers not only increases oil recovery rates but also reduces the minimum miscible pressure required for effective CO2 dispersion. We also found that shut-in times, permeability, and the huff-and-puff method used all have considerable impacts on huff-and-puff recovery rates. This study offers valuable technical insights, supporting the application of CO2 miscible fracturing huff-and-puff technology to enhance oil recovery rates in low-permeability reservoirs.

The development of synthetic microorganisms that could use one-carbon compounds, such as carbon dioxide, methanol, or formate, has received considerable interest. In this study, we engineered Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to both synthetic methylotrophy and formatotrophy, enabling them to co-utilize methanol or formate with CO2 fixation through a synthetic C1-compound assimilation pathway (MFORG pathway). This pathway consisted of a methanol-formate oxidation module and the reductive glycine pathway. We first assembled the MFORG pathway in P. pastoris using endogenous enzymes, followed by blocking the native methanol assimilation pathway, modularly engineering genes of MFORG pathway, and compartmentalizing the methanol oxidation module. These modifications successfully enabled the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris to utilize both methanol and formate. We then introduced the MFORG pathway from P. pastoris into the model yeast S. cerevisiae, establishing the synthetic methylotrophy and formatotrophy in this organism. The resulting strain could also successfully utilize both methanol and formate with consumption rates of 20 mg/L/h and 36.5 mg/L/h, respectively. The ability of the engineered P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae to co-assimilate CO2 with methanol or formate through the MFORG pathway was also confirmed by 13C-tracer analysis. Finally, production of 5-aminolevulinic acid and lactic acid by co-assimilating methanol and CO2 was demonstrated in the engineered P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae. This work indicates the potential of the MFORG pathway in developing different hosts to use various one-carbon compounds for chemical production.

Synthetic ammonia production sustains food production for more than half of the world’s population. Many regional ammonia plants convert all ammonia to ammonium nitrate fertiliser. With these, all carbon in the feed ends up as carbon dioxide (CO2), with around 2 tonnes of CO2 released per tonne of ammonia produced using natural gas. Conveniently, ammonia plants produce a substantial pre-concentrated CO2 stream. Ammonia plants are high-capex, long-life assets that operate for 40+ years. With the energy transition, replacing such assets is very high cost and will dramatically impact the cost of food production. Further, green energy is highly variable, leading to the need for additional supply side assets to stabilise energy supply. This paper outlines a transition approach for a 30% CO2 reduction (also a 43% case) to extend the useful life of these assets while re-using much of the plant, with the ability to turn on/off the green energy with minimal disruption for stable operation. The example plant is based on a typical 750 tpd ammonia gas Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) plant. The approach considers adding and integrating green power and biogas into this plant to reduce net reportable CO2 emissions. Methanation of CO2 has been demonstrated in several projects and is considered key in developing a transition pathway for an existing gas-based plant, extending its operational life and flexibility to operate with varying degrees of variable green energy supply. Further, whilst Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) is used in this case, the approach can be beneficially applied with methanol and other Power-to-X opportunities.

The liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector relies extensively on gas turbines for on-site power generation and to drive refrigeration compressors. They provide an efficient and reliable energy source for LNG operations in remote locations. With upcoming changes to the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia, there is an increased focus on Scope 1 emissions, so management and targeted reduction are a priority to reduce liabilities. Despite technology advancements, gas turbines remain one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in LNG production facilities. Also, in Australia, many facilities are not grid-connected, meaning that displacement of Scope 1 emissions through renewable electricity sourcing is a challenge. To develop deeper cuts in Scope 1 emissions, one solution is to deploy post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) on existing gas turbines, with the potential to reduce associated emissions by over 90%. Globally, a number of LNG facilities are already deploying CCS to permanently store reservoir CO2 from the LNG processing trains. Several Australian LNG facilities are located in close proximity to potential CO2 storage reservoirs, meaning that a coordinated approach to both reservoir and post-combustion CO2 should be considered when sizing pipelines, shipping systems and storage wells to optimise and leverage the required investment. This paper outlines the technological, economic and policy aspects of integrating both reservoir post-combustion CCS on LNG facilities, including barriers and opportunities for deployment. It will discuss new developments and enablers for CCS to be more widely deployed at LNG production sites.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical component of proposed pathways to limit global warming, though considerable upscaling is required to meet emissions reduction targets. Quantifying and managing the risks of fault reactivation is a leading barrier to scaling global CCS projects from current levels of ~40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide(CO2) per year (to target levels of several gigatonnes of CO2 per year), because CO2 injection into reservoirs can result in increased pore-fluid pressure and temperature changes, which can reduce the strength of rocks and faults and induce brittle failure. This can result in induced seismicity, whilst hydraulic fracturing of seals could provide pathways for CO2 leakage. Consequently, identifying favourable geomechanical conditions (typically determined through data on pre-injection rock stress, mechanical and elastic properties, and pore-fluid pressures) to minimise deformation of reservoirs and seals represents a key challenge in the selection of safe and effective sites for CCS projects. Critically, however, such geomechanical data are typically spatially limited (i.e. restricted to wells) and mainly consist of pre-injection crustal stress orientation measurements, rather than a full 3D description of the stress tensor and related geomechanical properties. This paper reviews some key geomechanical issues and knowledge gaps (particularly those associated with data availability and limitations) that need to be understood to enable successful reservoir and seal management for CCS projects. We also highlight recent advances in multi-scale and dimensional geomechanical modelling approaches that can be used to assess sites for the secure storage of CO2 as well as other gases, including hydrogen.

Global warming has evolved into a global environmental concern. Despite the significant impact of rivers on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there remains a lack of wide quantification of emissions at high temporal resolution. This research investigated the characteristics of the CO2 exchange flux (FCO2) and CH4 exchange flux (FCH4) at the interface of water and gas, as well as the primary determinants that impact these fluxes, at both the seasonal and 24-h scales, in the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River (IMYR). FCO2 was 52.52 ± 78.26 mmol·m−2·d−1 in summer, which was higher than autumn (30.81 ± 51.24 mmol·m−2·d−1) and spring (-96.09 ± 264.31 mmol·m−2·d−1). FCH4 peaked in summer (928.45 ± 513.31 μmol·m−2·d−1) and declined in the fall (326.76 ± 576.31 μmol·m−2·d−1). The lowest FCH4 was recorded in spring (61.75 ± 190.26 μmol·m−2·d−1). Wind speed (WS) and organic carbon mineralisation were the primary determinants of FCO2 at the seasonal scale, whereas temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the primary determinants of FCH4. Monitoring FCO2 and FCH4 at night revealed higher average levels than during the day. FCO2 was regulated by levels of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total phosphorus (TP) levels over a 24-h period, whereas FCH4 was regulated by levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) and total nitrogen (TN). Throughout the majority of the time period, the IMYR river segment emits carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Due to the fact that emission patterns and driving mechanisms of riverine CO2 and CH4 differ across time scales, it is necessary to conduct more precise observations with high spatial and temporal resolution in order to acquire the most reliable data and comprehend more targeted approaches to carbon emission reduction.

The respective Federal petroleum and greenhouse-gas (GHG) storage legislation was examined in detail to understand the interactions between the technical requirements in the legislation, the overarching emissions-policy framework and the existing and likely future technical capabilities of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry. Key elements of the GHG legislation were then stress-tested using CCS project examples to determine applicability. The number of CCS projects required to meet the nation’s emission reduction targets over the next 5–25 years is high (probably between 20–40 projects of 4 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa)), but the existing 8–10 year approvals timeline provides only a maximum of 2.5 full project cycles to undertake 20–40 projects, a goal not considered possible without substantial regulatory reform. Opportunities for improvement should focus on facilitating a robust and rapid CCS project rollout and could include the following: changing the legislation to facilitate the accelerated utilisation of depleted petroleum fields to storage facilities, including allowing the progressive expansion of the awarded injection licence (IL); changing the concept of containment to emphasise carbon dioxide (CO2) plume management via assessing risk and potential impacts, not by artificial constraints into GHG permits and licences; including unitisation and combination pathways in the GHG legislation; ‘CO2 plume’ is not defined in legislation, even though the spatial location of a plume is central to numerous approvals, such as declaration of storage, demonstrating containment and all measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) programs; developing a framework to manage future CCS project interactions at a basin scale, as is undertaken in groundwater management onshore.

In the face of increasing demand for hydrogen, a feasibility study is conducted on its production by using Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), especially from wind and solar sources, with the latter preferring photovoltaic technology. The analysis performed is based on climate data for the Province of Brindisi, Apulia, Italy. The various types of electrolyzers will be analyzed, ultimately choosing the one that best suits the case study under consideration. The technical aspect of the land consumption for RER exploitation until 2050 is analyzed for the Italian case of study and for the Apulia Region. For both the 200 MW and 100 MW RER Power Plants, an economic analysis is carried out on the opportunities for using hydrogen. In the last part of the economic analysis, the trade-off between the high specific investment cost and the Capacity Factor of Wind technologies is also investigated. The results show the affordability of building high-scale Wind Farms, harnessing the existing scale economies. The lowest Hydrogen selling price is achieved by the 200 MW Wind Farms equal to 222 €/MWh against 232 €/MWh of the 200 MW Photovoltaic (PV) Farm. Finally, the feasibility analysis considers also the greenhouse gas emission reduction by including in the economic analysis the carbon dioxide (CO2) Average Auction Clearing Price leading for the 200 MW Wind Farms to a hydrogen selling price equal to 191.2 €/MWh against 201 €/MWh of the 200 MW Photovoltaic Farm.

For over 50 years Gippsland Basin Joint Venture (GBJV) has been producing oil and gas from the Gippsland Basin. Through hard work, challenging the status quo and innovation, the business, the operation and the people have been on a transformational journey. You may have heard about our conventional expansion opportunities, Kipper-Tuna-Turrum development and Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, but have you heard about how GBJV is progressing carbon dioxide (CO2) to sales with BOC and Air Liquide or how the team has reduced flare by 46% since 2018? Have you heard how the team increased Longford’s capacity by 11% in 2022 to deliver the highest gas production since 2017 to meet market demand. Or about how we are transforming the operation through our Gippsland Asset Streamlining Project, where we will no longer have a Crude Stabilisation Plant or a Gas Plant 1 at Longford? We continue to focus on our reliable gas operation through upcoming projects such as Hastings Generation Project, and Kipper Compression Project while also pursuing meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions such as South East Australia Carbon Capture and Storage Project in the Gippsland Basin. Our transformation to a ‘Modern Australian Gas Business’ has not only meant change for our facilities but also change for our people in how we work and the culture we have built. Every day, our teams work to supply essential energy to Australian homes and businesses while also being on a transformational journey to improve the sustainability of our operation and contribute to the energy transition.

Abstract: In upcoming years , a lot of construction is going to happen leading to more cement consumption and more GHG’s emissions by default as an embodied carbon. Reduction of cement consumption is possible by partially repacing it with biochar which is a by-product of pyrolysis of biomass or adding it as an additive in cement mortar and concrete for carbon sequestration. Biochar is effective in carbon sequestration activity and results in high water and carbon dioxide holding capacity. Increase in biochar lead to increase in carbon sequestration . As pozzolanic activity lead to strength gaining characteristics and durability of concrete, this study focusses on investigating pozzolanic activity of biochar. Biomass considered in this study were walnut shells and pretreatment was done with 0.1 N HCl and and pozzolanic activity is checked by chapelle test by observing Ca(OH)2 fixation during the titration. It was observed that increase in temperature or Normality of HCl in pretreatment does not enhance pozzolanic activity of biochar . Hence pretreatment with 0.1 N HCl at room temperature for an hour is sufficient to enhance the pozzolanic activity of biochar with much high carbon dioxide sorption as compared to usual concrete without compromising with the strength of concrete. This study reclaims the potential use of biochar in concrete is reliable for carbon sequestration.

Globally many countries have committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and their dependence on fossil fuels with most large emitting countries now committing to ‘net-zero’ targets sometime in the second half of this century and earlier intermediate targets in 2030. With only 6 years to go until the deadline to meet 2030 emission reduction targets, what is the verdict? How are Australian and global emission reduction projects tracking? World electricity demand in 2022 was 28,500 TWh with 39.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted in the same year as a result. The global energy mix hasn’t changed much: fossil fuel consumption as a percentage of primary energy in 2022 remained steady at 82% and in July 2023 the International Energy Agency projected 2023 oil demand to be 102.1 million barrels a day, an all-time high. This paper will take a look at decarbonisation efforts around the world and provide an overview of what was targeted in previous years and compare it with what has actually been achieved. How far are we truly on the road to decarbonisation? Are decarbonisation initiatives including carbon capture, utilisation and storage, hydrogen projects, solar and wind farms providing the intended results? Incorporating recent key regulatory initiatives from governments around the world including the US, Australia and the EU, this paper will outline progress to date and attempt to show possible paths going forward in answering the question whether it is possible to achieve the proposed emission reduction targets in 6 years.

Purpose – Addressing the imperative of sustainable development and environmental conservation, this study investigates the intricate relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and annual fossil fuel subsidies in Slovenia and North Macedonia. Methodology/Approach – Utilizing regression analysis aligned with the indicators of the twelfth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), we discern trends in sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and total suspended particulate matter emissions. Findings – For every billion dollars in subsidies, North Macedonia experiences an average annual reduction of 40.073 kilotons in carbon dioxide emissions, while Slovenia sees an increase of 6.999.431 kilotons per year. The results point out the negative impact fossil fuel subsidies have on the environment by making fossil fuels more affordable, thus warranting further regulation by lowering or eliminating this type of subsidy. Implications – The implications address the need for research advancement and enhanced SDG reporting in North Macedonia, coupled with a demand for improved environmental indicators in Slovenia. Policymakers can leverage these findings for air pollution regulation, and managers can champion socially responsible practices for a green economy. Originality/Value – This study fills a critical gap in the literature regarding cross-country comparisons in this area, identified through a Scopus database search.

Two structurally distinct and biologically privileged succinimide and isoindole heteroarenes bearing benzothiadiazinedioxide motif-centered hybrid conjugates are proficiently achieved through Rh(III)-catalyzed sequential C(sp2)–H bond activation, ortho-alkenylation and finally cascade intramolecular cyclization. The significant feature of this developed protocol is that the resulting diversely decorated heterocycles contain a quaternary carbon center and this has been coursed through atypical [4 + 1] annulation ignoring the prevalent [4 + 2]-cyclization pathway and interestingly the applied coupling partners (e.g., maleimide, maleate, and styrene) to materialize the protocol functioned only as C1 synthon. Furthermore, the selective reduction strategy enables to modify the hybrid conjugate of succinimide and benzothiazine dioxide to benzothiazine dioxide-based spirocyclic isoindolopyrrolidinedione skeleton following preferential reduction of one carbonyl group of imide functionality. Overall this methodology emerges to be easily handled, versatile, time-efficient, and manifests relatively unfamiliar spiro-cyclization and good functional group tolerance so easy to grab a library of the entirely new variant of decorated hybrid spiro-heterocyclic scaffolds.

Electrochemical reactions are those that occur on the surface of a charged catalyst, including carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction in total hydrolyzed water, anode fuel oxidation reaction, and cathode oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells and so on. Usually, active sites of these catalysts used in the aforementioned electrochemical reactions are noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Ru, which are limited by high cost and low reserves. In comparison, transition metals with low cost and high reserves are gradually used in these electrochemical fields, and have the potential to replace common noble metal catalytic materials. As a typical transition metal, copper is not the best choice as active site in catalysts for electrochemical reactions, but its properties offer unique characteristics in different electrochemical reactions. For example, in CO2RR process, moderate adsorption capacity of CO intermediates on Cu active site promotes the formation of a carbon-carbon bond, which will increase the proportion of multi-carbon products. In other electrochemical reactions, the use of copper can affect the electronic structure of other transition metal active sites to improve the catalytic capacity. Therefore, this chapter gives an overview of the application of copper used as active site or dopant in the field of electrochemistry.

Abstract In order to comply with the trend of global climate change, countries are gradually promoting energy conservation and emission reduction, and prefabricated buildings have become one of the main paths for the construction industry to develop towards carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. This paper takes the box-shaped column flange connection achieved by plug welding-core sleeve in the dormitory building of Tongzhou Campus of the Affiliated High School of Capital Normal University in China as the research object. Based on the consumption quota of prefabricated construction projects and the actual project quantity, the carbon emissions of steel structure column connection joints at different phases are calculated by the emission factor method, and it is proposed that the production consumption of building materials plays a key role in energy conservation and emission reduction. This paper concludes that the box-shaped column flange connection achieved by plug welding-core sleeve in the construction phase of an assembled steel building emits 49.5% less carbon dioxide than a conventional full fusion-welded joint. And the reason for the high carbon emissions of the latter is mainly from the amount of materials and machinery required for full penetration welding. It further affirms the green and environmental protection effect of the assembled steel structure plug welding-core sleeve flange connection joint in actual projects, and provides a reference for related research.

Abstract The unavoidable and unpredictable surface reconstruction of metallic copper (Cu) during the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction process is a double‐edged sword affecting the production of high‐value‐added hydrocarbon products. It is crucial to control the surface facet reconstruction and regulate the targeted facets/facet interfaces, and further understand the mechanism between activity/selectivity and the reconstructed structure of Cu for CO 2 reduction. Based on the current catalyst design methods, a facile strategy combining chemical reduction and electro‐reduction is proposed to achieve specified Cu(111) facets and the Cu(110)/(111) interfaces in reconstructed Cu derived from cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O). The surface facet reconstruction significantly boosted the electrocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into multi‐carbon (C 2+ ) products comparing to the unmodified catalyst. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the Cu(110)/(111)s interface between Cu(110) and a small amount of Cu(111) can tailor the reaction routes and lower the reaction energy barrier of C–C coupling to ethylene (C 2 H 4 ). The work will guide the surface facets reconstruction strategy for Cu‐based CO 2 electrocatalysts, providing a promising paradigm to understand the structural variation in catalysts.

Since 1999 successive Australian Commonwealth governments have provided direct funding for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects, notably the carbon capture and storage (CCS) Flagships Fund (Rudd government, 2009). The most recent CCUS Hubs and Technologies Fund (Morrison government, 2022) was later revoked (Albanese government, 2022) marking a shift from direct funding (‘carrot’) to emission reduction through a strengthening of the Safeguard Mechanism, the introduction of a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, and the establishment of the Net Zero Authority (‘stick’). Reports such as the ‘Net Zero Mobilisation Report’, have delineated the need for, and size of, the role of CCUS in Australia, especially for hard-to-abate sectors and the report states ‘private investment in a CCUS industry requires targeted government support’ i.e. funding. As government focus moves from direct funding support for CCS to CCU and direct air capture (DAC), the development of underground geological storage of carbon dioxide will be largely left to fossil fuel emitters, especially large liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies, reflected in current Western Australian government policy (Cook government, 2023) to develop CCS strategy as part of the LNG Jobs Taskforce. The only current exception is CarbonNet, operated by the Victorian government and one of the early CCS Flagship funded projects.

In the contemporary tramp shipping industry, route optimization and scheduling are directly linked to enhancements in operations, economics, and the environment, making them key factors for the effective management of maritime transportation. To enhance effective ship-to-cargo matching and the refinement of maritime transportation itineraries, this paper introduces a time efficiency and carbon dioxide emission multi-objective optimization algorithm named ETE-SRSP (efficiency–time–emission multi-optimization algorithm). ETE-SRSP incorporates several factors, including the initial positions of ships, time windows for loading and unloading operations, and varying sailing speeds. Within the ETE-SRSP framework, pioneering an approach that integrates ballast and laden sailing velocities as decisional parameters, it employs a multi-objective optimization technique to investigate the intricate interplay between temporal efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the model’s proficiency in mitigating emissions and managing costs is clearly demonstrated through the optimization of these objectives, thereby offering a robust framework for decision support. The experimental results show that the optimal sailing speeds derived from the ETE-SRSP, under typical time-weight scenarios, can achieve an optimal balance between emission reduction and cost control. In summary, this study underscores the optimization strategy’s potential to effectively address the maritime sector’s need for economic growth and ecological conservation, showcasing its practical value in the industry.

Abstract As a result of electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), value-added chemicals like as synthetic fuels and chemical feedstocks can be produced. In the current state of the art, copper-based materials are most widely used being the most effective catalysts for this reaction. It is still necessary to improve the reaction rate and product selectivity of CuOx for electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The main objective of this work was synthesized and evaluate the copper oxide electrocatalyst combined with silver (CuO 70% Ag 30%) for the conversion of carbon dioxide into synthetic fuels. The catalysts have been prepared by the oxalate method and assessed in a flow cell system. The results of electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature and at different potentials (-1.05 V–0.75 V vs. RHE in presence of 0.1 M KHCO 3 ) and gas and liquid chromatographic analysis are summarized. The CuOx-based electrodes demonstrated the selective of ~ 25% at -0.55 V for formic acid (HCOOH) and over CuO -Ag and selective of ethylene at ~ 20% over CuOx at -1.05 V. Other products were formed as ethylene, ethanol, and propanol (C 2 H 4 , EtOH, PrOH) at more positive potentials. On the other hand, carbon monoxide, acetate, ethylene glycol, propinaldehyde, glycoaldehyde and glyoxal (CO, CH 3 COO, C 2 H 6 O 2 , C 3 H 6 O, C 2 H 4 O 2 , C 2 H 2 O 2 ) have been formed and detected. Based on the results of these studies, it appears that the formation of synthetic fuels from CO 2 at room temperature in alkaline environment can be very promising.

Abstract Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance in various catalytic reactions. However, the low metal loading (<1.0 wt.%) and the difficulty in precisely modulating their coordination configurations hinder the practical yield of target products and the understanding of actual reaction mechanisms. To overcome these obstacles, a series of strategies are proposed to design SACs with a precise coordination configuration and/or a high density of active sites. For an insightful and comprehensive understanding of these strategies, it is worth analyzing and categorizing them according to their intrinsic mechanisms and applicational perspectives. In this review, the synthesis strategies of precise and/or high‐density SACs are first summarized. Moreover, taking typical electrochemical processes, including oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction, metal–sulfur batteries, etc., as examples, the applications of these SACs are discussed, focusing on their advantages in enhancing the yield of target products, improving the efficiency of energy storage, and revealing the unique effects. Finally, the challenges and perspective of precise modulation and densification of metal sites for SACs are proposed. It is expected that this review can provide a useful reference for the design and preparation of high‐density and/or controllably coordinated SACs.

Developing land use strategies to optimize carbon sinks and improve carbon footprints involves proposing efficient nature-based solutions that industries and businesses can implement while considering financial and legislative constraints. The pulp and paper industry is associated with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily due to the substantial carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) footprint of its mills. Also, some forestry operations contribute to the release of carbon to the atmosphere in the form of CO 2 and methane (CH 4 ). Conversely, this industry could potentially be a significant ally in the fight against climate change by favoring forestry practices that reduce carbon emissions and increase its sequestration, namely, by adding value to industrial by-products (e.g., biosolids) instead of treating them as wastes and landfilling them. Notably, the pulp and paper industry has been seeking alternative uses of its by-products, such as fertilizers to maximize tree growth. In this paper, we identify opportunities and challenges that exist for the pulp and paper industry in regard to recycling industrial by-products to: 1) lower GHG emissions directly at the mill and 2) improve its GHG budget by increasing carbon sequestration in forests and plantations. We illustrate our analyses by describing a case study of a pulp and paper mill in southern Quebec, Canada, that uses its biosolids and other by-products as fertilizers. This case study highlights that this strategy could not only contribute to the reduction of GHGs but could also create added value and improve economic returns of forest operations.

The rapid growth of the digital economy has heightened concerns over its environmental impacts, particularly in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast to previous studies that focus on the positive effects of digital technology on reducing carbon emissions, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the various factors that influence digital economy carbon emissions and their interrelationships, using the system dynamics method to simulate and predict China’s future digital economy carbon emission baseline from 2016 to 2046. Four different scenarios were established by adjusting parameters for the percentage of the digital economy, e-waste growth rate, and data center power consumption. The simulation results indicate the following: (1) The baseline scenario shows China’s digital economy carbon emissions peaking at 1.9045 billion tons in 2041 after an initial increase and subsequent decrease. (2) Single-policy simulations indicate that changing the digital economy’s scale and e-waste growth independently leads to peak emissions of 1.9205 billion tons and 1.5525 billion tons, respectively. Adjusting data center power consumption has a greater impact, increasing the peak emissions to 2.1675 billion tons, a 13.82% rise from the baseline. (3) Under the comprehensive regulation scenario, emissions peak in 2040 at 2.0813 billion tons, considering the interactions between the digital economy, data center power, and e-waste. Based on the findings, we recommend fostering innovation in the digital industry, enhancing the e-waste treatment process, strategically developing digital infrastructure, and exploring effective carbon reduction strategies for the digital economy aimed at supporting China in achieving its dual-carbon goals.

In today’s climate-conscious world, companies across the globe continue to push to optimise energy use and reduce or eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions. Investments aimed at emission monitoring and reduction are driven by the need to optimise consumption of electricity, gas, oil, and water to meet emissions reduction targets and sustainability goals. Tracking and reducing emissions can improve process uptime through predictive maintenance and reduce product losses across the process. Methane emissions are in particular focus as methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated that a third of methane emissions in North America come from the industrial sector, and similar figures come from the European Commission. It is no wonder that government and industry are laser-focussed on improving their approach to the reduction of methane emissions. As companies drive their own corporate standards to achieve net zero emissions, there is also a need to comply with existing and upcoming governmental emissions standards and regulations, and report emissions on a periodic basis. The trend to move fugitive emissions monitoring from periodic to continuous provides operators with a greater insight into emissions sources which drives efficiencies through the reduction of lost product and a more predictive approach to maintenance. Investors are increasingly focussed on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting and favouring companies that can demonstrate strong ESG performance. Fugitive emission leaks can translate into billions of dollars of lost productivity annually, and serious occupational accidents.

Photochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) using molecular transition metal complexes as catalysts has been previously documented to proceed via either of the two mechanisms: CO2 insertion into metal hydride bonds, or hydrogenation of CO2. We present herein photoreduction of CO2 to HCOOH that adopts both these pathways by a single monometallic molecular catalyst featuring earth-abundant cobalt - a characteristic not observed in other molecular catalysts for CO2 photoreduction to date. This dual functionality stems from distinctly different, active forms of the catalyst, at different temporal stages of irradiation. We employ in situ NMR spectroscopy to monitor potential catalytic intermediates at various time points of irradiation by visible light. These observed states align with the kinetic profiles of product evolution, proving instrumental in revealing the catalyst's unique behavior. We advocate for the integration of such in situ NMR monitoring in future studies as it provides a valuable tool for an informed design of photochemical CO2 reduction by molecular catalysts.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the primary drivers of global climate change. Human activities, particularly those related to energy production, transportation, and industry, have long contributed to the escalating levels of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere. Recognizing the significance of this issue, universities, including Thammasat University, play a vital role in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions research and education, carrying a responsibility to address the matter. This study is aimed aims to assess the greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation measures at Thammasat University (Lampang campus), Thailand. The emissions are categorized into 3 types: (1) direct GHG emissions; (2) energy-related indirect GHG emissions; and (3) other indirect GHG emissions. Activity data from the years 2019 to 2022 was used for the calculations, resulting in GHG emissions of 1051.70, 778.28, 558.64, and 1034.531 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Among these emissions, energy-related indirect GHG emissions from electricity purchases represent the majority, accounting for approximately 78.55% of the total emissions. Consequently, implementing mitigation strategies, such as solar panel installations and solid waste reduction (combined scenario), has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by up to 57.78%. Furthermore, the university should actively promote GHG emissions reduction through the enactment of energy-saving policies and the adoption of energy-efficient technologies to reduce reliance on energy purchases.

Abstract: In the ever-evolving realm of urban transportation, the fusion of technological advancements and ubiquitous mobile connectivity has sparked a paradigm shift in how cities are navi- gated. This shift has led to innovative approaches in ridesharing and crowdsourcing, offering promising solutions to tackle traffic congestion, reduce emissions, and prioritize travel needs in urbanareas. Unlike traditional carpooling methods, where arrange-ments are made in advance, ridesharing in smart cities operates on real-time matching of drivers and riders, with priority given to factors such as destination and purpose.This study delves into the intricate dynamics of ridesharing and crowdsourcing for smart city transportation, investigating the complex interplay between technology and social factors.Additionally, it considers aspects of security, policy, and pricing strategies to ensure a seamlessand equitable experience for all stakeholders.Drawing insights from comprehensive case studies and practical implementations, this exploration highlights the advantages of ridesharing and crowdsourcing, including the reduction of carbon dioxide emis- sions and the prioritization of travel needs based on purpose. It offers guidance for stakeholders navigating the complexities and embracing the transformative potential of these innovative solutions in shaping the future of urban mobility.

Abstract Modelling of the co-electrolysis process requires understanding of the underlying reaction pathways under H2/H2O/CO/CO2-atmospheres. These include the electrochemical steam reduction/hydrogen oxidation, the electrochemical CO2 reduction/CO oxidation and their coupling via the catalytic (reverse) water gas shift reaction ((R)WGS). The assumption of a very fast RWGS and therefore neglectable electrochemical CO2 conversion is commonly used to model the co-electrolysis process. In contrast, previous studies on Ni/GDC fuel electrodes suggest that the electrochemical conversion of CO / CO2 can be present in H2/H2O/CO/CO2-atmospheres. To deconvolute surface-related and non-surface-related processes in the impedance response we present results from a complex variation of operating parameters for process identification by the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the subsequent impedance analysis by the distribution of relaxation times. A physically meaningful equivalent circuit model, based on a single channel transmission line, is then derived. The model enables quantification of the surface reaction resistance under varied C/H-ratios. From a kinetic analysis it is shown that the electrochemical H2/H2O conversion is dominant for y_CO+y_(CO_2 )≤ 50% and electrochemical CO/CO2-conversion onsets from y_CO+y_(CO_2 )≥ 60%.

Continuing a comprehensive study of the reduction of COx over supported Ru catalysts, we explored the interaction of CO2 with Ru/g-Al2O3 by TAP reactor measurements, focusing on dynamic aspects in adsorption/desorption, reaction and oxygen exchange processes. Pulse shape analysis in H2/CO2 multipulse sequences provides information on the interaction of reactant/product species with the catalyst. The measurements provide information on the dynamic build-up of reaction intermediates and more stable adspecies during pulsing, and its relation to CH4 formation. Facile oxygen exchange between CO2 and catalyst, followed by isotope labelling experiments, is quantitatively reconciled in a simple model, relating the ratio between different CO2 isotopologues to the 18O : 16O ratio in the total exchangeable oxygen on the surface and in the CO2 pulse. The results provide detailed insight into various aspects of the interaction between CO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts important for a mechanistic understanding of various catalytic reactions involving CO2.

In an exploration of environmental concerns, this groundbreaking research delves into the relationship between GDP per capita, coal rents, forest rents, mineral rents, oil rents, natural gas rents, fossil fuels, renewables, environmental tax and environment-related technologies on CO2 emissions in 30 highly emitting countries from 1995 to 2021 using instrumental-variables regression Two-Stage least squares (IV-2SLS) regression and two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimates. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions across all quantiles, showcasing an EKC with diminishing marginal effects. Coal rents exhibit a statistically significant negative relationship with emissions, particularly in higher quantiles, and mineral rents show a negative association with CO2 emissions in lower and middle quantiles, reinforcing the idea of resource management in emissions reduction. Fossil fuels exert a considerable adverse impact on emissions, with a rising effect in progressive quantiles. Conversely, renewable energy significantly curtails CO2 emissions, with higher impacts in lower quantiles. Environmental tax also mitigates CO2 emissions. Environment-related technologies play a pivotal role in emission reduction, particularly in lower and middle quantiles, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to different emission levels and leveraging diverse strategies for sustainable development.

Clathrate hydrates are crystals formed by guest molecules that stabilize cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Whereas thermodynamic equilibrium is well described via the van der Waals and Platteeuw approach, the increasing concerns with global warming and energy transition require extending the knowledge to non-equilibrium conditions in multiphase, sheared systems, in a multiscale framework. Potential macro-applications concern the storage of carbon dioxide in the form of clathrates, and the reduction of hydrate inhibition additives currently required in hydrocarbon production. We evidence porous mesomorphologies as key to bridging the molecular scales to macro-applications of low solubility guests. We discuss the coupling of molecular ordering with the mesoscales, including (i) the emergence of porous patterns as a combined factor from the walk over the free energy landscape and 3D competitive nucleation and growth and (ii) the role of molecular attachment rates in crystallization–diffusion models that allow predicting the timescale of pore sealing. This is a perspective study that discusses the use of discrete models (molecular dynamics) to build continuum models (phase field models, crystallization laws, and transport phenomena) to predict multiscale manifestations at a feasible computational cost. Several advances in correlated fields (ice, polymers, alloys, and nanoparticles) are discussed in the scenario of clathrate hydrates, as well as the challenges and necessary developments to push the field forward.

In light of growing environmental concerns, the reduction of CO2 emissions is increasingly vital. Particularly in the construction industry, a major contributor to global carbon emissions, addressing this issue is critical for environmental sustainability and mitigating the accelerating impacts of climate change. This study proposes the Optimal Green Design Model for Mega Structures (OGDMM) to optimise CO2 emissions, cost-effectiveness, and serviceability in highrise buildings with mega structures. The OGDMM examines the impact of each material and structural design of main members on these three critical aspects. Analytical results for high-rise buildings (120–200 m, slenderness ratio: 2.0–8.0) demonstrate that OGDMM can reduce CO2 emissions and costs by an average of 4.67% and 3.97%, respectively, without compromising serviceability. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, this study introduces five new evaluation indicators encompassing environmental, economic, and serviceability performances of high-rise buildings. Based on these criteria, optimised structural designs for high-rise buildings are classified into four categories according to slenderness ratio, leading to the formulation of corresponding design guidelines. The model’s applicability is further validated through its application to a 270-m-tall high-rise building in Korea, showing reductions in CO2 emissions and costs by 8.99% and 18.50%, respectively, while maintaining structural serviceability.

Previous studies on future scenarios identified two key effects of increasing CO2 on the African summer monsoon (ASM): Rising CO2 leads to an enhancement in moisture supply, favoring an increase in ASM precipitation (the thermodynamic effect). However, it also results in a weakening in mean atmospheric flow, thus facilitating a dryness across the ASM region (the dynamic effect). Therefore, the ultimate change in ASM precipitation stems from the balance of both the thermodynamic and dynamic effects. This study further examines the impact of rising CO2 on ASM rainfall, by taking into account various climate states. Our results suggest that an increase in CO2 during warm interglacial periods has a stronger influence from thermodynamic factors than from dynamic factors, resulting in an enhancement in ASM rainfall. In contrast, if CO2 increases under cold glacial climate backgrounds, its dynamic impact dominates a reduction of rainfall in the ASM region.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is increasingly being recognized as an effective and promising technology to reutilize CO2 and convert it into high value-added products, which presents a viable pathway to actualize carbon neutrality. Owing to the distinct affinity of copper (Cu) to the key intermediates of CO2RR, Cu-based electrocatalysts are emerging as highly promising catalysts for producing multi-carbon (C2/2+) products through CO2RR. Notably, the deliberate design and advancement of Cu-based catalysts stand as pivotal factors in actualizing efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2. In this review, we first elucidate the reaction pathways of Cu-based electrocatalysts for the synthesis of C2/2+ products. Then, various strategies toward the regulation of the structure of Cu-based catalysts are summarized, aiming to disclose the "structure-performance relationship". Meanwhile, the important advances regarding the catalyst/electrolyte interface engineering as well as the electrolyte optimization toward improved C2/2+ production are also included. Lastly, the review concludes by critically summarizing both findings and perspectives and how this promising field might advance in the future.

ABSTRACT This paper examines the influence of shading devices in non-residential buildings on enhancing cooling loads, mitigating environmental impact, and reducing energy consumption in semi-arid climates. The focus is on educational buildings as part of Algeria's national strategy to enhance sustainability and decrease energy usage. To achieve this, a comparative analysis was conducted, encompassing both numerical and experimental assessments of the effects of four indoor shading techniques and three outdoor shading techniques. Subsequently, the impact of the optimal shading combination on four main orientations was evaluated using dynamic building simulation software. The outcomes demonstrate that the optimal combination of shading devices substantially affects cooling loads, leading to noteworthy energy savings and a reduction in CO2 emissions. Notably, these savings can reach up to 7% in cooling load reduction and up to 32% in energy and CO2 emission reductions. Furthermore, the study concludes that distinct design considerations should be tailored to climate attributes and building orientations to achieve maximal cooling load reductions. This research enriches the existing knowledge concerning the optimization of shading devices for educational buildings with a focus on cooling load reduction. The findings emphasize the necessity for architects, builders, and proprietors to incorporate passive design alternatives that align optimally with energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and overall building sustainability.

A Cu/Co tandem catalysis protocol was developed to conduct the hydroformylation of olefins using CO2/H2 and PMHS (polymethylhydrosiloxane) as a readily available and environmentally friendly hydride source. This methodology was performed via a two-step approach consisting of the copper-catalyzed reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane and subsequent cobalt-promoted hydroformylation with H2 and the in situ formed CO. The optimized triphos oxide ligand, which presumably facilitates the migratory insertion of CO gives moderate to excellent yields for both terminal and internal alkenes. This earth-abundant metal catalysis provides a reliable and efficient way to afford useful aldehydes in industry using silicon by-product PMHS as hydrogen source and renewable CO2 as carbonyl source.

Growing trend of air pollution has become one of the familiar environmental hazards for the society. It is a mixture of toxic compounds emerging from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Depending on the source and rate of emission the components of air pollution change dramatically. The primary human-made sources of air pollution may include vehicle emissions, natural gas to heat homes, fuel oils, and by-products of manufacturing and power generation and fumes from chemical production. In addition to that, various hazardous substances such as methane and other gases are released by decomposing organic matter in soils, and other gases include ash and smoke from volcanic eruptions, which are frequently caused by humans. Various reports around the world have consistently demonstrated that air pollution is a significant adaptable risk factor for enhanced mortality. Air pollutants can harm the health of humans, animals, plants, and buildings. The pollutants are in the form of gases, solid particles, or liquid droplets. Ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are some of the gaseous pollutants that contribute to air pollution. The pollution is now the leading environmental cause of premature death. Cardiovascular events such as acute ischemic account for the majority of the additional mortality caused by air pollution. Aside from increased mortality, air contamination is linked to significant reductions in worker productivity. Exposure to air pollution has a wide range of negative consequences on people's health. The effects of air pollution can be divided into short-term and long-term effects. The discomfort, such as irritation to the nose, eyes, throat or skin, as well as infections like bronchitis are short-term symptoms that are transient. It can also cause headaches, nausea and dizziness. The long-term effects of pollution can last for years and cause various respiratory diseases. Long-term damage to people's nerves, brains, kidneys, liver, and other organs, birth defects are the consequences of air pollution (Brook et al. 2004; Newby et al. 2015; Zivin and Neidell 2018; Hamanaka and Mutlu 2018).

Synergistic reduction of carbon emissions and air pollution is the core means to address the two major strategic tasks of fundamentally improving the ecological environment and the 'Dual-carbon target'. The issue of synergistic reduction at the provincial level needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Taking Henan Province, the largest economy in central China, as an example, this study uses environmentally extended input-output analysis and structural path analysis to identify the key sectors that contribute to CO2, SO2, and total particulate matter (TPM) emissions, and to sort out key emission pathways (e.g., Final Demand → Sector…). The results indicate that S2 (Mining of Fossil Energy), S10 (Nonmetal Mineral Products), S11 (Metal Smelting), S13 (Power and Heat) and S17 (Transportation) are mainly responsible for CO2, SO2, and TPM direct emissions on the production side, while S16 (Construction), S12 (Equipment) and S18 (Services) account for more than 45 % of CO2, SO2, and TPM embodied emissions on the consumption side. 32 shared emission pathways are extracted from the top 100 pathways for CO2, SO2, and TPM emissions, which account for 27 %-51 % of total emissions in Henan Province. P9 (Export → Nonmetal Mineral Products), P10 (Export → Metal Smelting) and P21 (Gross Capital Formation → Construction → Nonmetal Mineral Products) are the leading paths responsible for embodied emissions. The research results provide the foundation and guidance for well-designed mitigation policies, as well as a reference for better synergistic control in provinces facing similar situations.

Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) can efficiently utilize renewable energy to achieve efficient CO2 reduction and CH4 reforming for syngas production. In this work, a high-performance quasi-symmetric Ni-based electrolyzer with Ni–Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 (GDC) porous cathode and Ni–Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92 (YSZ) microchannel anode, is designed for efficient CO2 electrolysis and electrochemical oxidation of CH4. The electrolytic current density of SOEC reaches 3.2 A cm−2 at the voltage of 1.5 V for CH4-assisted CO2 electrolysis. Highly efficient and stable electrolysis of CO2 is achieved at the thin porous Ni-GDC cathode without external protective gases through the regulation of methane concentration and increasing the electrolysis current. The designed SOECs exhibits a stable operation for 400 h at a highly electrolysis current density of 2 A cm−2 without external protective gases and does not experience detrimental effects from the carbon deposits, despite the presence of a small amount of carbon deposits observed in the anode channels confirmed by the EDS analysis. This study has demonstrated that the design of quasi-symmetric Ni-ceramic electrolyzer is a highly efficient strategy for achieving electrochemical reforming of CH4 with CO2.

In this study, an integrated technology is proposed for the absorption and utilization of CO2 in alkanolamine solution for the preparation of BaCO3 in a high gravity environment. The effects of absorbent type, high gravity factor, gas/liquid ratio, and initial BaCl2 concentration on the absorption rate and amount of CO2 and the preparation of BaCO3 are investigated. The results reveal that the absorption rate and amount of CO2 follow the order of ethyl alkanolamine (MEA) > diethanol amine (DEA) > N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and thus MEA is the most effective absorbent for CO2 absorption. The absorption rate and amount of CO2 under high gravity are higher than that under normal gravity. Notably, the absorption rate at 75 min under high gravity is approximately 2 times that under normal gravity. This is because the centrifugal force resulting from the high-speed rotation of the packing can greatly increase gas-liquid mass transfer and micromixing. The particle size of BaCO3 prepared in the rotating packed bed is in the range of 57.2−89 nm, which is much smaller than that prepared in the bubbling reactor (>100.3 nm), and it also has higher purity (99.6 %) and larger specific surface area (14.119 m2/g). It is concluded that the high gravity technology has the potential to increase the absorption and utilization of CO2 in alkanolamine solution for the preparation of BaCO3. This study provides new insights into carbon emissions reduction and carbon utilization.

Abstract. The escalating climate crisis requires rapid action to reduce the concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and lower global surface temperatures. Methane will play a critical role in near-term warming due to its high radiative forcing and short atmospheric lifetime. Methane emissions have accelerated in recent years, and there is significant risk and uncertainty associated with the future growth in natural emissions. The largest natural sink of methane occurs through oxidation reactions with atmospheric hydroxyl and chlorine radicals. Enhanced atmospheric oxidation could be a potential approach to remove atmospheric methane. One method proposes the addition of iron salt aerosol (ISA) to the atmosphere, mimicking a natural process proposed to occur when mineral dust mixes with chloride from sea spray to form iron chlorides, which are photolyzed by sunlight to produce chlorine radicals. Under the right conditions, lofting ISA into the atmosphere could potentially reduce atmospheric methane concentrations and lower global surface temperatures. Recognizing that potential atmospheric methane removal must only be considered an additive measure – in addition to, not replacing, crucial anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission reductions and carbon dioxide removal – roadmaps can be a valuable tool to organize and streamline interdisciplinary and multifaceted research to efficiently move towards understanding whether an approach may be viable and socially acceptable or if it is nonviable and further research should be deprioritized. Here we present a 5-year research roadmap to explore whether ISA enhancement of the chlorine radical sink could be a viable and socially acceptable atmospheric methane removal approach.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to formate is an attractive carbon emissions mitigation strategy due to the existing market and attractive price for formic acid. Tin is an effective electrocatalyst for CO2R to formate, but the underlying reaction mechanism and whether the active phase of tin is metallic or oxidized during reduction is openly debated. In this report, we used grand-canonical density functional theory and attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to identify differences in the vibrational signatures of surface species during CO2R on fully metallic and oxidized tin surfaces. Our results show that CO2R is feasible on both metallic and oxidized tin. We propose that the key difference between each surface termination is that CO2R catalyzed by metallic tin surfaces is limited by the electrochemical activation of CO2, whereas CO2R catalyzed by oxidized tin surfaces is limited by the slow reductive desorption of formate. While the exact degree of oxidation of tin surfaces during CO2R is unlikely to be either fully metallic or fully oxidized, this study highlights the limiting behavior of these two surfaces and lays out the key features of each that our results predict will promote rapid CO2R catalysis. Additionally, we highlight the power of integrating high-fidelity quantum mechanical modeling and spectroscopic measurements to elucidate intricate electrocatalytic reaction pathways.

The present paper compared, through life cycle assessment (LCA), the production of aviation biofuel from two hydrothermal routes of microalgae cultivated in wastewater. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (G + FT) were compared. Both routes included biomass production, hydrotreatment for biofuel upgrading, and product fractionation. Secondary data obtained from the literature were used for the cradle-to-gate LCA. G + FT had a higher impact than HTL in the 18 impact categories assessed, with human carcinogenic toxicity exerting the most harmful pressure on the environment. The catalysts were the inputs that caused the most adverse emissions. The solvent used for bio-oil separation also stood out in terms of impacts. In HTL, emissions for global warming were −51.6 g CO2 eq/MJ, while in G + FT, they were 250 g CO2 eq/MJ. At the Endpoint level, HTL resulted in benefits to human health and ecosystems, while G + FT caused environmental damage in these two categories, as well as in the resources category. In the improvement scenarios, besides considering solid, aqueous, and gaseous products as co-products rather than just as waste/emissions, a 20% reduction in catalyst consumption and 90% recovery were applied. Thus, in HTL, 39.47 kg CO2 eq was avoided, compared to 35.44 kg CO2 eq in the base scenario. In G + FT, emissions decreased from 147.55 kg CO2 eq to the capture of 8.60 kg CO2 eq.

This research paper aims to optimize electrical system modeling to minimize CO2 emissions, improve reliability, and reduce costs. It proposes integrating Elman Neural Network (ENN) and metaheuristic algorithm to evaluate environmental impact and optimize system performance. The goal is to create a mathematical model considering renewable energy sources, grid energy, CO2 emissions, and maintenance costs, and use metaheuristic algorithms to determine the optimal combination of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels. To train the ENN model and optimize the system, a three-stage approach is proposed. Quasi-random numbers are generated using Sobol techniques to create input data, which is then processed by TRNSYS for simulation. The proposed approach incorporates an ENN with Boosted version of the Coyote optimization algorithm to accurately model and predict the behavior of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems for Zero Energy Buildings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our method significantly reduces energy consumption, costs, and system reliability, achieving a 25% reduction in energy consumption and 12% reduction in system cost, and is effective in optimizing hybrid solar/wind and hydrogen storage systems. The optimal system configuration significantly reduces CO2 emissions, achieves a high level of system reliability, and minimizes costs. Comparative analysis with previous studies showcases the superiority of the proposed method in achieving comprehensive optimization. In conclusion, this study combines AI techniques and metaheuristic algorithms to optimize electrical system design, considering environmental, technical, and economic factors. The proposed approach overcomes limitations in previous studies and offers an effective solution to address the optimization problem.

Here, we report an efficient integrated CO2 photoreduction to methanol accompanied with the simultaneous oxidation of benzyl amines to corresponding imines using quadrangular WO3 nanoplates grafted with Cu(BTC) as a photocatalyst under visible light, enabling to provide efficient use of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the maximum yield of methanol and N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)methanimine was found to be 642 μmol-g − 1 and 98 %, respectively. The developed integrated dual functional system comprising CO2 reduction coupled with the oxidative organic synthesis opens a new window for value chain up gradation at both ends using sustainable solar energy.

Here, a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst by integration of copper phthalocyanine with carboxyl grafting (CuTcPc) and BiVO4 nanosheets (BVO) via the hydroxyl induced assembly strategy has been developed for selective CO2 photoreduction. The optimal CuTcPc/BVO catalyst delivers a 21-fold increments in CO yields compared with pristine BVO and 91 % selectivity towards CO2 reduction, coupled with nearly stoichiometric O2 in pure water. As unraveled by experimental results and theoretical simulations, the remarkably improved photoactivity is attributed to the complementary light absorption of BVO and CuTcPc, the enhanced charge transfer and separation due to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction and most importantly the preferable CO2 adsorption and activation brought by the adjusted local coordination and electronic environment of central Cu-N4 sites by electron-withdrawing substituents. This study provides a feasible avenue to manipulate the active sites from the perspective of functional substitute tailoring on metal phthalocyanine over novel BiVO4-based Z-scheme heterojunctions for artificial photosynthesis.

Considering the alarming frequency of coal mine gas disasters globally, there is an urgent need to develop efficient gas control technologies to ensure mining safety. This study focuses on the problem of high peak gas emission restriction in the process of coal roadway tunneling in outburst coal seams, taking the No. 15 outburst coal seam of the Pingshu Coal Mine as the research object. Based on coal sample testing analysis and the application of CO2 gas fracturing (CO2-Frac) in coal mines, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on pore-fracture structure alteration and homogenization gas emission effect induced by CO2-Frac, providing technical solutions for coal mine safety production. The results are as follows: (1) CO2-Frac induces fracture propagation and the development of three types of fracture structures: Tri-Wing Fracture, Damage Markers, and Coal Matrix Fragmentation. (2) Following CO2-Frac at 150 MPa, the pore volume and average diameter of pores in the 100–10,000 nm range increased by 128% and 61%, respectively, compared to the pre-CO2-Frac state. (3) During the excavation period, continuous monitoring of the airflow for 3 days showed a significant homogenization of gas emission, with a maximum value of 0.450% and a variance value of 0.0031, indicating a reduction of 31% and 68%, respectively. These results reveal several key findings: The pore-fracture structure alteration enhances gas diffusion and permeation, providing high-speed pathways for gas migration, resulting in a substantial increase in gas extraction efficiency. During coal cutting, the modified coal exhibits homogenized gas emission, eliminating the high peak phenomenon and achieving safe and efficient mining. These findings demonstrate that CO2-Frac has broad potential in gas emission homogenization for widespread application in coal mines with similar gas geological conditions.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation‐relaying ligand, namely 6‐mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom‐precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT = 1‐hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2‐to‐CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation‐relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2‐to‐CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+ < Na+ < K+ < Cs+, and are gated by the cation‐coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.

Epicardial (Epi) access is commonly required during ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. Conventional Epi (ConvEpi) access targets a "dry" pericardial space presenting technical challenges and risk of complications. Recently, intentional puncture of coronary venous (CV) branches with Epi carbon dioxide insufflation (EpiCO2) has been described as a technique to improve Epi access. The safety of this technique relative to conventional methods remains unproven. To compare the feasibility and safety of EpiCO2 to ConvEpi access. All patients at a high-volume center undergoing Epi access between 1/2021 and 12/2023 were included and grouped according to ConvEpi or EpiCO2 approaches. Access technique was according to the discretion of the operator. Epi access was attempted in 153 cases by 17 different operators (80 ConvEpi vs 73 EpiCO2). There was no difference in success rate whether ConvEpi or EpiCO2 approach was used (76 [95%] vs 67 [91.8%], p=0.4). Total Epi access time was shorter in the ConvEpi group compared to the EpiCO2 group (16.3±11.6min vs 26.9±12.7min, p<0.001), though total procedure duration was similar. Major Epi-access related complications occurred in only the ConvEpi group (6 [7.5%] ConvEpi vs 0 [0%] EpiCo2, p=0.02). Bleeding ≥ 80 mL was more frequently observed following ConvEpi access (14 [17.5%] vs 4 [5.5%], p=0.02). After adjusting for age, repeat Epi access and antithrombotic therapy, EpiCO2 was associated with a reduction in bleeding ≥ 80 mL (OR=0.27, 95%CI 0.08 – 0.89, p=0.03). EpiCO2 access is associated with lower rates of major complication and bleeding when compared to ConvEpi access.

Among the approaches to facilitating negative CO2 emissions is biochar production. Biochar is generated in the pyrolysis of certain biomasses. In the pyrolysis process, carbon in the biomass is turned into a solid, porous, carbon-rich, and stable material that can be captured from the soil after a period of from a few decades to several centuries. In addition to this long-term carbon sequestration role, biochar is also beneficial for soil performance as it helps to restore soil fertility and improves the retention and diffusion of water and nutrients. This work presents a Life Cycle Assessment of different pyrolysis approaches for biochar production. Biomass pyrolysis is performed in a fixed-bed reactor, which operates at a mild temperature (550 °C). Biochar is obtained as solid product of the pyrolysis, but there are also liquid (bio-oil) and gaseous products (syngas). The pyrolysis gas is partly used to fulfil the energy demand of the pyrolysis process, which is highly endothermic. In the conventional approach, CO2 is produced during the combustion of syngas and emitted to the atmosphere. Another approach to facilitate CO2 capture and thus obtain more negative CO2 emissions in the pyrolysis process is burning syngas and bio-oil in a Chemical Looping Combustion unit. Life Cycle Assessment was performed of these approaches toward biomass pyrolysis to evaluate their environmental impact. The Chemical Looping Combustion approach significantly reduced the values of 7 of the 16 environmental impact indicators studied, along with the Global Warming Potential among them, it slightly increased the value of one indicator related to the use of fossil resources, and it maintained the values of the remaining 8 indicators. Environmental impact reduction occurs due to the avoidance of CO2 and NOx emissions with Chemical Looping Combustion. The CO2 balances of the different pyrolysis approaches with Chemical Looping Combustion configurations were compared with a base case, which constituted the direct combustion of wheat straw to obtain thermal energy. Direct biomass combustion for the production of 17.1 MJ of thermal energy had CO2 positive emissions of 0.165 kg. If the gaseous fraction was burned by Chemical Looping Combustion, CO2 was captured and the emissions became increasingly negative, until a value of −3.30 kg/17.1 MJ was generated. If bio-oil was also burned by this technology, the negative trend of CO2 emissions continued, until they reached a value of −3.66 kg.

The reduction of carbon emissions has become a critical global issue, and the use of monoethanolamine (MEA) solution for CO2 absorption is prevalent in industry. To elucidate the mass transfer mechanisms in reactive multiphase flow, we employed high-speed photography and digital image processing to examine the dynamics and mass transfer behavior of CO2 bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell. The results indicate that as the MEA solution concentration increases, oscillations during bubble ascent diminish, and the terminal velocity decreases. Based on changes in the mass transfer coefficient, the reaction process can be segmented into a phase of intensified mass transfer, marked by a rapid decrease in bubble equivalent diameter, and a phase of deteriorating mass transfer, where the diameter stabilizes. Additionally, we introduced a dimensionless mathematical model for the Sherwood number based on experimental findings, and its reliability was confirmed.

As the uncertainty in energy supply increases, engaging various flexible resources in power systems has emerged as an effective strategy to address wind curtailment issues. Existing research insufficiently explores how EAFs can participate in reducing wind curtailment or optimizing flexible power system resources to decrease CO2 emissions from TTPs and enhance wind energy absorption across various timescales. This study introduces a dual timescale, dual-tier scheduling methodology incorporating EAF regulation and wind power modal decomposition. The day-ahead model integrates EAF demand response to decrease wind curtailment, a comprehensive wind power allocation, and a TTP carbon minimization model. The intra-day model employs wind power modal decomposition for optimizing BESSs within WFs and schedules TTPs to minimize CO2 emissions. Implemented through iterative genetic algorithms and CPLEX solver techniques, simulation results from a real-case scenario indicate that incorporating EAF loads reduces wind curtailment by 40.49% and cuts CO2 emissions by 2.5% in the day-ahead phase. Furthermore, by applying modal decomposition, TTPs and BESSs absorb fluctuating wind power components, ensuring maximal wind utilization and substantial CO2 reduction at TTPs. This approach offers vast potential to enhance power system flexibility, advance energy-intensive industries' transition, and foster low-carbon initiatives at TTPs.

CO2 geological sequestration in coal seams can achieve the dual objectives of CO2 emission reduction and enhanced coalbed methane production, making it a highly promising carbon capture and storage technology. However, the injection of CO2 into coal reservoirs in the form of supercritical fluid (ScCO2) leads to complex physicochemical reactions with the coal seam, altering the properties of the coal reservoir and impacting the effectiveness of CO2 sequestration and methane production enhancement.In this paper, theoretical calculations based on ReaxFF-MD were conducted to study the interaction mechanism between ScCO2 and the macromolecular structure of both low-rank and high-rank coal, to address the limitations of experimental methods. The reaction of ScCO2 with low-rank coal and high-rank coal exhibits significant differences. At swelling stage, the low-rank coal experiences a decrease in aromatic structure and aliphatic structure, high-rank coal shows an increase in aromatic structure and a decrease in aliphatic structure, while swelling phenomenon is more pronounced in high-rank coal. At dissolution stage, low-rank coal is initially decomposed into two secondary molecular fragments, and then recombine to form new molecular structure, the aromatic structure increased and the aliphatic structure decreased. In contrast, high-rank coal occurs stretches-breakage-movement-reconnection, a reduction in aromatic structure and an increase in aliphatic structure.The primary reasons for these variations lie in distinct molecular structure compositions and the properties of ScCO2, leading to different reaction pathways of functional group and aromatic structure. The reaction pathways of functional groups and aromatic structures in coal can be summarized as follows: the breakage of the O-H bond in hydroxyl groups, the breakage of the C-OH bond in carboxyl groups, transformation of aliphatic structures into smaller hydrocarbon compounds or formation of long-chain alkenes, and various pathways involving broken, rearrangement, recombination of aromatic structures. In low-rank coal, there is a higher abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures. The breakage of O-H and C-OH chemical bonds results in the formation of free radical ions, while some aliphatic structures detach to produce hydrocarbons. Additionally, some of these aliphatic structures combine with carbonyl groups and free radical ions to generate new aromatic structures. Conversely, in high-rank coal, the lower content of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures, along with stronger intramolecular forces, results in fewer chemical bond breakages and makes it less conducive to the formation of new aromatic structures.These results elucidate the specific deformations of different chemical groups, offering a molecular-level understanding of the interaction between CO2 and coal.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to ethanol has been widely researched for potential commercial application. However, it still faces limited selectivity at a large current density. Herein, Mo4+-doped CuS nanosheet-assembled hollow spheres are constructed to address this issue. Mo4+ ion doping modifies the local electronic environments and diversifies the binding sites of CuS, which increases the coverage of linear *COL and produces bridge *COB for subsequent *COL–*COH coupling toward ethanol production. The optimal Mo9.0%–CuS can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a faradaic efficiency of 67.5% and a partial current density of 186.5 mA cm–2 at −0.6 V in a flow cell. This work clarifies that doping high valence transition metal ions into Cu-based sulfides can regulate the coverage and configuration of related intermediates for ethanol production during the CO2RR in a flow cell.

Copper (Cu) based catalysts are frequently used in CO2 hydrogenation, particularly in reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) and CO2-to-methanol reaction. Cu0 and Cu + are the key species affecting the catalyst performance and product distribution. Therefore, constructing and adjusting Cu0/Cu+ active pairs is significant for the catalyst design. In this study, Cu0/Cu+ active pairs are obtained by utilizing the properties of perovskite-type oxides (PTOs). A series of CaTi1-xCuxO3 and Ca0.8La0.2Ti1-xCuxO3 (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50) were synthesized via citric acid complexing method and part of the Cu species entered the PTOs lattice. After reduction, large Cu particles and highly-dispersed Cu clusters were obtained simultaneously. The dispersed Cu clusters have more interfaces with the PTOs and provide abundant Cu + while large Cu particles tend to aggregate and supply mainly Cu0. Cu0 activates H2 and CO2 and plays a vital role in the rWGS reaction. Cu+ is the active site for methanol synthesis and it can strongly absorb CO. The ratio of Cu0/Cu + varies with different Cu content and doping La can also adjust the chemical state of surface Cu. The performance test demonstrates that both excessively high and low Cu0/Cu+ ratios are beneficial for CO generation, while a moderate ratio is suitable for methanol synthesis. These insights provide a method for regulating the chemical state of surface metal species and help the catalyst design for CO2 hydrogenation.

The aviation industry is responsible for over 2% of global CO2 emissions. Synthetic jet fuels generated from biogenic feedstocks could help reduce life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum-based fuels. This study assesses three processes for producing synthetic jet fuel via the synthesis of methanol using water and atmospheric CO2 or biomass. A life cycle assessment and cost analysis are conducted to determine GHG emissions, energy demand, land occupation, water depletion, and the cost of producing synthetic jet fuel in Switzerland. The results reveal that the pathway that directly hydrogenates CO2 to methanol exhibits the largest reductions in terms of GHG emission (almost 50%) compared to conventional jet fuel and the lowest production cost (7.86 EUR kgJF–1); however, its production cost is currently around 7 times higher than the petroleum-based counterpart. Electrical energy was found to be crucial in capturing CO2 and converting water into hydrogen, with the sourcing and processing of the feedstocks contributing to 79% of the electric energy demand. Furthermore, significant variations in synthetic jet fuel cost and GHG emissions were shown when the electricity source varies, such as utilizing grid electricity pertaining to different countries with distinct electricity mixes. Thus, upscaling synthetic jet fuels requires energy-efficient supply chains, sufficient feedstock, large amounts of additional (very) low-carbon energy capacity, suitable climate policy, and comprehensive environmental analyses.

However, the limitations of existing synthetic techniques include the requirement for costly catalysts and limited substrates. Here, we developed a novel electroreductive arylcarboxylation of alkenes with CO2 based on a radical–polar crossover pathway assisted by easily accessible dimethyl terephthalate as a reductive mediator. This method will provide an efficient strategy for the synthesis of 2,3-diarylpropanoic acids.

The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction serves as a critical pathway for converting CO2 into diverse chemicals. The Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which leverages lattice oxygen as the oxidant and oxygen vacancies as reductants, offers an alternative catalytic strategy for the selective RWGS reaction. While Mn-substituted SrTiO3 (i.e., SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3) has been shown to promote the RWGS reaction selectively via the MvK mechanism, achieving a sufficient conversion of CO2 necessitates elevated temperatures. This study investigated the effect of Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 on the activation of adsorbed H2 molecules, which generated oxygen vacancies and enhanced CO2 conversion. Notably, 1.0 wt% Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 yielded 13.4% of CO at 673 K, whereas pristine SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 and Pd-loaded SrTiO3 yielded negligible or minimal amount of CO. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed that Pd promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies via both thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and kinetic studies revealed that the RWGS reaction over Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 proceeded primarily via the MvK mechanism with a partial contribution from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. This study underscores the effectiveness of combining metal and MvK-type catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the RWGS reaction.

The mechanistic understanding of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under electrochemical conditions is crucial for optimizing the overall catalytic performance. While electrolyte ions have received considerable attention, it remains unclear how the condition of interfacial cations modulates the CO2RR and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we explore the CO2 activation and Volmer step representing the critical first electron transfer during the CO2RR and HER, respectively. This investigation involves manipulating the cation identity (K+, Li+, and H+) and concentration at Au–water interfaces, which is carried out via the slow-growth sampling approach integrated with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that the high local alkali metal cation (AM+) concentration facilitates the CO2RR following the order of 2K+ > 1K+ > 2Li+ > 1Li+ > 0AM+, and the highly promoted CO2 activation kinetics originate from the short-range coordination between alkali metal cations and reaction intermediates. However, the interfacial HER behaves very differently with the kinetic order of 1Li+ > 0AM+ > 1K+ > 2Li+ > 2K+, closely related to the interfacial water structures, which are affected by both cation identity and local concentrations. Overall, the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR at the Au–water interface can be enhanced by increasing the local cation concentration (K+ > Li+). These findings highlight the critical roles of alkali metal cations and reaction microenvironments in modulating interfacial reaction kinetics.

Carbon-based materials with single-atom (SA) transition metals coordinated with nitrogen (M-Nx) have attracted extensive attention due to their superior electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance. However, the uncontrolled recombination of metal atoms during the typical high-temperature synthesis process in M-Nx causes deterioration of CO2RR activity. Herein, by using electrospinning, we propose a novel strategy for constructing a highly active and selective SA Fe-modified N-doped porous carbon fiber membrane catalyst (Fe-N-CF). This carbon membrane has an interconnected three-dimensional structure and a hierarchical porous structure, which can not only confine Fe to be single atom as active centers, but also provide a diffusion channel for CO2 molecules. Relying on its special structure and stable mechanical properties, Fe-N-CF is directly used for CO2RR, which presents an excellent selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 97%) and stability. DFT calculations reveals that the synthesized Fe-N4-C can significantly reduce the energy barrier for intermediate COOH* formation and CO desorption. This work highlights the specific advantages of using electrospinning method to prepare the optimal SA catalysts.

Ground heat is a renewable energy source that is less affected by atmospheric temperature and maintains a nearly constant temperature throughout the year. Therefore, it can serve as a heat source for hot water and air conditioning systems, resulting in a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional systems. In Japan, the recognition of the use of ground heat is still low, and the prices of ground heat exchangers and geothermal heat pumps tend to be high. In addition, the excavation cost is very high, so it is very important to reduce the construction cost. One cost-saving method is to install a ground heat exchanger in the core material of the earth retaining wall, which has been shown to reduce construction costs by more than 50%. In this study, a numerical program was developed to clarify the performance and characteristics of a ground heat exchanger attached to an H-beam in a "Pre-installation method using the earth retaining wall". Then, the factors influencing the heat extraction performance of two U-Tube heat exchangers connected in series, four U-Tube heat exchangers connected in series and two W-Tube heat exchangers connected in series were investigated. Firstly, the validity of the calculation program was confirmed by comparing the numerical results with the experimental thermal response results. Secondly, numerical simulations were performed using the calculation program, and the following results were obtained. Under the conditions defined in this study, we found that the rate of heat extraction increases as the flow rate of the heat extraction medium increases in all ground heat exchangers. However, it becomes difficult to increase the heat extraction when the flow of the heat extraction medium reaches a turbulent area. All three models confirmed that the H-beam expanded the area where the formation temperature changes and increased the temperature of the heat extraction medium. This led to an enhanced heat extraction performance of the ground heat exchanger. Finally, we compared the heat extraction performance of several ground heat exchangers using the 'coefficient of heat extraction or rejection'. The results showed that the four U-Tube model had the highest performance, followed by the two W-Tube model, and the two U-Tube model had the lowest performance, although the differences were small.

Portland cement is widely used in the construction industry. Its production contributes to carbon dioxide emissions, urging the need for sustainable alternatives. The present study aims to evaluate the strength, durability, microstructural properties, and cost-effectivity of geopolymer (GP) concrete containing polyethylene (PE) fibers, with fly ash (FA), ground-granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and calcium magnesium carbonate (CaMg(CO3)2 known as dolomite) as binders. PE fiber used has an ultra-high molecular weight. Six different mixtures were produced with FA, GGBFS, dolomite, and/or PE fiber. The control mix used only FA as a binder without PE fiber. Fresh and mechanical properties, including slump value, compressive strength, and split tensile strength, were determined, and non-destructive tests, such as electrical resistivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity, were conducted. The durability of GP was evaluated through initial surface absorption and capillary suction absorption tests at different curing ages. Microstructural and mineralogical characteristics were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results revealed that the addition of PE fibers and CaMg(CO3)2 reduced the workability of GP by 30.22% in comparison with that of PE fiber along with GGBFS. Compared to the reference mix at 28 days, incorporating 20% GGBFS resulted in the highest improvement of 76.89% and 104.86% in compressive and split tensile strength, respectively. GP sample with 20% GGBFS replacement of FA presented the highest reduction of 44.4–41.63% for initial and secondary rate of absorption. SEM analysis showed that the addition of GGBFS and CaMg(CO3)2 to fiber-reinforced FA-based geopolymer mixes developed a denser and more homogenous matrix with improved mechanical behavior due to the co-existence of C−S−H and aluminosilicate gel. PE fibers improve the toughness properties by helping to absorb energy and bridging cracks. The development of a stronger matrix was characterized by C−S−H, calcium aluminate oxide (carbonate) hydroxide (C4AHx) and quartz. A one-way ANOVA analysis and cost analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of partially replacing FA with CaMg(CO3)2 and GGBFS in PE fiber-reinforced GP concrete.

We combined ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface science techniques, electrochemical measurements, and computational modeling to investigate electrocatalytic systems that are crucial components of the carbon management effort, including oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). Well-defined Model catalysts were grown on substrates in the UHV chamber and characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Selected model electrocatalysts were then tested in electrochemical cells to establish the structure-property relationships in OER and CO2RR. Our results showed that the edge sites of Fe2O3 grown on Au(111) were the most active toward OER and incorporation of Ni at the edge sites (NiFeOx) further boosted their OER activity. We also resolved the size-dependent electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion of the Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with average particle diameter between 2 to 6 nm: smaller diameter (< 3 nm) particles favored H2 evolution reaction (HER) due to a high population of Ag edge sites, whereas larger diameter particles favored CO2RR as the population of Ag(100) surface sites grew. We further discovered that electronic interactions between small diameter Ag particles and highly defective carbon supports could break the size-dependent CO2RR selectivity, resulting in highly selective (CO Faradaic Efficiency > 90%) and active Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with sizes < 2 nm diameter.

The pressure-swing distillation traditionally used in the industry for separating dimethyl carbonate/methanol (DMC/MeOH) commonly suffers from high energy consumption and challenges in achieving high-purity separation due to the existence of pinch zone. Hence, energy-saving extractive distillation system is explored to achieve the high-purity separation of DMC/MeOH azeotrope. With the analyses of isovolatility and residue curve maps based on Wilson model calibrated by vapor–liquid equilibrium experimental data, an extractive distillation process using O-Xylene (OX) as the most suitable entrainer were modeled and validated by using extractive distillation experiment. Furthermore, the design, optimization, and comparison of a 10000 t/a DMC extractive distillation process and a pressure-swing distillation process are investigated. It is demonstrated that the extractive distillation process presents significant economic and emission advantage, specifically with 34.66 % and 26.95 % reductions in operating cost (OC) and in total annual cost (TAC) respectively, as well as 42.53 % reduction in CO2 emissions. This work should provide a feasible and promising approach to energy saving, low-carbon, and high-purity separation of DMC/MeOH azeotrope.

This comprehensive review explores the mechanism of phase transition in catalysts and its potential for enhancing electrocatalysis. It provides an in-depth analysis of commonly employed phase transition strategies for transition metal-based materials and discusses the characterization techniques used to observe the phase transition process. The significance of the phase transition strategy in electrocatalysis is elucidated through the lens of key reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges associated with implementing phase transition strategies to achieve advanced catalytic performance. By providing valuable insights, this review aims to inspire further research in phase transition modulation, paving the way for the advancement of the catalysts that contribute to sustainable and eco-friendly energy production.

This study offers an in-depth analysis and optimization of a microgrid system powered by renewable sources, designed for the efficient production of hydrogen and dimethyl ether—key elements in the transition toward sustainable fuel alternatives. The system architecture incorporates solar photovoltaic modules, advanced battery storage solutions, and electrolytic hydrogen production units, with a targeted reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the enhancement of overall energy efficiency. A rigorous economic analysis was conducted utilizing the HYSYS V12 software platform and encompassing capital and operational expenditures alongside profit projections to evaluate the system’s economic viability. Furthermore, thermal optimization was achieved through heat integration strategies, employing a cascade analysis methodology and optimization via the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), yielding an 83% decrease in annual utility expenditures. Comparative analysis revealed that the energy requirement of the optimized system was over 50% lower than that of traditional fossil fuel-based reforming processes. A comprehensive assessment of CO2 emissions demonstrated a significant reduction, with the integration of thermal management solutions facilitating a 99.24% decrease in emissions. The outcomes of this study provide critical insights into the engineering of sustainable, low-carbon energy systems, emphasizing the role of renewable energy technologies in advancing fuel science.

The circular economy has come with momentum to settle in the countries as a new model of economic growth. Thus, sustainable development and the objectives set forth by the United Nations for its achievement and expansion highlight the concern and preoccupation of society for these issues. For this reason, this chapter deals with four specific aspects of the agricultural industry sector, which aim to improve our lives and the sustainability of our planet. These aspects refer to the use of biomass residues and their contribution to the food sector, the generation of biofuel and electricity from biogas for agricultural use, as well as the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation. Finally, a decrease in cotton production and the use of regenerated cotton by the textile industry will be considered. Based on the theoretical framework, four specific proposals are established to achieve the aggregate global growth requirement posed by Sustainable Development Goal 8, compared to the reduction in the use of CO2, together with the reduction in the use of resources (Goals 6, 7, 9, 12 and 15). These proposals cover aspects such as the reuse of organic and biodegradable wastes, the reuse of water through different irrigation methods and its application based on its components, and the reuse of cotton from existing clothing. All of this provides economic agents, administration, companies, and households with opportunities for reflection and implementation of a more sustainable economic and social model.

Combining biomass co-firing with oxy-fuel combustion is a promising Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology. It has the potential to achieve a large-scale reduction in carbon emissions from traditional power plants, making it a powerful tool for addressing global climate change. However, mercury in the fuel can be released into the flue gas during combustion, posing a significant threat to the environment and human health. More importantly, mercury can also cause the fracture of metal equipment via amalgamation, which is a major risk for the system. Therefore, compared to conventional coal-fired power plants, the requirements for the mercury concentration in BECCS systems are much stricter. This article reviews the latest progress in mercury control under oxy-fuel biomass co-firing conditions, clarifies the impact of biomass co-firing on mercury species transformation, reveals the influence mechanisms of various flue gas components on elemental mercury oxidation under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various mercury removal methods, and finally provides an outlook for mercury control in BECCS systems. Research shows that after biomass co-firing, the concentrations of chlorine and alkali metals in the flue gas increase, which is beneficial for homogeneous and heterogeneous mercury oxidation. The changes in the particulate matter content could affect the transformation of gaseous mercury to particulate mercury. The high concentrations of CO2 and H2O in oxy-fuel flue gas inhibit mercury oxidation, while the effects of NOx and SO2 are dual-sided. Higher concentrations of fly ash in oxy-fuel flue gas are conducive to the removal of Hg0. Additionally, under oxy-fuel conditions, CO2 and metal ions such as Fe2+ can inhibit the re-emission of mercury in WFGD systems. The development of efficient adsorbents and catalysts is the key to achieving deep mercury removal. Fully utilizing the advantages of chlorine, alkali metals, and CO2 in oxy-fuel biomass co-firing flue gas will be the future focus of deep mercury removal from BECCS systems.

Methanol is considered as an essential base chemical, which is widely known for its versatility and broad potential use contexts in future chemical industries and energy storage applications. Methanol production pathways powered by renewable electricity sources, also known as power-to-methanol processes, are characterized by low specific life-cycle emissions and are therefore of paramount interest. One possible renewable process chain features proton-conducting high temperature electrolyzers combined with a direct hydrogenation of CO2. In this paper, a techno-economic forecast study of this process chain is presented and specific production costs of renewable methanol under different electricity supply scenarios are determined and discussed for the years 2030 and 2050. The studies showed that flexible grid-supported scenarios through direct spot-market participation and renewable scenarios enable the largest production cost reduction potential in the upcoming decades.

Microwave heating (MWH) of lignocellulosic biomass with susceptors has attracted attention for H2 production. In this study, H2 is produced from cellulose via MWH at 800 °C in a steam atmosphere with magnetite used as the susceptor. The effects of steam feeding and MWH on the product yields are experimentally investigated in comparison with conventional heating (CH). The H2 and CO2 yields are increased by steam feeding for both MWH and CH because the water–gas shift reaction occurs. Without steam feeding, MWH enhances H2 and CO production, thereby increasing the maximum energy efficiency. With steam feeding, the steam gasification of C is more predominant for CH than for MWH as the reduction in the C content in the char of CH is higher than that of MWH. MWH reduces the formation of secondary char, and it is therefore expected to overcome issues such as the clogging or blockage of gas lines.

Magnetron sputtering (MS) is a very promising approach for electrode preparation due to its versatility, environmental benignity, and sustainability. In particular, by allowing high control of the deposited nanostructures, MS is characterized by: high deposition rates at low temperatures, deposition of complex species just selecting a specific target, high-density films, and outstanding adhesion of the films on supports. In the following study, the preparation by MS, and thus avoiding toxic chemical reagents, of NbRe thin films, for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), was reported. Firstly, the electrocatalytic activity of NbRe thin films was tested towards HER showing promising performance: negligible overpotentials and very small Tafel slopes. Secondly, in the context of carbon recycling, and considering renewable sources intermittence, the electrodes were tested towards CO2RR, obtaining selectively C3 compounds. Overall, the proposed study aims to contribute to the development of sustainable catalytic electrochemical processes, supporting the ecological transition.

The anode has not been extensively studied in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) systems because it is believed to have no significant effect on the catalytic selectivity and activity of the cathode. Herein, we report that the anode can indeed influence the catalytic activity of the CO2RR by regulating the transfer of water and ions in a membrane electrode assembly. Despite employing identical cathode conditions, we observed optimal ethylene production at different current densities for distinct anode substrates: carbon paper (CP) and Ti meshes. Based on the results of in situ/operando analysis and transparent cell tests, CP creates an environment deficient in water and cations, thereby promoting local pH effects. Consequently, this leads to a higher valence state of Cu during the CO2RR, resulting in increased catalytic activity for ethylene production. However, in the high-current-density region, the catalytic activity of CP degrades due to the uneven distribution of the reaction. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the reaction environment for CO2RR and offers insights for optimizing the catalytic activity of CO2RR systems.

In this work, La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 HEO nanoparticles with a perovskite-type structure are synthesized and used in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalyst demonstrates high performance as an electrocatalyst for the CO2RR, with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5% at a current density of 21.9 mA cm–2 under −0.75 V vs a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). Particularly, an FE above 54% is obtained for methyl isopropyl ketone (C5H10O, MIPK) at a partial current density of 16 mA cm–2, overcoming all previous works. Besides, the as-prepared HEO catalyst displays robust stability in the CO2RR. The excellent catalytic performance of La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 is ascribed to the synergistic effect between the electronic effects associated with five cations occupying the high-entropy sublattice sites and the oxygen vacancies within the perovskite structure of the HEO. Finally, DFT calculations indicate that Cu plays a vital role in the catalytic activity of the La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 HEO nanoparticles toward C2+ products.

The importance and breadth of applications of the family of quaternary chalcogenides with the formula Cu2ZnSnSxSe(4−x) (CZTS/Se) where x = 0–4 are steadily expanding due to the tunable optoelectronic properties of these compounds and the Earth abundance of the elements in their composition. These p-type semiconductors are viewed as a viable alternative to Si, gallium arsenide, CdTe, and CIGS solar cells due to their cost effectiveness, Earth’s crust abundance, and non-toxic elements. Additionally, CZTS/Se compounds have demonstrated notable capabilities beyond solar cells, such as photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction, solar water splitting, solar seawater desalination, hydrogen production, and use as an antibacterial agent. Various routes have been explored for synthesizing pure CZTS/Se nanomaterials and significant efforts have been dedicated to reducing the occurrence of secondary phases. This review focuses on synthetic approaches for CZTS/Se nanomaterials, with emphasis on controlling the size and morphology of the nanoparticles and their recent application in solar energy harvesting and beyond, highlighting challenges in achieving the desired purity required in all these applications.

The study aimed to test the hypothesis that biochar's unique properties, such as its microporous structure, enhance concrete's resilience to high temperatures. Despite expectations of reduced crack formation and enhanced fire resistance, the experimental results revealed limited impact on concrete's fire behaviour. The investigation involved the use of two biochar types, fine and coarse biochar as replacements for cement and aggregates, respectively. Fine biochar exhibited higher water absorption and Young's modulus than coarse biochar, but both resisted ignition at 35 kW/m2 and had peak heat release rates below 40 kW/m2. Incorporating these biochars at varying weight percentages (5, 10, and 20 wt.%) into concrete led to a gradual decline in compressive and tensile strength due to reduced binding ability with increased biochar content. Exposure to 1000 °C compromised mechanical properties across all the samples. However, the biochar concrete maintained standard compressive strength (compared to the control) with up to 20 wt.% biochar as a fine aggregate substitute after exposure to 600°C, and as a cement replacement after exposure to 200°C. This substitution also yielded a significant reduction in CO2 emissions (50 % reduction as the biochar loading amount doubled) from concrete manufacturing, showcasing biochar's potential for sustainable construction practices. Despite not fully supporting the initial hypothesis, the study demonstrated biochar's viability in reducing carbon footprint while maintaining concrete strength under certain fire conditions.

Benefiting from enhanced oxygen surface exchange and chemical diffusion kinetics, resultant PrBa0.95Gd0.05Co2O5+δ (PBG0.05CO) exhibits an area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.038 Ω cm2 at 700 oC, reduced by ∼46.5% relative to undoped PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBCO). When evaluated as the air electrode, the as-fabricated single coin fuel cell delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 1230 mW cm-2 at 700 oC. For the CO2-electrolysis at 750 oC, the large current density (J) of 2630 mA cm-2 is achieved in the PBG0.05CO anode-based electrolysis cell at a voltage (V) of 1.8 V. Furthermore, exceptional operating stability is realized in both ORR and OER manners. Our findings highlight an effective strategy to optimize the electrocatalytic properties of layered perovskites, endowing potential applications in energy storage and conversion aspects.

ZrCo alloy is easily poisoned by impurity gases such as O2, CO, and CO2, resulting in a deterioration in hydrogen storage performance. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the adsorption and dissociation characteristics of oxygen on the ZrCo(110) surface using first-principles calculations. Previous studies indicated that the anti-disproportionation properties of ZrCo alloy can be significantly improved by Hf substitution, but the effect of Hf doping on the anti-poisoning properties has not been reported. We also examined the effect of Hf doping on the adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion characteristics of oxygen. It is found that on the ZrCo(110) surface, O2 molecules are easily dissociated and then stably adsorbed at the hollow site. Oxygen atoms will fill the surface preferentially and then diffuse inward. The doping of Hf has an insignificant impact on the adsorption or dissociation behavior of oxygen in comparison to the pure ZrCo surface. However, a notable observation is that the doping of Hf resulted in a reduction in the diffusion barrier for oxygen from the surface to the subsurface by 0.61 eV. Consequently, our study suggests that doping Hf is not an advisable strategy for improving the ZrCo(110) surface’s resistance to O2 poisoning because of improved oxygen permeability.

Biomass pyrolysis has the potential to be transformed into valuable chemicals and fuels. Nitrogenous chemicals exert a substantial influence on the quality of bio-oil. Studying the impact of lignin on the transformation of nitrogen-containing elements in biomass during biomass pyrolysis is crucial for achieving efficient and effective utilization of biomass resources. In this study, tube furnace experiments, thermogravimetric infrared experiments (TG-FTIR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) were used to investigate the interaction between typical lignins (vanillin and syringol), nitrogenous components (glutamic acid) during the co-pyrolysis process as well as the effect of lignin on the pyrolysis gas release and pyrolysis products of glutamic acid, and combined with quantum chemical calculations, the impact of lignin on the effect of pyrrolidone formation from glutamic acid.The experimental findings demonstrated that the co-pyrolysis of lignin and glutamic acid resulted in a reduction in the pyrolysis temperature. This reduction facilitated the release of HCN, NH3, and CO2 while notably impeding the formation of nitrogen-containing compounds in the oil. The nitrogen concentration in the pyrolysis oil declined from 97% to a range of 51.06% to 79.63%, and the inhibitory impact decreased as the pyrolysis temperature increased. At an elevated pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, lignin facilitated the decarboxylation process of glutamic acid, resulting in an increased production of pyrrolidone.Simulation results demonstrated that the lowest energy barrier paths were the dehydration condensation process and the Maillard reaction involving glutamic acid and lignin and their pyrolysis intermediates, with a particular competitive connection between the two pathways. The results explained the interaction mechanism between the two pyrolysis products and provided a fundamental theoretical basis for nitrogen conversion in biomass pyrolysis.

This study redefines resource efficiency in the renewable energy sector by repurposing construction waste into high-performance thixotropic soils for additive manufacturing. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that these engineered soils achieve compressive strengths up to 30 MPa—indicating a 50% increase over traditional substrates—and flexural strengths reaching 5 MPa. Rigorous life cycle assessments quantify a reduction in carbon emissions by 20% and a resource efficiency enhancement to 85%, surpassing conventional materials which average 500 kg CO2 eq/ton in carbon footprint and 60% in resource efficiency. Fine-tuned 3D printing parameters deliver unparalleled precision, achieving layer accuracy to ±0.1 mm and reducing material wastage by 30%, while accelerating construction timelines by 40%. Additionally, the materials exhibit thermal stability with only a 0.1% variation under elevated temperatures and a durability that sustains less than 0.5 MPa degradation over a 10-month period. These quantitatively robust results support the thixotropic soils' adoption, not just as a sustainable choice but as a superior alternative to conventional building materials, setting a new paradigm in the construction of environmentally resilient and economically viable renewable energy infrastructures.

Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p‐type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90 eV, which causes the upward band bending of p‐type Sb2S3, forming a hole‐transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back‐illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches −5.38 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC‐CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of −0.44 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 0 V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than −0.03 mA cm−2 without CuxS.

ABSTRACT Considering groundwater from the aquifers overlying the bedrock is an important water source for drinking purposes. As such, the investigation of its property is essential. Based on the spatial structure of aquifers in the study area, the aquifers in the Cenozoic strata are divided into three groups. The multivariate statistical approaches are employed to identify the hydrogeochemical processes and hydro-chemical types, and hydrogeochemical inverse modeling is applied to further validate and elucidate the hydrogeochemical process and water–rock interaction. The results are as follows: (1) The hydro-chemical type of the upper aquifer is dominated by the K + Na-HCO3 type, while others have similar water quality types, which are dominated by the K + Na-Cl type and the K + Na-SO4 type. (2) The saturation index of anhydrite, gypsum, halite, and CO2(g) is below zero in three aquifers, indicating that they are unsaturated. While aragonite, calcite, and dolomite in the middle aquifer remain in the unsaturated–saturated state. (3) The cation exchange process accelerating the reduction of Ca2+ concentration and the increase of SO42− concentration occurs in three aquifers, and the dissolution of calcite and dolomite minerals occurs in most cases. This study supports the fundamental evidence for the hydrogeochemical processes and water resource utilization and has a certain practical significance.

Transition-metal species embedded in carbon have sparked intense interest in the fields of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, improvement of the electrocatalytic kinetics remains a challenge caused by the synergistic assembly. Here, we propose a biochemical strategy to fabricate the Co nanoparticles (NPs) and Co/Ni–N4–C co-embedded N-doped porous carbon (CoNPs&Co/Ni–N4–C@NC) catalysts via constructing the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)@yeast precursor. The rich amino groups provide the possibility for the anchorage of Co2+/Ni2+ ions as well as the construction of Co/Ni–ZIF@yeast through the yeast cell biomineralization effect. The functional design induces the formation of CoNPs and Co/Ni–N4–C sites in N-doped carbon as well as regulates the porosity for exposing such sites. Synergy of CoNPs, Co/Ni–N4–C, and porous N-doped carbon delivered excellent electrocatalytic kinetics (the ORR Tafel slope of 76.3 mV dec–1 and the OER Tafel slope of 80.4 mV dec–1) and a high voltage of 1.15 V at 10 mA cm–2 for the discharge process in zinc air batteries. It provides an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance catalysts.

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of decarbonizing the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic, pivotal for addressing climate change and fostering economic growth. Employing the robust-decision making methodology, we studied multiple scenarios via computational models, capturing inputs from stakeholders and evaluating each scenario across 1,000 futures to capture deep uncertainty. Four scenarios were examined: baseline, reference, natural gas, and renewable. The renewable scenario emerged as the most advantageous, proposing the replacement of coal-fired power generation with renewable sources, primarily solar and wind, coupled with batteries. A significant investment, averaging US$3.3 billion, is necessary for this shift toward renewable energy; however, these investments are overcompensated by savings in operational costs. Crucially, this transition promises substantial benefits by 2050: an estimated cumulative average net economic gain of US$2.7 billion, an 8% reduction in average generation costs in 2050, the creation of 160,000 direct jobs, and the avoidance of circa 140 million tons of CO2. The findings underscore the feasibility and economic viability of transitioning to a 55% renewable energy generation by 2050. The study offers a critical roadmap for policymakers, highlighting renewable energy expansion, transmission grid strengthening, and strategic coal generation replacement, thus offering a comprehensive blueprint for the nation's energy transition.

In addition to its use as a lightweight material, pure magnesium is a promising candidate for prospective bioimplants considering its excellent biocompatible properties. Regardless of what Mg application is used, the ultimate goal is to improve magnesium's mechanical properties and degradation behaviour. Because of the high affinity for oxygen native oxide layer of gas-atomized powders is naturally formed in contact with the atmosphere. S/TEM investigation of the native oxide of the Mg powder particles revealed a nonhomogeneous nano-crystalline MgO layer. MgO is relatively soluble in water and does not provide sufficient corrosion protection. Among various surface treatment methods, conversion of the non-protective magnesium oxide to carbonate products is possible depending on the environmental conditions. This work used a simple experimental method using CO2 and water vapour to achieve surface carbonation of Mg powders. Two carbonated samples and pure magnesium were prepared by direct extrusion. The samples after carbonation retained good mechanical properties and the layer of carbonates had a significant impact on corrosion resistance. 1 day carbonation resulted in transformation of native oxide into amorphous layer and reduction of corrosion rate. Longer carbonation (10 days) revealed layer growth and transformation of native oxide to crystalline nesquehonite structure.

The closed-loop wastewater source heat exchanger (WSHE) has advantages such as being non-clogging and resistant to corrosion, but their heat transfer efficiency is relatively low, therefore it is still not the mainstream form of heat exchanger of wastewater source heat pump (WSHP). A novel CO2 direct-expansion wastewater source heat exchanger (DX-WSHE) is proposed in this paper, aiming to significantly improve the heat transfer rate of the heat exchanger and the energy efficiency of the heat pump system. The direct-expansion heat transfer process is complex, large grid number and long calculation time will be required if calculated by conventional numerical simulation software. Therefore, a three-dimensional transient heat transfer model was developed based on the thermal resistance and capacity model, which offers the advantages of fast computation speed and strong flexibility. The heat transfer and energy efficiency characteristics under different parameters were studied. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the direct-expansion wastewater source heat pump (DX-WSHP) can be increased by 31.0% compared to conventional design, and the heat flux of the direct-expansion wastewater source heat exchanger can be up to 250 W/m for the standard group. Compared with conventional designs, the direct-expansion wastewater source heat pump has excellent heat transfer and energy efficiency capabilities, which is a promising building energy saving and emission reduction technology.

This study investigated the potential use of spent pot-lining (SPL) as a supplementary fuel in blast furnaces to replace pulverized coal (PC). Based on actual blast furnace operational parameters, a three-dimensional numerical model is established to simulate the complex flow and reaction processes in the tuyere raceway. The impact of the proportion of SPL in the mixed fuel from 0 % to 45 % on the thermochemical characteristics of the mixed fuel combustion is analyzed. The results indicate that with an increase in SPL proportion, the combustion peak temperature (2511 K-2922 K) and the average temperature in the raceway (2014 K-2474 K) of the mixed fuel both increase. However, the combustion rate of the mixed fuel decreases, highlighting the need for a rational design of the mixed fuel ratio to optimize combustion performance. The SPL proportion has minimal influence on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airflow but significantly affects combustion and thermal properties, altering the distribution of gas-phase components. Through linear regression and correlation analysis, linear relationships between SPL proportion and combustion rate, peak temperature in the raceway, and CO and CO2 mass fractions are established. This research holds substantial significance and value in advancing the technology of using industrial waste SPL to replace part of the coal powder as blast furnace injection fuel, promoting the development of green metallurgical technologies, and contributing to global energy conservation and emission reduction.

The removal of formaldehyde (FA) is vital for indoor air quality management in light of its carcinogenic propensity and adverse environmental impact. A series of copper manganite spinel structures (e.g., CuMn2O4) are prepared using the sol-gel combustion method and treated with reduction or oxidation pretreatment methods at 300°C condition. Accordingly, CuMn2O4-O ("O" suffix for oxidation pre-treatment in air) is identified as the best performer to achieve 100% conversion (XFA) of FA (50 ppm) at 90°C; its performance, if assessed in terms of reaction kinetic rate (r) at XFA =10%, is 5.02E-03 mmol g-1 h-1. The FA removal performance increases systematically with decreases in flow rate, FA concentration, and relative humidity (RH) or with increases in bed mass. The reaction pathways and intermediates of FA catalytic oxidation on CuMn2O4-A are studied with density functional theory simulations, temperature-programmed characterization experiments, and in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The synergistic combination of large quantities of adsorbed oxygen (OA) species and oxidized metal species (e.g., Cu2+) contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance of CuMn2O4-O to oxidize FA into CO2 with the reaction intermediates of H2CO2 (DOM), HCOO-, and CO. The present study is expected to provide valuable insights into the thermocatalytic oxidation of FA over spinel CuMn2O4 materials and their catalytic performances in relation to the key process variables.

Integrated Energy Systems (IES) play a pivotal role in achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. However, previous research in IES operation has mainly focused on energy flow constraints, neglecting the impacts of renewable energy output, energy prices, carbon emission, and storage status. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a Comprehensive Self-Adaptive (CSA) operation strategy as a key component of our two-tier synergistic optimization method, optimizing an IES integrated with Concentrated Photovoltaic/Thermal systems. In the upper-tier capacity configuration, the proposed method considers the full life-cycle carbon emissions of equipment. In the lower-tier operational strategy optimization, the CSA operation strategy automatically adjusts energy generation, utilization, and storage by comprehensively evaluating hourly operating costs, hourly carbon emissions, and hourly storage benefits. Compared to traditional operation strategies and other adaptive methods, the newly developed strategy consistently demonstrates superior performance. When contrasted with separate energy systems, IES operating under the CSA operation strategy markedly stands out, achieving a cost savings rate of 25.87%, a CO2 reduction rate of 61.54%, and an electricity matching ratio of 91.24%. Additionally, the paper explores the performance of the CSA operation strategy across various regions, confirming its feasibility and generalizability under diverse load and irradiance conditions.

Land is a big issue in population dense country like India to implement large scale PV plant, whereas Grid-tied PV system is more economic than off- grid system in long run. The solar energy mission of the country will be success- ful if more and more small-scale rooftop plant will be developed. To address this issue and to find out different aspects of small-scale rooftop grid-tied PV plants, a 1kWp rooftop grid-tied PV plant is developed and different aspects of the plant on changed climate condition are studied. The study on the plant performance revealed that panel efficiency, inverter efficiency and overall system efficiency are 12.55%, 94.94% and 11.86% respectively. Array Yield, Reference Yield and final Yield of the plant are found to be 4.74,5.002 and 4.45 respectively. Also, authors analyzed capture loss, system loss and performance ratio are found to be 0.262,0.29 and 0.89 respectively. Reduction of the overall plant efficiency due to dust accumulation over the panels with changed climate condition is 0.6% for lower radiation levels and 1.6% for higher radiation levels after 4 consecutive non-cleaning days in Kolkata. Overall efficiency drops to 6.45% from 12.545% for continuous 60 non- cleaning days. From the environmental point of view the plant generates around 1149.75 kWh of electricity and fed to the grid which in turn reduces around 0.9 tons of CO2 to mix with the atmosphere annually. Apart from that the system has been compared with the simulation study in PV sol soft- ware and the production forecast, panel temperature and performance ratio has been carried out for annual basis. The payback period of the plant is evaluated as 11 years which is far less than the total life span of the plant which is 25 years. So, the results from the study sound positive for small scale grid-tied rooftop plants.

The wind tower is a sustainable architectural solution designed to improve natural ventilation and thermal comfort in buildings while reducing energy consumption. This study examines thermal comfort, natural ventilation, and heat transfer in a wind tower-room system with air humidification, such that the interaction of mixed convection with these parameters can be linked. The performance of the system is evaluated considering both natural and forced convection, influenced by differential heating and air inlet through the tower, respectively. A parametric analysis explores various parameters like outside air temperature, humidity, and velocity, along with room wall temperatures. Reynolds and Grashof numbers range from 8.57×103-1.99×105 and 2.20×109-1.31×1010, respectively. Simulations are validated against experimental data, with deviations under 5.0%, 10.0%, and 19.6% for dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and air velocity. The system shows improved heat extraction efficiency under dominant forced convection conditions. Humidification yields PPD values between 10.0% to 46.0% and PMV values below 0 at air temperatures range 25.0-30.0 °C. At air temperatures of 35.0 °C with air humidity below 40.0%, PPD values remain below 20.0%. However, above 40% humidity, humidification is less effective. The air exchange effectiveness reduction due to humidification is minimal at 0.61%. These results illustrate the combination of parameters necessary for the optimal performance of the tower-room system, this study provides a valuable guide for integrating wind towers with humidification systems in building design and contributing to reduced electricity use and CO2 emissions.

Introduction Surgical cap attire plays an important role in creating a safe and sterile environment in procedural suites, thus the choice of reusable versus disposable caps has become an issue of much debate. Given the lack of evidence for differences in surgical site infection (SSI) risk between the two, selecting the cap option with a lower carbon footprint may reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures. However, many institutions continue to recommend the use of disposable bouffant caps. Methods ISO-14044 guidelines were used to complete a process-based life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impact of disposable bouffant caps and reusable cotton caps, specifically focusing on CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions, water use and health impacts. Results Reusable cotton caps reduced CO2e emissions by 79% when compared to disposable bouffant caps (10 kg versus 49 kg CO2e) under the base model scenario with a similar reduction seen in disability-adjusted life years. However, cotton caps were found to be more water intensive than bouffant caps (67.56 L versus 12.66 L) with the majority of water use secondary to production or manufacturing. Conclusions Reusable cotton caps have lower total lifetime CO2e emissions compared to disposable bouffant caps across multiple use scenarios. Given the lack of evidence suggesting a superior choice for surgical site infection prevention, guidelines should recommend reusable cotton caps to reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures.

Microalgae are an excellent carbon concentrators with substantial lipid content. However, biomass production vis-à-vis lipid hyperaccumulation is a major constraint in the biofuel economy. In this regard, Dunaliella salina, an oleaginous, wall less microalga, was grown in graded concentration of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). There was a significant increase in biomass (1.57-fold), photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm = 0.72), and chlorophyll a content in 0.25 mg/L IAA supplemented cultures over the control (stage I). However, supplementation of IAA under nitrogen deprivation (stage II) led to a significant rise in the lipid content (47 % DCW), carbohydrate (18.37 %) and simultaneous reduction in the oxidative status (MDA, H2O2, O2·−, OH·) over the control. Further, 0.25 mg/L IAA supplemented cultures under nitrogen starvation were undertaken for biomass and lipid characterization. Nile red based flow cytometric analysis revealed an apparent increase in the neutral lipid fluorescence, also validated by 1H- NMR based lipidome, revealing the presence of triacylglycerol (TAG, 4.12–4.31 ppm). FTIR spectra revealed the increased absorbance at 2926 cm−1, 1740 cm−1 and 1025 cm−1, validating the increased carbohydrate and lipid, while biomass pyrolysis showed 81.42 % decomposition in the active pyrolytic zone as recorded by the TGA/DTG analysis. Interestingly, elemental analysis (CHNS) of the biomass showed an increased carbon and hydrogen %, HHV (19.94 MJ kg−1), H/C ratio (1.78), and CO2 fixation rate. Thus, the present study opens new avenues for the economic feasibility of bioenergy/biofuel production from microalgal biomass at commercial scale.

The emission factor method (Tier 1) recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is commonly used to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock and poultry farms. However, the estimation accuracy may vary due to practical differences in manure management across China. The objectives of this study were to estimate the direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from dairy manure management between 1990 and 2021 in China and characterize its spatial and temporal variations following IPCC guideline Tier 2. The N2O emission factor (EF) of dairy cow manure management systems was determined at the national level and regional level as well. The results showed that the national cumulative N2O emission of manure management from 1990 to 2021 was 113.1million tons of CO2 equivalent, ranging from 90.3 to 135.9 million tons with an uncertainty of ±20.2%. The annual EF was 0.021 kg N2O-N (kg N)−1 for total emissions, while it was 0.014 kg N2O-N (kg N)−1 for direct emissions. The proportions of N2O emissions in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central and Southern China, Southwest China and Northwest China were 32.3%, 18.6%, 11.4%, 5.8%, 6.1% and 25.8%, respectively. In addition, N2O emissions varied among farms in different scales. The respective proportions of total N2O emissions from small-scale and large-scale farms were 64.8% and 35.2% in the past three decades. With the improvement in farm management and milk production efficiency, the N2O emissions per unit mass of milk decreased from 0.77 × 10−3 kg to 0.48 × 10−3 kg in 1990–2021. This study may provide important insights into compiling a GHG emission inventory and developing GHG emission reduction strategies for the dairy farming system in China.

Стратегия замены клинкера активными минеральными добавками (АМД) представляется кратчайшим путем к дости­жению целей устойчивого развития, требующим минимальных капиталовложений. Внедрение кальцинированных глин в каче­стве АМД в российской цементной промышленности позволило бы увеличить производство цементов для всех областей применения. Предварительный анализ геологии глин на террито­рии РФ показывает, что химический и минеральный состав глин некоторых выявленных месторождений позволяет использовать их для производства обожженных глин. Эти месторождения глины находятся близко к существующим цементным заводам, благодаря чему могут эксплуатироваться в промышленных мас­штабах. Сочетание прокаленной глины и известняка становится очень привлекательным для частичной замены клинкера в це­менте. Цементы, в состав которых входят эти компоненты, могут достигать таких же характеристик, как у портландцемента без минеральных добавок, при содержании клинкера всего 50 %. Использование обожженной глины и известняка как заменителей клинкера приводит к сокращению выбросов углекислого газа на 35—45 % по сравнению с эталонными показателями, до 400—500 кг CO2 на 1 т цемента. Внедрение технологии производства цементов, содержащих известняк и кальцинированную глину (Limestone Calcined Clay Cement, LC3) могло бы стать интересной возможностью для цементных компаний в РФ, поскольку оно позволяет им переоборудовать в установки прокаливания глины те печи обжига клинкера, которые недостаточно эффективны, и увеличить производство цемента. РФ обладает необходимыми ресурсами и технологическим потенциалом для того, чтобы стать мировым лидером в производстве LC3. The strategy of substituting clinker by supplementary cementitious materials, SCM appears to be the shortest and less capital-intensive path to sustainability. Introducing calcined clays as SCMs in the Russian cement industry will facilitate the production of cements that can be used in all applications. A preliminary analysis of the geology of clays within the Russian Federation shows that several of the clays identified comply with chemical requirements to be used for the production of calcined clays. These clay deposits are very close to the existing cement plants, thus making commercial operation feasible. The combination of calcined clay and limestone becomes a very attractive choice for clinker replacement in cement. Cements containing calcined clay and limestone can reach performance of a pure Portland cement with only 50 % of clinker. The use of calcined clay and limestone as substitutes of clinker induces reductions in carbon emissions in the order of 35-45 % compared to benchmark references, with emission figures estimated within 400-500 kg CO2/ ton of cement. Embracing the LC3 technology could represent an interesting opportunity for cement companies in the Russian Federation to convert their inefficient clinker kilns to clay calciners, and increase cement production with current clinker availability. The Russian Federation has the necessary resources and the potential in technology to become a world leader in the production of LC3 cement.

Boosting solutions such as turbochargers are one of the popular technologies in the development of IC engines. Turbochargers date back to their usage on aircraft engines in the early nineteenth century and started usage in heavy-duty Caterpillar engines in 1954. Later they were introduced in passenger car applications in the early 1960s and became more popular after the 1990s due to the usage of high-power density engines in passenger cars. Popular technologies in engine air management systems such as variable valve timing (VVT), supercharging, turbocharging and intercooling have significantly improved engine power-to-weight and power-to-displacement ratios. Turbocharging internal combustion engine is widely recognized as one of the best and most cost-effective technologies for the enhanced benefits in power density, low-end torque, fuel consumption (CO2 emissions), transient performance etc. Basis the benefits of fuel efficiency from turbocharging, it is considered as one of the key technologies to adopt for CAFE standards (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) with downsized engines. Globally turbocharging has gained popularity and higher penetration year on year in diesel, gasoline, and bi-fuel /Natural gas engine types. The boosting system has been undergoing upgradation with various add-on features to meet performance and emission needs. The introduction of emission norms like RDE (Real Driving Emission) drives engines to optimise for a reduction in scavenging, maintain λ = 1 in full operations and usage of the gas particulate filter to meet the Particulate number (PN) limit. In gasoline engines, there is a need to incorporate advanced combustion technologies like Miller/Atkinson and Low-Pressure Exhaust Gas Recirculation (LPEGR), with lean burn combustion for improved fuel economy. In this chapter, the benefits and challenges of the turbocharger boosting system and its integration into the gasoline engine are described. Additionally, the simpler ways of modelling the engine air management system to help the selection of the right boosting solutions are described.

Abstract Fractured reservoir simulation is important and applicable to understand many processes related to subsurface geo-energy recovery and storage, such as shale gas/oil, enhanced geothermal systems, and CO2 sequestration in basaltic rocks. However, such simulations are often computationally expensive to capture the high contrast of permeability and pore volume between matrix and fracture. Therefore, a reduced order model (ROM) can be extremely beneficial for fractured reservoir simulation to reduce computational costs for iterative history-matching and reservoir optimization workflows. In this study, we propose a novel ROM that flexibly honors fracture representations, namely DiagNet. In DiagNet, we generate the coarse matrix nodes based on the reservoir outlines, and add extra diagonal connections between non-neighboring matrix nodes if intersecting fractures traverse them, which avoids the inclusion of additional fracture nodes. Since dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can facilitate the model parameterization, we adopt PCA to generate quality priors for sampling of the matrix transmissibility and pore volume arrays. Further, the DiagNet models are then calibrated to the well observation data (such as well flow rates and bottom-hole pressures), and a gradient-based optimization method is implemented in a general automatic-differentiable simulator framework to tune the model parameters (e.g., matrix/fracture transmissibilities, pore volumes, and well indices). Our results show that we can perform robust calibration of DiagNet based on the synthetic well observation data from a fine-scale reference simulation model. We have found that it is necessary to incorporate the dominant flow physics (i.e., water breakthrough) from the observation data to improve the training convergence and the prediction accuracy for DiagNet. Further, PCA for parameterization improves the convergence rate of model calibration, as compared to random initialization. Interpretation of the calibrated transmissibility field from DiagNet aligns with high connectivity regions from the fine-scale reference model. As a result, the new DiagNet is interpretable in terms of reservoir connectivity or geology and thus can be used for reservoir history-matching using observation data from the field and the further optimization.

In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the capacity to generate energy faces significant hurdles. Despite efforts to integrate renewable energy sources and natural gas power plants into the energy portfolio, the desired reduction in environmental impact and alleviation of energy poverty remain elusive. Hence, exploring a spectrum of hybrid technologies, encompassing storage and hydrogen-based solutions, is imperative to optimize energy production while mitigating harmful emissions. To exemplify this necessity, the 216 MW Kribi gas power plant in Cameroon is the case study. The primary aim is to investigate cutting-edge emissions and energy schemes within the SSA. This paper assessed the minimum complaint load technique and four power-to-fuel options from technical, financial, and environmental perspectives to assess the viability of a natural gas fuel system powered with hydrogen in a hybrid mode. The system generates hydrogen by using water electrolysis, with photovoltaic electricity and gas power plant. This research also assesses process efficiency, storage capacity, annual costs, carbon avoided costs, and production prices for various fuels. Results showed that the LCOE from a photovoltaic solar plant is 0.19$/kWh, with the Power-to-Hydrogen process (76.2% efficiency) being the most efficient, followed by the ammonia and urea processes. The study gives a detailed examination of the hybrid hydrogen natural gas fuel system. According to the annual cost breakdown, the primary costs are associated with the acquisition of electrical energy and electrolyser CAPEX and OPEX, which account for 95% of total costs. Urea is the cheapest mass fuel. However, it costs more in terms of energy. Hydrogen is the most cost-effective source of energy. In terms of energy storage and energy density by volume, the methane resulted as the most suitable solution, while the ammonia resulted as the best H2 storage medium in terms of kg of H2 per m3 of storage (108 kgH2/m3). By substituting the fuel system with 15% H2, the environmental effects are reduced by 1622 tons per year, while carbon capture technology gathered 16,664 tons of CO2 for methanation and urea operations, yielding a total carbon averted cost of 21 $/ton.

A large number of oceanic metagenomic data and environmental metadata have been published. However, most studies focused on limited ecosystems using different analysis tools, making it challenging to integrate these data into robust results and comprehensive global understanding of marine microbiome. Here, we constructed a systematic and quantitative analysis platform, the Microbiome Atlas/Sino-Hydrosphere for Ocean Ecosystem (MASH-Ocean: https://www.biosino.org/mash-ocean/), by integrating global marine metagenomic data and a unified data processing flow. MASH-Ocean 1.0 comprises 2147 metagenomic samples with five analysis modules: sample view, diversity, function, biogeography, and interaction network. This platform provides convenient and stable support for researchers in microbiology, environmental science, and biogeochemistry, to ensure the integration of omics data generated from hydrosphere ecosystems, to bridge the gap between elusive omics data and biological, ecological, and geological discovery, ultimately to foster the formation of a comprehensive atlas for aquatic environments. Oceans account for approximately 71% of the total surface area of Earth, making them the largest habitats for life on this planet. They contribute to over 90% of the total volume of the biosphere and are responsible for nearly half of the global total primary productivity [1]. It has been estimated that marine ecosystems host a remarkable number of over 1029 bacterial and archaeal cells [2]. These microbes exhibit vast diversity and are ubiquitously distributed across various oceanic environments, including both sea water and subsurface from intertidal zone, euphotic layer, and deep sea. Moreover, they thrive in special geological areas such as hydrothermal vents, cold seep regions, subduction zones, and oceanic crust. Active biogeochemical cycling mediated by these microorganisms through their carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolisms can directly influence the Earth's climate [3]. Therefore, it is critical to understand the diversity, function, and biogeography of marine microbiome. With the ongoing advancements in oceanic sampling technologies and high-throughput sequencing platforms in recent years, scientists have discovered a wide variety of microorganisms with different ecological and geological functions in various marine habitats [4]. Microorganisms inhabiting distinct ecological niches may specifically play key roles in driving certain geochemical cycles and mediating the fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur among sediment, sea water, and atmosphere [3]. Currently, an increasing number of metagenomic studies focusing on various types of oceanic environments have been reported [5]. For example, in sea water, archaea, bacteria, protist, and virus have been found to play significant roles in influencing the release of organic matter, mineralization, and fixation of carbon dioxide [6]. In sediments, the abundance and diversity of microorganisms is much higher than that in marine water bodies and primarily facilitates the anaerobic degradation of organic matter, sulfate reduction, methane production, and oxidation [7]. In summary, the analyses of multiple omics data have revealed a significant presence of microorganisms in oceanic environments that actively participate in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur elements. Although high-throughput metagenomic sequencing technology has greatly promoted microbiological research, each individual study has employed different analytical processes. These analysis results often show substantial heterogeneity when compared with each other. Only by accumulating and analyzing metagenomic data in a standard way, scientists would be able to reach robust conclusions and generate comparable results. Several platforms, such as Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) [8] and Marine Metagenomics Portal (MMP) [9], support preliminary analysis of metagenomic or genomic data. Recent developments of online microbiome analysis platforms, for example, Wekemo Bioincloud [10] and MicrobiomeAnalyst [11], have also facilitated researchers in exploring the biological significance of metagenomic samples by providing multiple analysis tools and interactive visualization capabilities. Nevertheless, a gap still exists between elusive omics data and biological, ecological, and geological discovery. Here, we have established an online microbiome platform called the Microbiome Atlas/Sino-Hydrosphere for Ocean Ecosystems (MASH-Ocean, https://www.biosino.org/mash-ocean/), aiming to bridge this gap and achieve standardized, interactive analyses of massive metagenomic data, and to explore the knowledge atlas related to microbial mediated oceanic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. MASH-Ocean is a website-based platform (Figure 1A). This platform collects public metagenome data related to global marine environments and assembles and annotates these data with a uniform standard bioinformatic workflow. The current database contains annotations of microbial taxonomic features derived from metagenomic reads and metabolic functional features from assembled metagenomic contigs. These results can be visualized by online users without the well-established knowledge of bioinformatics and omics. Three major advantages of the MASH-Ocean platform are microbial diversity analysis, metabolic feature reconstruction and comparison using selectable metagenomic datasets globally, as well as interactive visualization of global distribution of the selected functional genes or microbial species (Movie S1). All data within MASH-Ocean 1.0 was collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and the National Omics Data Encyclopedia (NODE) databases (https://www.biosino.org/node/) by September 2020 with a total of 75 keywords (Table S1). Metagenomes were also filtered out manually by their size (below 200 MB), descriptions such as "enriched," "metatranscriptome," and "amplicon," as well as the restricted datasets from DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI). In total, 2147 samples from different marine environments were selected for further analyses to build a basic knowledge pool for MASH-Ocean 1.0 (Figure 1B). Additionally, MASH-Ocean keeps downloading and filtering public oceanic metagenomic data to maintain and update this platform. The second batch of data (September 2023) has been downloaded and is under the analyzing process. The MASH-Ocean 1.0 workflow encompasses both reads-level and contigs-level analyses (Figure 1C,D). Specifically, the platform currently hosts two primary data categories: "clean reads" consisting of 210 billion sequences (totaling 44.2 trillion base pairs) and "contigs" comprising 257 million sequences (totaling 555.3 billion base pairs). For microbial taxonomy analysis, trimmed metagenomic reads were annotated by Kraken2 v2.1.3 [12], and the abundance was estimated by Bracken v2.6.1 [13]. For metabolic feature analysis, the trimmed reads were assembled by MEGAHIT v1.2.9 [14]. The contigs coverage was calculated by mapping the trimmed reads to each contig using BBMap v38.18 [15]. All contigs were subjected to open reading frame (ORF) prediction with Prodigal v2.6.3 [16]. The predicted ORFs were annotated by eggNOG database [17]. On this platform, all samples can be found in "Sample view" section on the website. The table here shows 10 key information of samples. Users can locate specific samples or narrow down the sample pool by providing key information in the navigation panel (Figure 1B). For the fields of Run/Project/Sample ID, we provide a field matching search mode, allowing users to match all complete fields and help them select the appropriate item by typing in part of the string. For the fields of Habitat source, Env Zone, Env Medium, Fraction, and Location, we provide a composite selection method that combines field matching with a drop-down box to provide users with a convenient operation experience. Flexible selections are also supported by providing a drag bar with information of longitude, latitude, and water depth. The selected samples can be displayed on a global topographic map by clicking on the "Display Map" button, located at the top right of the sample table, to easily obtain a panoramic view of sample distribution. MASH-Ocean also provides a comprehensive diversity analysis using taxonomic information produced through the annotation of metagenomic reads. Users can either generate microbial diversity profiles at different taxonomic levels or statistically compare the diversity among different samples by setting up distinct groups. In general, this platform allows users to establish five groups in total to carry out the diversity comparison, with at least three selected samples in each group. The diversity statistical comparison results can be divided into different taxonomic levels, that is, archaea, bacteria, eukaryota, and viruses, each of which contains six ranks including Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. In total, four types of comparisons are included in the platform (Figure 2A). The first diagram is the taxonomic composition of the selected samples calculated by Kraken2 and Bracken programs. The second analysis is the ranking of taxonomically distinctive members between different groups, which is calculated by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe). The third analysis is the heatmap of beta-diversity distances using Jaccard or Bray-Curtis matrix, and a principal coordinates analysis of all selected samples will also be calculated and displayed by using the beta-diversity distances. The function analysis is designed for the visualization of the presence and abundance of key genes and modules from the major carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolic functional pathways of selected samples. These pathways are critical for global biogeochemical cycling and may therefore influence the Earth's climate. The function analysis module allows users to integrate their own data set with the MASH-Ocean database through three options. One can upload a file with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) list with the sequencing depth corresponding to those KOs. Users can also upload a file with the predicted ORFs ID and annotated KOs, as well as a sequencing depth file together. The final result will be displayed as a KEGG map, and the relative abundance of metabolic functional genes are shown in red gradient color (Figure 2B). If the number of uploaded or selected samples exceeds three, the relative abundance of metabolic functional genes and further distilled KEGG modules will be displayed in a heatmap for better exhibition. MASH-Ocean contains the function of interactive biogeography visualization and analysis. It supports global distribution display for both microbial species and metabolic functional genes. For microbial species analysis, users can either enter a species name or upload a genome to check their global distribution pattern in all or selected metagenomic data set in MASH-Ocean (Figure 2C). MASH-Ocean also allows users to upload their genomes and will be classified using GTDB-Tk version 2.3.2 [18] for taxonomic assignment. Similarly, for metabolic functional genes, one can select the gene name provided within the website or enter a KO entry and then it will be displayed on the global map on our website. MASH-Ocean also contains the function of interactive network visualization. Six pre-established global microbial co-occurrence networks on the species, genus, family, order, class, and phylum levels were integrated. If users focus on the interaction of one or several specific microbes in the global oceanic microbial network, they can enter the name or taxonomic ranks of the microbe. Then this microbe will be highlighted in the entire network and users can either download the complete network or the network of their focused microbe (Figure 2D). The co-occurrence networks were generated using FastSpar v1.0.0 [19] and iDIRECT [20], and parameters are listed in Table S2. MASH-Ocean takes approximately 10–50 min to process the diversity analysis module (Figure 2E), depending on the scale of analysis (ranging from 6 to 150 samples). For the function analysis and biogeography module, the time requirements vary due to the time-consuming sequence preprocessing steps. For instance, when annotating metabolic functions in the function analysis module, MASH-Ocean requires around 1 h for one file with size ~50 MB. In contrast, other modes complete this task in less than 5 min. For the biogeography module, MASH-Ocean processes one genome file in approximately 35 min, and a protein sequence file in about 10 min, while other modes complete tasks with similar sample scales in less than 20 s. As the initiative platform for the MASH project in China, MASH-Ocean offers a convenient and stable service to ensure the integration of omics data generated from hydrosphere ecosystems. In comparison to existing omics online servers, such as IMG/M [8], which focused mainly on storage of metagenomic data with limited capabilities in systematic comparison and visualization, while Wekemo Bioincloud [10] or MicrobiomeAnalyst [11] that specifically provided online analysis tools for meta-omics, MASH-Ocean is designed to provide exploratory insights from a big data perspective for researchers through a one-station service. In the future, besides ocean ecosystems, MASH will include other hydrosphere ecosystems such as wetlands, lakes, rivers, and so on. For the MASH-Ocean platform, there are three aspects that will be upgraded in the coming years. First, the data collection process will continue to accommodate more publicly available resources. Second, except for metagenome, we will include published metatranscriptome data in the future version. Third, we also aim to include microbial genomic data to enhance the integrity of MASH-Ocean. Last but not the least, we will further closely cooperate with other databases and online analysis platforms such as the integrated microbiome analysis cloud platform, an eLibrary of Microbial Systematics and Genomics, NODE databases to enlarge and diversify the content of the MASH-Ocean platform.
