Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to highly value‐added C2+ fuels or chemicals is a promising pathway to address environment issues and energy crisis. In the periodic table, Cu as only the candidate can convert CO2 to C2+ products such as C2H4 and C2H5OH due to the suitable absorption energy to reaction intermediate. Application of Cu is limited for its low activity and poor selectivity. The tandem catalytic strategy can effectively solve the problems caused by single copper catalyst. In tandem catalysis, how to promote the formation, transport, adsorption and coupling of the important intermediate CO is the key issue to improve the selectivity of C2+ products. Regulating structure of Cu‐based bimetallic can effectively promote processes to Electrochemical CO2RR on account of its synergistic effect, electronic effect. In this review, we systematically summarized the relationship between structure of Cu‐based bimetallic catalysts with performance of electrochemical CO2RR. More importantly, we reveal that different Cu‐based bimetallic structures enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts by regulating the processes such as the transport and adsorption of reaction intermediate CO. We proposed well‐effective strategies to rationally design Cu‐based metallic catalysts. We put forward some challenges and opportunities that Cu‐based bimetallic catalysts in future.

Abstract CO 2 -to-CO electrolyzer technology converts carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide using electrochemical methods, offering significant environmental and energy benefits by aiding in greenhouse gas mitigation and promoting a carbon circular economy. Recent study by Strasser et al. in Nature Chemical Engineering presents a high-performance CO 2 -to-CO electrolyzer utilizing a NiNC catalyst with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency, employing innovative diagnostic tools like the carbon crossover coefficient (CCC) to address transport-related failures and optimize overall efficiency. Strasser’s research demonstrates the potential of NiNC catalysts, particularly NiNC-IMI, for efficient CO production in CO 2 -to-CO electrolyzers, highlighting their high selectivity and performance. However, challenges such as localized CO 2 depletion and mass transport limitations underscore the need for further optimization and development of diagnostic tools like CCC. Strategies for optimizing catalyst structure and operational parameters offer avenues for enhancing the performance and reliability of electrochemical CO 2 reduction catalysts.

Abstract As a frontier method for adjusting the electronic and geometric configurations of metal sites, lattice strain engineering plays a key role in regulating the interaction between catalytic surface and adsorbed molecules. Here, the research progress of strain effects in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is reviewed. Starting from the basic principles of strain effects in the CO 2 RR, the advanced in situ characterization techniques are summarized. The key effect of strain on the structure–activity relationship in CO 2 RR is comprehensively discussed. Subsequently, the electrocatalysts with different properties rich in strain are classified, including core–shell structure catalysts, alloys, transition metal compounds, and single‐atom catalysts. Finally, the obstacles encountered in the practical application of strain effect are proposed, and the future research direction of this emerging field is prospected.

In this study, Cleaner Production (CP) strategy and Carbon Emission Pinch Analysis (CEPA) were used to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission generated in printing industry. CP audit was conducted in a printing premise to quantify the consumption of materials and energy, waste generated and other aspect such as safety and productivity. The amount of CO2 emission generated from the operations and activities in the premise was estimated to identify key issues. Subsequently, CP options were identified to overcome the issues. Feasibility studies were conducted for each option identified to evaluate the reduction of CO2 emission and monetary returns. The study revealed that a total of 0.8 kg CO2 emission was generated per kg of paper processed, where electricity consumption was the main contributor. A total of eight CP options were identified and evaluated to reduce CO2 emission generated from the electricity consumption and solid waste generation. Implementations of the suggested CP options are expected to potentially reduce the CO2 emission to 0.7 tons CO2/kg of processed paper, which is a reduction of 78%. The CEPA study also demonstrated that a saving of 211,194 kWh/month of electricity and a reduction of CO2 emission of 141.5 tons/month (68%) from the total emission of 209 tons/month could be achieved. There are four CP options can be implemented without any cost incurred, with expected CO2 emission reduction of 96.5 tons/month. Hence, the case study proves that it is possible to reduce CO2 emission in printing premise by implementing CP and CEPA.

As the global economy transitions towards carbon neutrality, innovative secondary energy sources are becoming increasingly pivotal. Hydrogen derived from zero-carbon power and synthetic fuels produced by bonding carbon dioxide (CO2) with hydrogen—hereafter referred to as Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) fuels in this article—are expected to complement electricity as critical components in this transition. However, to incentivise the use of these alternatives, mechanisms must be in place to ensure that their adoption effectively translates into reductions in CO2 emissions for users. With this in mind, this paper reviews the current issues related to the ‘attribution’ of GHG emissions or emission reductions for CCU fuels, reviews the current status and developments of the various relevant schemes, and identifies their challenges. It then categorises and proposes solutions: CCU fuel characteristics and challenges arising from its counting methods: CCU fuels are attracting attention for their potential as a new energy source that does not require changes to existing fossil fuel infrastructure and utilisation equipment. Although CCU fuels emit CO2 during combustion, their CO2 is recovered from what would otherwise be in the atmosphere, so long as the carbon content (C) of the fuel is focused on, fuel use does not increase global CO2 emissions. However, as long as the conventional counting rule—emissions are attributed to the physical emitting point—is applied, the fuel users are not incentivised to choose CCU fuels since they are identical to the fossil fuels under the rule. In order to design a system that promotes the use of CCU fuels, it is necessary to consider how to count the CO2 emissions associated with the production and use of CCU fuels, not bound by conventional approaches. In particular, clear international rules need to be set on which countries get the value of the emission reductions when they are traded crossing national borders. Approaches to international rule-making: Currently, the IPCC, ISO, EU, Japan and others are working on guidelines and rules directly or indirectly related to the handling of CCU fuels. Based on theoretical considerations and taking into account the content of these developments, this paper proposes the following approach: • Basically, CCU fuels are counted by the user as fuels with zero emission factor during combustion. At the same time, at the origin of the CCU fuel, the counting method is adopted: ‘CO2 captured and used for CCU fuel synthesis is considered as not captured for convenience’; • At the national level, possible approaches include (1) rule setting on the National GHG Inventory (IPCC Guidelines and relevant CMA decisions), which is used for accounting for the achievement of NDC targets; (2) adoption of national rules; and (3) transfer of ITMOs through bilateral agreements; • It is best to set national rules for companies in each country that are also consistent with them; and • Technically, the key point is how to guarantee “being CCU fuel” in the rules, such as certification of origin, and its emittability of captured CO2 in the baseline. The potential of CCU fuels can be maximised if the rules are set up in a way that is as easy to understand, common and workable as possible. To this end, instead of simply waiting for the completion of the IPCC methodology report and the subsequent discussions in the CMA of the Paris Agreement, it is desirable to continue to provide opportunities for all stakeholders, including governments and industry, to engage in dialogue and harmonise the rules, and to support discussions in the IPCC and UNFCCC.

The direct CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) from simulated flue gas of various CO2 concentrations could minimize extra energy for pre‐concentration processes to highly concentrated CO2 as a feed­stock. We investigate the challenges for CO2RR caused by low CO2 concentrations and provide strategies concerning the impact of the chosen electrocatalyst material and the selection of the electrolyte to attain high CO selectivity. We continuously feed CO2 mixed with N2 (the typical dilutant in flue gas) in various ratios to gas diffusion electrodes in a model flow‐through electrolyzer. Operating the CO2RR at lower CO2 concentrations results in an overpotential shift to more cathodic values. We show that higher active catalysts can maintain high CO selectivity down to 5% CO2 by using Ag‐ and NiCu‐based catalysts. NiCu reached its limit when the CO2 concentration was lowered to 2%, due to low CO2 availability and competition of carbonate formation. Employing near‐neutral electrolytes with buffering capacity, we maintained high Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials and higher CO2 utilization at low CO2 concentration.

The proceeding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires the formation of active hydrogen species for CO2 protonation, while traditional catalysts fail to balance the rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. Herein, we propose a “hydrogen on demand” mechanism, in which the polarity of the adsorbed CO2 is enhanced to allow the capture of hydrogen from water without forming free hydrogen species, realizing the matching rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. As a proof of concept, we construct Zn–N sites modified by Se atoms, allowing the proceeding of CO2RR under the “hydrogen on demand” mechanism with superior efficiency. The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of −539.7 mA cm−2, faradaic efficiencies of CO > 90% over a broad window from −0.5 to −1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6 × 104 h−1 in flow cell. In‐situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO2− with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.

With the extensive use of fossil fuels and CO2 emission, the development of effective electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into high‐value‐added chemical products has become an important issue in academia community. Single‐atom alloys (SAA) integrate the advantages of single‐atoms catalysts and alloys, which can improve the activity and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) by adjusting the electronic and geometric structure of the host and guest metals simultaneously. This article provides a comprehensive review on the research advances of SAA catalysts used for CO2RR, including the synthesis and characterizations, computational design, experimental performances, and electronic structure effects of different SAA. Specifically, the correlations between experimental results and theoretical studies have been highlighted and discussed clearly in this review, which provide unique fundamental insights on the CO2RR performances of SAA catalysts. Based on these understanding, we finally propose a workflow combining both computational and experimental methods to rationally design the SAA, which can help the further development of CO2RR catalysts in the future.

Operando analysis is crucial for understanding the selectivity and stability of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Existing operando techniques normally adapt single-compartment cells operating at low currents. However, high current densities on the order of 100 mA cm-2 are required for practical applications, and under these conditions, selectivity and reaction pathways can differ. Here, we developed an inline operando NMR method compatible with high-current reaction conditions. Demonstrating on a copper-catalyzed eCO2RR at a current of 100 mA cm-2, our NMR study revealed a fast decrease of Faradaic efficiency for formate and ethanol within the first few hours of reaction, accompanied by a pH decrease from 14 to 8 within the first hour and a continuous concentration increase of bicarbonate. At 200 mA cm-2, the bicarbonate concentration reached the saturation point of 3.34 M within five hours. Water crossover was simultaneously observed and quantified via a deuteration technique and showed a strong current dependency. Our NMR observations revealed a highly dynamic environment of copper-catalyzed eCO2RR at high currents and will further aid the design and optimization of this reaction. Using on a common flow cell and a benchtop NMR system, the new operando approach is accessible by non-NMR experts and readily applicable to a wide range of catalysts, electrolyte compositions and reactor designs for eCO2RR.

Operando analysis is crucial for understanding the selectivity and stability of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Existing operando techniques normally adapt single-compartment cells operating at low currents. However, high current densities on the order of 100 mA cm-2 are required for practical applications, and under these conditions, selectivity and reaction pathways can differ. Here, we developed an inline operando NMR method compatible with high-current reaction conditions. Demonstrating on a copper-catalyzed eCO2RR at a current of 100 mA cm-2, our NMR study revealed a fast decrease of Faradaic efficiency for formate and ethanol within the first few hours of reaction, accompanied by a pH decrease from 14 to 8 within the first hour and a continuous concentration increase of bicarbonate. At 200 mA cm-2, the bicarbonate concentration reached the saturation point of 3.34 M within five hours. Water crossover was simultaneously observed and quantified via a deuteration technique and showed a strong current dependency. Our NMR observations revealed a highly dynamic environment of copper-catalyzed eCO2RR at high currents and will further aid the design and optimization of this reaction. Using on a common flow cell and a benchtop NMR system, the new operando approach is accessible by non-NMR experts and readily applicable to a wide range of catalysts, electrolyte compositions and reactor designs for eCO2RR.

The catalytic efficiency of M‐H2tpda pincer complexes (M = Mn(I), Fe(II), Co(III)) in CO2 hydrogenation, emphasizing the role of transition metal center variability have been discussed. The DFT analysis demonstrates that complexes with low αR values form weaker M—H bonds, enhancing catalyst reactivity with the elongation of M—H bond. The analysis further displays excellent catalytic performance for Mn‐H2tpda (ΔE = 20.3 kcal/mol), Fe‐H2tpda (ΔE = 21.0 kcal/mol) and Co‐H2tpda (ΔE = 23.6 kcal/mol) for CO2 to formic acid formation. The Co‐H2tpda (ΔE = 16.7 kcal/mol) is comparatively better than Mn‐H2tpda (ΔE = 20.7 kcal/mol) and Fe‐H2tpda (ΔE = 19.6 kcal/mol) in formaldehyde formation. All three catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the conversion of formaldehyde to methanol. The condensed Fukui function calculations of these catalyst complexes establish direct relationship between the ΔE for the rate limiting catalytic cycle and the electrophilicity of the metal centers. The TOF calculations further helped to understand the catalytic performance of the catalysts at various temperatures.

CO2 emissions from gas-powered cars have a large impact on global warming. The aim of this paper is to develop an accurate estimation method of CO2 emissions from individual private passenger cars by using actual driving data obtained by telematics. CO2 emissions from gas-powered cars vary depending on various factors such as car models and driving behavior. The developed approach uses actual monthly driving data from telematics and vehicle features based on drag force. Machine learning based on random forest regression enables better estimation performance of CO2 emissions compared to conventional multiple linear regression. CO2 emissions from individual private passenger cars in 24 car models are estimated by the machine learning model based on random forest regression using data from telematics, and the coefficient of determination for all 24 car models is R2=0.981. The estimation performance for interpolation and extrapolation of car models is also evaluated, and it keeps enough estimation accuracy with slight performance degradation. The case study with actual telematics data is conducted to analyze the relationship between driving behavior and monthly CO2 emissions in similar driving record conditions. The result shows the possibility of reducing CO2 emissions by eco-driving. The accurate estimation of the reduced amount of CO2 estimated by the machine learning model enables valuing it as carbon credits to motivate the eco-driving of individual drivers.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect, and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by about 50% since the Industrial Revolution. The signs of global warming are everywhere, and solving this problem requires analyzing the trend of CO2 concentration and its impact on global temperature. This report will establish mathematical models to verify the accuracy of CO2 concentration and analyze the feasibility of new models. At the same time, two models will be constructed to explore the relationship between global temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration and predict future trends. The results showed that the trend of carbon dioxide concentration is constantly increasing, whereas the trend of land-ocean temperature appears to be periodic. Pearson correlation analysis found that carbon dioxide was linearly correlated with temperature height, and linear regression further visualized this relationship. The forecast data show that carbon reduction needs to be taken seriously, or the consequences are serious, and both individuals and governments should take measures.

Commencing nearly a decade ago, the scientific literature has shown that changes in the concentration of water vapor, a greenhouse gas with a heating power 400 times greater than carbon dioxide, CO2, closely match changes in the average global temperature. The foregoing notwithstanding, while there is no correlation between changes in the average global temperature and changes in the concentration of CO2; still a large community of interests including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), academia, agencies of government, various research institutions and enterprises, tens of thousands of scientists, public officials and policy makers which have worked for over three decades without proof, continue to assert that it is the increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2 that drives global warming. Thus, the myopic focus of this de-carbon community remains reducing carbon emissions. This is a major problem, because, while the data and the physics have clearly shown that when the global concentration of water vapor is reduced, the result is global cooling and reductions in catastrophic weather. and these relationships have not been discussed in the preeminent scientific literature. As a direct consequence, no steps to drive increased precipitation to reduce the concentration of water vapor have been undertaken. As each year passes, the size of the reduction sufficient to reverse global warming grows, thus, increasing the time necessary to effect this, whichmay take decades as annual devastation from catastrophic weather increases at a rate of $45 bn US every decade. To fight climate change, the policy must change to focus on encouraging the development of effective, efficient and sufficient means of increasing precipitation.

Human activities have caused a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, leading to greater absorption of CO2 by oceans and causing ocean acidification. This phenomenon, marked by a reduction in pH, represents substantial risks to marine ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. Seagrasses are vital elements of coastal ecosystems, performing important functions in carbon storage, stabilizing shorelines, and preserving biodiversity; however, reactions to ocean acidification are not well understood, especially in terms of molecular.This research study examined alterations in gene expression within seagrass meadows, namely the species Cymodocea nodosa, in reaction to simulated ocean acidification conditions. Climate chamber system to adjust CO2 levels to simulate future projections of ocean acidification, specifically following the RCP 8.5 scenario. Gene expression dynamics were assessed by collecting samples at different time intervals across a 36-hour period.Research has demonstrated that genes related to photosynthesis are suppressed quickly after being exposed to increased amounts of CO2. Gene expression levels were found to change often over time, which is crucial for adaptation and acclimatization. However, antioxidant genes have varied responses to ocean acidification, with CAT and SOD being downregulated in distinct ways.Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of seagrass responses to ocean acidification. It highlights the significance of examining short-term responses when evaluating the susceptibility of coastal ecosystems to climate change.

Global warming is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). A metric used to quantify the change in CO2 emissions is the marginal emission factor, defined as the marginal change in CO2 emissions resulting from a marginal change in electricity demand over a specified period. This paper aims to present two methodologies to estimate the marginal emission factor in a decarbonized electricity system with high temporal resolution. First, we present an energy systems model that incrementally calculates the marginal emission factors. Second, we examine a Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model, a statistical model designed to estimate marginal emission factors faster and use an incremental marginal emission factor as a benchmark to assess its precision. For the German electricity market, we estimate the marginal emissions factor time series historically (2019, 2020) using Agora Energiewende and for the future (2025, 2030, and 2040) using estimated energy system data. The results indicate that the Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model is more accurate in estimating marginal emission factors than the Dynamic Linear Regression models, which are frequently used in the literature. Hence, the Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model is a simpler alternative to the computationally intensive incremental marginal emissions factor, especially when short-term marginal emissions factor estimation is needed. The results of the marginal emission factor estimation are applied to an exemplary low-emission vehicle charging scenario to estimate CO2 savings by shifting the charge hours to those corresponding to the lower marginal emissions factor. By implementing this emission-minimized charging approach, an average reduction of 31% in the marginal emission factor was achieved over the 5 years.

Malaysia generates substantial agricultural residues annually, endowing the country with significant biomass energy potential. Palm oil biomass stands out as a promising feedstock. However, its high humidity, bulkiness, low energy density, and dispersed resource locations (mills) pose challenges. A network that consisting collection facilities incorporating pretreatment operations as intermediaries between mills and biorefineries is a plausible solution. Nevertheless, the facility locations directly impact travel distance, overall expenses, and the nearby population. Moreover, vehicle routing during biomass collection influences transportation costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Consequently, this research designs a model to address the location-routing intricacies within a two-echelon biomass supply chain. The model operates as a multi-objective optimization framework, encompassing three-dimensional sustainability assessment, quantified respectively as total cost minimization, CO2 emissions reduction, and minimization of the population affected. The research initially optimizes each objective function individually and subsequently advances to multi-objective optimization employing the weighted sum approach. While single-objective optimization yields optimal outcomes for each dimension, enhancements in one aspect may hinder performance in others. Nonetheless, the multi-objective optimization provides insight into the trade-offs among the sustainability objectives. The computational findings demonstrate the model could adapt the network configuration in alignment with distinct sustainability aspirations.

Structural transformations in OECD countries significantly influence carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, affecting economic and social dimensions. These transformations encompass changes in industrial composition, technological progress, energy consumption patterns, and policy frameworks. This research investigates the impact of such structural shifts on CO2 emissions across a panel of 38 OECD countries between 2000 and 2021, using panel cointegration techniques to ensure robust analysis. The study confirms the presence of cross-sectional dependence among countries and establishes long-run cointegration relationships. Results from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) models indicate that renewable energy, advancements in information and communication technology, and structural changes significantly reduce CO2 emissions. In contrast, economic growth, reliance on non-renewable energy, and institutional quality are linked to higher emissions. However, estimates derived from Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) and Mean Group Panel (MGP) methods differ from those of FMOLS and DOLS, underscoring potential methodological variances in evaluating these relationships. This study highlights the pivotal role of structural changes in emission reduction strategies, while also emphasizing the importance of methodological choices in policy analysis. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align economic growth with environmental sustainability within OECD countries. Moreover, the research stresses the necessity of incorporating structural changes into long-term climate strategies to ensure their effectiveness. Future studies could expand the analysis by integrating more recent data and exploring non-linear relationships to refine policy recommendations further.

A reduction in emissions in transportation is paramount to achieve full compliance with the European Union’s 2050 targets. In this framework, a great boost to the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of internal combustion engines fueled by petroleum-derived fuels can be obtained through the adoption of biomass-derived fuels that can be employed in conventional series production engine vehicles. This paper presents the results of an experimental activity on a two-cylinder turbocharged common rail diesel engine, whose main application is for urban mobility, fueled with renewable fuels: Neste MY Renewable Diesel and Eni HVOlution. Aimed at analyzing the potential employment of renewable fuels as drop-in alternative fuels, the engine performance and emissions were investigated under fixed settings of the injection parameters, in the complete range of the engine speed, at the full pedal position. The comparison with the data from tests in which the engine was fueled with fossil diesel highlighted minimal differences in the performance outcomes, while significant differences were observed in the emissions results. In more detail, there were reduced carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (HVO produced using Ecofining™ technology retained better behavior in relation to HVO produced using the NEXBTL™ technology), advantages in hydrocarbon (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (HVO from NESTE Oil performed better than HVO from ENI), a decrease in the particle mass and number emissions (HVO from Ecofining™ technology was characterized by a lower particle number and court mean diameter in relation to HVO from the NEXBTL™ technology). The results highlight that an optimization of the engine settings based on the specific properties of each fuel could allow us to take full advantage of these fuels in reducing the environmental impact of cars.

Between 2013 and 2018, commercial aviation saw a 70% increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, significantly outpacing United Nations projections. This alarming trend is anticipated to continue, with emissions potentially tripling by 2050, driven by economic expansion and an increasing dependence on fossil fuels. In 2022, the aviation industry’s energy consumption reached 12.1 MJ/RTK, with projections forecasting a 2.8 to 3.9-fold increase by 2040. Without a strategic shift towards sustainable alternatives, aviation emissions are expected to reach 2,000 megatons by mid-century, posing a severe threat to global climate stability. This study emphasizes the urgent need for the aviation sector to adopt high-energy, reliable alternative fuels that can mitigate its environmental impact. A comprehensive evaluation and comparison of potential alternative fuels are presented, focusing on their energy densities, production processes, and environmental footprints. The research highlights the potential of these alternatives to meet the industry’s energy demands while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Technological advancements in fuel production and aircraft propulsion are also explored, underscoring their role in achieving meaningful emissions reductions. The study argues that integrating sustainable practices and fostering innovation within the aviation sector are critical for ensuring its long-term sustainability and resilience. By transitioning to alternative fuels and embracing new technologies, the aviation industry can not only address its environmental challenges but also lead the way in global efforts to combat climate change and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The county-to-district reform, as an important measure to break down administrative barriers between cities and counties and promote market integration, raises the question of whether it influences enterprise carbon emissions behaviour. By utilising data from 1992 to 2019 and matching it with patent data for Chinese listed companies, this paper examines the impact of the county-to-district reform on enterprise carbon emissions. The findings show that the reform accelerates market integration, facilitates the free flow of production factors, thus expanding the scale of enterprise production and increasing total carbon dioxide emissions from enterprises. Meanwhile, this process alleviates financing constraints for enterprises and increases the proportion of research and development investment on one hand; on the other hand, the reform intensifies market competition, thereby improving enterprise productivity. Ultimately, this leads to a reduction in overall carbon emission intensity. This phenomenon is particularly evident in non-state-owned enterprises, non-carbon trading pilot regions, northern regions, and small and medium-sized enterprises. This paper explores the impact of changes in China's government power structure on enterprise carbon emissions behaviour, adding to the research on the role of micro-level enterprises in carbon reduction during the county-to-district reform process.

The objective of this study is to investigate the temporal variation of forest cover and carbon stock change within the Middle Awash River Basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the years 1995, 2010, and 2023. The study utilized multi-temporal Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine cloud API platform and employed the Random Forest Algorithm for LULC classification. The above-ground carbon stock in the present study was computed from total forest cover of the basin. The results indicate a significant decline in forest cover within the Basin, which decreased from 1,521.88 km&sup2; in 1995 to 1,174.10 km&sup2; in 2010 and further to 825.20 km&sup2; by 2023. Alongside this reduction, total wood volume and dry matter biomass also experienced declines, with wood volume falling from 876.28 m&sup3; to 676.03 m&sup3;, and then to 475.14 m&sup3;, while dry matter biomass decreased from 376.80 tons to 290.69 tons, and finally to 204.31 tons. These trends highlight a troubling reduction in carbon stock and an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Overall, the gradual decline in carbon stocks and the loss of forest cover within the basin highlight the urgent need to implement effective conservation strategies aimed at restoring and safeguarding the remaining forest ecosystems.

Continuously increasing carbon dioxide concentration is predicted to elevate the earth’s temperature. Elevated temperature is a severe problem for the cultivation of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L ). Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effect of elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2), elevated temperature (eT) and their interactive effect on yield and seed mineral nutrients of two genotypes, i.e., ICC 4958 (desi) and Flip 90-166 (kabuli) of chickpea (C. arietinum L ). The pot experiments were conducted in Open Top Chamber (OTC) for two consecutive years (2019-20 and 2020-21), along with the control placed in ambient natural conditions. The eCO2 (650±50 µl/l) and eT (~4oC) were given individually and in combination. The gaseous exchange was measured at the flowering stage. After harvesting, yield and its parameters, seed protein and mineral nutrients were determined using standard methods. Under eCO2, the photosynthesis of both genotypes was positively affected, ultimately converting to yield (8.8-17.5% increase). However, the effect was more prominent in ICC 4958 than Flip 90-166. Higher temperature only positively affected dry biomass, but that effect was not converted to yield; instead, a reduction occurred in yield (- 12.0 to -26.9% ). In combination with eCO2 and eT, the negative effect of high temperature was ameliorated by eCO2 on yield, augmenting the effects on seed nutrient reduction. Among the seed mineral nutrients, Na, K, Fe and Zn were most reduced (-20.3 to -30.0%) under interactive effect. The findings will help to enhance seed yield with improved mineral nutrient content of chickpea.

Abstract Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by skeletal muscle hypermetabolism following exposure to halogenated anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine. The sustained muscle contraction produces a depletion of adenosine triphosphate, dramatically increasing oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and heat. We present the rare case report of MH diagnosed intraoperatively posted for an open reduction and internal fixation surgery of the right mid-shaft of femur fracture. Unfortunately, the patient developed MH and succumbed. In every hospital set-up where MH-triggering anesthetics are administered, an adequate stock of dantrolene and other medications and rescue equipment must be available to treat the MH crisis.

Systems for direct conversion of captured CO2 into CO (i.e., CO2 capture and reduction: CCR) via bifunctional catalysts have attracted attention as technologies for achieving carbon neutrality. However, the reported systems require additional heating above 623 K, which is still an issue from an ecological perspective. The present work realized selective CO production through CCR under isothermal conditions at 423 K by the application of a direct current electric field and a Pt‐Na/TiO2 catalyst. The application of an electric field to the catalyst is needed for CO2 conversion at low temperature, and the loading of both Pt and Na is required for CO2 capture and its selective reduction to CO. The obtained results open the door for greener CCR technologies that effectively utilize waste heat from power plants and industry.

Background: The treatment of glaucoma often requires numerous therapeutic modalities to achieve the desired reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). Cyclodestructive procedures or ciliary body destruction have been performed using techniques with considerable differences in efficacy and complication rates. Among these methods, cyclocryotherapy is non-invasive and simple for the management of uncontrolled glaucoma in dogs and cats. The objective of this case report is to describe the technique of carbon dioxide cyclocryotherapy to reduce intraocular pressure in dogs and cats with glaucoma.Cases: Nine canine patients and one cat with glaucoma were treated with cyclocryotherapy performed under general anaesthesia. Clinical signs patients included blepharospasm, ocular pain, episcleral congestion and ocular hypertension. The patients showed higher levels of IOP, higher than 30 mmHg. Surgical treatment with general anaesthesia was applied. The pre-anaesthesia protocol included acepromazine 0.05 mg/kg with methadone 0.2 mg/kg, followed by intravenous propofol and maintenance with isoflurane and oxygen. An ophthalmological cryocautery unit was used with carbon dioxide as the cryogenic agent and a retinal cryoprobe of 3.2 mm diameter tip for the procedure. The method used was a double cycle of freezing and thawing for 60 s in each site. The cryoprobe was centred approximately 5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus over the ciliary body. The temperature of each cyclocryotherapy spot was between -60°C and -80°C and each site was maintained in place for 60 s; 4 to 6 spots of the double freeze-thaw cycle were made. This technique did not have any serious complications during or after the application of cryotherapy, but chemosis and hyperaemia of the bulbar conjunctiva developed. Subconjunctival anti-inflammatory steroids were injected to minimise swelling and patient discomfort. Satisfactory results were observed; in all cases, the intraocular pressure decreased, with the usual result being a cosmetic and painless eye. Discussion: Even with recent surgical and medical advances, pain and blindness are still common occurrences in glaucoma in human and veterinary practice. The cyclodestructive procedures included cyclodialysis, cyclodiathermy, cyclocryotherapy, and cyclophotocoagulation. The cryosurgery in veterinary ophthalmology has many indications for the treatment of ocular diseases and is effective at decreasing intraocular pressure in patients with persistent uncontrolled glaucoma. Cyclocryotherapy has been shown to reduce intraocular pressure in dogs, cats, rabbits and humans with normotensive and glaucomatous eyes. The application of a cryoprobe over the ciliary processes results in ablating ciliary tissue so that aqueous humour inflow is reduced to acceptable levels. In the clinical cases evaluated, there was a reduction in intraocular pressure reaching acceptable levels, with the usual result being cosmetic and painless eye. Medical therapy remains the predominant method for treating glaucoma in veterinary patients; therefore, cyclocryotherapy is an effective, simple way to lower IOP and is a reasonable treatment option for glaucoma management. Cyclocryotherapy has shown good results, with a low learning curve and it can also be repeated if necessary.Keywords: eye, canine, feline, surgery.

This paper investigates the impact of road traffic-related air pollution on public health in Beijing and evaluates the effectiveness of driving restriction policies in mitigating both traffic congestion and environmental pollution. With Beijing facing severe air quality challenges due to rapid urbanization and increased vehicle use, various measures have been implemented over the years to improve air quality. The 2008 Beijing Olympics served as a catalyst for stricter emissions controls and vehicle restrictions, leading to a reduction in pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM). This study traces the evolution of these policies, assesses their effectiveness in reducing air pollution and carbon emissions, and examines the broader public health implications. The paper concludes that while significant progress has been made, further innovations such as low-emission zones and congestion pricing could help address the remaining challenges of air pollution and traffic congestion in the city.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage for enhanced oil recovery (CCUS-EOR) is a key technology for mitigating carbon emissions. The effects of CO2 miscible flooding on EOR after water flooding in low-permeability reservoirs are highly uncertain. This work establishes a comprehensive model for CO2 miscible flooding in low-permeability reservoirs, taking into account processes such as dissolution and trapping of formation water. The model simulates the miscible behavior of CO2 and crude oil under various formation water conditions. The conclusions are as follows: formation water exhibits dissolution and trapping phenomena with injected CO2 and crude oil, leading to a loss of effective CO2 volume, a reduction in recoverable crude oil volume, and a delay of response of CO2 miscible flooding; a minimal quantity of movable water can limit CO2 fingering, while an abundant amount can hinder CO2-oil contact; ignoring the microscopic mechanisms between water, CO2, or oil can overestimate the CO2-oil miscible process, miscible degree, and miscible flooding efficiency. These conclusions help further understand the mechanisms of CO2 miscible flooding to enhance oil recovery in high-water saturation low-permeability reservoirs and provide references and insights for CO2 capture and reservoir development.

Biochemical networks use reaction cascades to selectively reduce CO2 using energy from sunlight, but can similar selectivity be achieved by applying a cascade approach to an engineered system? Here, we report the design and implementation of a two-step photoelectrochemical (PEC) cascade to a liquid solar fuel: reduction of CO2 to CO and subsequent reduction of CO to methanol. The potentials required to perform the reductions were generated using custom-made III–V-based three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNT) catalyzed both reactions. Multiphysics simulations of electrolyte flow and nonilluminated electrochemical measurements were used to narrow the operating parameters for the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes. The champion integrated photocathode produced methanol with 3.8 ± 0.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE), with tested photocathodes having 0.7–3.8% methanol FE. Products were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The current output of the tested photocathodes was highly stable, and methanol production continued over multiple experiments. The low methanol yield is attributed to insufficient CO flux to, and CO2 depletion at, the methanol-producing subcell when both contacts are active, which is supported by the observation that a control photoelectrode slightly outperformed the methanol production of the 3TT device. Methanol production ceased when the 3TT subcell driving CO reduction was deactivated, supporting the assignment of a cascade mechanism. The major factors resulting in low methanol FE by the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes are insufficient CO2 depletion at the methanol-producing contact and uncertainty in operating potential selection using the 3TT design. Although the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathode is not yet highly selective, this work develops the basic science principles underlying the PEC cascade, demonstrates the co-design of a 3TT-based photoelectrode to produce carbon-based fuels, and finally discusses routes for improving product yields with this concept, including CO2 supply optimization and alternative photoelectrode and catalyst materials.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to multi‐carbon (C2+) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO2 loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C2+ products due to the competing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C‐C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO2 coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO2 reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C‐C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C2+ products in strong acid. Lowering the CO2 feed concentration reduces CO2 coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C‐C coupling. This approach efficiently suppresses the formation of undesired C1 products. By employing a 20% CO2 feed, we achieved a significant improvement in C2+ Faradaic efficiency, reaching 68% at 100 mA cm‐2, approximately 1.7 times higher than the 41% obtained using pure CO2. We demonstrated the direct electroreduction of a 30% CO2 feed – representative CO2 concentration of typical industrial flue gases – in a full electrolyzer, achieving a C2+ selectivity of 78% and an energy efficiency of 23% at 200 mA cm‐2.

Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of solid-state materials comprising inorganic elements and organic molecules. These hybrid materials are widely recognized for their diverse properties, rendering them indispensable in the field of organic synthesis, material science and the pharmaceutical industry. Although the traditional batch methods for MOFs synthesis are well-developed, they often struggle with reproducibility, scalability and environmental issues. However, the development of continuous flow techniques has emerged as a promising alternative, offering more efficient mass and heat transfer, precise reaction control, greater potential for automation, improved safety, and reduced environmental impact. This review primarily focuses on advanced continuous flow synthesis of MOFs incorporating techniques such as air flow, spray drying, microwave, micro-droplets, supercritical carbon dioxide, and ultrasound. Additionally, the recent advancements in applying MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts for various organic transformations under continuous flow conditions are discussed, categorized by the type of bond formation, including C-H bond formation (hydrogen reduction), C-C bond formation, and C-O bond formation.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to multi-carbon (C2+) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO2 loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C2+ products due to the competing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C-C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO2 coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO2 reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C-C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C2+ products in strong acid. Lowering the CO2 feed concentration reduces CO2 coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C-C coupling. This approach efficiently suppresses the formation of undesired C1 products. By employing a 20% CO2 feed, we achieved a significant improvement in C2+ Faradaic efficiency, reaching 68% at 100 mA cm-2, approximately 1.7 times higher than the 41% obtained using pure CO2. We demonstrated the direct electroreduction of a 30% CO2 feed - representative CO2 concentration of typical industrial flue gases - in a full electrolyzer, achieving a C2+ selectivity of 78% and an energy efficiency of 23% at 200 mA cm-2.

Abstract The manufacturing of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) significantly contributes to global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, necessitating the exploration of alternative binders like alkali-activated materials (AAM). Despite its environmental benefits, AAM generally faces challenges such as drying shrinkage and efflorescence, limiting its industrial application. This study focuses on investigating the impact of steam curing on addressing these challenges in high strength slag-based AAM. The results indicates that high strength AAM can be developed by carefully optimizing the activator-to-binder and water-to-binder ratios, and incorporating steam curing. Specifically, a compressive strength of 112.4 MPa was achieved after one day of steam curing, compared to 100.8 MPa after 28 days of standard curing. This demonstrates the ability of steam curing to accelerate strength development of AAM. Furthermore, steam curing proved to be highly effective in reducing drying shrinkage, which was decreased from 17 351 microstrains to 1 440 microstrains. This reduction aligns the shrinkage levels of AAM with those of OPC, addressing a major limitation of AAM. This study also found that efflorescence was notably mitigated, with a significant reduction observed after a 24-hour steam curing period. These findings highlight steam curing as a cost- effective and practical-effective method in improving the performance of AAM. By addressing the key challenges, steam curing facilitates the broader adoption of AAM in sustainable construction practices.

As the greenhouse effect intensifies, China faces pressure to manage CO2 emissions. Coal-fired power plants are a major source of CO2 in China. Traditional CO2 emission accounting methods of power plants are deficient in computational efficiency and accuracy. To solve these problems, this study proposes a novel RF-RFE-DF-Optuna (random forest–recursive feature elimination–deep forest–Optuna) framework, enabling accurate CO2 emission prediction for coal-fired power plants. The framework begins with RF-RFE for feature selection, identifying and extracting the most important features for CO2 emissions from the power plant, reducing dimensionality from 46 to just 5 crucial features. Secondly, the study used the DF model to predict CO2 emissions, combined with the Optuna framework, to enhance prediction accuracy further. The results illustrated the enhancements in model performance and showed a significant improvement with a 0.12706 increase in R2 and reductions in MSE and MAE by 81.70% and 36.88%, respectively, compared to the best performance of the traditional model. This framework improves predictive accuracy and offers a computationally efficient real-time CO2 emission monitoring solution in coal-fired power plants.

Construction of metal–organic cages (MOCs) with internal modifications is a promising avenue to build enzyme‐like cavities and unlocking the mystery of highly catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes. However, current interests are mainly focused on single‐metal‐node cages, little achievement has been expended to metalloclusters‐based architectures, and the in situ endogenous generation of metal clusters. Herein, based on the hard‐soft‐acids‐bases (HSAB), the metalloclusters‐based heterometallic MOC (Cu3VMOP) constructed of [Cu3OPz3]+ and [V6O6(OCH3)9(SO4)(CO2)3]2– clusters was obtained by one‐pot method. In addition, Cu4I4 was generated in situ in the cage to form Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP by the coordination‐driven hierarchical self‐assembly strategy. As catalysts for CO2 reduction, Cu3VMOP produces HCOOH and CH3COOH as the main reduction product with yield of CH3COOH up to 0.9 mmol g–1, ranking among the highest value of reported materials, whereas Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP exhibited targeted CO2‐to‐HCOOH conversion with 100% formic acid selectivity and the yield outperforms that of Cu3VMOP by 5 fold. Theoretical calculations and femtosecond time‐resolved transient absorption reveal that endogenous Cu4I4 not only regulates orbital arrangements and enhances localized electron states to generate a long‐lived charge‐separated state, but also raises *CO coupling energy barrier, resulting in the targeted conversion of CO2 to formic acid.

The reduction of CO2 emissions is crucial for the energy transition. New technologies for the CO2 capture and storage are under development to achieve this goal. CO2 based electrothermal energy and geological storage system (CEEGS) is a novel technology trying to combine renewable energy storage system based on the transcritical CO2 cycle with CO2 storage in geological formations and geothermal heat extraction. Porous media and rock caverns are the geological formations of high interest for such technology. Among them, depleted hydrocarbon fields gain ground due to the experience of reservoir characterisation, sealing performance, storage operability, and already established oil or gas well infrastructure which critically decreases the cost. However, one of the major problems caused during the CO2 storage in depleted hydrocarbon fields is the interactions between the injected CO2 and the remaining fluids. In this study, the potential CO2 storage in the depleted gas fields was investigated and the Marismas 3 was used as an hypothetical model area for the examination of CO2 interactions with a reservoir representing by carbonate-silisiclastic rocks and sands.PHREEQC computer simulation software was used for the investigation of reservoir rock/water/remained gas (CH4) interactions followed by the interactions taking place after the CO2 injection. Two different scenarios were used for the CO2 concentration in the reservoir representing the minimum and the maximum ratio of reservoir storage efficiency factor. During the CO2 injection, carbonic acid was formed, causing a dissolution of several minerals, leading to the precipitation of siderite and clay minerals such as kaolinite, Ca-montmorillonite and illite, which may cause problems related to the permeability of the system. The colloidal nature of siderite and the swelling properties of Ca-montmorillonite are of high concern for the pore throats clogging. However, in this study area, the other new formed mineralogical phases are not threatening the reservoir quality. To make the system more complex and generic, the CMG software utilized to combine dynamic fluid flow and geochemistry, examining the long-term sequestration of CO2 through dissolution trapping, residual trapping, and lateral migration.

Electroreduction of CO2 to CO represents a highly promising way for artificial carbon cycling, but obtaining high selectivity over a wide potential window remains a challenge due to the sluggish CO generation and diffusion kinetics. Here we report an integration of long‐range P modified asymmetrical bismuth atomic site on an ordered macroporous carbon skeleton with mesoporous “wall” (MW‐BiN3‐POMC) for efficient electroreduction of CO2. In‐depth in‐situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the incorporation of long‐range P atom is able to strengthen the orbital interaction between the C 2p of CO2 and Bi 6p, thereby establishing an electronic transport bridge for the activation of CO2 molecule. Additionally, the ordered macropore with mesoporous wall effectively facilitates the diffusion of CO. As a result, MW‐BiN3‐POMC exhibits an ultrawide potential window of 1000 mV for high CO selectivity (>90%) and a maximal CO partial current density of 414 mA cm‐2. Moreover, MW‐BiN3‐POMC can also be employed as the cathode to integrate the solar‐driven electrolytic cell (anode of Co3O4‐OMC) toward CO2 reduction coupled with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation to simultaneously yield CO and 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid.

Abstract Photovoltaic‐driven electrochemical (PV‐EC) carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 R) coupled with sulfide oxidation (SOR) can efficiently convert the solar energy into chemical energy, expanding its applications. However, developing low‐cost electrocatalysts that exhibit high selectivity and efficiency for both CO 2 R and SOR remains a challenge. Herein, a bifunctional copper selenide catalyst is developed with copper vacancies (v‐CuSe 2 ) for the CO 2 R‐SOR. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 62.4% for methane at −200 mA cm −2 is achieved in the cathodic CO 2 R. In a two‐electrode CO 2 R‐SOR system with 16 h of long‐term operation at a current density of 200 mA cm −2 , an average Faradaic efficiency of 57.2% for methane and 97.7% for sulfur powder generation is achieved at cathode and anode, respectively. Compared to the coupling of CO 2 R with oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the energy efficiency (EE) of the CO 2 R‐SOR system can be increased to 22.9%. The mechanism study has found that the synergistic effect of copper vacancies and introduced Se significantly enhances the selectivity toward methane. Driven by silicon solar cells, a solar‐to‐methane conversion efficiency of 2% is achieved.

This study explores the environmental and economic impacts of aviation emissions, focusing on the changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using real flight data from Batman Airport, the research examines aircraft emissions, global warming potential (GWP), specific environmental impacts (SEI), and specific eco-cost (SEC) from 2018 to 2023. The analysis reveals significant reductions in total emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2, HC, CO, NOx) during 2020, while per-passenger emissions increased. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, total CO2 emissions in 2020 decreased by 31.45%, while emissions per passenger rose by 9.7%. Similar patterns were observed for HC, CO, and NOx. The pandemic-induced reduction in aviation activity led to a 32.1% decrease in GWP and a 31.7% reduction in SEC for the same period. However, the rapid recovery in 2021 saw emissions and environmental costs return to near pre-pandemic levels by 2023. This research provides valuable insights into the long-term environmental effects of reduced air travel during COVID-19 and highlights strategies to mitigate aviation-related emissions, such as reducing taxi times to loer pollutants and their associated environmental costs.

This study evaluates the impact of building orientation, typology, and envelope characteristics on energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in urban dwellings in subtropical climate, with a focus on Cartagena, Colombia. North-facing dwellings consistently demonstrate superior energy performance, achieving an average efficiency increase of 4.27 ± 1.77% compared to south-facing counterparts. This trend is less pronounced near the equator due to the sun’s high zenith angle. Semi-detached homes exhibit 23.17 ± 9.83% greater energy efficiency than corner houses, attributed to reduced exterior wall exposure, which lowers energy demand and CO2 emissions by 2.16 ± 0.74 kg CO2/m2 annually. Significant disparities in emissions are observed across socioeconomic strata; homes in strata 3 and 4 show the lowest emissions (6.69 ± 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), while strata 5 and 6 have the highest (10.48 ± 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), due to differences in construction quality and glazing ratios. Roofing materials also play a key role, with thermoacoustic (TAC) roofs reducing emissions by up to 5.80% in lower strata compared to asbestos–cement roofs. Furthermore, sandwich panels demonstrate substantial potential, achieving CO2 emissions reductions of up to 51.6% in strata 1 and 2 south-facing median homes and a minimum saving of 9.4% in strata 5 and 6. These findings underscore the importance of integrating energy performance criteria into public housing policies, promoting construction practices that enhance sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving occupant comfort and property value.

The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction provides a convenient approach to convert CO2 to CO, which facilitates to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Herein, the Cu/CeO2 catalyst prepared by a co‐precipitation method using a mixture of Na2CO3 and NaOH at pH of 10 (sample Cu/CeO2‐10) achieved an intrinsic reaction rate of 428.4 mmol•gcat‐1•h‐1 with 100% CO selectivity at 400 °C and CO2/H2 ratio of 1:4, which is much higher than Cu/CeO2 prepared by impregnation and other methods. Various characterizations showed the highest fraction of CuCeO2 solid solution in the calcined Cu/CeO2‐10, and formed highly dispersed Cu clusters (~2.5 nm) on partially reduced CuCeO2 solid solution with abundant of oxygen vacancies upon reduction. The Cu and oxygen vacancies facilitates the activation of H2 and CO2, respectively, resulting in lowered H2 and CO2 reaction orders. As a result, the synergy between the two components enhanced the overall RWGS activity with lowered activation energy. Moreover, the optimal catalyst is very stable in 24h stability test without detectable agglomeration of Cu clusters.

We propose a hybrid electrocatalytic‐bioelectrocatalytic reaction cascade integrated on a gas diffusion electrode for CO2 reduction under selective formation of methanol. Ag‐Bi2O3 selectively reduces gaseous CO2 to formate at neutral pH conditions. A subsequent enzymatic cascade comprising formaldehyde dehydro­genase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)‐dependent, further reduce formate sequentially to formaldehyde and methanol. The enzymatically oxi­dized redox cofactor NAD+ is regenerated through the enzyme diaphorase which is electrochemically coupled to the electrode by embedding it into a cobaltocene‐based low‐potential redox polymer. Methanol formation is confirmed using a highly selective biosensor based on alcohol oxidase in combination with horseradish peroxidase integrated into a specifically adapted redox polymer. The proposed hybrid electrocatalytic‐bioelectrocatalytic cascade is an example for a general strategy for enhancing the selectivity of electrocatalytic reac­tions and/or to replace bioelectrochemically challenging steps such as the synthesis of formate from CO2 using the highly oxygen‐sensitive formate dehydrogenase by more robust inorganic electrocatalysts.

Solar desalination efficiency can be significantly altered by combining several approaches to improve evaporation rate. The objective of this research is to find a way to make solar stills (SS) more efficient by combining evacuated tube solar collectors, blue metal stones, and corrugated fins. An investigation into a six-tube evacuated solar collector was conducted to increase the system's evaporation rate. Corrugated fins were thought of to rise the surface area of heat transfer between the water and absorber. Blue metal stone was proposed to keep the water at a maximum temperature even when solar radiation is minimal. Separate displays of the cumulative distillate output (DO) numbers and hourly values for each time period provide a comprehensive view. Based on the findings, the peak period for DO moves from 1 p.m. on a sample day in May 2024, which is six months into the project. In comparison to CSS, MSS temperature values are over 55 °C higher at the peak and nearly 26 °C higher on average. On top of that, the total DO during the day can reach 2.64 to 6.82 L, while at night it rises from 0.067 to 0.96 L. In addition, there is a 146.3% improvement in the average DO during the six months, going from 3.02 to 7.22 L. Additionally, MSS is 0.43₹ per liter and CSS is 0.47₹ per liter, in that order. The net amount of carbon dioxide reduction achieved by modified solar stills was approximately 2.44 times greater than that of conventional solar stills.

The electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2eRR) to high value-added chemicals in an aqueous electrolyte usually faces challenges, including sluggish oxygen evolution at the anode and the competing reaction of hydrogen evolution at the cathode. A novel CoNi@NC composite with high saturation magnetization, prepared by facile pyrolysis, was used as the cathode and a Pt sheet as the anode in an ionic liquid (IL)-methanol electrolyte to conduct the CO2eRR to produce CH4 and CO, and oxidation of methanol to generate methylal (dimethoxymethane, DMM). A magnetic CoNi alloy nanomaterial (CoNi@NC) with a nitrogen-doped carbon layer-coated structure was synthesized by a one-pot method. The system achieved an associative strategy for synchronous production of high-valued chemicals via two half-reactions at the cathode and anode, respectively. The optimal CoNi@NC composite exhibited efficient catalytic activity, obtaining an average of 54.5% faradaic efficiency (FE) for DMM within 48 h and 91.9% of momentary FE for CO and CH4 at 24 h under lower energy consumption. The electrode catalyst and ionic liquid electrolyte also exhibited good recyclability and stability in the CO2eRR. Mechanism studies indicated that magnetic CoNi alloy species served as adsorption and active sites for CO2 conversion. In addition, the carbon layer coating enhanced the stability of the CoNi alloy, and N-doping introduced surface defects on the carbon layer, thereby promoting CO2 adsorption and electrocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the magnetic CoNi (1 1 1) species was conducive to CO2 adsorption and activation, exhibiting high selectivity for the CO2eRR.

The utilization of carbide slag, an industrial by-product, as a resource to prepare value-added products has a profound impact not only for sustainable synthesis and the circular economy but also for CO2 reduction. Herein, we report the very first example of the controlled multi-dimensional assembly of calcium carbonate particles at the micrometer scale with industrial by-product carbide slag and CO2. Calcium carbonate particles of distinctly different sizes, shapes, and morphologies are obtained by finely tuning the assembly conditions. This strategy yields diverse assembled structures, including simple cubic, mulberry-like assembled unit, stacked cubic polycrystalline, and rotated polycrystalline structures, using the same starting materials. This innovative approach not only highlights the adaptability and efficiency of utilizing industrial by-products via multi-dimensional assembly but also provides new insights into the potential applications of the resulting calcium carbonate.

Abstract Dynamic resistance exercise (RE) produces sinusoidal fluctuations in blood pressure, with hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion commonly observed immediately following RE. Whether the cerebral vasculature adapts to these regular blood pressure challenges is unclear. This study examined the cerebrovascular response to post‐dynamic RE orthostasis. RE‐trained ( n = 15, female = 4) and healthy untrained individuals ( n = 15, female = 12) completed five stands: one after seated rest, with each of the subsequent four stands occurring immediately following a set of 10 repetitions of unilateral leg extension exercise at 60% of their one repetition maximum. Beat‐to‐beat blood pressure, mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv mean ) and end‐tidal carbon dioxide were measured throughout. During standing the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and MCAv mean nadirs were identified. There was no difference between groups for age (mean ± SD, 26 ± 7 RE‐trained vs. 25 ± 6 years untrained, P = 0.683) or weight (78 ± 15 vs. 71 ± 15 kg, P = 0.683). At MAP nadir during the post‐exercise stand, a greater reduction in MAP was observed in the RE‐trained group (e.g., set 4, −45 ± 11 vs. −36 ± 6 mmHg, training effect P = 0.026). However, post‐exercise stand MCAv mean at MCAv mean nadir was not different (e.g., set 4, −20 ± 7 vs. −17 ± 6 cm/s, interaction effect P = 0.478). Rate of regulation was higher in the RE‐trained group (set 1, 0.301 ± 0.170 vs. 0.167 ± 0.009, training effect P = 0.023). Despite RE‐trained individuals demonstrating greater absolute reductions in MAP during orthostasis following RE, there were no differences in MCAv mean , suggesting that habitual RE may mitigate post‐exercise cerebral hypoperfusion.

Conservation tillage practices within integrated systems offer a viable strategy for restoring degraded pastures on slopes. This study evaluated the short-term (2 years) impacts of soil tillage types and young silvopastoral systems on soil hydrophysical properties, CO2 emissions and erosion processes in a 38% sloping area following pasture renovation. Three management systems (full-sun pasture; and silvopastoral system with eucalyptus or with gliricidia) were evaluated alongside three soil tillage types (downhill ploughing with a disc plough; contour ploughing with a mouldboard plough; and no-tillage). The results revealed that soil tillage led to bulk density and penetration resistance reductions of up to 85% compared to no-tillage. The decrease in bulk density was associated with increased total porosity (particularly macroporosity), resulting in enhanced soil water infiltration rates (up to > 76.5%). However, disturbance induced significant environmental disadvantages, including nearly twofold increases in soil losses, water losses and increased CO2 emissions (> 43%). Young silvopastoral systems demonstrated a soil hydrophysical quality comparable to full-sun pasture and did not significantly affect CO2 emissions, soil water content or temperature. Notably, no-tillage resulted in lower CO2 emissions and soil temperatures but higher soil water content, particularly when integrated with tree species, effectively minimizing soil and water losses. These findings underscore the critical role of no-tillage practices within silvopastoral systems in enhancing soil conservation, especially on erosion-prone sloping lands.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 is promising for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage but confronts low CH4 selectivity, especially at high current densities. The key challenge lies in promoting *CO intermediate and *H coupling while minimizing side reactions including C‐C coupling or H‐H coupling, which is particularly difficult at high current density due to abundant intermediates. Here we report a cooperative strategy to address this challenge using Cu‐based catalysts comprising Cu‐N coordination polymer and CuO component that can simultaneously manage the key intermediates *CO and *H. A fast CO2‐to‐CH4 conversion rate of 3.14 mmol cm‐2 h‐1 is achieved at 1,300 mA cm−2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.7%. In‐situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations show that the increased Cu‐Cu distance in the Cu‐N coordination polymer component favors multistep *CO hydrogenation over the dimerization, and the CuO component ensures an adequate supply of *H, together contributing to the selective CO2‐to‐CH4 conversion at high current densities. This work develops a cooperative strategy for the electrosynthesis of CH4 with simultaneous high current density and high selectivity by rational catalyst design, paving the way for its applications.

Purpose: The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality in Vietnam. Methodology: The research employed is the non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) approach, utilizing time-series data from 1986 to 2022. The strength of NARDL lies in its consideration of both increasing and decreasing trends in independent variables such as Economic Growth, Energy from Renewable Resources and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in a non-linear relationship with the dependent variable, CO2. Findings: The research findings indicate that overall economic growth is positively associated with an increase in CO2 emissions, aligning with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory in the first stage of the inverted U-shape. However, the EKC hypothesis is not supported in later stages, as environmental degradation persists despite economic growth. Renewable resources in primary energy have increased from 6% in 1986 to 16% in 2022, while FDI has risen from 0.03% of GDP in 1986 to 4.3% of GDP in 2021, resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions. In other words, the Pollution Haven Hypothesis does not hold in Vietnam. With a net-zero CO2 target by 2050, Vietnam necessitates rapid, short-term changes to neutralize carbon emissions effectively in the long term. Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: To simultaneously ensure economic growth while adhering to Vietnam's carbon neutrality objectives, followings solutions are recommended: (1) increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources and reducing fossil fuel dependency; (2) incorporating modern, environmentally friendly technologies in the industrial sector to diminish resource-intensive practices and reduce dependence on fossil fuels; (3) establishing a legal framework and conditions to attract FDI in technology-intensive sectors, thereby mitigating carbon emissions.

Stabilizing GHG emissions in the agri-food sector is crucial for climate change mitigation. Tea is one of the most consumed drinks worldwide and such high levels of consumption necessitate for the carbon footprint (CF) assessment of its entire life cycle encompassing all six stages such as cultivation, processing, packaging, transportation, consumption and disposal to understand the environmental impact of tea industry at large. In this context, this study is a maiden attempt to quantify and compare CF for the entire life cycle of all three types of tea such as black, green and white tea in a single research paper by employing the life cycle assessment (LCA) method in significant tea growing areas of Tamil Nadu, India. The findings revealed that the consumption stage contributed the highest CO2 emissions, accounting for 45%-56% to overall CF. Black tea consumption contributed 45% (5.8 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea) of the total CF, while green tea and white tea had higher CF (8.3 kg CO?-eq/kg of made tea), contributing 56% to the total CF. The processing stage was the second largest source, contributing 12-19% to overall CF, followed by packaging (15-17%) and cultivation (10-11%) stages. Overall, the total CF (cradle to grave) for black tea and white tea had a similar value of 12.9 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea, whereas green tea registered a higher value of 14.79 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea. Furthermore, this assessment identified hotspots of GHG emissions. It enabled the recommendation of CF reduction measures to promote carbon neutrality in tea sector while being a part of global climate change mitigation efforts.

In this study, we employed EC‐MS to elucidate the role of halide anions in electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction. We found that the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was significantly suppressed by the anion used. Specifically, the rates of H2 production decreased in the order KF > KCl > KI, meaning that I− most strongly suppressed HER. Interestingly, CO reduction products showed an inverse relationship to HER, with KI leading to the highest rate of CO reduction. By pairing our experimental findings with classical molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism wherein halide anions influence the dynamic interplay between CO reduction and HER by modulating the competition of H* and CO* for active sites on the Cu surface. We propose that this interaction is enabled by the interfacial concentration of K+ being greater in the presence of F− than in I−. Our results highlight the need to more broadly consider the properties of ions at electrocatalytic interfaces and they point to thus far underappreciated avenues to optimize hydrocarbon production while suppressing hydrogen evolution.

The steel industry is responsible for a very large environmental impact because more than 70% of the production of iron is done in blast furnaces, where the reduction of iron oxides (ore) is performed with carbon monoxide obtained from coke and coal. Their partial oxidation produces CO used to reduce the iron oxides, simultaneously yielding huge amounts (approximately 2GT/a) of CO2. It is necessary to find new alternatives to decarbonize the steelmaking process. The present work studies the reduction kinetics of iron oxides using hydrogen as a reductant. The overall reaction displays complex behavior that explains the versatile and partly contradictory interpretations found in the literature on hydrogen reduction of iron oxides. Experiments in thin layers of powder were performed under various experimental conditions to investigate the kinetics with both pure iron oxide and an industrial feedstock. To support the interpretation of the data, morphological and chemical-physical characterization was performed, and a comparison between pure hematite and commercial ironmaking pellets was reported.

Работа посвящена вопросам моделирования массообменных аппаратов в составе воздухонезависимых энергетических установок с реализацией растворения диоксида углерода в морской воде методом абсорбции. С целью достижения данной задачи рассмотрено наличие биогенных поверхностно-активных веществ (ПАВ) в морской воде, являющихся продуктами жизнедеятельности морских организмов. На основе литературных данных по распределению биомассы в верхнем слое Мирового океана предложена зависимость концентрации ПАВ от района и выполнено сравнение с экспериментальными данными. Получены зависимости на основе физико-химических процессов, возникающих при барботаже газа и адсорбции молекул биогенных ПАВ на поверхности пузырька. Установлено, что наличие биогенных ПАВ в морской воде приводит к снижению коэффициента поверхностного натяжения, что в свою очередь снижает скорость движения газовой фазы, при незначительном понижении коэффициента массопередачи, в условиях увеличения общей поверхности массообмена. Определено, что в условиях коалесценции и дробления газовых пузырьков снижение объема газовых пузырьков, вызванный снижением минимального и максимального диаметров газового пузырька приводит к преобладанию дробления над коалесценцией, что приводит к увеличению поверхности массообмена при росте числа пузырьков. The work is dedicated to the modeling of mass transfer apparatuses within air-independent power systems, focusing on the dissolution of carbon dioxide in seawater through the absorption method. To achieve this goal, the presence of biogenic surfactants in seawater, which are products of marine organisms' life activities, is considered. Based on literature data on biomass distribution in the upper layer of the World Ocean, a dependency of surfactant concentration on the region is proposed and compared with experimental data. Dependencies are derived based on the physicochemical processes that occur during gas sparging and the adsorption of biogenic surfactant molecules on the bubble surface. It is established that the presence of biogenic surfactants in seawater leads to a reduction in surface tension, which in turn decreases the velocity of the gas phase, with a slight reduction in the mass transfer coefficient, under conditions of increased overall mass transfer surface area. It is determined that under conditions of coalescence and fragmentation of gas bubbles, the reduction in gas bubble volume, caused by the decrease in minimum and maximum bubble diameters, leads to the predominance of fragmentation over coalescence, resulting in an increase in the mass transfer surface area as the number of bubbles increases.

We use nonparametric methods to compute the environmental inefficiency of 100 countries over the period 1990-2017 on the macro-level. The inefficiency is expressed as the potential reduction of GHG emissions, holding economic output constant. Based on that, we estimate different trend functions and project the trends further until 2050. Confidence intervals to indicate the uncertainty inherent in the long-run projections are obtained by bootstrapping. We compare the efficient emissions remaining after subtracting the potential reductions with the official EU climate targets. It becomes apparent that a sizable contribution could be made by reducing inefficiency. However, even after removing the entire inefficiency, the results also indicate that this alone is probably not sufficient to break the increasing trend of GHG (and especially CO2) emissions. Thus, further policy measures are required for breaking the trend.

Pumps in fuel oil systems are mechanical equipment used for the transfer of liquid fluid from one place to another. In particular, pumps are required to transfer the maximum flow rate in the transfer units in minimum time. They consume a very high amount of energy for this transfer. In this research, research studies were carried out to ensure the transfer of the highest possible amount of fuel oil by consuming energy at optimal rates. In this experimental study, the energy consumption and flow rate were measured across a range of engine speeds (100-700 RPM) and varying gear lengths (90-100 mm). According to the findings, energy consumption reached ideal levels at 600 RPM engine speed. In addition, it was determined that the lowest CO2 emission was obtained in the range of 600-700 RPM and by using long gear length. In addition, it is observed that the effect of gear length on energy efficiency is significant and energy consumption decreases as the gear length gets shorter. The results show that minimum energy consumption can be obtained with maximum flow rate at 609 RPM engine speed and 100 mm gear length. The ANOVA analysis used in the study reveals that the flow rate changes are 98% related to the engine speed, while the gear length is 78% effective in CO2 emission reduction. This research provides an important contribution to energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in industrial applications. This study provides an innovative method that can be used to achieve energy saving and environmental sustainability goals and makes valuable contributions to the literature on optimising internal gear pump designs.

Heterogeneous cobalt phthalocyanine has emerged as a promising molecular catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol. Boosting both electrocatalytic durability and selectivity remains a great challenge, which is more difficult with unknown regulation factors for the HER side reaction. Herein, to discover the key to balancing the durability and selectivity, as well as HER regulation, we carried out GC-DFT calculations, based on which dynamic product distribution modeling was conducted to visually present the variation of the product distribution within the applied voltage range. The strongly electron-donating NMe2-substituted CoPc is found to be an excellent candidate. The dynamic product distribution reveals that the key to selectivity and durability balance is to regulate both the potential of the highest methanol Faradaic efficiency and the corresponding energy barrier of the selectivity-determining step for hydrogenated CoPc. The pivotal factor in HER regulation stems from hindered H adsorption due to ligand hydrogenation, arising from the decreased Co-to-H charge transfer. The dynamic product distribution analysis provides intuitive theoretical guidance for highly selective and durable CO2 electroreduction.

In this study, the effects of using different scrap ratios in a converter on carbon emissions were analyzed based on life cycle assessment (LCA) theory, and the carbon emissions from the converter were evaluated with the use of coke and biochar as heating agents at high scrap ratios. In this industrial experiment, the CO2 emissions during the converter smelting process decreased with the increase in the scrap steel ratio. For every 1% increase in the scrap steel ratio, the carbon emissions during the steelmaking process decreased by 14.09 kgCO2/t steel. Based on statistical data for the actual use of a charcoal heating agent in the converter, the relationship between the utilization coefficient of the heating agent and the scrap ratio was calculated as η=7.698×102x−2.596. When biochar was used as a converter heating agent, the scrap ratio required to achieve the lowest carbon emissions was 36%, and the converter emissions could be reduced by 172 kgCO2/t·steel relative to the use of coke. The use of biochar as a converter heating agent can contribute to the elimination of 330 million tons of scrap through furnace–converter long-process steelmaking, yielding an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 158 million tons.

The purpose of this study was to develop a fuzzy logic controller (FLC)-based energy management strategy for battery electric vehicles that enables them to reduce their energy consumption and carbon emission levels without sacrificing their performance. An electric vehicle model was developed in MATLAB/Simulink using a virtual battery and validated with real-world driving tests to save time and money. An in-depth investigation is conducted on both virtual and real vehicles to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy. This study shows that by using FLC-based energy management, an energy consumption advantage of 9.16% can be achieved while maintaining acceptable performance levels in real-world driving conditions. This advantage results in significant reductions annually: 1044.09 tons of CO2 emissions, USD 164,770.65 in savings for electric bus lines, and 5079 battery cycles. For European passenger electric vehicles, this corresponds to 405,657.6 tons of CO2 emissions reduced, USD 64,017,840 saved, and 5.071 battery cycles per vehicle. This strategy not only enhances energy efficiency but also contributes to long-term sustainability in public transportation systems, particularly for electric bus fleets, which play a critical role in urban mobility.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to alleviating global warming and emerging energy crises. Yet, the CO2RR efficiency is impeded by the need for electrocatalysts with good selectivity and efficiency. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention in electrocatalysis and are more efficient than traditional metal-based catalysts. In this study, we modeled a Cu single atom embedded on MoX2 (X = Se and Te) monolayer with a single chalcogen (X) vacancy as SAC. Employing the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) method, the electrocatalytic CO2RR activity of the Cu-MoX2 SACs is systematically investigated through significant descriptors, such as the Gibbs free energy change, charge density difference, and COHP analysis. The stability of SACs, CO2 adsorption configurations, and all possible reaction pathways for the formation of C1 products (HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, and CH4) were examined. All of the Cu-MoX2 SACs are stable and show high catalytic selectivity for the CO2RR by significantly suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We found that the catalytic activity is mainly due to the level of antibonding states filling between the Cu atom and *OCHOH intermediate. Among the C1 products, CH4 is selectively produced in all three SACs. Notably, there is a decrease in the limiting potential (UL) when X changes from S to Te in Cu-MoX2. Among these three SACs, Cu-MoTe2 SAC is the most promising catalyst for reducing CO2 to CH4, with as low as UL of −0.34 V vs RHE. Our results demonstrate that the local coordination environment in SACs has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of CO2RR.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease that leads to pain and limited mobility. Inflammation is a key pathogenetic factor in OA, which is accompanied by the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines. One of the most promising methods of treating inflammation is carboxytherapy (CO2), which has low toxicity and physiological safety, but its interaction with other anti-inflammatory drugs is not well understood. Objective. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of CO2 in animal models of carrageenan inflammation and to study its combined use with diclofenac and chondroitin. Methods. The study was conducted on 56 Wistar rats, which were randomly divided into 7 groups. Inflammation was modelled by injecting carrageenan into the limb of the animals. Prophylactic injections of anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, chondroitin) were performed intraperitoneally and CO2 subcutaneously one hour later. The size of the edema was analysed 1, 2, 3 and 5 hours after the injection. The rectal temperature of the animals was also measured to determine the overall inflammation. Results. One hour after the administration of carrageenan, the volume of the limb in group VII decreased to (0.429 ± 0.020) ml (p < 0.001), and in group VI — to (0.441 ± 0.017) ml (p < 0.001). After 2 hours, the maximum decrease in limb edema was observed in group VII — (0.491 ± 0.017) ml (by 52 %, p < 0.001), and in group VI — (0.495 ± 0.012) ml (by 38 %, p < 0.001). After 5 hours, the size of the limb edema in group VI decreased to (0.559 ± 0.030) ml (by 51 %, p < 0.001), and in group VII — to (0.571 ± 0.016) ml (by 46 %, p < 0.001). Rectal temperature in group VI decreased to (37.7 ± 0.3) °C (by 1.5 °C, p < 0.001), and in group VII — to (38.3 ± 0.2) °C (by 0.9 °C, p < 0.001). Conclusions. Carboxytherapy has a pronounced anti-inflammatory effect, which is manifested in the reduction of edema and temperature, especially when combined with diclofenac or chondroitin. Further research may be aimed at studying the possible mechanisms of the positive effect of CO2, optimising therapeutic regimens and determining the long-term effects of carboxytherapy.

Abstract Energy conservation, emission reduction, and voyage time optimization are critical concerns in the marine sector, where enhancing ship energy efficiency and sailing duration is essential for significant decreases in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Existing studies generally focus on either sailing speed or route optimization, sometimes overlooking their interplay under continuously variable weather conditions, hence reducing the precision and quality of proposed solutions. This research presents an advanced Time Boundary Semicircles (TBS) Algorithm, which provides a robust and precise optimization model that incorporates involuntary speed reduction based on real-time weather data from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS), subject to deterministic time boundaries. The TBS algorithm employs mathematical modeling to compute speed reductions dynamically and integrates Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Cartopy to enhance waypoint optimization and software interactivity. This research compares the TBS algorithm to the SIMROUTE software, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in heavy weather scenarios with sailing time reductions ranging from 7–27.25%. Case studies validate the algorithm's efficacy through comprehensive simulation outputs, including map plots and detailed reports. They also highlight its potential for broader applications in aviation and land transport for route optimization. By bridging the gaps in maritime routing optimization, the TBS algorithm represents a significant advancement in sustainable and efficient transportation.

One of the solutions contributing to the development of energy independence is the utilization of biogas as an alternative fuel for agricultural tractors. Biogas is recognized as a renewable energy source, and its usage aids in the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale. The reuse of this material/waste exemplifies the concept of a circular economy. Several models of agricultural tractors designed explicitly for biogas utilization or adaptable for its use are available in the market. This study aimed to evaluate the energy-ecological parameters of the MP tractor (T6.180 Methane Power) powered by Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in comparison to its structurally identical counterpart fueled by Diesel (T6.180 Electro Command). Based on the Air–Fuel Ratio (AFR) coefficients for diesel and methane, as well as values of air excess ratios (λ) and the proportions of CO and CO2 emissions determined for various engine load states, the mass emission of selected exhaust components for the examined tractors was estimated. This research highlights that biogas-powered tractors hold the potential to contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture through the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in farm energy autonomy, and optimal resource utilization, closely aligned with the principles of a circular economy.

Ultra-protective ventilation is the combination of low airway pressures and tidal volume (Vt) combined with extra corporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R). A recent large study showed no benefit of ultra-protective ventilation compared to standard ventilation in ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) patients. However, the reduction in Vt failed to achieve the objective of less than or equal to 3 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW). The main objective of our study was to assess the feasibility of the ultra-low volume ventilation (Vt ≤ 3 ml/kg PBW) facilitated by ECCO2R in acute respiratory failure patients. Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of patients with either high or low blood flow veno-venous ECCO2R devices. A session was defined as a treatment of ECCO2R from the start to the removal of the device (one patient could have one more than one session). Primary endpoint was the proportion of sessions during which a Vt less or equal to 3 ml/kg PBW at 24 h after the start of ECCO2R was successfully achieved for at least 12 h. Secondary endpoints were respiratory variables, rate of adverse events and outcomes. Forty-five ECCO2R sessions were recorded among 41 patients. Ultra-low volume ventilation (tidal volume ≤ 3 ml/kg PBW, success group) was successfully achieved at 24 h in 40.0% sessions (18 out of 45 sessions, confidence interval 25.3–54.6%). At 24 h, tidal volume in the failure group was 4.1 [3.8–4.5] ml/kg PBW compared to 2.1 [1.9–2.5] in the success group (p < 0.001). After multivariate analysis, blood flow rate was significantly associated with success of ultra-low volume ventilation (adjusted OR per 100 ml/min increase 1.51 (95%CI 1.21–1.90, p = 0.0003). Ultra-low volume ventilation (≤ 3 ml/kg PBW) was feasible in 18 out of 45 sessions. Higher blood flow rates were associated with the success of ultra-low volume ventilation.

This study investigates the effects of adding steam to the oxidizer on the combustion behavior of coke oven gas through numerical simulations. The analysis used the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Ansys Fluent. The results obtained for the case where dry air was used as the oxidizer were compared with experimental data. The k-Ɛ standard turbulence model was employed for turbulence modeling, while the PDF/Mixture Fraction combustion model and the P-1 radiation model were used for the three-dimensional numerical simulations. According to the simulation results, adding steam to the oxidizer slightly reduced the temperature of the COG. When assessing the emissions, it was observed that NOX emissions significantly decreased, while CO2 emissions showed a slight reduction. However, CO emissions were found to increase slightly. In conclusion, the study indicates that adding steam to the oxidizer significantly mitigates the high NOX emissions typically associated with using coke oven gas as an alternative fuel.

In the context of new power systems, the rapid development of distributed renewable energy and the drive of dual carbon targets have prompted community-level clean energy and energy storage configuration to become the key to improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Based on the regional autonomy balance and sharing mechanism, this paper establishes a community distributed energy and energy storage optimization configuration model. With the goal of minimizing the total operating cost of the community, the established model is linearized by using the Big-M method and the McCormick method and transformed into a mixed integer linear programming model that is easy to solve. In order to comprehensively evaluate the comprehensive benefits of the established optimization scheme, this paper introduces the indicators of clean energy self-consumption rate, load self-supply rate, static investment payback period, and static CO2 investment payback period from the aspects of energy utilization, the economy, and the environment. Finally, a calculation example analysis is conducted, and the results show that, compared with the scenario where energy storage is configured separately and distributed energy resources are not shared, the configuration strategy proposed in the article can reduce the energy storage configuration capacity by 46.6% and the distributed energy configuration capacity by 21.1%. Investment costs can be reduced by 15.6%. At the same time, 91.75% of distributed energy self-consumption and 96.80% of load self-supply are achieved, reducing grid interaction and promoting regional autonomy and balance. The static CO2 investment payback period is also significantly shortened, and the carbon emission reduction effect is significant, providing an important reference for community energy system optimization planning and green and low-carbon development.

Due to the high environmental burden of plastics, this study aimed to evaluate the environmental performance of chemical recycling of plastic waste through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), focusing on pyrolysis oil production as the primary output. A pyrolysis plant in Almería, Spain, was chosen as a case study. The results indicate that the production of 1 L of pyrolysis oil from plastic waste generates about 0.032 kg CO2 eq and a water consumption of 0.031 m3, with other impact categories registering values of less than 0.1 kg/L or 0.01 m2a crop eq/L, reducing impacts in 17 out of 18 categories compared to fossil diesel. In addition, its chemical and physical properties, close to those of fossil diesel, suggest its suitability for internal combustion engines, although as a blend rather than a complete substitute. Chemical recycling also appears to be more environmentally favorable than incineration and landfilling in all 18 impact categories, achieving significant benefits, including a reduction in global warming of −3849 kg CO2 eq/ton, ionizing radiation of −22.4 kBq Co-60 eq/ton, and fossil resource consumption of −1807.5 kg oil eq/ton. These results, thus, highlight the potential dual role of chemical recycling of plastic waste, both in mitigating environmental impacts and in supporting circular economy goals by reducing demand for virgin plastics. However, although it appears to be a promising technology, challenges associated with high energy requirements, raw material variability, and scale infrastructure still need to be addressed to ensure industrial competitiveness and significant environmental benefits.

This paper explores innovative approaches to reducing energy consumption in building ventilation systems through the implementation of adaptive control strategies. Using a publicly available high-resolution dataset spanning a full year, the study integrates real-time data on occupancy, CO2 levels, temperature, window state, and external environmental conditions. Notably, occupancy data derived from computer vision-based detection using the YOLOv5 algorithm provides an unprecedented level of granularity. The study evaluates five energy-saving strategies: Demand-Controlled Ventilation (DCV), occupancy-based control, time-based off-peak reduction, window-open control, and temperature-based control. Among these, the occupancy-based strategy achieved the highest energy savings, reducing power consumption by 50%, while temperature-based control yielded a significant 37.27% reduction. This paper’s originality lies in its holistic analysis of multiple dynamic control strategies, integrating diverse environmental and operational variables rarely combined in prior research. The findings highlight the transformative potential of integrating real-time environmental data and advanced control algorithms to optimize HVAC performance. This study establishes a new benchmark for energy-efficient building management through offering practical recommendations and laying the groundwork for predictive models, renewable energy integration, and occupant-centric systems.

The competences of the President of the Energy Regulatory Office include, inter alia, resolving disputes between parties of specific contractual relations in which at least one party is an energy enterprise. One of the categories of such disputes is refusal to connect a renewable energy installation. The analysis presented in this paper leads to a conclusion that due to the multidimensional goals laid down in energy law, technical and economic conditions should be examined while taking into account interests of all stakeholders. This article presents analyses the law in force, involving a case study of a Polish example and a comparative analysis. As a result, the author has come to the conclusion that resolving disputes by the President is a legal instrument that serves to ensure equal treatment and connection of market participants who request it, at the same time facilitating reduction of CO2 emissions and energy neutrality pursuant to the principles adopted by the European Union and the international community. The article draws on selected acts of ordinary law, the relevant literature, decisions made by courts and tribunals, as well as data published by the President and by industry entities.

CO₂ emissions are one form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to global warming. CO₂ contributed 175.62 million tons in 2021, impacting greenhouse gas levels. One strategy to reduce the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere is to convert CO₂ gas into useful chemicals. One example of this is the hydrogenation of CO₂ to produce methane, which can serve as an alternative to LPG. The aim of this research is to produce methane gas by developing a fixed bed reactor in a simple manner. The catalyst Ni/Al2O3 with 20 grams and five regenerations could produce CH₄ up to 49.73% compared to 39.06% for those with 10 grams. However, the H2 gas remaining is higher for those with 10 grams (1.454 ppm compared to 1.042 ppm). Also, The CO2 gas remaining is higher for those with 10 grams (58.18% compared to 47.92%). The results of this study can be the basis for developing energy policies, encouraging investment in clean energy technologies, and supporting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for energy sustainability and resilience.

The removal of barriers to the movement of goods, services and factors of production within an integration association leads to the emergence of spillover effects that have a significant impact on the welfare of the population in the integrating countries. Given the growing dynamics of trade turnover and accelerating economic growth in the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), as well as the lack of studies on the environmental situation in this region, the study of the impact of technology on the environment in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia is of particular relevance. The purpose of the study is to identify the impact of technological spillover on the state of the environment in five EAEU countries in the interval 2011-2022. Hypothesis of the study - the spread of technology in the EAEU space changes the quality of production (there is an increase in the share of renewable energy sources), and this reduces damage to the environment, through the reduction of CO2 emissions. The study investigated the stationarity of variables, determined the most appropriate model for each set of data, considered the possibility of using models with fixed or random effects. As a result of the study, the hypothesis stated in the paper was not confirmed by panel data for the EAEU countries in the interval 2011-2022.

This study evaluates the performance of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (codh) embedded strains in bench-scale microbial electrochemical systems (MES) for CO₂ reduction to biofuels and biochemicals. CO2 fermentation efficiency was evaluated by comparing the wild-type Clostridium acetobutylicum (Wild), a negative control E. coli strain lacking the codh gene (NC-BL21), and engineered E. coli strain (Eng) alone and with IPTG induction (Eng+IPTG). Four electrochemical systems were used viz. Wild+E, NC-BL21+E, Eng+E, and Eng+IPTG+E, with a poised potential of 0.6 V applied to the working electrode. CO₂ and bicarbonate were supplemented to a total inorganic carbon (IC) concentration of 40 g/L, with a retention time of 60 h. The engineered strains demonstrated enhanced metabolic performance compared to the wild-type and negative control strains, yielding a maximum formic acid concentration of 2.1 g/L and acetic acid concentration of 7.8 g/L under the Eng+IPTG condition. Ethanol yield was highest at 3.9 g/L under the Eng+IPTG+E condition, substantially exceeding the 2.4 g/L acetic acid yield observed in the wild-type strain. The engineered strains showed superior cumulative yields (0.4075 g/g), improved codh charge flux stability (60 vs. 5 for Wild), and upregulated expression of genes in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Bioelectrochemical performance analysis demonstrated elevated reductive catalytic currents, enhanced CO₂ reduction, and optimal charge transfer kinetics. This study highlights the effectiveness of genetic and process engineering, particularly codh overexpression and IPTG induction, in optimizing microbial electrosynthesis for biofuel and biochemical production from C1 gases.

The iron and steel industry is a sector with very high energy consumption and also causing high emissions. It is difficult to imagine the development of modern sectors of the economy such as construction, transport or the machinery industry without the use of steel, so forecasts indicate that the demand for steel will increase in the future. Meanwhile, environmental concerns and concerns about climate change are growing, so the iron and steel industry faces a serious challenge related to reducing its emissions in order to achieve the goal set in the Paris Agreement, and this is even more true for this industry in the European Union. Currently, the most popular technology for steel production is the blast furnace process – basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF). This technology requires the use of coal, which is a source of emissions, so a radical technological change is needed. Decarbonising the steel industry requires changing from coal-based metallurgy to hydrogen-based and electricity-based metallurgy. Changing from primary to secondary steel production (using scrap steel) improves the situation but is not a solution to meet growing demand. There are two main technology paths that can achieve significant CO2 reduction. The first is Smart Carbon Usage (SCU), which is based on the gradual reduction of coal consumption, including the use of by-product gases for further conversion into valuable products. The second emerging technology path is Carbon Direct Avoidance (CDA). These and other developing methods of low-emission or zero-emission metallurgy are discussed in the article. Unfortunately, some of these methods are not mature and their final commercialisation requires overcoming a number of problems.

Abstract Due to multiple external shocks since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the world economy, SSA is facing acute debt distress and new highs in the cost of foreign capital at exactly the time it needs to mobilise a stepwise level of financing to invest in human, physical and natural capital to meet the region's development and climate goals for the 21st Century. This paper outlines the relative levels of sovereign external debt and service payments between now and 2030 for SSA countries. We calculate the fiscal space level left to meet climate and development financing needs during the same period. The region cannot meet those pressing needs without new forms of liquidity, concessional and grant finance to complement and bend down the cost of capital and comprehensive debt relief. We find that External debt in SSA has more than tripled since 2008, experiencing the largest increase in debt and the largest increase in debt-to fiscal revenue in the developing world—as capital costs have hit new highs.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and private bondholders represent 60% of the region's external debt, with roughly equal shares of 30%. China and the Paris Club are owed 12 and 5%.Sub-Saharan's external debt service is the equivalent to 93% of the average country's climate financing needs, and only ten countries in the region have the borrowing space to finance those needs.The region urgently needs new forms of liquidity, concessional and grant-based development finance that catalyses low-cost private finance; and for those countries in debt distress significant debt relief across all creditor classes that is aligned with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.MDBs will need to provide between $2.4 and $34.5 billion in relief in a manner that does not harm their preferred creditor status or crediting ratings, or the burden of reduction by the private sector and official creditors will be immense. Sub-Saharan Africa's debt distress is in large part a function of external shocks of which the region had no control—such as COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, climate shocks, the globalisation of inflation from advanced economies and advanced economy interest rate hikes. Moreover, the region is responsible for roughly one half of 1% of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and bares the highest level of the costs of climate change itself (IMF, 2017; Moss, 2020). Given the lack of voice and representation that the region has in the international economic architecture, advanced economies must lead. Further inaction will not only inflict material damage globally in the form of climate change and lost market opportunities, but also further erode the legitimacy of the architecture itself.

This study investigates the distributional impacts of carbon taxes, traditionally examined through simulation studies on the regressivity of hypothetical tax scenarios. However, the dy-namic influence of actually implemented carbon taxes on consumption/income poverty and inequality in a cross-country setting has been less scrutinised. This paper assesses the effect of carbon taxes introduced in the past three decades in 15 European countries on consumption shares of the lowest decile groups, poverty rates and inequality indices. The analysis shows that a $40/ton CO2 tax covering 30% of emissions leads to a consumption share increase of up to 4% for the bottom 20% and 40% of the population, a trend that persisted for five years post implementation, particularly in nations that efficiently redistribute carbon tax revenues. This resulted in a modest reduction in consumption inequality over three years. In contrast, the impact of carbon taxes on income poverty and inequality is not statistically significant. These findings suggest that concerns about poverty and inequality due to carbon taxes can be miti-gated by implementing a moderate tax combined with a strategically efficient revenue redis-tribution mechanism.

β-cyclocitric acid and its precursor β-cyclocitral are signaling apocarotenoids which trigger defense and detoxification mechanisms enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. From a transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis plants exposed to each apocarotenoid over several exposure times, we identified a gene (CYP81D11) encoding a cytochrome P450 that is strongly induced under all conditions and is under the control of the TGAII-SCL14 transcription regulator. Overexpressing the CYP81D11 gene in Arabidopsis led to a very tolerant phenotype to high light stress while a CYP81D11-deficient mutant was photosensitive. The transcriptomic profile of the CYP81D11 overexpressor revealed a selective upregulation of genes related to photosynthesis and the response to high light stress. Photosynthetic electron transport, CO2 fixation and biomass production were noticeably improved by high expression levels of CYP81D11. These effects occurred in high light, not in low light, and were associated with a noticeable reduction of singlet oxygen photoproduction. These findings indicate that CYP81D11 is a key component of β-cyclocitral-induced stress tolerance, acting through enhancement of the photosynthetic capacity of leaves. This gene could be a new target for improving photosynthesis, particularly in sunny environments.

The electrification of transport is increasingly recognized as a pivotal strategy in global efforts to mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and decrease dependency on fossil fuels. This paper investigates the key drivers behind the shift toward electric transportation, emphasizing environmental benefits, energy security, and technological advancements. Notable environmental advantages include significant reductions in CO2 emissions and air pollution, while energy security is enhanced by diminished reliance on oil and improved integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with renewable energy sources. Technological progress in battery systems, electric drivetrains, and smart grid infrastructure has accelerated the feasibility of widespread EV adoption. Despite these advances, the transition to electric transport faces several challenges, including the need for extensive charging infrastructure, sustainable sourcing of critical materials like lithium and cobalt, and the economic impacts on industries and labor markets. The paper explores strategies to overcome these challenges, such as advancements in recycling technologies, enhanced grid management, and supportive economic policies. By analyzing both the drivers and barriers, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape and future prospects for sustainable transport electrification.

Chemical weed control is a significant agricultural concern, and reliance on a limited range of herbicide action modes has increased resistant weed species, many of which use C4 metabolism. As a result, the identification of novel herbicidal agents with low toxicity targeting C4 plants becomes imperative. An assessment was conducted on the impact of 3-cyanobenzoic acid on the growth and photosynthetic processes of maize (Zea mays), a representative C4 plant, cultivated hydroponically over 14 days. The results showed a significant reduction in plant growth and notable disruptions in gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence due to the application of 3-cyanobenzoic acid, indicating compromised photosynthetic activity. Parameters such as the chlorophyll index, net assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), maximum effective photochemical efficiency (Fv′/Fm′), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (ϕPSII), and electron transport rate through PSII (ETR) all decreased. The A/PAR curve revealed reductions in the maximum net assimilation rate (Amax) and apparent quantum yield (ϕ), alongside an increased light compensation point (LCP). Moreover, 3-cyanobenzoic acid significantly decreased the carboxylation rates of RuBisCo (Vcmax) and PEPCase (Vpmax), electron transport rate (J), and mesophilic conductance (gm). Overall, 3-cyanobenzoic acid induced substantial changes in plant growth, carboxylative processes, and photochemical activities. The treated plants also exhibited heightened susceptibility to intense light conditions, indicating a significant and potentially adverse impact on their physiological functions. These findings suggest that 3-cyanobenzoic acid or its analogs could be promising for future research targeting photosynthesis.

This study examines calcium extraction from Bottom Ash (BA) and the use of Solid Residue (SR) as a substitute for White Lump Clay (WLC) in brick production. Experimental analyses identified calcium and silicon as the main elements in BA, with 50% of calcium carbonate recovered through leaching. SR was a viable alternative to WLC in ceramic bricks, as SEM-EDS and FTIR analyses revealed changes in composition and microstructure. This approach promotes circular economy principles by recovering resources and reducing waste. Calcium extraction from BA can produce 29,000 tons of CaCO3 annually for industrial use, while substituting SR for WLC in brick production could replace 30% of clay, saving 1500 tons of clay and producing millions of bricks annually. Less than 50% of incinerated Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) would require landfilling. The process supports sustainable construction by conserving natural resources, reducing landfill waste, and lowering CO2 emissions. It offers annual cost savings of 2,639,250 USD and preserves 74,812.5 tons of resources through waste and clay reduction. By demonstrating a scalable model for waste valorization, this research aligns with global goals for sustainable development, resource efficiency, and ecological balance.

Biochar’s benign effects on agricultural production have been demonstrated. Still, no consistent conclusions have been drawn on the impact of biochar-amended paddy fields on carbon sequestration, gas emission reduction, and efficiency enhancement in typical cropping areas in the middle Yangtze River. A field experiment using five dosages of biochar (CK, BC1.5, BC3, BC4.5, and BC6) at 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 kg·m−2 was conducted at the Hubei Irrigation Experiment Center Station, Jingmen City, Hubei Province, China, to investigate the effects of biochar on carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, and agricultural efficiency in paddy in the middle Yangtze River Region. This study showed that the optimal biochar dosage was 4.5 kg·m−2 (BC4.5). Biochar significantly improved soil properties, increased rice yield by 26.4–61.4%, and enhanced water use efficiency (WUE) and economic profit (EP) by 32.0–83.7% and −8.0–48.6%, respectively. Biochar increased soil carbon sequestration (SCS) and carbon pool management index (CPMI) by 23.0–198.3% and 22.9–71.5%, respectively. Biochar also reduced greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI), global warming potential (GWP), and emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that soil organic carbon (SOC), in addition to the “biochar” influence factor, was a key positive influence factor for SCS, CPMI, and EP. Another major positive factor for GWP was silt, and for WUE it was saturated hydraulic conductivity, while TN and SOC were the major negative variables for GHGI. In summary, biochar demonstrated outstanding carbon sequestration and emission reduction impacts while ensuring crop production growth and efficiency improvement. The results provide a research basis for safeguarding food security and mitigating climate warming in the middle Yangtze River region.

Renewable raw materials, as regenerative biobased feedstock for chemicals, have an enormous potential for reducing feedstock-related greenhouse gas emissions. Dedicated to driving the growth of bioeconomy, we continuously explore and develop building blocks for turning the bioeconomy ambition into a reality. Bio-based products are already available in the market but are limited in growth due to lack of technologies and product development costs. Alternatively, scale-up and utilization of biobased feedstocks, leveraging existing infrastructure, requires utilization of different chain-of-custody models. That is how a growing need for bio-attributed products, which provide the same quality and performance of their conventional equivalent and a proven benefit determined by the reduction of the Product Carbon Footprint in cradle-to-gate assessments, can be fulfilled. Ranging from a discussion around collaboration to drive sustainability in the chemical industry, towards current and future policy asks, we discuss about the opportunities of using different types of feedstocks and how we can accelerate industry transformation strategies by using attribution models, model biogenic CO2-uptake in a meaningful, fair, and transparent way, based on accepted and harmonized standards, such as global ISO standards. We provide reference points and statistics and address the latest and the most important bioeconomy-related aspects of bio-attribution as science is evolving.

Cities encounter increasing risks and challenges under new development patterns, and digital economy (DE) can drive cities’ improved resilience to natural and social uncertainties. Based on data collected on the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2011 to 2021, the development situation of the regional DE and urban resilience (UR) was measured, and the impact mechanisms of the DE on UR were analysed theoretically and empirically using a benchmark regression model. The findings are as follows: The benchmark test revealed that the DE development contributed significantly to UR in the region. The mediating effect test revealed that the DE improved UR through two pathways: industrial structure upgradation and energy restructuring. The moderating effect test suggested that environmental pollutant emissions had a negative moderating effect between the impact mechanisms of the DE, industrial structure, and energy structure and between the effects of industrial structure, energy structure, and UR, whereas CO2 emissions had a positive moderating effect between the impact mechanisms of DE and industrial structure. Heterogeneity analysis indicated that the DE contributed positively to the UR except in the upstream region, where the coefficient of the DE was insignificant. Overall, this study highlights the crucial role of the DE in improving UR and elucidates the theoretical impact mechanisms of environmental pollution control and carbon reduction measures on UR.

Artificial N2 fixation via the electrocatalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) has been recently promoted as a rational route toward reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission as compared with the traditional Haber–Bosch process. Nevertheless, optimizing NRR relies on developing highly efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we report on the reliable and reproducible synthesis of two promising electrocatalysts in either the presence or absence of Ketjenblack (KB), namely, ZrO2–ZrN@KB and ZrO2–ZrN systems, synthesized through the nitriding of Zr. Both materials had never previously been considered for NRR, to the best of our knowledge. Nevertheless, both of these electrocatalysts incorporated a combination of tetragonal ZrO2, ZrON, and cubic ZrN and showed excellent activity and durability toward NH3 formation. Moreover, the maximum NH3 production rate of 84.1 μg h–1 mg–1 at −0.7 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was achieved with the ZrO2–ZrN electrocatalyst with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 21.2% at −0.6 V vs RHE, indicating a high selectivity associated with the NRR. Additionally, the catalysts demonstrated excellent stability during the electrolysis process and recycling tests. We postulate that the combination of exposed active sites of ZrN and ZrO2 likely contributes to the enhanced NRR performance attributed to ZrO2–ZrN.

Background: The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is a measure of quantitative anesthetic potency and has become the standard index for the evaluation and comparison of volatile anesthetics, in addition to guiding dose administration. Black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) are primates present in the clinical and surgical routine of veterinary hospitals, as well as experimental models, especially in neuroscience. Few studies have evaluated the potency of the main volatile anesthetics in this species. This study aimed to determine the MAC of isoflurane and sevoflurane in C. penicillata using the up-and-down method and to evaluate the effects of these drugs on the quality of anesthetic induction, maintenance, and recovery. Materials, Methods & Results: Twenty-four animals of undetermined age were used. All marmosets were healthy according to hematological and physical evaluation. The animals were randomly divided into two groups: ISOMAC and SEVOMAC. Each animal was induced to general anesthesia in an anesthetic box with oxygen (5 L/min) and sevoflurane at 7% in the SEVOMAC group or isoflurane at 5% in the ISOMAC. Upon reaching lateral decubitus, orotracheal intubation was performed. General anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane or sevoflurane diluted in oxygen (0.8 L/min) using a non-rebreathing delivery system under spontaneous ventilation. As defined in the pilot study, the first animal from ISOMAC started the maintenance of anesthesia with 2.6% isoflurane, while the first animal in SEVOMAC received 4% sevoflurane. After finishing the instrumentation to assess heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, and rectal temperature, a 15-minute wait to reach anesthetic equilibrium was allowed, and then an electrical noxious stimulation (50 mA and 50 Hz) was performed on the lateral aspect of the thigh (a faradic current of 3 consecutive single stimuli, followed by 2 continuous stimuli). The animals' responses to the electrical stimulus were observed. The presence of a positive response (gross movement of the limbs, head, or vocalization) or a negative response (absence of gross movements) determined the increase or reduction, respectively, of the inhalation anesthetic concentration by 10% in the subsequent marmoset. The quality of anesthetic induction and recovery from anesthesia was evaluated using a scale that measured the intensity of agitation, coughing, nausea, and vomiting. Physiological variables were recorded before (M0) and after (M1) applying the nociceptive stimulus. Isoflurane and sevoflurane MAC values in C. penicillata were 2.29 ± 0.10% and 3.93 ± 0.61% respectively. Physiological parameters, quality of anesthetic induction and recovery did not differ significantly between groups. However, isoflurane caused irritation of the airway and ocular mucous membranes, more coughing episodes, and tearing at induction. There was no difference between groups for time to extubation and recovery time to regain sternal position. Discussion: Previous studies in primates found lower MAC values for both anesthetics, except for Lemur catta. Those findings may be explained by the use of different nociceptive stimuli and the MAC determination method employed, although no differences in MAC values have been described between bracketing or up-and-down methods in human primates and dogs. It is unlikely that the stimulus and technique alone are the determining factors for the high concentration of isoflurane and sevoflurane observed in the present study since MAC was high with both halogenates, indicating that dose extrapolation from other species can lead to the wrong anesthetic dosage.

Climate change is increasingly conceded as a significant menace to global agricultural productivity, with plant diseases emerging as a critical challenge in this context. Plant diseases can result in an annual reduction of approximately US$220 billion in agricultural productivity, impacting global economies and socio-economic stability. To address these challenges, it is crucial to explore the intricate relationship between climatic variables and the occurrence, intensity, and geographic distribution of plant diseases, highlighting how shifts in temperature, CO2 levels, and precipitation patterns exacerbate pathogen virulence and alter disease dynamics. This review examines the historical and projected impacts of climate change on vulnerable crops and regions, emphasizing the heightened risk to food security. The molecular basis of climate-modulated plant defense mechanisms and pathogen virulence is dissected, offering insights into the underlying biological processes that govern these interactions. In response to this escalating threat, we discuss climate-informed plant disease management strategies, including early warning systems, adaptive surveillance, and the development of resilient crops through biotechnological advancements such as genetic engineering, gene silencing, and genome editing. Additionally, we explore the role of resource-saving technologies and precision agriculture in mitigating the adverse repercussions of climate change on plant health. The review concludes with an exploration of critical research needs and future perspectives, underscoring the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches to safeguard sustainable agricultural productivity in a rapidly changing climate.

The phosphate-bearing rocks (phosphate rocks and phosphorites) were studied over a 45-meter interval of the Moyero river section, covering the upper part of the Darriwilian and the lower part of the Sandbian stages of the Ordovician. These rocks were investigated by field observations and laboratory methods, including optic and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analyses. The accumulation of phosphatic matter is manifested in carbonates, sandstones, and aleurolites in the form of grains (ooids and peloids), intraclasts, phosphatic and phosphatized shells. In argillites, it is represented by cryptocrystalline matter. Phosphate matter consists of fluorapatite. The peaks of phosphate accumulation are associated with the formation of layers of physically reworked granular phosphorites (condensation horizons) directly above the depositional sequence boundaries. The formation of the studied phosphate-bearing rocks during the Darriwilian-Sandbian transition was influenced by a combination of global (Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), reduction in sea surface temperature, atmospheric CO2, high sea level, flooding of craton margins) and regional (equatorial position of Siberia, arid climate, facies) factors. Global conditions led to the enrichment of seawater with phosphorus and the effect of upwelling. Regional conditions determined the characteristics of phosphate formation. Studied phosphate-bearing rocks can be considered as a record of upwelling on the Siberian craton during the Middle-Late Ordovician transition and one of the manifestations of long-term global cooling started early in the Middle Ordovician.

The application of hydrogen enrichment of palm oil-based biodiesel in a compression ignition engine was examined in this work. Synthesized from crude palm oil (CPO), biodiesel was first fed into a single-cylinder diesel engine. The intake manifold received hydrogen gas at flows of 2.5 L/min, 5 L/min, 7.5 L/min, and 10 L/min. Operating at a constant speed of 2,000 rpm, the single-cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine used The aim of this work is to assess the performance and emissions of a diesel engine utilizing hydrogen gas and CPO biodiesel fuels. This work examined engine performance and exhaust emissions using smoke emissions, exhaust temperature, power, thermal efficiency, and fuel economy. Addition of hydrogen improved emissions and performance. Optimal engine performance was achieved by adding 2.5 L/min of hydrogen, which resulted in a 20.12% increase in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and a 27.57% reduction in fuel consumption compared to biodiesel. The addition of hydrogen gas has a positive impact on exhaust emissions (HC, CO2, and smoke opacity), but has a negative impact on NO emissions. At elevated loads of 2.5 lpm hydrogen flow, emissions measured were 40.00 ppm, 0.04%, 4.20%, and 44.20%, respectively, alongside a 45.72% increase in NO emissions. Including hydrogen gas improves the diesel engines running on biodiesel's performance and exhaust pollutants.

The green unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains 12–13 carbonic anhydrases (CAs). For a long time, the two closely related α-CAs of the periplasmic membrane CAH1 and CAH2 were considered to be the CAs with the highest CO2 hydration activity. The recombinant protein α-CA CAH3 (rCAH3) from the thylakoid lumen obtained in the present study showed more than three times higher activity compared to CAH1 and more than 11 times higher compared to previous studies with rCAH3. Long-term sustainability of the enzyme was observed at alkaline pH (>8), with maintenance of half of its activity at 4 °C for up to 50 days. Thermostability of rCAH3 indicated the retention of the activity at 20 °C for one hour at pH 9–10 with its ~50% decrease at pH 6–7. However, the residual activity of rCAH3 after incubation at an extremely high temperature (75 °C) for 15 min led to the formation of the double-hump graph with maxima at pH 6 and 9. The enzyme demonstrated high sensitivity to ethoxyzolamide and acetazolamide at nM concentrations, to Zn2+ and Cu2+ cations at 1 mM concentrations, and L-cysteine was able to completely inhibit CA activity of rCAH3 through reduction of sulfhydryl groups. Esterase activity of rCAH3 was well detected with values comparable to those of bovine CAII, but with a maximum at pH 8 instead of pH 9, which is usual for bovine CAII. The results indicated that CAH3 may be the most active CA of C. reinhardtii and that its role in the photosynthetic apparatus function could have been underestimated in previous works.

"The preservation of meat has always presented a complex problem to man. The first means of preservation was probably rubbing salt onto the meat surface. This dried out the surface enough and produced a high enough salt concentration to inhibit the growth of spoilage organisms. It is believed that the salt used at first contained many impurities such as salt peter (sodium nitrate), which were also inhibitory to spoilage organisms. The meat would last longer than fresh unprotected meat, but the high salt concentration produced a rather unpalatable finished product. New means of preservation were provided with an increase in technology. A new method of preservation was developed by Nicholas Appert in the late 1700's. He found that foods heated in sealed containers lasted longer than foods that were unprotected as long as the container was not opened. This finding developed into the canning industry. Refrigeration was the most important technological advancement in meat preservation since canning. The reduction in temperature down to 0-5 [degrees] C decreased the rate of growth of spoilage organisms. Refrigeration greatly expanded the length of time meat could be stored. Meat could be transported further with increased shelf-life and storage time at home was increased. With the advent of refrigeration in the retail store, meat could be individually packaged and self-service meat cases evolved. The retail shelf-life was still limited to several days because the meat packaging material was oxygen permeable and provided an environment for bacterial growth. New types of packaging systems have been introduced that replace or remove oxygen and thus inhibit spoilage bacterial growth. Different gasses have been used to replace oxyqen to extend the storage life of meat. Carbon dioxide has been used successfully to replace oxygen and has caused significant increases in storage time (Baran et al., 1970; Huffman, 1974). Huffman, (1974) also reported using nitrogen to replace oxygen, but found no decrease in bacterial counts. In addition, Pierson et al., 1970, reported finding no difference between vacuum packaging and nitrogen gas packaging. Vacuum packaging excludes oxygen from the meat package thereby inhibiting aerobic spoilage organisms. Oxygen impermeable films have been developed to facilitate vacuum packaging. The use of vacuum packaging has become very popular in the distribution of beef wholesale cuts. Vacuum packaging of pork has not been utilized much in industry to date. Very little is known about the effects of vacuum packaging on pork. The objectives of this research were to determine: 1. The impact of (a) chill method and storage temperature and (b) meat quality on weight losses, tenderness, and oxygen saturation of the purge in vacuum packaged fresh boneless pork sirloin roasts. 2. The impact of leakers on (a) the subsequent microbial profile population and (b) fresh meat color after three days of retail display of vacuum packaged fresh boneless pork sirloin roasts."--Introduction.

The article presents the results of research on the impact of material and construction solutions on energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Field research was conducted in an existing free-standing greenhouse located in southern Poland. The research period covered the entire calendar year. The measurement data were used in the next step to validate the computational model using the numerical method of elementary balances. The data distribution was also analyzed in terms of basic statistics. The validated and verified model was used in the further part of the analysis to conduct computer simulations for three variants, differing in terms of material and construction solutions. The variants included: no foundation insulation, extruded polystyrene (XPS) insulation and the use of single-chamber polycarbonate panels with thermal insulation of the foundations. The obtained results showed a high agreement between theoretical and real data (85–89% for the coefficient of determination (R2) and 84–88% for the GOF method). In the case of variant 1, which in terms of material and construction solutions corresponded to the actual construction of the greenhouse, it was found that the annual energy demand for heating purposes amounted to 153,234 kWh/year. In variant 2, in which additional thermal insulation relative to the zero state was used, the energy demand for heating purposes was lower and amounted to 147,704 kWh/year. The lowest heat load was characteristic of variant 3, in which 116,294 kWh/year was required to cover heating needs. The variant with polycarbonate and foundation insulation brought energy savings of 24% and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 24%. In addition, replacing fuel from hard coal with natural gas brought significant benefits, reducing pollutant emissions by 51%. The paper is a new approach to the use of the mentioned numerical method for the assessment of gaseous pollutant emissions in this type of building based on numerical simulations of energy consumption.

Purpose China is experiencing an economic revolution focused on reducing carbon emissions (CEs). Various technological research and development (R&D) frameworks also hasten the growth of the digital economy, which then fuels this economic revolution. Nevertheless, several correlation uncertainties in China have been observed between R&D investment and CE reduction with green economic transformation. This phenomenon is attributed to insufficient spatial impact considerations. Design/methodology/approach Therefore, this article explored the spatial impacts of the digital economy and R&D expenditures regarding environmental quality using Chinese-related panel data between 2012 and 2021. This study uses the Moran I index to test whether there is a spatial relevance between regional carbon emissions in China and assess the digital economic advancement level using the entropy weight approach. In addition, this article analyzes the direct and indirect impacts following the partial differentiation approach, and then creates an interaction term between the digital economy and R&D investment to assess the moderating effect for examining the influence of investing in R&D on reducing CO2 levels of the digital economy. Findings A positive spatial relevance between the digital economy and CEs was then highlighted from the empirical findings. The digital economy expansion also demonstrated higher local CEs while negatively impacting nearby regions. Notably, the digital economy concurrently lowered and increased local CEs in the Eastern and Central zones, respectively. Overall, a larger R&D investment directly impacted the capacity of the digital economy in decreasing the carbon emission intensity (CEI) at a regional level. An accelerated digital economy expansion and lower CEI were recorded in the Eastern zone owing to more significant R&D investments. Research limitations/implications China has gradually shifted its focus from reducing CEs to implementing “dual control of carbon” to achieve the “dual carbon” target. Future studies should then involve additional studies concerning the impact mechanism and path selection related to “dual carbon control.” Practical implications Investment in R&D plays a key role in reducing carbon emissions from the digital economy. By fostering innovation and technological advances, R&D investment activities can create more energy-efficient digital infrastructures, develop sustainable practices and optimize resource use. In addition, these R&D investments can facilitate the transition to renewable energy sources, enhance data management systems to minimize waste and promote the adoption of green technologies by businesses and consumers. As the digital economy continues to evolve, prioritizing R&D in this area is critical to achieving long-term sustainable development goals and addressing the pressing challenges of climate change. Stakeholders across industries must therefore recognize the importance of investment in research and development as a strategic approach that not only drives economic growth but also ensures environmental stewardship in an increasingly digital world. Social implications Investments in research and development not only foster innovation and technological progress, but also promote sustainable practices, which can have significant environmental benefits. In addition, they have the potential to create new jobs, improve public health through better air quality and drive economic growth in a manner consistent with climate goals. As society becomes increasingly dependent on digital solutions, it is critical to harness the power of the digital economy to achieve a more sustainable and inclusive society. Originality/value Research development investment is critical to all aspects of regulation. Research on R&D investment can provide direction to local governments in formulating digital economy policies and can be beneficial to local governments in considering regional differences in resource availability. The research and technical innovation strategies in the policies for developing the digital economy can substantially expedite carbon neutrality achievement by 2060.

Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, wreaking havoc on the national pharmaceutical and medical supply industries, which are largely concentrated on the island.1 The impact was profound, particularly on the supply of small bags of intravenous (IV) fluids. For months afterward, hospitals across the United States struggled to obtain basic IV fluids, forcing clinicians to rethink how and when they used these products. The crisis highlighted the vulnerability of our healthcare supply chain to environmental disasters and underscored the need for more judicious use of IV fluids in the inpatient setting. In the wake of Hurricane Helene in September 2024, we find ourselves grappling with similar supply chain disruptions. By mid-October, ~86% of US physicians and providers had experienced IV fluid shortages.2 Some hospitals delayed noncritical surgeries3 and many hospitals continue to ration IV fluids until supplies return to their pre-Helene levels.4 These events, which are associated with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters due to climate change, demand long-term solutions. Hospitals face numerous challenges from extreme weather across the clinical care continuum. In addition to critical supply shortages, climate change and extreme weather can affect disease patterns (e.g., heat-related illness, injury, and vector-borne illnesses), resulting in care interruptions, and delay in diagnosis and treatment. As health care providers, it is incumbent upon us to not just treat the patient in front of us, but also to do our part in resource utilization to reduce waste and decrease patient care related greenhouse gas contributions and environmental harms that spur these events. Rather than relying on reactive and temporary workarounds, such as rationing supplies or importing from less-affected regions, it is time to reassess our dependency on IV fluids. While they are a cornerstone of inpatient care, used for everything from volume resuscitation in shock to rapid medication delivery, more environmentally sustainable, evidence-based practices exist that prioritize patient safety while conserving resources. We must also address the lack of supply chain resiliency and support broader efforts to reduce healthcare's large, negative environmental impact. There is growing evidence that IV fluids are often administered unnecessarily or continued longer than clinically indicated. The proportion of hospitalized patients who can safely receive oral hydration instead of IV fluids is likely substantial, particularly in cases where oral intake is feasible and safe. For patients with infectious diarrhea, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends oral rehydration solutions as the first line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration.5 In patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing contrast-enhanced CT or cardiac catheterization, oral hydration was as effective as IV hydration in preventing contrast-associated acute kidney injury.6, 7 Oral rehydration for clinically stable patients with hypernatremia has demonstrated safety in pediatric populations, and could be implemented for adult inpatients.8 Avoiding low-value practices restricting oral intake can reduce the use of IV fluids. Examples include shortening pre-procedure fasting times9 and early resumption of enteral nutrition for acute pancreatitis.10 Even for patients with dysphagia, a study by Leder et al. demonstrated that 90.7% of hospitalized patients who passed a 3-ounce water swallow challenge could be advanced to oral diets without subsequent signs of aspiration.11 Many medications such as antibiotics can be administered through IV push (like cefazolin and meropenem)12 or orally (as in azithromycin or fluroquinolones) with equal efficacy.13 IV proton pump inhibitors in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleed can be administered as infusions or intermittently as twice a day IV pushes or oral therapy after the initial 80 mg bolus, according to American College of Gastroenterology guidelines.14 Wherever fluids can be minimized, doing so provides multiple benefits including improved resource utilization and ease of nursing medication administration. Overuse in these cases is not only wasteful but also increases the risk of complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and prolonged hospital stays in patients with heart failure and other conditions. Moreover, the unnecessary use of IV lines increases the risk of infections and thrombophlebitis, adding to patient morbidity. Despite the evidence, excess use of IV fluids and medications remains a default practice in many hospitals. The reasons are multifaceted. Orders may be part of standard protocols, sometimes with little thought given to whether they are truly necessary. Many clinicians view IV fluid administration as a simple, low-risk intervention to "do something" for patients, especially where the clinical picture is uncertain. The complex nature of insurance reimbursements also contributes to this confusion, as the use of IV fluids and medications can be perceived as the difference between inpatient and observation status. This mindset contributes to a cycle of overuse that is difficult to break. Using IV fluids and medications more judiciously and developing better decision-making frameworks for fluid management also includes work to reduce our overall dependency on IV medications. A report by the Department of Health & Human Services identified more than 25% of drug and device manufacturers are located in areas at high risk of natural hazards including flooding, tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes.15 The climate change-induced disruptions caused by Hurricanes Maria and Helene offer opportunities to reevaluate our use of IV fluids. These events have forced hospitals to implement multifaceted measures aimed at conserving supplies, such as encouraging oral hydration when possible, limiting the use of IV fluids to critically ill patients, changing medications to oral equivalents, and more carefully monitoring fluid balance. From a greenhouse gas emissions perspective, the production of 500 mL of IV fluids generates about 0.5 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).16 If we can reduce annual usage by 25%, this could save emissions equivalent to driving a passenger car nearly 800,000 miles, or 285 trips from California to Maine in the United States. This rough estimate and other high-value care practices highlight the broader environmental benefits of simultaneously improving healthcare sustainability and potential cost reductions.17 Conservation strategies should not be seen as temporary measures but as part of a broader shift toward more mindful and evidence-based fluid management practices. Hospitals should consider implementing stricter guidelines for IV fluid administration. This includes regular reassessment of fluid needs, limiting automatic inclusion of IV fluids in admission orders, or requirements to reorder continuous IV fluids after a prespecified amount of time. Clinical decision support tools can help guide fluid management based on the patient's condition. For example, ask clinicians to consider if oral equivalents or oral hydration with fluid intake goals would be an appropriate first-line approach for patients with active diet orders. The practice of "keeping veins open" with IV fluids may also not be required as studies in the pediatric population suggest no difference between saline lock and continuous infusion on IV patency.18 As hospitalists, many of us are involved in administrative roles including resource utilization and supply chain issues as a part of process improvement and providing higher value. By taking steps now to reassess our utilization, we can create more resilient and adaptable healthcare systems better equipped to face the challenges of the future. This latest IV fluid shortage is not a supply chain anomaly. The COVID-19 pandemic is a lingering reminder that even the most basic elements of medical care are not immune to the forces of nature.19 Aside from causing severe equipment shortages, it also catapulted telehealth, once considered an aspirational next step for medicine, to the forefront of ambulatory care. Natural disasters, pandemics, and future unknown threats provide opportunities for innovation, improvement, and adoption of more sustainable practices. Rigorous and systematic research into best practices and disaster preparedness should be undertaken to inform our institutional policies and priorities given the increasing likelihood of future supply disruptions. Changing practice patterns will require more than updated guidelines and decision support tools. A cultural shift is necessary to reduce the default reliance on IV fluids and medications in inpatient care and to move to more sustainable hospital practice in general. This starts with education. Physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers need to be trained in the risks associated with unnecessary IV fluid use and the benefits of alternative approaches. They should also be apprised of the downstream environmental harms of hospital waste and overuse and how this can adversely impact our communities and patients.20 Medical schools and residency programs should emphasize evidence-based fluid management, teaching future clinicians to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of IV fluid administration. Continuing education programs for practicing providers can also help to reinforce these principles, especially in the context of supply chain vulnerabilities and disaster preparedness. Medical societies also have a role in driving sustainable healthcare delivery through clinical practice guidelines. Members of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health have committed to addressing climate change and health issues through their organizations and collectively through policy action and educational offerings. The frequent disruptions in IV fluid supplies due to climate disasters such as Hurricanes Maria and Helene highlight an urgent need to reduce overreliance on these products in the inpatient setting. We must seize this moment to promote smarter, evidence-based practices that not only conserve valuable resources but also enhance patient safety and care outcomes. This shift will require systemic changes, from updating clinical guidelines to fostering a culture that questions the routine use of IV fluids. By doing so, we can create a more resilient, patient-centered healthcare system capable of withstanding the growing pressures of climate-related disruptions (Table 1). The authors declare no conflict of interest.
