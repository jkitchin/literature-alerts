Thermocatalytic decomposition of methane provides opportunities for hydrogen (H2) production with no emission of carbon dioxide. However, high‐value carbon products need to be produced for economic deployment of thermocatalytic decomposition and to achieve a minimum H2 selling price below the U.S, Department of Energy target of $1/kg H2. In this review, we re‐evaluate data on catalyst development reported in the literature and propose fundamental correlations between catalyst characteristics, catalytic stability, and properties of carbon co‐products. In the first part of the review, growth mechanisms for carbon nanotubes using state‐of‐the‐art chemical vapor deposition are reviewed to catalog the effects of catalyst characteristics, the influence of carbon sources, interactions between metal particles and supports, and metal particle sizes on carbon growth. In the second part, representative developments in mono‐, bi‐, and tri‐metallic nickel catalysts are highlighted. We present kinetic analysis of reactions catalyzed by mono‐metallic nickel catalysts, which generates a correlation between metal particle size and catalyst stability.

Green and sustainable electrosynthesis of urea at ambient conditions through co-reduction of CO2 and NO3− (CR-CO2/NO3−) is regarded as a new avenue for nitrogen fertilizer production, however, the lack of novel electrocatalysts capable of selective C-N coupling hinders its wide application. Herein we reported a TiNx catalyst (TiN/TiN0.3) prepared by facile electric explosion method for electrocatalytic urea synthesis via CR-CO2/NO3−. The derived catalyst with porous nanostructure and specific active phase (TiN0.3) is more conductive for efficient C-N coupling. Consequently, a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 43.1 ± 3.1 % and a urea formation rate as high as 1488 ± 95 μg h−1 mgcat−1 were reached over the TiNx electrode, outperforming most of the reported CR-CO2/NO3− systems toward urea synthesis. In-situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and isotope-labeling experiments demonstrated the details about electrochemical coupling processes. The simulation study suggested that the TiN0.3 (1 0 0) facet facilitates the electroreduction of CO2 and NO3−, and decreases the energy barrier for generation of the key intermediates (*CO/*NH2), thus leading to the selective formation of urea. This work accomplished highly efficient electrochemical CR-CO2/NO3− toward nitrogen fertilizer production over a novel TiNx electrocatalyst for the target process.

Abstract Silicon-based porous nanocomposites are considered promising as electrode materials for the photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, the high cost of raw materials and tedious processing for building nanostructures may not be conducive to large-scale industrial applications in terms of cost. Herein, we would like to introduce a porous structure prepared by Fenton reaction-assisted chemical etching of low-cost commercial silicon powder in the mixed solution of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen peroxide. These porous particles are further decorated with silver nanoparticles to explore their feasibility for photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. As shown by experimental results, this silicon-based nanocomposite is capable of catalyzing the conversion of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide. The low cost of commercial silicon powder (~$3000/ton) compared with that of silicon wafers also renders this method potential and feasible for large-scale production of silicon-based porous materials.

Since General Secretary Xi Jinping pledged the “30·60” targets to the world, the importance of pollution reduction and carbon reduction has become increasingly prominent. The previous focus on the pollution reduction effects of emission trading systems, while overlooking their carbon reduction impacts, as well as the limitations of research methods and scope, is no longer suitable for the needs of the new era. Therefore, this paper constructs a CGE model to study the synergistic effects, simulating the synergistic emission reduction effects of sulfur dioxide emission trading policies, and comes to the following conclusions: After the implementation of the sulfur dioxide emission trading mechanism, under different sulfur price scenarios, the synergistic reduction amounts of SO2 and CO2 vary greatly. As the sulfur price increases, the reduction amount becomes larger. In the five sulfur price scenarios set in this paper, the maximum reduction of SO2 can reach about 111,400 tons, and the maximum for CO2 is about 399 million tons. The CO2 reduction rate is approximately 1.0767 times that of SO2. This indicates that the sulfur dioxide emission trading policy is a very effective path for synergistic pollution and carbon reduction, with good reduction effects. In addition, sulfur dioxide emission trading will reduce the consumption of fossil energy, decrease industry output, raise product prices, cause GDP loss, and lead to reduced social welfare to varying degrees.

The imperative to address climate change and CO2 emissions has elicited substantial interest in the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) as an avenue to both environmental sustainability and the production of value-added fuels. However, the selectivity and efficiency of eCO2RR remain below the industrial requirement for its implementation at high current density. One pivotal strategy to ameliorate this deficiency involves augmenting the mass transport of CO2 to electrode, thereby alleviating the competing hydrogen evolution reaction and consequently enhancing eCO2RR performance. Herein, we primarily discuss the CO2 mass transport enhancement strategies through electrode and electrolyzer designs, as well as electrolysis conditions. The electrode designs are first presented, including wettability regulation, porous substrates construction, catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer designs. Then, we highlight state-of-the-art electrolyzer designs, including the bipolar membrane structure, interdigitated flow field and in-situ exsolution of CO2 structure. The electrolyzer based gas–liquid Taylor flow is also introduced. Following this, we delve into the impact of various electrolysis conditions, encompassing the electrolyte, electrolysis potentials, CO2 pressure, CO2 flow rate and reaction temperature. Finally, we conclude this review by delineating persisting challenges and potential solutions aimed at advancing CO2 mass transport for the industrial implementation of eCO2RR technology.

Climate change due to increasing CO2 emissions has become one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. In order to lessen CO2 emissions and the negative effects of global warming, CO2 utilization and conversion technologies have received more attention in recent years. Among the various carbon utilization and conversion technologies, an innovative technology approach for producing high-value-added products using intermittent renewable energy is CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ECR). However, more cost-effective, reliable, and scalable electrolyzer designs, are still required for future commercial CO2ECR. In this review, we summarize current developments in CO2ECR electrolyzers and highlight how the CO2ECR process's efficiency can be enhanced by optimizing internal core components of electrolyzer, including catalyst, electrode, ion exchange membrane (IEM) and flow field design. The aim of this review is to raise awareness among researchers, professionals and policymakers of the potential benefits of using CO2ECR technology for carbon utilization.

The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (eCO2RR) to formate, driven by clean energy, is a promising approach for producing renewable chemicals and high-value fuels. Despite its potential, further development faces challenges due to limitations in electrocatalytic activity and durability, especially for non-noble metal-based catalysts. Here, naturally abundant bismuth-based nanosheets that can effectively drive CO2-to-formate electrocatalytic reduction are prepared using the plasma-activated Bi2Se3 followed by a reduction process. Thus-obtained plasma-activated Bi nanosheets (P-BiNS) feature ultrathin structures and high surface areas. Such nanostructures ensure the P-BiNS with outstanding eCO2RR catalytic performance, highlighted by the current density of over 80 mA cm−2 and a formate Faradic efficiency of >90%. Furthermore, P-BiNS catalysts demonstrate excellent durability and stability without deactivation following over 50 h of operation. The selectivity for formate production is also studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, validating the importance and efficacy of the stabilization of intermediates (OCHO*) on the P-BiNS surfaces. This study provides a facile plasma-assisted approach for developing high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts.

Oxygen-containing species have been demonstrated to play a key role in facilitating electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR), particularly in enhancing the selectivity towards multi-carbon (C2+) products. However, the underlying promotion mechanism is still under debate, which greatly limits the rational optimization of the catalytic performance of CO2RR. Herein, taking CO2 and O2 co-electrolysis over Cu as the prototype, we successfully clarified how O2 boosts CO2RR from a new perspective by employing comprehensive theoretical simulations. Our results demonstrated that O2 in feed gas can be rapidly reduced into *OH, leading to the partial oxidation of Cu surface under reduction conditions. Surface *OH accelerates the formation of quasi-specifically adsorbed K+ due to the electrostatic interaction between *OH and K+ ions, which significantly increases the concentration of K+ near the Cu surface. These quasi-specifically adsorbed K+ ions can not only lower the C–C coupling barriers but also promote the hydrogenation of CO2 to improve the CO yield rate, which are responsible for the remarkably enhanced efficiency of C2+ products. During the whole process, O2 co-electrolysis plays an indispensable role in stabilizing surface *OH. This mechanism can be also adopted to understand the effect of high pH of electrolyte and residual O in oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) on the catalytic efficiency towards C2+ products. Therefore, our work provides new insights into strategies for improving C2+ products on the Cu-based catalysts, i.e., maintaining partial oxidation of surface under reduction conditions.

Abstract In this experiment, it was experimentally investigated the combustion and exhaust characteristics, as well as the thermal efficiency, of RCCI combustion using gasoline, ethanol, and propane as low-reactivity fuels under four operating conditions. For each operating condition, gISNO x was limited to 0.15 g/kWh, and gISSmoke was limited to below 15 mg/kWh. The experiment was conducted by determining the operating conditions that satisfied these limitations and resulted in the highest city thermal efficiency. The low-reactivity fuels were supplied by port injection, while diesel was directly injected into the combustion chamber using a diesel injector. As a result, when gasoline is replaced with low-carbon fuels like ethanol and propane, the reduction in CO 2 emissions occurred. Under maximum power conditions, using ethanol allowed for a maximum reduction in CO 2 emissions of 6.81%. Depending on the driving conditions, ethanol showed a reduction ranging from 3.60 to 6.81%, while propane exhibited a reduction ranging from 3.10 to 5.64%. Additionally, by substituting with ethanol and propane, the GIE could be improved up to 44.73 and 43.56%, respectively.

Electrocatalytically reducing CO2 into value-added products is a challenging but promising process. Catalysts have been proposed to reduce the potential necessary for the reaction to occur, among which single-atom alloys (SAAs) are particularly promising. Here, we employ density functional theory calculations and the computational electrode model to predict whether silver-based SAAs have the potential to be effective electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into C1 products. We take into account surface defects by using the Ag(211) surface as a model. We also verify whether the proposed materials are prone to OH poisoning or enhance the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Our calculations predict that these materials show weak mixing between the host and the dopant, characterized by a sharp peak in the density of states near the Fermi energy, except when copper (also a coinage metal) is used as the dopant. This affects the adsorption energy of the different intermediate molecules, yielding different reaction profiles for each substrate. As non-doped silver, copper-doped SAA tends to spontaneously desorb carbon monoxide (CO) instead of proceeding with its reduction. Other elements of the fourth period (Fe, Co, and Ni) tend to bind to the CO molecule but do not favor more reduced products. These metals also tend to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction. On the contrary, we show that the Ir and Rh dopants have significant potential as electrocatalysts, which favors the reduction of CO over its desorption while also suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction at potentials lower than those required by copper. They have also been shown to not be prone to poisoning by OH radicals.

A novel electrolyzer has been proposed for CO2 reduction to CO, concurrently generating NaClO as a byproduct at the anode. The cell is divided into two compartments by a bipolar membrane, which plays a pivotal role in the dissociation of H2O into H+ and OH−. In the cathode compartment, CO2 is reduced to CO within a neutral organic solution. Simultaneously, in the anode compartment, Cl− undergoes oxidation to form ClO− within a basic aqueous solution. The electrolyzer remains stable during 10 hours of electrolysis, and the current density reaches 76.35 mA cm−2 at a potential of -2.4 V (vs SHE), with the Faradaic efficiency of CO formation stable at 93%. By increasing the product values, CO2 electro-reduction technology can be promoted to industrial applications.
