Recent advances in nanoparticle materials can facilitate the electro-reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to form valuable products with high selectivity. Copper (Cu)-based electrodes are promising candidates to drive efficient and selective CO2 reduction. However, the application of Cu-based chalcopyrite semiconductors in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is still limited. This study demonstrated that novel zinc oxide (ZnO)/copper indium gallium sulfide (CIGS)/indium sulfide (InS) heterojunction electrodes could be used in effective CO2 reduction for formic acid production. It has been determined that Faradaic efficiencies for formic acid production using ZnO nanowire (NW) and nanoflower (NF) structures vary due to structural and morphological differences. A ZnO NW/CIGS/InS heterojunction electrode resulted in the highest efficiency of 77.2% and 0.35 mA cm–2 of current density at a −0.24 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) bias potential. Adding a ZTO intermediate layer by the spray pyrolysis method decreased the yield of formic acid and increased the yield of H2. Our work offers a new heterojunction electrode for efficient formic acid production via cost-effective and scalable CO2 reduction.

Abstract We report here the feasibility of using LaT M O 3 -based perovskites (T M = Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, i.e., non-Cu 3d transition metals) as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR). Phase pure LaT M O 3 s, having T M -ions in multiple oxidation states for all and O-defects for LaFeO 3 and LaNiO 3 , have been synthesized and tested as electrocatalysts for eCO 2 RR in fuel cell type set-up. The above characteristics of the La-T M -oxides have been found to influence the current densities during eCO 2 RR at the various applied potentials, with favorable effects of the presence of O-defects (as for LaFeO 3 and LaNiO 3 ). Upon eCO 2 RR, both C1 and C2 liquid products have been obtained, including ethanol, with a partial current density of -2.66 mA/cm 2 at -1.2 V vs. RHE (for LaFeO 3 ). The types of products and the faradic efficiencies have been found to depend on the T M -ion present (in the LaT M O 3 ); in particular, the oxidation state(s), associated O-defect(s) and electronic conductivity. Furthermore, the electrocatalysts have been found to be stable during eCO 2 RR. Overall, the present work highlights the potential of La-T M -oxide perovskites for usage as stable electrocatalysts for eCO 2 RR, and also provides insights into the proper selection of ‘T M ’ and reaction conditions for obtaining the desired product(s).

The increasing emission of carbon dioxide worldwide has emerged as a major global concern in the context of addressing climate change. Converting CO2 to high-value carbon materials is a promising solution to capture emitted carbon for achieving carbon neutrality. Furthermore, such conversion can provide carbon nanomaterials for key industries, including the lithium battery and fuel cell industries. Here, it is shown that sub-50 nm tangled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be synthesized by adjusting the metaborate concentration and the current density through the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide in a molten carbonate salt. The metaborate ion concentration affects the product selectivity and carbon morphology, and the current density is strongly related to the particle size of in situ seed catalysts supplied by the dissolution of an Ni-Fe-Cr alloy anode. The optimized process conditions control the nucleation and growth of carbon via a tip-growth mechanism, thereby promoting the formation of sub-50 nm CNTs rather than bulky irregular carbon particles. The Raman and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analyses showed that the properties of the prepared CNTs depended on the synthetic parameters. This study provides deep insights into the mechanism underlying carbon synthesis through the electrochemical reduction of a molten carbonate salt.

The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C‐700‐4) simply by a thermal‐driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen‐doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for carbon dioxide reduction into formate. The in‐situ experimental observation on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen‐doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8% and the long‐time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar‐driven system renders the high 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2%, presenting the impressive solar‐to‐fuel conversion.

The possibility of electrosynthesis of formate from CO2 at a current density of 50–190 mA/cm2 in sulfuric acid aqueous solutions (pH 2–2.5) in a gas diffusion electrode with a lead electrocatalyst deposited on acetylene black was studied. It is shown that with an appropriate selection of the electrolyte composition, it is possible to carry out the electrosynthesis process with parameters that practically differ little from those in alkaline solutions. The highest current efficiency of 74% was obtained at a potential of -1.89 V, a current density of 150 mA/cm2 in an electrolyte of 0.5 M K2SO4 + 0.083 M H2SO4.

A sterically encumbered dinuclear amidinato magnesium hydride 3 with bridging hydrido ligands was synthesized from the metalation of the corresponding amidine 1 with dibutylmagnesium and subsequent treatment with phenylsilane. This complex reacts stoichiometrically with 1 atm of carbon dioxide at room temperature in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to the corresponding bis(thf) adduct of the dinuclear formate complex 4‐2thf with bridging formate anions. This complex is stable in THF at 60°C for more than 16 hours but decomposes into the amidine 1 upon removal of ligated thf ligands . Complex 3 efficiently catalyzes the reduction of carbon dioxide with 9‐BBN, yielding bis(boryl)acetal (R2BO)2CH2, and with silanes H4‐nSiPhn (n = 1, 2, and 3). The bis(silyl)acetal is quantitatively accessible for Ph3SiH (n = 3) whereas during the reduction of CO2 with hydrogen‐richer silanes (n = 1, 2) siloxanes form and methane evolves.

Bismuth-based catalysts are highly promising for the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to formate product. However, achieving high activity and selectivity towards formate and ensuring long-term stability remains challenging. This work reports the oxygen plasma inducing strategy to construct the abundant grain boundaries of Bi/BiOx on ultrathin two-dimensional Bi nanosheets. The oxygen plasma-treated Bi nanosheet (OP-Bi) exhibits over 90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate at a wide potential range from −0.5 to −1.1 V, and maintains a great stability catalytic performance without significant decay over 30 h in flow cell. Moreover, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device with OP-Bi as catalyst sustains the robust current density of 100 mA cm−2 over 50 h, maintaining a formate FE above 90%. In addition, rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery presents the peak power density of 1.22 mW cm−2 with OP-Bi as bifunctional catalyst. The mechanism experiments demonstrate that the high-density grain boundaries of OP-Bi provide more exposed active sites, faster electron transfer capacity, and the stronger intrinsic activity of Bi atoms. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations further elucidate that the unsaturated Bi coordination atoms between the grain boundaries can effectively activate CO2 molecules through elongating the C–O bond, and reducing the formation energy barrier of the key intermediate (*OCOH), thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of eCO2RR to formate product.

Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction in aqueous electrolytes is a promising route to produce added-value chemicals and decrease carbon emissions. However, even in Gas-Diffusion Electrode devices, low aqueous CO 2 solubility limits catalysis rate and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that when assembled over a heterogeneous electrocatalyst, a film of nitrile-modified Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) acts as a remarkable CO 2 -solvation layer that increases its local concentration by ~27-fold compared to bulk electrolyte, reaching 0.82 M. When mounted on a Bi catalyst in a Gas Diffusion Electrode, the MOF drastically improves CO 2 -to-HCOOH conversion, reaching above 90% selectivity and partial HCOOH currents of 166 mA/cm 2 (at −0.9 V vs RHE). The MOF also facilitates catalysis through stabilization of reaction intermediates, as identified by operando infrared spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory. Hence, the presented strategy provides new molecular means to enhance heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction, leading it closer to the requirements for practical implementation.

Amorphous materials are distinguished by their exceptional attributes, notably their expansive surface area and the profusion of active sites they present. Consequently, the amorphization process stands as an efficacious strategy to augment the catalytic efficacy of electrocatalysts. This is achieved through the meticulous construction of the surface architecture and the precise modulation of the electronic configuration of these materials. Therefore, this review aims to offer a thorough examination of the latest progress in the application of amorphous materials for the enhancement of electrocatalytic processes, with a particular emphasis on the nitrate (NO3‐) reduction reaction (NITRR) and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Initially, we delve into the structural benefits inherent to amorphous materials, outlining the diverse synthesis techniques and characterization methodologies utilized in their development. Following this, we illustrate the utilization of various amorphous materials in NITRR and CO2RR, accentuating how the amorphous framework influences electrocatalytic activities. Concludingly, we encapsulate the merits and the obstacles encountered in the application of amorphous electrocatalysts for NITRR and CO2RR, whilst also forecasting the future direction for the creation of innovative amorphous electrocatalysts.

Metal‐organic framework (MOF) materials have attracted much attention due to their diverse topological structures, excellent adsorption capacity, and unique physicochemical properties, which hold great promise in catalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the original MOFs materials have disadvantages such as poor electrical conductivity, high diffusion barrier and limited accessible catalytic sites, which seriously limit their application in CO2RR. Therefore, many structural engineering strategies have been used to improve the CO2RR performance of the MOFs materials. In this review, we mainly review the four main structure engineering strategies, i.e. crystal engineering, 2D engineering, heterostructure engineering and MOF derivatives engineering, in enhancing the catalytic CO2RR performance of the MOFs. We hope that this review will not only provide insights for the rational design of efficient MOFs materials for the CO2RR, but also stimulate more research work in this field.

The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds substantial promise for producing high‐value chemicals and fuels, drawing significant attention from both academia and industry. This work proposes an in‐situelectrodeposition method to prepare indium‐doped copper (Cu)‐based catalysts on carbon paper (Cu100Inx‐CP, x = 3.9, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, and 7.6, denoting the molar ratio of In to Cu in the catalyst.). The catalysts Cu100Inx‐CP were used for CO2RR to produce multi‐carbon (C2+) products. Characterization results showed that In was highly dispersed in the Cu particles at x<5.1. The Cu100In5.1‐CP (containing 0.95 wt% In based on Cu) was very efficient for electrocatalytic CO2RR. The in‐situ Raman spectroscopy showed that Cu100In5.1‐CP enhanced *CO intermediate adsorption and promoted the production of C2+ products due to the synergistic effect between In and Cu. In doping could suppress HER, enhanced *CO intermediate adsorption, and C‐C coupling for the production of C2+ products in CO2RR.

Understanding the structure-activity relationship of materials that are active for the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2ERR) is crucial for developing stable, high-performance catalysts. In this research, it is first shown that ball-milling is a highly efficient way to disperse cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) onto carbon black without influencing the CO2 electroreduction performance of the resulting materials. Then, the link between the loadings of the CoPC precursor on the carbon support and the CO2ERR activity of the pyrolyzed materials is demonstrated. With CO current efficiencies higher than 45 % and CO current densities as high as -20 mA cm−2 at -0.77 V vs. RHE, the materials with CoPC loadings of 7.9 wt% and higher were still surprisingly active after pyrolysis at 800 and 900°C. On the other hand, the CO2ERR activity of the materials containing less than 6.1 wt% CoPC was drastically reduced after pyrolysis at these temperatures, with CO current efficiencies lower than 10%. X-ray powder diffraction revealed that only the materials containing crystalline CoPC before pyrolysis showed good CO2ERR activity after pyrolysis at 800 and 900°C. Furthermore, X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that the loading of the CoPC precursor influenced the structure of the active sites in the pyrolyzed CoPC/C materials. Overall, this study highlights the importance of the dispersion of CoPC when forming a material that is catalytically active for CO2ERR after pyrolysis.

Despite enormous efforts towards development of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) technologies, industrial-scale devices are still visibly unavailable. The development of effective CO2RR catalysts appears to be the most difficult challenge for this technology. Due to the well-defined active site, distinct energy levels, and tunable core structure, porphyry-type molecular catalysts (metal-porphyrins, and metal-phthalocyanines) have gained attention among the various classes of electrocatalysts. But because they are not very stable or long-lasting, getting their benchmark CO2RR performance is still hard. Therefore, to approach their ideal performance, researchers have conducted many experimental and theoretical analyses, altering their electronic and geometric configurations and even transitioning them from homogeneous to heterogeneous phases. The aim of this review is to provide a coherent framework for the existing literature on molecular systems for CO2RR and to make forward-looking suggestions for the development of optimal CO2RR catalysts. We critically reviewed the possible strategies for tuning and controlling the catalytic active sites, emphasizing the bridges between activity and structural features of molecular systems, and proposed logical optimization strategies to improve their performance and selectivity. Insights provided in this article would surely benefit readers to develop novel high-performing CO2RR electrocatalysts in the future.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a sustainable strategy for producing fuels and chemicals. However, it suffers from sluggish CO2 activation and slow water dissociation. In this work, we construct a (P‐O)δ− modified In catalyst that exhibits high activity and selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate. A combination of in‐situ characterizations and kinetic analyses indicate that (P‐O)δ− has a strong interaction with K+(H2O)n, which effectively accelerates water dissociation to provide protons. In‐situ attenuated total reflectance surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS) measurements together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that (P‐O)δ− modification leads to a higher valence state of In active site, thus promoting CO2 activation and HCOO* formation, while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the (P‐O)δ− modified oxide‐derived In catalyst exhibits excellent formate selectivity across a broad potential window with a formate Faradaic efficiency as high as 92.1% at a partial current density of ~200 mA cm−2 and a cathodic potential of ‐1.2 V vs. RHE in an alkaline electrolyte.

A fuel cell involving CO2/H2 is an appealing energy system to convert CO2 into value-added fuels as well as to generate electricity using only waste heat. However, overcoming the inherent activation barrier of CO2 to improve the CO2 conversion rate in CO2/H2 fuel cell is still challenging. Herein, we report a synergistic electron-donor and proton-repulsion group composed of Pt-N3-S-C sites to simultaneously modulate the electronic structure and CO2-protonation ability of Ru nanoclusters (RuNC) in RuNC/Pt-N3-S-C catalyst. Experiments combined with theoretical calculations indicate that Pt-N3-S sites not only function as electron donors to Ru nanoclusters to cooperatively induce the orbital hybridization of Ru 3d and the antibonding orbitals of CO2, affording the dissociation of C=O bonds in CO2, but also as electronic structure "modulator" to create new active sites on the surface of RuNC to effectively active CO2 molecular. More importantly, an internal polarization field between Pt-N3-S-C and RuNC additionally makes single Pt sites repel proton while Ru atoms serve as proton capturers via hydrogen spillover effect, resulting in accelerated protonation of CO2. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits highly improved catalytic activities for the CO2 conversion with a conversion rate of 559.1 μmol gcat-1 h-1. This approach helps with fine tuning the electronic structures and catalytic CO2 protonation ability of catalysts for thermal-coupled electrocatalysis.

With a significant share of renewable power generation integrated into the power supply, it is crucial to timely adjust the regulating peak load for coal-fired power plants equipped with CO2 capture to ensure the stable operation of the multi-energy supply system. In this paper, the effects of varying boiler loads on the techno-economic performance of the retrofitted power plant were studied. Furthermore, the potential for reducing the cost of CO2 capture was investigated, and early opportunities for demonstration were discussed. Results showed that when the boiler load decreased from 100% turbine heat acceptance condition to 50% turbine heat acceptance condition, the cost of CO2 capture increased from 37.0 $/t CO2 to 57.0 $/t CO2, cost contribution of energy penalty and extra capital investment also increased from 20.6 $/t-CO2 to 25.7 $/t-CO2, and from 16.4 $/t-CO2 to 31.3 $/t-CO2, respectively. Furthermore, by improving separation efficiency from 0.15 to 0.5, a 25% to 30% reduction in CO2 capture cost can be achieved. The cost of CO2 capture could decrease by 42.2–50.5% when the cumulative capacity reaches 250 GW under the high investment learning rate scenario. According to the distribution of coal prices and renewable energy sources in China, the early demonstration projects of multi-energy supply systems should prioritize the northern region. The results of this work can provide informative references for making roadmaps and policies for CO2 emission reduction toward carbon neutrality.

The wide product spectrum resulting from the intricate reactions of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) makes CO2RR unfavorable for industrial electrolysis. Herein, we demonstrate a hydrogen-feeding effect from copper-silica catalysts that can regulate CO2RR product selectivity via modulation of Cu dispersion in the copper-silica core-shell particles. We found electromethanation of CO2 is greatly enhanced on Cu-Si catalyst with optimally dispersed Cu nanoparticles, resulting in a high methane Faradaic efficiency of 72.9 %. In contrast, a lower or higher Cu dispersion correlated to a preferential (co-)production of methane and ethylene or hydrogen. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and spectroscopic analysis, we show Cu dispersion affects the Cu coverage on SiO2 and the exposure of Cu-O-Si interfacial sites for CO2RR and water dissociation. An optimum Cu dispersion creates abundant Cu-O-Si sites with reduced energy barriers for both the hydrogenation of *CHO and water dissociation, leading to selective methane formation.

Nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are promising candidates. However, its selectivity and activity are limited by the undeveloped pore and limited electronic effect. Herein, we propose a strategy of three birds with one stone to utilize the embedded nickel for inducing electron-rich pyridinic-NC with multimodal porous structure based on the hard template assisted sacrificial template method. Nickel acts as sacrificial agent and inducer to facilitate the formation of mesoporous and reactive nitrogen species for capturing and activating reactants, respectively. Besides, we find that nickel as electron donor endows the NC with electron accumulation for participating actively in PCET reaction. The resultant Ni0.87-NC-1-AE exhibits an eminent FECO of 97.6% with excellent activity and stability. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and the projected crystal orbital Hamilton populations (pCOHP) confirm the accumulation of *COOH and the stable adsorption of *COOH on the surface. What's more, the well-designed experiments and DFT calculations accurately locate pyridinic-N as the active site, where the aggregated electrons donated by nickel significantly reduce the energy barrier of rate-determining step and promote the desorption of CO. This work provides an instructive perspective to construct advanced NC electrocatalysts with high mass transfer efficiency and high catalytic activity.

The utilization of photothermocatalytic dry reforming of methane is shown to be an up-and-coming technology. However, reaching high fuel productivity at a comparatively low light intensity and effectively suppressing the side reactions of coking in the DRM process are still two tough difficulties. Under focused UV–vis–IR irradiation at a relatively low light intensity of 80.5 kW m−2, a nanostructure of Co/Mg-CoAl2O4 possesses excellent photothermocatalytic activity and a light-to-fuel efficiency of 34.2 % and a low carbon deposition rate compared to its reference catalyst without Mg2+ doping (Co/CoAl2O4). The improved photothermocatalytic activity and coking resistance of Co/Mg-CoAl2O4 mainly comes from the synergetic effect, including Mg2+ doping, the active lattice oxygen in CoAl2O4 also participating in the oxidation of carbon species, and strong light absorption properties of the Mg-CoAl2O4. The photoactivation promotes DRM on Co nanoparticles while significantly facilitates the C* oxidation by strongly adsorbed CO2 on doped Mg2+.

Summary Harnessing solar energy for CO2 conversion to fuels presents a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, finding an economical, stable, non-toxic nanomaterial catalyst poses a significant challenge. Understanding the catalyst's active state is vital for optimal performance due to potential structural changes during reactions. Herein, we employ various in situ characterizations to detail δ-FeOOH's structural evolution during hydrogen activation, identifying its active phase while catalyzing the heterogeneous reduction of CO2 by H2. Using in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy, δ-FeOOH is first dehydrated to α-Fe2O3, then reduced to Fe3O4, and finally to α-Fe. Other in situ characterizations revealed that the active state of the catalyst (Fe-350-H2) is a mixture of Fe3O4 and α-Fe. A detailed investigation into the photocatalytic CO2 reduction using batch, flow, and LED reactors unveiled that the Fe-350-H2 catalyst exhibits superior activity and selectivity in activating the reverse water gas shift reaction compared with similar iron-based catalysts.

The transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni)-doped cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanowire arrays (M-Cu2O@CM, M = Fe, Co, Ni) are successfully synthesized for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to ethylene (C2H4) through the simple calcination and impregnation-exchange methods. Systematic characterizations have demonstrated that the Ni/Co doping in Cu2O@CM is conducive to stabilizing the Cu+ sites due to the electron transfer from Cu2O to Ni/Co, while the Fe doping has the opposite effect. Consequently, they show the different electrocatalytic performances of Ni-Cu2O@CM > Co-Cu2O@CM > Cu2O@CM > Fe-Cu2O@CM for CO2RR to C2H4 in an H-cell. Among them, Ni-Cu2O@CM exhibits the ∼2.0-fold faradaic efficiency for C2H4 (58.2 % vs. 28.7 %) and the ∼2.5-fold current density (−37.6 vs. −15.0 mA·cm−2) at −1.1 V vs. RHE, as compared with Cu2O@CM. Further experiments reveal that during the electrocatalytic CO2RR, the Ni-Cu2O@CM can generate more *CO, which promotes the C–C coupling reaction. The activity of Co-Cu2O@CM is lower than Ni-Cu2O@CM because of the strong adsorption of *COOH, while the Fe-Cu2O@CM even exhibits a lower activity than Cu2O@CM. This work provides an insight into the effect of transition metal-doped Cu2O array on the electrocatalytic CO2RR to C2H4 products.

Decarbonization of the power sector means a reduction of its CO2 intensity, which reduces the emission of carbon dioxide per unit of electrici­ty generated. In order to meet the emission reduction targets pledged to the Paris Agreement on climate change, power utility companies need to devel­op strategies on how to decarbonize their generation assets. Companies must achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which is necessary to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement of capping global temperature rise at 1.5°C and to meet the less ambitious 2°C target. Rapid decarbonization of the power sector is needed particularly as heat and transport sectors are electrified, creating an increase in demand for electric power. Decarbonization is being achieved by increasing the share of low-carbon energy sources, particularly renewables, and a corresponding reduction in the use of fossil fuels. Worldwide, renewa­bles now produce a third of power capacity.

It is known that the combustion of fossil fuels is the main artificial source of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and that it leads to environmental pollution, as well as global climate changes, i.e. the “greenhouse” effect. For these reasons, instead of fossil fuels used in various branches of energy and process technology, we shouldswitch to alternative energy sources that would significantly reduce the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Biomass is plant material obtained by the reaction of carbon dioxide from air, water and sunlight, the process of photosynthesis, in order to produce carbohydrates. In adecayprocess of organic matter from plant residues, carbon is returned to the atmosphere in a form of carbon dioxide and/or methane. In the atmosphere, during the oxidation process, carbon dioxide is formed from methane again, which completes the carbon cycle in nature. Today, biofuel is the only fuel that meets the criteria of a closed system in terms of the creation of carbon dioxide and solid material combustion products. Most of the carbon released in a form of carbon dioxide is absorbed by the next generation of plants through photosynthesis or through minerals from the soil. Thus, biomass is becoming one of the key energy resources in the fight against global warming and depletion of fossil fuel reserves. Additionally, replacing fossil fuels with biomass has a beneficial impact on reducing the emission of sulfur dioxide, which causesacid rainformation. It should be noted that the primary advantage of biomass as an energy source is not in its significant potential, but in its renewability. Renewability is the essential advantage of biomass over conventional, fossil fuels that are nonrenewable and therefore cannot be the basis for long-term planning of sustainable growth that implies the rational use of energy. In the field of energetics, the European Union (EU) is aimed at reducing CO2 emissions in order to achieve sustainable development, as well as reducing dependence on imported fuels and changes in pricesof energy-generating products (oil, gas, etc.). One way to reduce CO2 emissions is to increase the share of renewable sources in total energy production. The goal of the EU countries is to achieve 20% energy savings, 20% production of energy from renewable sources, 20% reduction of CO2 emissions ("20-20-20-targets") (Directive 2009/28/EC). In order to maintain energy stability and approach closer to the EU, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the Republic ofSrpska, have signed a number of laws and regulations on the use of renewable energy sources. This paper provides review data on biomass potentials (wood and agricultural) in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the neighbouring countries. Special emphasis is on agricultural biomass. Data on physical and chemical properties of agricultural biomass as an energy fuel are presented. Thermochemical procedures of biomass processing are provided, such as: pyrolysis, gasification and combustion and the possibility of using energy from these processes. Apparatus and furnaces of the considered processes used in industrial practice are presented. An overview of pollutant emissions from the biomass combustion process is also given.

The lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO2) batteries hold promise for energy storage, given their capacity to capture and convert carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the practical application of Li-CO2 batteries continues to face substantial obstacles caused by sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution kinetics, resulting in high overpotential and short lifespan. This work presents the fabrication of a highly effective MoO2@Mo2C heterostructure hybrid catalyst using a CO2 oxidation strategy. This strategy integrated (in-situ) MoO2 onto the surface of two-dimensional (2D) Mo2C MXene, enhancing catalytic activity while preserving 2D electron/ion pathways. As a result, the MoO2@Mo2C, when used as a catalyst in Li-CO2 battery showcased a discharge capacity of 20790.8 mAh/g at a current density of 200 mA g−1. Notably, it achieved a long cycling life of 230 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh/g with a voltage gap as low as 1.85 V, which was significantly superior to that of a pristine Mo2CTx catalyst (3.61 V after twenty cycles). This work provides critical insights into the design of MXenes-based high-performance catalysts for advanced Li-CO2 batteries.

Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO2) foam mobility control in CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery can improve the storage potential and oil production by reducing CO2 mobility and increasing reservoir sweep efficiency. A coreflooding study of CO2 foam strength and stability during the co-injection of CO2 and a nonionic surfactant (CO2 foam) solution with and without hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymers was conducted, including one experiment adding chromium cross-linker solution to the surfactant-polymer solution, to assess gelation effects to assess the effects on improving CO2 mobility reduction. Foam strength, stability, and propagation at unsteady-state flow were compared between the surfactant-based CO2 foam and the polymer-enhanced foam (PEF) solution at 70% foam quality in sandstone cores at scales of 9 cm and 83 cm in length, and rates of 2 ft/day and 4 ft/day. In addition, pure CO2 was injected after foam to identify dynamic changes in foam stability and determine CO2 flow reduction efficiency of the solutions after their placement. Furthermore, the experiment with the 83 cm core added a stage of injection with a chromium cross-linker solution to the surfactant-polymer solution to assess the propagation and strength of the PEF gelled. Apparent viscosity quantified foam strength during co-injections of CO2 foam and CO2 PEF. Adding HPAM polymers significantly increased the foam's apparent viscosity, efficiently creating a stronger foam. PEF propagated at a higher differential pressure compared to CO2 foam, but differential pressure did not increase substantially during the injection of several pore volumes. While the effect of foam injections without polymer was fully reversible during pure CO2 injections, polymer-enhanced foams could significantly reduce the flow of CO2 after placement. The PEF floods high DP showed that the polymer has the ability to block flow channels. The chromium cross-linker with the polymer solution showed that gelation occurred during injection, after which gel entirely blocked the core so CO2 could not enter. Higher rates showed the shearthining behavior of foams and a higher impact on reducing flow mobility during and after the PEF placement. Foam with added polymers may be promising for CO2 mobility reduction during and after placement. Foam has been acknowledged to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) mobility during its injection in a porous media from pore scale to field scale. Therefore, enhancing in-situ CO2 foam propagation into sedimentary reservoirs is essential to maximize CO2 storage and EOR, and it may be achieved by adding polymers in the liquid lamellae.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is well recognized as one of the key intermediates for carbon dioxide (CO2) electrolytic reduction to C2+ products, which has been a hot research field recently. Developing an efficient catalyst that focuses on achieving C-C coupling is highly important for the production of C2+ products. In the present work, we present a feasible approach via the combination of electrostatic assembly and the hydrothermal method of coupling silicon polyanions and copper salts to build an amorphous copper hybrid material wrapped in carbon-silica, denoted as CuO@C-SiO2-X (where X means preparation temperature), as an efficient electrocatalyst for carbon monoxide reduction mainly to liquid C2+ products. The CuO@C-SiO2-X catalyst demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity, especially to C2+ liquid products with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 81.5%. Additionally, the catalyst showed good stability. The presence of carbon enhanced electronic conductivity, and the silica protected the amorphous CuO from aggregation into crystalline structures. The present work not only provides an efficient catalyst for CO electrocatalytic reduction to liquid C2+ chemicals but also offers a protocol for building Cu-based catalysts with high selectivity to C2+ products in CO reduction.

The complexity and interdependence of all factors of forest ecosystems is reflected in the general state of the environment. The forest moderates air temperature fluctuations by 1.5–4° C, and creates a more favorable temperature regime in the soil. Atmospheric precipitation in the forest is absorbed by the forest litter, which slows down surface runoff and prolongs the period of water infiltration. The wind speed in the forest is 30% lower than the wind speed in the open space, and wind protection is manifested in a radius 3–5 times greater than the average height of the trees. Forest vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and uses it for its growth in the process of photosynthesis. This process leads to a decrease in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and contributes to reducing the negative effects of the greenhouse. In this way, forests influence the prevention of the occurrence of unfavorable scenarios of surface global warming, which may manifest with an increase in temperature by as much as 5.8° C. Forests play a key role in maintaining the oxygen-carbon dioxide balance because they annually release 9–13 t/ha of CO2, and bind 6–18 t/ha of CO2. A monofunctional approach to forest ecosystems, where forests are viewed exclusively through the prism of the production (assortment) function, still exists it burdens the perception and evaluation of numerous ecological and social functions. However, even today, around 1.15 billion hectares of forests (30%) are used primarily for the production of wood and non–wood forest products. Some of the ecological potential of forest complexes is reflected in the absorption of dust particles, sulfur dioxide, the release of oxygen, the binding of carbon dioxide, and the release of phytoncides. One hectare of forest absorbs 30 to 70 tons of dust annually. Coniferous forests absorb 30−35 tons of dust annually, and deciduous forests 50-76 tons. A hectare of forest absorbs about 100 kg of SO2, releases 3 to 11 t of oxygen and binds 4 to 15 t of CO2 per day. Thanks to the phytoncide action, a cubic meter of forest air contains 250 to 300 times less bacteria than city air. Forest ecosystems contain more carbon per unit area than any other terrestrial ecosystem. Amounts of soil organic carbon in the upper 30 cm of soil vary from 1.7 to 4.2 kg C.m-2 for organic layers and from 5.0 to 9.5 kg C.m-2 for mineral layers. The layers of the forest mat and the surface horizons of the forest soil of coniferous forests are large acceptors of heavy metals. Risks caused by numerous disruptions of natural processes (climate change, drought, storm winds, erosion, fires, etc.) have a major impact on the sustainable development of natural resources and threaten the environment, infrastructure, forest ecosystems, agricultural production, water availability and public health. The threat of forests, disappearance, degradation and drying of forests affect the reduction of the impact of the forest on the balance in the biosphere, the reduction of the volume of biomass production and the endangerment of the environment. Existing forests continue to suffer the direct and indirect effects of human action, whether from deliberate deforestation, damage from numerous conflicts and wars, to the careless actions of mining companies and illegal activities, or damage from legal and illegal logging. Around the world, severe forest fires have not only shown the combined effects of careless human activities in and around forests and global warming, but have also shown how quickly forests can be lost. In Europe, almost 45.000 forest fires occur every year, covering of 500.000 ha. The Balkan Peninsula is one of the areas with the highest risk of drought. Frequent and long-lasting drought leads to a decrease in the vitality and gradual deterioration of forests due to a decrease in soil moisture, the appearance of climatic extremes, a shortening of the vegetation period, difficult regeneration, a decrease in resistance to harmful biotic factors (the appearance of epiphytophytes of pathogenic fungi or gradation of economically harmful insects), all of which can lead to the drying of forests on a wider scale. For the environment, the general utility functions of forests related to tourist-recreational, health, water protection, historical, cultural and other values are particularly important. These functions are reduced due to the degradation and devastation of forests because these processes affect the increase in the intensity of climate change, the reduction of biodiversity, the reduction of renewable energy sources, the decline of economic development, the occurrence of erosion and flood, increase in atmospheric CO2, decline in quality of life, occurrence of diseases, etc. The complexity of the relationship between forest ecosystems and the environment needs to be viewed from multiple aspects and understood through an ecological, economic and social interconnected system. Understanding the impact of the forest requires the study of all characteristics of forest ecosystems, such as pedological, phytocenological, typological and other research. The destruction and fragmentation of urban forests, the loss of certain valuable trees, as well as the loss of fauna, threaten the ecological integrity and functioning of natural ecosystems, which directly affects the quality of life in urban areas. Domestic and international legislation and strategic decisions related to forest ecosystems are closely related to similar documents related to the environment. These documents mainly indicate the need to increase forest cover, preserve existing forests, multifunctional use of forest resources and sustainable development.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to produce high-value multicarbon products represents a challenging yet highly desirable process, particularly due to the inefficient C–C coupling observed in current electrocatalysts. In this study, Cu2+ and Co2+ were introduced into ZIF-8 as precursors to synthesize a series of Co- and CuCo-doped carbon nanostructure materials with varying Co-to-Cu ratios. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the successful doping of metal Co in the form of Co–Nx, while Cu was partly doped as nanoparticles attached to the carbon substrate surface and partly as single atoms forming Cu–Nx. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses revealed uniform distribution of elemental Co and Cu on the carbon substrate, with Cu loaded as nanocluster on the surface. Linear sweep voltammetry tests indicated that Cu/CoCu-Nx-C composites exhibited enhanced reactivity toward CO2 reduction compared to other samples. At −0.19 V (vs RHE), the Faradaic efficiencies (FEs %) of C2H4, C2H6, CH4, CO, and H2 over Cu/CoCu-Nx-C were 29.7, 8.6, 20.2, 9.8, and 31.5%, respectively. The influence of Co and Cu doping modes on the selectivity of electrocatalytic reduction products was investigated. Results showed that Cu/CoCu-Nx-C exhibited a higher FE of C2 compared to Cu/Cu–Nx-C, with nearly 10 times higher C2 current density. Mechanistic insights from acid-etching experiments and XPS revealed a synergistic interaction between metallic Co and Cu, promoting the generation of multicarbon products. Co–Nx improved *CO coverage, facilitating subsequent C–C coupling on neighboring Cu–Nx. Additionally, CH4 production was attributed to the (111) crystalline facets in the Cu nanocluster and isolated Cu–Nx. Overall, this research provides an important understanding of the creation of straightforward and effective catalysts for the reduction of CO2. It holds considerable potential for the production of hydrocarbons using carbon dioxide.

Copper (Cu) emerges as a highly efficient and cheap catalytic agent for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR), promising a sustainable route toward carbon neutrality. Despite its utility, the Cu catalyst exhibits limitations in terms of product selectivity, highlighting the need for the development of a superior catalyst design. Herein, we present a density functional theory (DFT) investigation into the selectivities of Cu-M (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, Zn, Ag, Au) bimetallic catalysts (BMCs) for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The interaction between the metals of Cu-M makes the surface electrons reconstruct so that the d-band center shifts to the Fermi level. In terms of CO2 activation, the Cu-Ni catalyst exhibits superior performance. Additionally, the Cu-Pd catalyst favors the formation of *COH along the reaction pathway, favoring the generation of CH4. Conversely, the Cu-Ni catalyst preferentially produces *CHO, thereby favoring the production of CH3OH. For the Cu-Ag catalyst, the reaction intermediates along the C2 pathway are *CO-*CHO and *COH-*CHO. The Cu-Ni catalyst follows a reaction path that proceeds via *CO-*CO → *CO-*COH → *COH-CHO. On the other hand, the Cu-Pt catalyst exhibits a reaction sequence of *CO-*CO → *CO-*CHO → *OCH-*OCH. This study provides guiding significance for the design of Cu-based bimetallic catalysts aimed at improving the selectivities and efficiency of the CO2RR process.

Utilizing carbon dioxide as a carbon source for the synthesis of olefins and aromatics has emerged as one of the most practical methods for CO2 reduction. In this study, an improved selectivity of 85% for targeting products (ethylbenzene and propylbenzene) is achieved with a benzene conversion of 16.8% by coupling the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to olefins over the bifunctional catalyst “Oxide-Zeolite” (OX-ZEO) and the alkylation of benzene with olefins over ZSM-5. In addition to investigating the influence of SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 zeolite acidity on product distribution, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is addressed by modifying both molecular sieves to be hierarchical to extend the catalyst lifespan. Even after 100 h of operation at 400 °C, the catalysts maintained over 80% selectivity towards the target products, with benzene conversion over 14.2%. Furthermore, the pathway of propylbenzene formation is demonstrated through simple experimental design, revealing that the surface Brønsted acid sites of SAPO-34 serve as its primary formation sites. This provides a novel perspective for further investigation of the reaction network.

Abstract In-situ electricity generation concepts and design precautions for the proposed system including the main goal which are related to reducing the environmental pollution due to the combustion of fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide (CO2). This reduction will be attained through a proposed smart gas well design and completion. The design is based on in-situ combustion for a gas flow in a downhole combustion chamber. Oxy-fuel combustion technique is the proposed combustion technique due to the ease of CO2 separation in this process. The proper well design will be analogous to the wells used for in-situ oil combustion to handle the high released temperature and the power generation design will combine the fundamentals of geothermal energy deployment for electricity generation. Finally, the produced CO2 from the combustion process will be reinjected downhole into an underground geological structure after being compressed and transferred to the supercritical phase. This process eliminates the CO2 production to the surface and hence reduce the environmental pollution.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has long been known to be affected by the electrolyte cations, yet the interpretations of these effects remain controversial. In this work, taking advantage of the unique catalytic characteristics of Pd, we investigated the cation effects on the CO2RR. It was found that the productions of formate and carbon monoxide (CO) are accelerated, and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is suppressed on Pd surfaces by larger cations. Detailed ATR-SEIRAS measurements revealed the promotion of CO2RR comes from two aspects. First, the CO2 molecules can be concentrated at the electrode–electrolyte interface by larger cations through electrostatic interaction. Second, a stronger interfacial electric field brought by the larger cations can accelerate the CO2RR and stabilize the negatively charged intermediates. The potential-dependent spectral transitions of adsorbed CO and interfacial water shed new light on the cation-dependent electric double layer structures. In light of these findings, the cation effects on the formate and CO pathways at different overpotentials were further revealed.

The electrolysis of (bi)carbonate solutions can upgrade captured carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals and fuels. This style of electrolysis relies on a pH swing to release the CO2 from the sorbent. Here, we report a bicarbonate electrolyzer equipped with an operando Raman spectroscopic probe that can measure the pH, at or near the cathode surface, as a function of current density. We correlate this cathode surface pH to the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction products when electrolyzing (bi)carbonate, a CO2 capture solution, set at different pH values. Our results show that C2 products (C2H5OH) are favored over C1 products (CO, CH4, HCOO–) when the pH at the cathode surface is high. This trend is consistent with the literature. However, at higher current densities and where the surface pH is highest, C2 product formation is actually less favored. This outcome is because less CO2 reactant is available for C−C coupling events. Consequently, the highest Faradaic efficiency for C2 product formation (22%) occurred at the lowest current density measured (100 mA cm−2).

In the context of rising global energy demands driven by population growth and urbanization, the construction industry significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions during the construction phase and subsequent energy consumption. Fossil fuel dependency for heating and energy needs exacerbates climate change, necessitating urgent solutions. Algal technology emerges as a promising strategy for green building practices, addressing energy efficiency and emissions reduction. Algae's unique ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) through photosynthesis is harnessed by deploying photobioreactors on building exteriors. Studies indicate that each kilogram of dry algae consumes 1.83 kg of CO2 while offering applications as organic fertilizer, oil, and protein sources. This technology not only diminishes CO2 emissions but also transforms wastewater and generates bioenergy, catering to building energy requirements. Algal technology's economic and environmental significance becomes evident through carbon capture, energy generation, and circular waste management, aligning with sustainability principles. This study highlights the potential of algal technology to shape the future of eco-friendly conscious construction practices, providing avenues for reduced emissions, efficient energy utilization, and sustainable development.

Reactive magnesium oxide cement (RMC) has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) due to its lower production temperature and ability to permanently sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) through carbonation. However, mixtures with only RMC can have significantly reduced CO2 absorption capacity due to limited CO2 diffusion, thereby compromising the performance of RMCs. This paper demonstrates the adoption of cenospheres, an industrial waste, as a lightweight filler in RMC-based 3D printable composites to enhance carbonation and improve thermal insulation. This work investigates the effect of incorporating different dosages of cenospheres on the rheological properties, compressive strength, thermal conductivity, and microstructural development of the RMC mixtures using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study reveals that substituting 30% of RMC with cenospheres not only improves the printability and carbonation of the composite but also results in a 16% reduction in density, achieving 1.72 g/cm³, and reduced the thermal conductivity by 59% compared to the control without cenospheres to 0.63 W/(m·K). The findings provide valuable insights for developing lightweight 3D printable RMC-based composites.

In 2011, commercial aviation contributed approximately 3.5% of global anthropogenic climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases during flight and operational non-CO2 climate effects. Over the last few years, numerous aviation-related organisations have set goals to reduce aviation’s climate impact. These goals, however, lack alignment, are poorly or ambiguously defined, or are internally inconsistent. This increases uncertainty about what aviation should work towards, how various stakeholders can contribute, and introduces problems with respect to accountability. In order to address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive definition of a climate neutral air transport system as an “air transport system of which the climate effects of all its greenhouse gases and non-carbon dioxide effects throughout the entire life-cycle of each element of the system is balanced”. The proposed definition spans relevant system and encompasses all life cycle phases. To achieve a climate neutral air transport system by 2050, all life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and non-CO2 climate effects remaining after in-sector reduction should be neutralised, as should all remaining non-CO2 climate forcing from emissions prior to 2050. Clarity on governance is furthermore needed, as the goal and associated targets proposed should be adopted globally.

Abstract In the energy transition era, Colombia has been evaluating different technologies as a commitment to increasing oil recovery and energy efficiency (EE) while at the same time reducing carbon intensity (CI), which represents a big challenge, particularly for heavy oil exploitation. One of the hybrid technologies under evaluation involves the combination of steam and flue gas (FG) to replace volumes of steam with a waste stream of FG from different industrial sources, including gas from steam generators. In that sense, Ecopetrol has been developing an R&D program that includes experimental studies such as a phase behavior evaluation for steam hybrid processes to support numerical studies [Pérez, R. et al., 2020; Pérez, R. et al., 2023]. The methodology for constructing a phase behavior model based on experimental tests that contemplate Carbon dioxide (CO2) solubility in oil and water and its impact on crude oil production and CI is developed and incorporated into a field-sector model for the hybrid steam + FG process. The CO2 and FG (15.24% CO2-84.76% N2) solubility in heavy crude oil at 19.2 SCF/STB were measured to identify its effect on the viscosity, density, and possible compositional changes at two different temperatures (110°F and 302°F) and three pressure conditions (250, 700, and 1,200 psi) to represent the effect of steam injection. In addition, heavy oil fractions were characterized by distillation curves analysis. The use of data from laboratory experiments allowed the development of a numerical fluid model that represents the CO2-Oil interaction through the vapor-liquid K-values obtained by fitting an EOS model, and the liquid-liquid K values that define the interaction CO2-water interaction were calculated using Henry´s model. Experimental evaluations showed at low temperatures, solubility increases with pressure, reaching gas-oil ratios (GOR) values close to 376.7 SCF/STB and 49.7 SCF/STB at the highest-pressure condition and reducing the viscosity of crude oil by 98% and 56% with CO2 and FG, respectively. However, at high temperatures, solubility decreased by 62% and 52% with less impact on oil viscosity reduction. The compositional profiles of the gas and liquid phases showed no increase in intermediate components, which indicates that the injected gases do not have the capacity to extract light hydrocarbons from the liquid phase. Incorporating the phase behavior into the field-sector model was a key feature for estimating an equivalent CO2 storage of 1,360 tons associated with retaining part of the CO2 injected in the remaining water and crude oil coupled with an incremental oil production of 33,000 barrels. This phase behavior study contributes to a better understanding of phenomena associated with steam-based hybrid technologies that positively affect the production of hydrocarbons and the reduction of emissions due to CO2 trapping effects associated with solubility in reservoir fluids, contributing to Colombian energy efficiency goals.

Abstract The increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has precipitated a climate crisis, with the industrial sector identified as a significant contributor to escalating pollution levels. This research explores the impact of real gross domestic product (GDP), consumption of renewable and non-renewable energy (RE, NRE), financial development (FD), and industrial value added (IVA) on CO2 emissions across a panel of OECD countries spanning the period 2000–2021. Cointegration techniques are employed to achieve this objective. The findings of the empirical analysis reveal cross-sectional dependence among countries. Furthermore, the variables are found to be integrated of order one, and cointegration tests indicate the presence of a long-run relationship between them. The results obtained from the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) analysis indicate that economic growth and non-renewable energy consumption are associated with an increase in CO2 emissions. In contrast, renewable energy consumption, industrial value-added, and financial development are found to contribute to a reduction in emissions over the long term. The interaction between financial development and industrial value-added exhibits a positive influence on CO2 emissions, indicating a lack of alignment between financial and industrial strategies.

The carbon emission trading policy attributes carbon dioxide emission rights to commodities, representing an important exploration to reduce carbon emissions by the market mechanism. Since 2013, China has implemented the carbon emission trading policy. In order to study whether the carbon emission reduction effect of emission trading policy in pilot areas and what is the pathway, this paper uses multi-period difference-in-differences method and the medintion effect method. An empirical analysis of panel data from 283 prefecture-level cities in China between 2006 and 2019.The research findings demonstrate that: (1) The policy about carbon emission trading significantly reduced carbon emissions,which is still valid after a series of robustness tests, and had a synergistic effect. (2) The policy primarily promotes carbon dioxide emission reduction through innovation in green technology and adjustments in industrial structure. (3) In comparison to the eastern and western regions, the policy performs better in central regions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of emission reduction depends on the intensity of environmental regulations, thus, stricter regulations are more conducive to carbon reduction. This paper provides strong evidence to the expansion of carbon emission trading pilots, and guides the operation of carbon emission trading market in China.

In situ studies of electrochemical processes using NMR offer valuable information on reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and species identification, making it a powerful tool in electrochemistry research. In this study, we present the design of an in situ redox-flow NMR cell that allows for a continuous flow of liquid (electrolyte) or gas, application of electrical voltage, and recording of NMR signals. The utility of this setup is demonstrated through two case studies: electrochemical copper deposition on a gold electrode and the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon products. Specifically, the presence of multicarbon products containing C–C bonds generated during the electrochemical reduction reaction is confirmed in the 2H NMR spectra in the latter example. These findings highlight the ability of the in situ redox-flow NMR cell to directly monitor reaction intermediates and products, thereby enabling the elucidation of reaction mechanisms for the efficient and selective production of valuable hydrocarbon products through the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals. In contrast to other reported in situ NMR cells, the presented cell is suitable for multiple uses, and allows detecting NMR signals not only from exhaust products but also from those formed on the catalyst surface.

Concrete pavements are integral to sustainable infrastructure, offering longevity and resilience in construction and transportation. This study focuses on optimizing concrete pavements through the incorporation of steel and carbon fibers with Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) to enhance mechanical strength, reduce fracture development, and minimize carbon emissions. Utilizing 25 mixing designs with a consistent water-to-cement ratio of 0.40, varying ratios of GGBS, steel fibers, and carbon fibers (0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% based on concrete volume) were explored. A comprehensive evaluation, including slump, compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength, water absorption, abrasion resistance tests, carbon dioxide emissions, and cost analysis, was conducted at different curing stages. Results revealed a decline in compressive strength for all mix designs at 28 days, attributed to reduced cement strength with GGBS substitution. The 1.5% steel fiber and 50% GGBS mix demonstrated minimal compressive strength reduction (30.1 MPa, 5.5% less than control), outperforming other mixtures. Steel fibers surpassed carbon fibers, likely due to \erior distribution. Notably, 1.5% steel fibers showed superior results, particularly with 50% GGBS. Compressive strength generally increased with GGBS content, except for 1% fibrous samples where 40% GGBS produced optimal results. At 90 days, compressive strength increased for most designs, with G50S1.5 exhibiting over 38% growth compared to the control. Steel fiber-containing samples outperformed carbon fiber-containing ones, showcasing the efficacy of steel fibers in enhancing compressive strength. Split tensile strength generally decreased, but steel fibers improved it, emphasizing their positive influence. Flexural strength increased in 28 and 90 days, with steel fiber-containing designs outperforming. G30S1.5 showed the most significant increase (33.3%) at 28 days, and G30S1.5 exhibited the highest growth (32.22%) at 90 days. Abrasion resistance tests indicated steel fibers and GGBS positively impacted abrasion reduction. G50S1.5 demonstrated the highest abrasion resistance (25% increase over control). The environmental evaluation revealed lower CO2 emissions for GGBS-containing designs. G50S0.5 showed a 40.34% reduction compared to the control sample. Cost analysis showed GGBS reduced costs, but fiber addition, particularly carbon fibers, increased costs. G30C1.5 had the highest cost increase (208.5%), while G50S1.5 showed a marginal rise (3.9%) compared to the control. Therefore, steel fibers in concrete pavements offer improved mechanical properties, durability, and reduced environmental impact, making them a viable choice despite a slight increase in cost. Conversely, carbon fibers are cautioned against due to their higher cost and inferior mechanical properties.

At present, the excessive emission of carbon dioxide has threatened people 's living environment and future development. More and more countries have begun to pay attention to carbon emission reduction. China has set the dual-carbon strategic goal of “carbon dioxide content reaches its peak” and “carbon neutrality”. According to the research on carbon dioxide capture technology by many scholars at home and abroad, it is found that the use of chemical absorbents to capture carbon dioxide is a relatively low cost, less technical difficulty, and can be widely put into industrial production. In this paper, several common chemical absorbents such as hot potassium alkali method, organic amine absorption method, amino acid salt, ionic liquid and phase change absorbent are reviewed. Through the research of various kinds of absorbents by researchers from various countries, their reaction principle, performance advantages and disadvantages, research status are introduced, and the future development direction of carbon dioxide negative emission technology is analyzed.

Abstract This paper focuses on the urgent need to a sustainable food production system and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the food supply chain, which account for over one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The objective is to identify areas for increasing food production and waste reduction areas targeting environmental sustainability. The study analyzes time series data spanning 60 years, encompassing food production, population growth, carbon dioxide emissions, and daily calorie intake by humans to understand where efficiency is needed. In addition to the data analysis, the paper includes a thorough examination of the current body of literature on strategies for reducing waste in the food supply chain. By combining original contributions with established knowledge, this paper synthesizes existing information while also introducing fresh insights into the field of food supply chain waste reduction approaches aiming at sustainable environmental performance. In the study's findings, the time series data analysis reveals an overproduction of food, surpassing the actual demand highlighting the need for sustainable supply chain practices. The slopes of the human daily food consumption curve, food production, and carbon dioxide production in the environment demonstrate a similar pattern, with an equivalent slope compared to the relatively lower slope of population growth. This observation suggests a correlation between these variables, indicating their contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Further investigation of the relationship among these variables is essential to develop effective strategies aimed at sustainable food consumption and production. Among the fifty-seven papers received for the existing literature study, only two papers dealt with environmental performance, therefore more research is looked-for environmental performance regard. The application of lean principles, proven effective in various research, is advocated as a powerful tool for reducing food waste-related carbon dioxide emissions. Lean methodologies should be implemented at each stage of the supply chain to minimize waste. By targeting a reduction in food loss and waste, production needs to be aligned with demand or surplus production can be preserved through processing. The findings of the food consumption and production pattern along with the waste reduction approach support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goals 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and 13 (Climate Action). Finally, this article later contributes to the theory of sustainable production and waste reduction towards the environmental footprint of the food supply chain.

Wall-seeping gas film (WSGF) represents a promising method for transition control, drag reduction, and heat reduction in hypersonic vehicles. Experiments were conducted in a Mach 6 hypersonic quiet wind tunnel using nano-tracer planar laser scattering (NPLS) and high-frequency fluctuating pressure measuring techniques. This paper investigates the effects of wall-seeping helium, air, and carbon dioxide gas films under identical volume flow rate conditions on conical boundary layer thickness, disturbance wave structure, wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and nonlinear interaction. The experimental results reveal that WSGF significantly thickens the hypersonic boundary layer, with the thickest position appearing at the downstream boundary of the seeping zone. The boundary layer thickness is thinnest for helium gas film and thickest for carbon dioxide gas film. Generally, air gas film and carbon dioxide gas film induce the appearance of regular, rope-like, and interlaced second-mode waves in advance in the boundary layer. However, under a higher volume flow rate for carbon dioxide gas film, the disturbance wave structure resembles interface fluctuations, with a characteristic wavelength of approximately 18 mm and a peak frequency as low as about 35 kHz, without the rope-like interlaced characteristic. At this time, the influence of shear layer instability becomes significant. The disturbance waves do not exhibit second-mode wave characteristics for wall-seeping helium gas film, whose shape is irregular and undergoes deformation over time and space. Additionally, the power spectral density of wall fluctuating pressure exhibits insignificant variation with volume flow rate and flow direction, which is similar to the characteristics of power spectral density in the laminar boundary layer and has no peak frequency. The wavelength of second-mode waves is about 2~3 times the boundary layer thickness for air gas film while increasing to more than 3 times for carbon dioxide gas film. Compared to air gas film, the application of carbon dioxide gas film results in a smaller peak frequency and bandwidth of disturbance waves, larger characteristic wavelength and amplitude, longer propagation distance, and stronger nonlinear interaction. In the future, attention should be directed towards understanding disturbance wave characteristics in the boundary layer for helium gas film and shear layer instability under larger volume flow rates.

Abstract The Paris Agreement has prompted a growing global sense of urgency to mitigate the climate impact of industrialization. Countries and corporations have committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, setting short, medium, and long-term targets for achieving this goal. Notably, the LNG industry is shifting as LNG is the transition fuel of decarbonization journey and major energy buyers seek carbon neutral energy sources to reduce emissions. Oman passed a Royal decree that endorsed the year 2050 as the designated target for attaining a state of net zero emissions. Additionally, this decree involved the formulation of a comprehensive national strategy and the establishment of the Oman Sustainability Centre, all aimed at facilitating the realization of this goal. Aligning with this trend and our mission, Oman LNG (OLNG) has undertaken key initiatives to reduce flaring, ensuring the delivery of clean, reliable energy with lower GHG intensity. OLNG has a well-developed flare abatement strategy and has top quartile Pacesetter of recent benchmarks in the LNG industry. Through a combination of operational best practices and design modifications, OLNG has significantly minimized flaring, ultimately resulting in achieving zero routine flaring as part of its normal operations. Despite the above, Oman LNG continues to pursue further improvements with respect to flaring reduction in safety and non-routine flaring events. An area of focus is on ship gassing up operations. Part of Oman LNG Annual Delivery Program is to accommodate ships which are scheduled for dry dock and inerted with Carbon Dioxide or Nitrogen. These ships must be purged to the flare to decrease CO2 or Nitrogen content to an acceptable level. This prevents disruptions in the fuel gas system by avoiding freezing at boil of gas demisters due to high CO2 content or discharge temperature rise and compressor trip due to high N2 content. In close collaboration with our valued customers, we embarked on a concerted effort to significantly reduce flaring during the ship gassing up operations. This endeavor was achieved through the strategic introduction of an innovative methodology known as the Direct Cooldown Method, which circumvents the conventional ship gassing up procedure. This novel approach entails the utilization of LNG dilution, primarily directed at ships that have been inerted with N2. The essence of this procedure lies in the gradual blending of the cargo tank content with vaporized LNG. Once the tank pressures attain a predetermined threshold and the quality of the diluted vapor aligns with Oman LNG specification, the resulting diluted vapor is channeled ashore directly to fuel gas system. Extensive assessments determined the feasibility of this approach, resulting in the modification of operating procedures for safe and reliable implementation. The successful implementation of this method leads to a truly remarkable outcome – the total elimination of flaring from the ship gassing up operation. Undeniably, this pioneering method aligns with Oman LNG long-term decarbonization plan, supporting the ambitious goal of becoming a carbon-neutral LNG producer.

Fungicides play a crucial role in conventional agriculture for disease control, but their prolonged use raises health and environmental concerns. Fusarium culmorum (F. culmorum), a major wheat pathogen causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Fusarium crown rot (FCR), poses significant mycotoxigenic threats. The application of natural plant extracts has been proven to fight against phytopathogenic fungi. This study aimed to a field experiment that was carried out at the Field Experimental Station of the Institute of Plant Protection—National Research Institute in Winna Góra, Poland, during the 2022/2023 season to evaluate the potential of Lamium album (L. album) flower extract as a foliar spray against mycotoxigenic fungi in two winter wheat varieties: Arkadia and Julius. The supercritical carbon dioxide extraction method (SC-CO2) was employed to obtain the L. album flower extract. Ergosterol (ERG) and mycotoxin accumulation in the harvested wheat grains were analyzed using chromatography-based methods. The results demonstrated a notable reduction in ERG content in the field plots treated with L. album flower extract, from 26.07 µg/g (control group) to 8.91 µg/g (extract-treated group) for Arkadia and from 70.02 µg/g (control group) to 30.20 µg/g (extract-treated group) for Julius. The treatment with L. album reduced mycotoxin biosynthesis in both varieties, with deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) production significantly decreased. Additionally, Arkadia exhibited greater resistance to Fusarium infection, and the antifungal effect of L. album was more pronounced than in the Julius variety, which proved to be more sensitive. In conclusion, L. album flower extract exhibited promising antifungal effects in field experiments to fight against F. culmorum in winter wheat varieties, suggesting a potential alternative to synthetic fungicides. However, as complete prevention of mycotoxin contamination was not achieved, further research is warranted to optimize extract concentrations and conduct long-term analyses to consider this plant extract as a sustainable control agent.

Flooding of paddy fields during the rice growing season enhances arsenic (As) mobilization and greenhouse gas (e.g., methane) emissions. In this study, an adsorbent for dissolved organic matter (DOM), namely, activated carbon (AC), was applied to an arsenic-contaminated paddy soil. The capacity for simultaneously alleviating soil carbon emissions and As accumulation in rice grains was explored. Soil microcosm incubations and 2-year pot experimental results indicated that AC amendment significantly decreased porewater DOM, Fe(III) reduction/Fe2+ release, and As release. More importantly, soil carbon dioxide and methane emissions were mitigated in anoxic microcosm incubations. Porewater DOM of pot experiments mainly consisted of humic-like fluorophores with a molecular structure of lignins and tannins, which could mediate microbial reduction of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides. Soil microcosm incubation experiments cospiking with a carbon source and AC further consolidated that DOM electron shuttling and microbial carbon source functions were crucial for soil Fe(III) reduction, thus driving paddy soil As release and carbon emission. Additionally, the application of AC alleviated rice grain dimethylarsenate accumulation over 2 years. Our results highlight the importance of microbial extracellular electron transfer in driving paddy soil anaerobic respiration and decreasing porewater DOM in simultaneously remediating As contamination and mitigating methane emission in paddy fields.

Abstract Commitments to emissions reductions following the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement have proliferated. Though it is promising that 145 countries have declared a net-zero emissions target, with 33 enshrining this goal into law, comparison of country-level emissions inventories can only be effectively carried out with uniform and consistent data. The extent to which greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory comparison is possible, and the ancillary climate governance implications, are the motivation for this article. Based on time-series correlation analyses over 32 years and 43 Annex-I countries, we uncover issues that are likely to inveigh against country-country comparison of GHGs—with the potential to weaken climate governance systems that are based mainly on emissions inventory tracking. First, the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs)—which convert each respective GHG into carbon equivalents (CO 2 -e), and are revised with each IPCC report—are not immediately or consistently integrated into GHG inventories. Second, GHGs apart from carbon dioxide, based on the data analysis, do not appear to be tracked uniformly. Should comparison of emissions remain a cornerstone of global climate governance, an overhaul of country-level GHG inventories is called for, specifically to enable effective reporting and tracking of GHGs apart from only carbon dioxide.

Abstract Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is discussed for offsetting residual greenhouse gas emissions or even reversing climate change. All emissions scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that meet the ”well below 2 ◦ C” warming target of the Paris Agreement include CDR. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) may be one possible CDR where the carbon uptake of the ocean is increased by artificial alkalinity addition. &#xD;Here, we investigate the effect of OAE on modelled carbon reservoirs and fluxes in two observationally-constrained large perturbed parameter ensembles. OAE is assumed to be technically successful and deployed as an additional CDR in the SSP5-3.4 temperature overshoot scenario. Tradeoffs involving feedbacks with atmospheric CO 2 result in a low efficiency of an alkalinity-driven atmospheric CO 2 reduction of -0.35 [-0.37 – -0.33] mol C per mol alkalinity addition (skill-weighted mean and 68% c.i.). The realized atmospheric CO 2 reduction, and correspondingly the efficiency, is more than two times smaller than the direct alkalinity-driven enhancement of ocean uptake. The alkalinity-driven ocean carbon uptake is partly offset by the release of carbon from the land biosphere and a reduced ocean carbon sink in response to lowered atmospheric CO 2 under OAE.&#xD;In a second step we use the Bern3D-LPX model in CO 2 peak-decline simulations to address hysteresis and temporal lags of surface air temperature change (ΔSAT) in an idealized scenario where ΔSAT increases to ∼2 ◦ C and then declines to ∼1.5 ◦ C as result of CDR. ΔSAT lags the decline in CO 2 -forcing by 18 [14 – 22] years, depending close to linearly on the equilibrium climate sensitivity of the respective ensemble member. These tradeoffs and lags are an inherent feature of the Earth system response to changes in atmospheric CO 2 and will therefore be equally important for other CDR methods.

The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is at the core of energy storage efforts. However, the formation of energy-dense liquid fuels such as methanol remains a major challenge, particularly under low temperature and pressure conditions that can be coupled to renewable electricity sources via electrochemistry. A multicatalyst system pairing an electrocatalyst with a thermal organometallic catalyst is introduced here, enabling the room temperature reduction of 1 atmosphere of CO2 to methanol. The reaction sequence involves: (i) the reduction of CO2 to formate by the electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (bpy = 2,2’-bipyridine), (ii) Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and (iii) thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H-PNP)Ir(H)3 (H-PNP = bis[(2-diisopropyl-phosphino]ethyl)amine). Reaction development led to mutually compatible conditions for a one-pot CO2 reduction in isopropanol electrolyte at ambient temperature and 1 atmosphere CO2. The isopropanol solvent plays sever-al crucial roles: activating formate ion as isopropyl formate, donating hydrogen for the reduction of formate ester to methanol via transfer hydrogenation, and lowering the barrier for transfer hydrogenation through hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition to reporting a method for room temperature reduction of challenging ester substrates, this work provides a proto-type for pairing electrochemical and thermal organometallic reactions that can guide the design and development of multi-catalyst cascades.

In the current context of carbon neutrality, afforestation is an effective means of absorbing carbon dioxide. Stock can be used not only as an economic value index of forest wood resources but also as an important index of biomass and carbon storage estimation in forest emission reduction project evaluation. In this paper, we propose a data-driven machine learning framework and method for predicting plantation stock based on airborne LiDAR + satellite remote sensing, and carried out experimental verification at the site of the National Forest emission reduction project in Southern China. We used step-up regression and random forest (RF) to screen LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI multispectral indicators suitable for the prediction of plantation stock, and constructed a plantation stock model based on machine learning (support vector machine regression, RF regression). Our method is compared with traditional statistical methods (stepwise regression and partial least squares regression). Through the verification of 57 plantation field survey data, the accuracy of the stand estimation model constructed using the RF method is generally better (ΔR2 = 0.01~0.27, ΔRMSE = 1.88~13.77 m3·hm−2, ΔMAE = 1.17~13.57 m3·hm−2). The model evaluation accuracy based on machine learning is higher than that of the traditional statistical method, and the fitting R2 is greater than 0.91, while the fitting R2 of the traditional statistical method is 0.85. The best fitting models were all support vector regression models. The combination of UAV point clouds and satellite multi-spectral images has the best modeling effect, followed by LiDAR point clouds and Landsat 8. At present, this method is only applicable to artificial forests; further verification is needed for natural forests. In the future, the density and quality of higher clouds could be increased. The validity and accuracy of the method were further verified. This paper provides a method for predicting the accumulation of typical Chinese plantations at the forest farm scale based on the “airborne LiDAR + satellite remote sensing” data-driven machine learning modeling, which has potential application value for the current carbon neutrality goal of the southern plantation forest emission reduction project.

Reduction of oxides of carbon (CO and CO2) to fixed forms of carbon is desirable to achieve sustainable and clean energy. Carbon monoxide (CO), an intermediate product in CO2 reduction, is challenging to reduce, which in turn jeopardizes the direct reduction of CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ to products like CH3OH and CH4. Iron porphyrins can efficiently reduce CO2 to CO by 2e–/2H+, but further reduction is halted by the rapid dissociation of CO from the reduced iron center. This work shows that CO can indeed be reduced upon inclusion of a pendent pyridine in the second coordination sphere of an iron porphyrin complex efficiently and selectively to CH4 using water or phenol as the proton source. In situ spectro-electrochemistry supported by theoretical calculations indicates that the pendent pyridine moiety imposes a hydrogen bonding interaction between the bound CO and water, which stabilizes two low-valent CO adducts, i.e., Fe(I)–CO and Fe(0)–CO, of iron porphyrins, allowing its complete reduction, via a Fe(II)–CHO species, to CH4. The ability to activate and reduce CO by ne–/nH+ via a second-sphere hydrogen bonding interaction in a mononuclear iron porphyrin opens newer pathways to valorize both CO and CO2 to valuable C1 products.

Addressing the urgent need for efficient CO2 reduction, a novel Co@C catalyst was synthesized through the pyrolysis of a unique layered metal–organic framework (MOF), featuring tunable thickness, pore sizes. The CO2 hydrogenation performance demonstrates an enhancement by an optimized structure that significantly improves stability, maintaining a 25% CO2 conversion rate over an extended 80-hour period. The catalyst's composite structure exhibits a dual-confinement effect, where the Co-C interface and graphitic carbon belt stabilize Co nanoparticles, preventing sintering during reaction cycles. This study delves into the structural modifications necessary for catalytic optimization in CO2 hydrogenation, offering valuable insights for designing efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction and advancing sustainable energy solutions.

Renewable energy is a sustainable and green energy converted from renewable energy resources in the nature. There is a huge amount of renewable energy resources in the ocean that can be changed into useful energy like electricity, store for long time use, or apply in the daily energy consumption. These marine renewable energies (MRE) include wave energy, ocean thermal energy, tidal energy, ocean current energy, salinity gradient energy, and offshore energy. With a big area, the oceans have been prospected that it brings endless renewable energy sources for social development and human demand. The renewable ocean energy shows many advantages of sustainable energy, clean energy, and non-carbon dioxide emissions by generating from wave and water in the ocean with an enormous amount of natural energy resources. The MRE can service at many areas of off-shore, on-shore, and remote areas where need energy to drive daily living demands. The MRE reveals some disadvantages such as the influence of daily, monthly, season, and period of time. The solutions have been developed to solve the limitations of the MRE such as developing the storage method to store energy for long time use or making the balance of the output performance to improve quality of the renewable energy. The MRE has also received many concerns from countries by promulgating policies, strategies, and plans to develop the renewable ocean energy such as green economy development, blue economy strategy, carbon dioxide emission reduction, and encouragement of using marine renewable energy. This paper reviews current marine renewable energy with its generation, storage, and application. The work also mentioned some advantages, disadvantage, policies, strategies, and solutions to encourage the development of the renewable ocean energy in over the world. The results hope that it will be spread development, exploitation, and application of marine renewable energy in the near future. Keywords: Marine renewable energy, energy storage, generation, application, sustainable energy

In this study, concentrated CO2 gas was used to create foamed cement paste, and concentrated CO2 gas was intermixed in fresh cement paste to produce regular cement paste materials that were not foamed. The potential of both methods to form CaCO3 from calcium ions that would form Ca(OH)2 was investigated. After curing the materials for different ages, the Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 contents were measured using thermogravimetric analysis; the large void size distributions, dynamic modulus, and compressive strength were tested and compared against Control (no gas added), and N2 foamed and N2 intermixed specimens. A 10 % increase in dynamic modulus and compressive strength was measured in CO2 foamed specimens compared to N2 foamed specimens. The increase in mechanical properties was the result of both a narrow void diameter distribution and CaCO3 formation in place of Ca(OH)2. The CO2 foamed cement generation method shows the potential to sequester 0.06 ton of CO2 for every ton of cement which is a CO2 emission reduction of 7.0 % of the CO2 production associated with cement production. For the CO2 intermixing method, the void content, compressive strength, and dynamic modulus results were consistent between the Control and CO2 intermixed specimens while the N2 intermixed specimens showed a decrease in compressive strength and dynamic modulus. The CO2 intermixing method showed potential to sequester 0.04 ton of CO2 for every ton of cement or a 4.7 % CO2 emission reduction of the total CO2 production associated with cement manufacturing. The reported CO2 emissions are not based on life cycle assessment and do not account for emissions associated with CO2 collection, transportation, and intermixing. The present paper does not investigate the mechanisms of hydration under CO2 intermixing.

This study quantifies and compares operational strategies as applied on a solar-assisted ground-source trans-critical CO2 heat pump (CO2 SAGSHP) system for simultaneous space and water heating, optimized on an hourly basis over the course of a week. Four (4) boundary conditions, representing spring, summer, autumn, and winter, were considered. To enable the use of a dynamic model for optimization simulations, the use of a previously developed surrogate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model of a Modelica CO2 heat pump model was evaluated for use in this study. The simulation results from the system model that applies the surrogate ANN model demonstrated strong alignment with those generated by the full Modelica model, yielding low root mean square errors and mean absolute percentage errors. Furthermore, it accelerated the speed of results generation for a single forward run by 6–15 times, depending on the boundary conditions. It can be inferred from the results of the optimization runs that when warm climate conditions dominate, implementation of the on/off operation with thermal energy storage (TES) should be prioritized, given that it could potentially yield greater operational cost benefits (12% to 58 % cost reduction) compared to hourly discharge pressure optimization (0.5 to 1.5 % cost reduction). Conversely, when colder seasons are longer, optimizing the CO2 heat pump's discharge pressure becomes more practical (6.5 % to 6.9 % cost reduction) than on/off operation, particularly when only a small TES is installed (1.2 % to 2.6 % cost reduction). The optimization of the mass flow rate of the supply side working fluid of a CO2 SAGSHP system exhibited minimal benefit, except notably in the summer where it generated an even better cost reduction than controlling the discharge pressure. This shows the practicality of this strategy for conditions where relatively high solar irradiation and relatively low heat demand are concurrently expected. In general, weekly reductions in operational costs were more substantial when both the discharge pressure and the on/off operation of the CO2 heat pump were concurrently optimized, especially when using a larger TES tank. Hence, both should be applied if there are no practical or cost limitations that restrict their implementation. While previous studies on CO2 heat pumps primarily emphasized efficiency optimization via discharge pressure control, this study shows that comparable or greater operational cost reductions can also be achieved from other strategies, depending on the boundary conditions.

Abstract Injection of high-pressure CO2 into depleted gas reservoirs can lead to low temperatures promoting formation of hydrate in the near wellbore area resulting in reduced injection rates. The design of effective mitigation methods requires an understanding of the impact of crucial parameters on the formation and dissociation of CO2 hydrate within the porous medium under flowing conditions. This study investigates the influence of water saturation (ranging from 20% to 40%) on the saturation and kinetics of CO2 hydrate during continuous CO2 injection. The experiments were conducted under a medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) to monitor the dynamics of hydrate growth inside the core and to calculate the hydrate saturation profile. The experimental data reveal increase in CO2 hydrate saturation with increasing water saturation levels. The extent of permeability reduction is strongly dependent on the initial water saturation: beyond a certain water saturation the core is fully blocked. For water saturations representative of the depleted gas fields, although the amount of generated hydrate is not sufficient to fully block the CO2 flow path, a significant reduction in permeability (approximately 80%) is measured. It is also observed that the volume of water+hydrate phases increases during hydrate formation, indicating a lower-than-water density for CO2 hydrate. Having a history of hydrate at the same water saturation leads to an increase in CO2 consumption compared to the primary formation of hydrate, confirming the existence of the water memory effect in porous media.

Abstract Anaemia is a common issue in patients who are admitted to intensive care units and worsens their condition throughout the stay due to the extraction of blood for diagnostic purposes. It is also well‐known that an important amount of the carbon dioxide produced by health services is likely attributable to blood donation, testing and manufacture, storage or distribution of blood components. This must be taken into account to perform nursing interventions consistent with the idea of sustainable health care. In this regard, within patient blood management bundles, with the objective of minimizing the use of blood products, it is recommended to use blood‐sparing techniques: small volume tubes (SVT) or closed‐blood sampling devices (CBSD). Published studies before 2014 (excepting two more recent ones) have shown that by themselves, both techniques reduce drawn volume but do not decrease haemoglobin reduction and/or need of transfusion. Given the lack of cost‐effectiveness studies, it may be easier to implement the use of CBSD as it does not require prior consensus on the discard volume or adaptations in the processing of laboratory tests, as is the case with SVT.

Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pandemic‐related lockdown on Turkey's air quality throughout time and space. For this purpose, statistical techniques were used to assess daily particulate matter (PM 10 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides and nitrogen dioxide (NO x and NO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), and carbon monoxide (CO). The study's findings showed that, while the lockdown improved air quality in terms of air pollutant emissions, the most notable reduction was in NO 2 and NO x emissions. When comparing the months prior to the pandemic (November 2019 to January 2020) with the months during the pandemic (November 2020 to January 2021), the declines in NO 2 were 20%, 3%, and 0.5%, respectively. NO x emissions decreased by an average of 19% and 5% in November and December, respectively, and increased by an average of 16% in January during the pandemic. When the data for the 33 days of lockdown were compared to the data for the same 33 days the previous year, significant differences were determined at several Clean Air Centers, which were two for PM 10 , two for SO 2 , seven for NO x , four for NO 2 , two for CO, and three for O 3 , respectively. In this study, pollutant concentrations were found in the following ranges from November 2019 to January 2021: PM 10 : 3–208 µg m –3 , SO 2 : 1–56 µg m –3 , NO x : 6–600 µg m –3 , NO 2 : 4–155 µg m –3 , CO: 1–3921 µg m –3 , and O 3 : 2–119 µg m –3 . There were days that exceeded the limit values for PM 10 .

Recent assessments of progress on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions suggest that efforts to reduce emissions are well below what is necessary to meet current global targets of 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models include significant amounts of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere as necessary to meet the 2 degrees Celsius target. The models assume the availability of CDR technologies to contribute to climate goals, but significant uncertainties remain regarding the efficacy, costs, scalability, environmental impacts, and broader public acceptability of these technologies. In Canada, CDR technologies are a crucial element of Canada’s long-term climate strategy towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Still, little to no national policy attention has been paid to researching, assessing, and implementing CDR measures, including the necessary legal framework in which these technologies would operate. This article provides an overview of Canada’s existing legal framework that will apply to various CDR methods as they are developed. It examines the legal framework as it may apply to CDR measures collectively (particularly in consideration of how these technologies will be treated in Canada’s broader climate framework), and individually. It aims to take stock of existing federal and provincial rules and assess the potential gaps that will need to begin to be addressed as Canada develops CDR capacities.

Introduction: Obesity has been linked to genetic and environmental determinants. Glu27 β 2 -adrenoceptor polymorphism has been associated with obesity and hypertension. In addition, muscle vasodilatation during physiological maneuvers is increased in individuals with Glu27 β 2 -adrenoceptor polymorphism. Not known is the impact of hypocaloric diet and exercise training on body weight and blood pressure (BP) in obese individuals with Glu27 β 2 -adrenoceptor polymorphism. Methods: From an initial sampling of 216 volunteers, we studied 42 middle-age normotensive obese women selected to represent two genotypes: 19 with Glu27 β 2 -adrenoceptor polymorphism and 23 wild type Gln27 (883± vs 86±2kg, P30.48, respectively). Hypocaloric diet consisted of a 600kcal/day reduction. Exercise training consisted of three 60-min exercise session/week during 4 months. Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP, cardiac output (CO, carbon dioxide rebreathing), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, microneurography) were evaluated pre and post interventions. Results: Hypocaloric diet and exercise training significantly decreased body weight, body mass index (BMI), 24-hour systolic BP, 24-hour pulse pressure, and CO in Glu27 and Gln27 groups. However, the comparisons between groups showed that the reduction in body weight (10.7±1 vs 7.4±1kg, P =0.02), BMI (4.1±0.4 vs 2.8±0.2kg/m 2 , P =0.01), 24-hour systolic BP (5.1±1 vs 2.2±1mmHg, P =0.05), 24-hour pulse pressure (3.6±1 vs 1.5±1mmHg, P =0.01), and CO (0.8±0.2 vs 0.4±0.1L/min, P =0.04) were significantly greater in Glu27 group than in Gln27group. No significant differences in diastolic BP, mean BP, and MSNA levels between groups were found. Conclusions: Obese women with Glu27 of the β 2 -adrenoceptor are more susceptible to body weight loss, and BP and CO reduction after hypocaloric diet and exercise training than wild type Gln27 obese women.

Our world has limited resources to sustain a growing population. According to some estimates, humanity currently uses about 1.5 times more renewable sources than the pace of their renewal. Reducing energy use, for example by improving the energy efficiency of an existing building fund, is one of the main environmental goals along with reducing CO2 emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy sources. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the construction of residential buildings with only low energy consumption or high-quality overhaul will reduce the need for heating buildings by 90 %. This will lead to a reduction in fossil fuel imports, increased energy independence of the state, greater sustainability of the economy in case of emergencies and a reduction in CO2 emissions. When writing the article, such empirical research methods as analysis and synthesis, comparison, generalization, etc. were used. Thus, the goals of major repairs are not only to improve the comfort and safety of housing, but also to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. The article considers the experience of major repairs abroad, ways to preserve the old housing stock and improve its energy efficiency.

Nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing (NDFO) bacteria are widespread in the environment contribute to nitrate removal and influence the fate of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and poorly understood. The most prominent model system for this type of studies is enrichment culture KS, which originates from a freshwater sediment in Bremen, Germany. A second NDFO culture, culture BP, was obtained with a sample taken in 2015 at the same pond and cultured in a similar way. To gain insights in the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to iron(II) oxidation under in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen limited conditions, we performed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analyses of culture BP.This dataset contains: (1) Raw sequencing data of 16S (V4 region, primers 515f and 806r) rRNA amplicon sequencing of the microbial community composition of the autotrophic NRFeOx enrichment culture BP and of environmental samples from the pond where culture BP originates from. Illumina MiSeq sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using PE 250 bp MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles kit) were performed at Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). (2) Raw sequencing data of near full-length 16S (primers 27F and 1492R) sequenced with PacBio Sequel SMRT at the Helmholtz research institute, Munich, Germany. (3) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metagenomics. Library was prepared with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Kit (Illumina) and sequenced with PE 150 bp on a NovaSeq 6000 totalling 91 Gbp by CeGaT, Tuebingen, Germany. (4) Short reads were assembled with MEGAHIT v1.2.7 using https://github.com/nf-core/mag v1.0.0. (5) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metatranscriptomes (2 conditions, triplicates). Library preparation including bacterial ribodepletion (Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus kit) and Illumina NextSeq v2.5 sequencing with PE 75 bp and 6 to 53 Mio clusters per sample were performed by Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland).

This review explores the potential of using different types of ash, namely fly ash, biomass ash, and coal ash etc., as mediums for CO2 capture and sequestration. The diverse origins of these ash types—municipal waste, organic biomass, and coal combustion—impart unique physicochemical properties that influence their suitability and efficiency in CO2 absorption. This review first discusses the environmental and economic implications of using ash wastes, emphasizing the reduction in landfill usage and the transformation of waste into value‐added products. Then the chemical/physical treatments of ash wastes and their inherent capabilities in binding or reacting with CO2 are introduced, along with current methodologies utilize these ashes for CO2 sequestration, including mineral carbonation and direct air capture techniques. The application of using ash wastes for CO2 capture are highlighted, followed by the discussion regarding challenges associated with ash‐based CO2 absorption approach. Finally, the article projects into the future, proposing innovative approaches and technological advancements needed to enhance the efficacy of ash in combating the increasing CO2 levels. By providing a comprehensive analysis of current strategies and envisioning future prospects, this review aims to contribute to the field of sustainable CO2 absorption and environmental management.

The calcium looping (CaL) process, comprising reversible calcination and carbonation reactions with CO2 and CaO-based sorbents, stands out as a highly promising industrial approach for CO2 capture. A significant challenge, however, is the swift degradation of the reactivity of CaO-based sorbents. In this study, CeO2-stabilized and CeO2/Al2O3 co-stabilized CaO-based sorbents were produced via a Pechini technique. Results indicated that incorporating CeO2 enhanced the CO2 sorption performance of CaO-based sorbents. The most effective CeO2-stabilized CaO-based sorbents (a CeO2/CaO mass ratio of 15:85) demonstrated an initial sorption capacity of 0.479 gCO2/gmaterial, undergoing a 41% reduction in its initial reactivity by the 20th cycle. To enhance CO2 sorption stability and reduce the high cost linked with the expensive cerium precursor, Al2O3 was introduced as the second stabilizer into the CeO2-stabilized CaO-based sorbents. When the CeO2/Al2O3/CaO mass ratio was adjusted to 5:10:85, the CO2 sorption capacity of CeO2/Al2O3 co-stabilized CaO-based sorbents reached 0.354 gCO2/gmaterial in the 20th cycle. This represented only a 17.7% reduction in its initial performance, surpassing the CeO2-stabilized counterpart by 26.3%. Comprehensive characterizations, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), revealed that incorporating Al2O3 into the CeO2-stabilized CaO-based sorbents served a dual purpose: acting as a stable framework to inhibit pore structure deterioration and increasing the concentration of oxygen vacancies. In consequence, the synergistic effect of CeO2 and Al2O3 improved both structural stability and oxygen vacancy concentration of the sorbents, ultimately leading to superior CO2 sorption performance.

The effective development of low permeability heavy oil reservoirs is crucial for tapping into unconventional resources. High-pressure CO2 flooding offers numerous benefits, including reducing crude oil viscosity, enhancing oil fluidity, and decreasing interfacial tension, leading to improved heavy oil production. Additionally, CO2 can be sequestered in the formation, contributing to carbon emission reduction. However, analyzing the migration and storage effects of CO2 in low permeability heavy oil reservoirs is challenging. In this study, high-pressure and high-temperature (50 MPa,100 °C) microfluidic experiments were designed and carried out, and the CO2 flooding characteristics and storage efficiency were studied. The distribution of the remaining oil and mechanisms of CO2 sequestration under various displacement speeds and injection pressures were analyzed. The results demonstrated that CO2 flooding achieved significantly higher recovery rates compared to high-pressure water flooding, with increments of 13.89, 21.53, and 23.09% at oil displacement pressures of 30, 40, and 50 MPa, respectively. The CO2 burial efficiency also showed substantial improvements, reaching 23.55, 34.01, and 37.13% under the corresponding conditions. Furthermore, a higher porosity facilitated CO2 migration, providing more space and migration channels for CO2 flow. By examining CO2–oil interactions, the study elucidated CO2 migration patterns and burial efficiency under different displacement modes.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising strategy to convert CO2 into fuels and building blocks for chemicals, exploiting renewable energy sources. Flow cells using gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) instead of simple H-cells are required to achieve higher production rates. In a GDE, CO2 diffuses through a porous gas diffusion layer (GDL) and reaches the active sites located in the catalyst layer; the GDL is a crucial component that can affect the performance of the GDE. In this work, we aimed to establish the parameters of the GDL that influence the selectivity toward the different CO2 reduction products in an alkaline flow reactor. We employed commercial Cu nanoparticles as electrocatalyst and selected a range of market-available GDLs: the structure, composition, and type of cracks of the GDL greatly influence the Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of CO, H2, and ethylene (C2H4). With the emphasis on C2H4, it was found that using a crack-free GDE is essential to get higher FEC2H4. At the same time, larger and more abundant cracks are detrimental to C2H4 production and promote hydrogen evolution: for instance, the FEC2H4 varies in the wide range of 13–32%, from the highly cracked to the crack-free GDL. The presence of both sulfur and oxygen in the microporous layer (MPL) of the GDL helps shift the CO2RR selectivity toward CO. The (in)stability of the GDEs at high current density has been correlated with a change in the wetting properties of the GDE and a loss in hydrophobicity.

Self-healing concrete is a type of concrete formed by delayed or secondary hydration of cement and its particles with water in the matrix leaking through cracks, and calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide on the crack surface react with calcium carbonate to provide protection against leakage through cracks. In recent studies, it has been observed that bacteria can self-repair with the production of calcium carbonate-based minerals and this repair provides protection against leakage, pore permeability and protection with increased strength and durability by reducing the infiltration of harmful substances into the internal structure. In this study, 32 different batches of samples were produced by using Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseudomonas putida and Sphingomonas mucosissima bacteria in mortar mixtures prepared by traditional methods with 2 different water/cement ratios and 3 different mineral additives. The bacteria used are cave isolates that provide calcium carbonate formation, and these isolates were multiplied in the appropriate growth culture and then added to the prepared mortar samples together with the mixture water. The specimens were cured with tap water for 28 days and then subjected to suction, ultrasonic, flexural and compressive strength tests. The results of the tests revealed a reduction in the porous structure of the specimens containing bacteria, resulting in lower water absorption rates compared to the reference specimens. It was observed that most CaCO3 was produced by Pseudomonas putida bacteria. However, there was no significant difference in compressive and flexural strengths compared to the reference specimens.

This study was set in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), where commercial vehicle movements were assigned across the road network. Implications for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air quality, and health were examined through an environmental justice lens. Electrification of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks was assessed to identify scenarios associated with the highest benefits for the most disadvantaged communities. Using spatially and temporally resolved commercial vehicle movements and a chemical transport model, changes in air pollutant concentrations under electric truck scenarios were estimated at 1-km2 resolution. Heavy-duty truck electrification reduces ambient black carbon and nitrogen dioxide on average by 10 and 14%, respectively, and GHG emissions by 10.5%. It achieves the highest reduction in premature mortality attributable to fine particulate matter chronic exposure (around 200 cases per year) compared with light- and medium-duty electrification (less than 150 cases each). The burden of all traffic in the GTHA was estimated to be around 600 cases per year. The benefits of electrification accrue primarily in neighborhoods with a high social disadvantage, measured by the Ontario Marginalization Indices, narrowing the disparity of exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Benefits related to heavy-duty truck electrification reflect the adverse impacts of diesel-fueled freight and highlight the co-benefits achieved by electrifying this sector.

Abstract This article presents the outcomes of a research study focused on optimizing the performance of soybean biofuel blends derived from soybean seeds specifically for urban medium-duty commercial vehicles. The study took into consideration elements such as production capacity, economics and assumed engine characteristics. For the purpose of predicting performance, combustion and emission characteristics, an artificial intelligence approach that has been trained using experimental data is used. At full load, the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) dropped as engine speed increased for biofuel and diesel fuel mixes, but brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased. The BSFC increased by 11.9% when diesel compared to using biofuel with diesel blends. The mixes cut both maximum cylinder pressure and $${{\text{NO}}}_{{\text{x}}}$$   NO x   emissions. The biofuel-diesel fuel proved more successful, with maximum reduction of 9.8% and 22.2 at rpm, respectively. The biofuel and diesel blend significantly improved carbon dioxide ( $${{\text{CO}}}_{2}$$   CO 2   ) and smoke emissions. The biofuel blends offer significant advantages by decreeing exhaust pollutants and enhancing engine performance. Graphical Abstract

Low-carbon electricity and heat production is essential for keeping the decarbonization targets and climate mitigation goals. Thus, an accurate understanding of the potential environmental impacts constitutes a key aspect not only for the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions but also for other environmental categories. Life cycle assessment allows us to conduct an overall evaluation of a given process or system through its whole lifetime across various environmental indicators. This study focused on construction, operation and maintenance, and end-of-life phases, which were analyzed based on the ReCiPe 2016 method. Within this work, authors assessed the environmental performance of one of the renewable energy sources—Enhanced Geothermal Systems, which utilize supercritical carbon dioxide as a working fluid to produce electricity and heat. Heat for the process is extracted from hot, dry rocks, typically located at depths of approximately 4–5 km, and requires appropriate stimulation to enable fluid flow. Consequently, drilling and site preparation entail significant energy and material inputs. This stage, based on conducted calculations, exhibits the highest global warming potential, with values between 5.2 and 30.1 kgCO2eq/MWhel, corresponding to approximately 65%, 86%, and 94% in terms of overall impacts for ecosystems, human health, and resources categories, respectively. Moreover, the study authors compared the EGS impacts for the Polish and Norwegian conditions. Obtained results indicated that due to much higher electricity output from the Norwegian plant, which is sited offshore, the environmental influence remains the lowest, at a level of 11.9 kgCO2eq/MWhel. Polish cases range between 38.7 and 54.1 kgCO2eq/MWhel of global warming potential in terms of electricity production. Regarding power generation only, the impacts in the case of the Norwegian facility are two to five times lower than for the installation in the Polish conditions.

Abstract Both laboratory tests and pilot wells have demonstrated the significant potential of CO2 as an EOR medium. Due to the weak pressure conduction and mass transfer of the CO2-oil system, multiple zones between the injection well and production well are generated in the ultra-low permeability reservoirs. This work aims to explore the characteristics of multiple zones and mechanisms of CO2-EOR, combining the experimental results, core-scale, and field-scale simulation. Long core displacement experiments were conducted under different miscibility pressures with production gas assayed using gas chromatography. When the core-scale simulation matched with the experimental results, the four CO2 fronts, which were used to distinguish different zones, were defined based on pressure, interfacial tension, and CO2 concentration along the long core. The distribution of five zones was upscaled to the field-scale model after the history matching of pilot wells. The final step was to evaluate the value of the miscible zone range, utilization factor of CO2 injection, oil recovery, and CO2 storage efficiency during the CO2 injection process. Results show that the boundary between the original oil zone and the oil transition zone exists at the CO2 component front, where the CO2 concentration is zero. Additionally, the location of the CO2 component front does not overlap with the contact interface of CO2-crude oil, meaning that the dissolution effect of CO2 in the oil transition zone results in the CO2 component front moving farther. Besides, when the formation pressure is higher than the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), the distance between the CO2-effective phase front and the CO2-effective component front further expands as the pressure increases, enlarging the miscible zone range. The pressure accumulates around the injection well because of slow pressure conduction. When the average formation pressure reaches 1.1 MMP, the miscible zone range is enlarged by 2.7% higher than that of the near miscible flooding (0.92 MMP), leading to a higher rate of oil recovery by 8.6% and a utilization factor of CO2 by 0.14t/t. It is for the first time that the range of five zones and the characteristics of four CO2 fronts migration is assessed, furnishing an in-depth understanding of the complicated mechanisms and phase behavior in CO2 EOR in the ultra-low permeability oil reservoir. This work contributes to providing significant information for designing an economic and environmental CO2 flooding strategy and is significant in the improvement of oil recovery and the reduction of CO2 emission.

This article presents the findings of a study on oxide reduction utilizing a novel reducing plasma torch, employing greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 as plasma gases. The primary aim of this investigation is to establish the viability of this approach. The innovative plasma torch was employed to reduce various oxides, including aluminum oxide, iron oxide, and titanium oxide, as well as a mixed oxide composition, employing a CO2/CH4 molar ratio of 1:1 within a spouted bed reactor. Following plasma treatment, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to examine the metallic phases, notably titanium, iron, and aluminum. SEM–EDS observations were carried out to assess microstructural changes and identify elemental compositions pre- and post-plasma treatment. The results demonstrate that within the conical section of the reactor, titanium oxide experiences partial reduction, resulting in limited titanium production, while aluminum oxide and iron oxides (magnetite and hematite) undergo reduction to yield aluminum and iron, respectively. Thermodynamic calculations, performed using Factsage software version 8.3, were utilized to predict stable-phase formations following plasma treatment for each material.

Solar‐driven CO2 reduction and water oxidation to liquid fuels represents a promising solution to alleviate energy crisis and climate issue, but it remains a great challenge for generating CH3OH and CH3CH2OH dominated by multi‐electron transfer. Single‐cluster catalysts with super electron acceptance, accurate molecular structure, customizable electronic structure and multiple adsorption sites, have led to greater potential in catalyzing various challenging reactions. However, accurately controlling the number and arrangement of clusters on functional supports still faces great challenge. Herein, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to uniformly disperse Wells‐Dawson‐ and Keggin‐type polyoxometalates on TiO2 nanotube arrays, resulting in a series of single‐cluster functionalized catalysts P2M18O62@TiO2 and PM12O40@TiO2 (M = Mo or W). The single polyoxometalate cluster can be distinctly identified and serves as electronic sponge to accept electrons from excited TiO2 for enhancing surface‐hole concentration and promote water oxidation. Among these samples, P2Mo18O62@TiO2‐1 exhibits the highest electron consumption rate of 1260 µmol g−1 for CO2‐to‐CH3OH conversion with H2O as the electron source, which is 11 times higher than that of isolated TiO2 nanotube arrays. This work supplied a simple synthesis method to realize the single‐dispersion of molecular cluster to enrich surface‐reaching holes on TiO2, thereby facilitating water oxidation and CO2 reduction.

Exploring various strategies for CO2 hydrate storage in subseafloor saline sediments reveals a promising yet challenging path toward mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions and advancing clean energy development. Research has revealed the efficacy of sediment-specific modifications, including the use of inorganic emulsifiers, l-leucine (an amino acid), and nanoparticle coatings, in enhancing CO2 hydrate formation stability and storage capacity. These modifications aid in overcoming the challenges posed by the harsh environmental conditions of salinity and sediment heterogeneity, providing increased stability, enhanced CO2 adsorption efficiency, and reduced induction time. Furthermore, advancements in nanomaterials have introduced nanostructured encapsulation systems capable of confining and stabilizing CO2 within a solid matrix under fluctuating pressure, temperature, and salinity conditions. Incorporating nanoparticles into polymers and surfactants yields a nanofluid that exhibits increased stability, improved wettability, interfacial tension (IFT) reduction, and elevated CO2 hydrate storage efficiency, with the synergistic effects of these components playing a critical role. Moreover, innovative thermal and pressure manipulation strategies, alongside the integration of kinetic promoters, have shown significant potential in optimizing CO2 hydrate formation kinetics and enhancing long-term stability. These strategies involve novel electrical heating systems, pressure management techniques, and chemical additives that collectively contribute to increased hydrate formation rates and gas storage capacities. Despite these promising developments, the field faces several challenges, including optimizing encapsulation materials to match geological characteristics, the long-term stability of CO2 hydrates under extreme conditions, and scaling laboratory experiments to field applications. Addressing these issues necessitates a multifaceted approach, incorporating empirical data and theoretical insights to design, screen, and formulate effective CO2 hydrate storage solutions in subseafloor saline sediments.

Since 2015, the prevailing challenges of gender inequality and climate change have garnered attention from the United Nations. While gender equality represents the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #5, climate action is listed as Goal #13. Gender equality is a saturated area in the extant literature of gender studies while the literature on the nexus between the climate change and gender mainstreaming are in short supply. Apart from the environmental hazards created by climate change, vulnerable groups, especially women, are facing higher risks and greater burdens from its impacts. The effects of climate change have led to a global quest for decarbonization, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions through the use of low-carbon power sources. Despite the global quest for decarbonization, the effects of climate change are alarming. The impact of climate change has widened the gap of gender inequality. Empirical studies show that women in agriculture are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change compared to their male counterparts. It is also evident that women and men experience climate change impacts differently due to their socially constructed roles and responsibilities in developing countries. Because climate change affects the availability of surface water, rural women, who are usually given the task of fetching water, have to travel greater distances to collect water, increasing their already substantial workloads. This study assesses the National Action Plan on Gender and Climate Change for Nigeria and its impact on gender mainstreaming in Nigeria. The study adopts methodological triangulation. The primary data were generated through key informant interviews (KIIs); the secondary data were sourced from textbooks, journal articles, and web-based materials. The data generated were analyzed using inductive methodologies and thematic analysis. The study recommends more gender-sensitive climate actions and the proper formulation of structures and processes toward the full realization of gender mainstreaming.

Summary Climate change is simultaneously increasing carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO 2 ]) and temperature. These factors could interact to influence plant physiology and performance. Alternatively, increased [CO 2 ] may offset costs associated with elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the interaction between elevated temperature and [CO 2 ] may differentially affect populations from along an elevational gradient and disrupt local adaptation. We conducted a multifactorial growth chamber experiment to examine the interactive effects of temperature and [CO 2 ] on fitness and ecophysiology of diverse accessions of Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae) sourced from a broad elevational gradient in Colorado. We tested whether increased [CO 2 ] would enhance photosynthesis across accessions, and whether warmer conditions would depress the fitness of high‐elevation accessions owing to steep reductions in temperature with increasing elevation in this system. Elevational clines in [CO 2 ] are not as evident, making it challenging to predict how locally adapted ecotypes will respond to elevated [CO 2 ]. This experiment revealed that elevated [CO 2 ] increased photosynthesis and intrinsic water use efficiency across all accessions. However, these instantaneous responses to treatments did not translate to changes in fitness. Instead, increased temperatures reduced the probability of reproduction for all accessions. Elevated [CO 2 ] and increased temperatures interacted to shift the adaptive landscape, favoring lower elevation accessions for the probability of survival and fecundity. Our results suggest that elevated temperatures and [CO 2 ] associated with climate change could have severe negative consequences, especially for high‐elevation populations.

Under the mounting pressure to make changes to become more environmentally friendly and sustainable, port authorities have been exploring effective solutions to reduce CO2 emissions. In this regard, alternative fuels, innovative technology, and optimization strategies are key pathways for ports to transition toward a low-carbon pattern. In this review work, the current development status and characteristics of renewable and clean energy in ports were meticulously analyzed. The CO2 emission reduction effects and limitations of port microgrids, carbon capture, and other technological operations were thoroughly examined. Lastly, the emission reduction optimization strategies ports could adopt under different scenarios were evaluated. The research findings showed that (1) combining the characteristics of the port and quantifying the properties of different renewable energy sources and low-carbon fuels is extremely necessary to select suitable alternative energy sources for port development; (2) technological advancements, multi-party interests, and policy impacts were the primary factors influencing the development of emission reduction technology methods; and (3) the coordinated optimization of multiple objectives in cross-scenarios was the main direction for ports to achieve sustainable development. This study provides theoretical guidance to ports that are transitioning to a greener pattern, as well as pointing out future research directions and development spaces for researchers.

Natural enzymes intricately regulate substrate accessibility through specific amino acid sequences and folded structures at their active sites. Achieving such precise control over the microenvironment has proven to be challenging in nanocatalysis, especially in the realm of ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticles. Here, we use atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) as model catalysts to demonstrate an effective ligand engineering strategy to control the local concentration of CO2 on the surface of gold (Au) NCs during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The precise incorporation of two 2-thiouracil-5-carboxylic acid (TCA) ligands within the pocket-like cavity of [Au25(pMBA)18]− NCs (pMBA = para-mercaptobenzoic acid) leads to a substantial acceleration in the reaction kinetics of CO2RR. This enhancement is attributed to a more favorable microenvironment in proximity to the active site for CO2, facilitated by supramolecular interactions between the nucleophilic Nδ− of the pyrimidine ring of the TCA ligand and the electrophilic Cδ+ of CO2. A comprehensive investigation employing absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, isotopic labeling measurements, electrochemical analyses, and quantum chemical computation highlights the pivotal role of local CO2 enrichment in enhancing the activity and selectivity of TCA-modified Au25 NCs for CO2RR. Notably, a high Faradaic efficiency of 98.6% toward CO has been achieved. The surface engineering approach and catalytic fundamentals elucidated in this study provide a systematic foundation for the molecular-level design of metal-based electrocatalysts.

The energy demand in the building sector is anticipated to increase with climate change and the high energy consumption is responsible for releasing enormous amounts of CO2 into the environment, intensifying climate change. Phase change material (PCM) integration into the building envelope has a high potential to reduce the building's energy demand without compromising environmental sustainability. This research investigated the impact of PCMs (PCM 18–PCM 30) on building cooling, heating, and annual energy efficiency for future climate scenarios (2095) in 13 different climate zones worldwide. For this purpose, the Fanger comfort model was implemented and numerical simulations were performed using Energyplus. The performance of PCM was evaluated using novel Predicted Mean Vote fluctuation reductions (PMVFR), and the Total Predicted Mean Vote drop (TPMVD). Further, for the first time, a time series-forecasting model for the estimation of CO2 emissions originating from various energy production sources in the future was developed using gene-expression programming (GEP) algorithm. Finally, the two different maps showing the PCM efficiency for energy conservation and environmental sustainability at the global level are presented. The results evidence a maximum of 12.9% reduction in annual energy demand in the future with the integration of PCM. The GEP-based prediction model demonstrated good accuracy as determined by the statistical parameters and satisfied the external validation requirements. The environmental analysis exhibits that PCM integration can reduce carbon emissions up to 204 CO2-e Kg/year. Overall, the integration of PCM is regarded as a sustainable solution for building energy efficiency, considering climate change.

Iron–sulfur clusters play essential roles in biological systems, and thus synthetic [Fe4S4] clusters have been an area of active research. Recent studies have demonstrated that soluble [Fe4S4] clusters can serve as net H atom transfer mediators, improving the activity and selectivity of a homogeneous Mn CO2 reduction catalyst. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating these [Fe4S4] clusters into a coordination polymer enables heterogeneous H atom transfer from an electrode surface to a Mn complex dissolved in solution. A previously reported solution-processable Fe4S4-based coordination polymer was successfully deposited on the surfaces of different electrodes. The coated electrodes serve as H atom transfer mediators to a soluble Mn CO2 reduction catalyst displaying good product selectivity for formic acid. Furthermore, these electrodes are recyclable with a minimal decrease in activity after multiple catalytic cycles. The heterogenization of the mediator also enables the characterization of solution-phase and electrode surface species separately. Surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) reveals spectroscopic signatures for an in situ generated active Mn–H species, providing a more complete mechanistic picture for this system. The active species, reaction mechanism, and the protonation sites on the [Fe4S4] clusters were further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The observed H atom transfer reactivity of these coordination polymer-coated electrodes motivates additional applications of this composite material in reductive H atom transfer electrocatalysis.

Lanthanide metals have attracted particular interest in the catalysis of electrochemical CO2 reduction. The synthesis and precise spatial distribution of active sites are fundamental important but still formidably challenging owing to the strong oxygen affinity of lanthanide. Here, heteronuclear Pr1-Ni1 single atoms are supported on the carbon matrix containing surface framework defects from lanthanide contraction. The Pr/Ni-NC catalyst exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.1 % with a commercial-scale current density of 237 mA cm−2 and a turnover frequency as high as 18,038 h−1 at −1.1 V due to d-f coupling effect and electronic structure perturbation of Pr. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations unveil that the diatomic active sites effectively reduce the energy barrier of the crucial *COOH formation, in which the Pr site facilitates CO2 activation and the Ni site enables H2O dissociation to accelerate the proton transfer process, thereby ensuring the synergy of catalytic sites to greatly facilitate CO2-to-CO conversion.

Abstract Reservoir modelling tools have played a significant role in designing the subsurface fluid injection, such as CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However, these models are computationally expensive; they require extensive geological and engineering data that often are not available in the early phase of carbon utilization and storage projects. This work presents the development of fast predictive models and optimization methodologies to quickly evaluate the CO2 EOR and storage operations in mature oil fields. Considerable experience with CO2 EOR and storage has been gained by the petroleum industry. In particular, the Weyburn-Midale project (Canada) is a comprehensive case to show how an oil reservoir could securely store CO2. Employing the Weyburn-Midale project, we developed, trained and tested several types of proxy models in multiple scenarios to assess the performance of the miscible CO2 flood in recovering residual oil, increasing the ultimate oil recovery factor while maximizing the permanent CO2 storage. The history matching of the Weyburn-Midale CO2 EOR model involved 216 well histories (producers and injectors) from 1964 to 2006 using a compositional reservoir simulator. The predominant exploitation scheme was based on an inverted nine-spot pattern waterflooding, water alternating CO2, and consequently CO2 injection. Two simulation data sets were employed at different periods of 1956 through 2006, and 2007 through 2025. Among several proxy models, an artificial neural network (ANN) model proved to accurately estimate features of interest, namely fluid production (oil, water, gas), fluid injection (water, CO2) and the amount of CO2 stored in the reservoir. Additionally, an autoregressive exogenous input (ARX) model was implemented to predict the future outputs in response to a future input. Inspection of the relative estimation error and the model fitness score showed that the proxy model was capable of rapidly reproducing the trend in the validation set satisfactorily. Lastly, we evaluated the transfer of learning from a proxy model, trained to the Weyburn-Midale field (Canada), to assess the performance of CO2 EOR in another mature oil reservoir in Europe (Romania). The application of proxy models under geological and operation uncertainties offers huge reduction in computational time and engineering data requirements. The results from the Weyburn-Midale case study deliver critical insights into the analysis of many process factors and modeling techniques intended to assess the economic limits and long-term performance of CO2 EOR and storage in mature oil fields.

Abstract The tight reservoir exhibits pronounced heterogeneity and possesses complex physical properties, thereby constraining crude oil exploitation. Water and CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery encounter challenges related to low sweep efficiency and viscous fingering, resulting in suboptimal recovery effectiveness. In recent years, there has been growing attention towards the synergistic advantages of oil displacement through the injection of fluids such as CO2, hydrocarbon gases, and chemical additives. This paper presents the design of a microscopic visualization experimental system specifically tailored for studying high-temperature and high-pressure composite fluid displacement in actual tight oil reservoir conditions. Based on the pore throat characteristics inside the core, a visual micro-nano scale pore throat model was created to simulate the flow of composite fluid in micro-nano channels under high temperature and high pressure conditions. The research findings indicate that adding dimethyl ether and ethane to composite gases enhances their solubility and expansion in crude oil. Comparing the occurrence characteristics of residual oil after CO2 injection development reveals that injecting a composite gas (CO2- C2H6-DME) leads to a notable reduction in residual oil in the form of Clustered and oil Porous. The experimental results show that the final recovery rate of composite gas flooding can reach 92.8%, which is 46.7% higher than pure CO2. This paper presents, for the first time, the synergistic enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology of injecting a composite gas mixture (CO2, C2H6, DME) into tight reservoirs. This study employs microscopic visualization techniques to assess the variation in residual oil characteristics and the enhancement of recovery in crude oils driven by different gases.

Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has set a target to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050, which is aligned with Oman’s country vision. A mid- and long-term strategy has been developed to identify cost-competitive abatement staircases, including elimination of routine flaring, driving energy efficiency across operating assets and increasing the share of power generation from renewable power sources (solar and wind). Although these activities will lead to a step-change reduction in CO2 emission levels, Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) will be a key enabler of PDO’s net zero targets. The extensive Mesozoic carbonate rock sequences of North Oman provide an exciting opportunity for CO2 storage in both dipping saline aquifers and structural traps. While hydrocarbons are produced from these carbonates in numerous fields in the country, they also have enormous potential for carbon storage with multiple reservoir-seal pairs, particularly in the Shuaiba, Kharaib, Lekhwair and Habshan Formations of the Kahmah Group. Unlike the majority of CCS projects globally which utilise clastic saline aquifers and depleted fields, carbonates present an additional challenge due to the pervasive nature of faults and fractures which can exert a large influence on both injectivity potential and containment of the CO2 plume.

Chemical looping integrated with reverse water gas (CL-RWGS) shift is presented in this study using Cu-based oxygen carrier (OC) supported on Al2O3 has been used to convert the CO2 and H2 mixture stream into a syngas stream with a tailored H2 to CO ratio and relevant conditions. The results demonstrated consistent breakthrough curves during redox cycles, confirming the chemical stability of the material. In 10 consecutive cycles at 600 °C and 1 bar, bed temperatures increased by 184 °C and 132 °C across the bed during oxidation and reduction stages respectively. The cooling effects during RWGS showed a decline in solid temperatures demonstrating the effectiveness of the heat removal strategy while attaining a CO2-to-CO conversion close >48%. The outlet gas maintains a H2/CO ratio above 2, confirming the material's dual role as OC and catalyst. During complete CL-RWGS cycles, varying temperature from 500 °C to 600 °C at a constant H2/CO2 molar ratio (1.3) and pressure (1 bar) reduces the H2/CO molar ratio from 3.14 to 2.35, respectively with a remarkable continuous CO2-to-CO conversion > 40%. The decrease in H2/CO molar ratio with the increase in temperature is consistent with the expected results of equilibrium limited conditions. Additionally, in CL-RWGS cycles, pressure insignificantly affects product molar composition. The study showed the capability of Cu material in converting CO2 into syngas through the CL-RWGS technique.

Objective Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) stands at the forefront of innovative solutions to combat climate change. This manuscript exploring into the promising realm of CCU, showcasing its role in transforming them into valuable products. The marriage of environmental sustainability and economic growth is the crux of CCU's appeal. This work conducts a comparative analysis of CCU methods, dissecting those with hydrogen integration and those without. By examining respective challenges, and potential driver for Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) deployment, insights will be provided that contribute to the ongoing discourse in Malaysia. The urgency to address climate change has fueled the exploration of innovative solutions, with CCU emerging as a frontrunner. Interest in Carbon Capture, Utilization and Sequestration (CCUS) in Southeast Asia has been growing in line with international trends. The renewed momentum for CCUS has been driven by strengthened climate commitments from governments and industry, including ambitious net-zero targets. Beyond the conventional approach of capturing CO2 emissions, CCU offers a dual benefit by repurposing the captured carbon into valuable products. This paradigm shift not only aligns with environmental sustainability goals but also opens avenues for economic growth, creating a synergy between climate action and financial viability. CCU with H2 hydrogenation is a way of converting CO2 into useful products or energy sources. Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction that adds hydrogen atoms to a molecule, usually to increase its stability or reactivity. In this case, hydrogenation of CO2 produces various fuels and chemicals, such as methane, methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, and hydrocarbons. There are different types of catalysts that can be used for CO2 hydrogenation with H2, such as metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, and metal carbides. The choice of catalyst depends on the desired product and the reaction conditions. Direct use of CO2 for utilization without hydrogen is another way of converting CO2 into useful products or energy sources. There are different ways to achieve this, such as using CO2 as a feedstock for chemical synthesis, building materials, or enhanced oil recovery. Unlike CO2 based Fuel processes which requires large input of energy due to splitting or reduction of CO2 molecule processes, incorporating CO2 molecule into the product such as CO2 in building materials require low energy. However, the estimated potential for the scale of CO2 utilization in fuels varies widely, from 1 to 4.2 Gigatonnes of CO2 per year while CO2 utilization pathways in concrete building materials are estimated between 0.1 and 1.4 Gigatonnes of CO2 per year over the long term[7]. Early commercial opportunities to use CO2 to cure concrete or in the production of aggregates are already being realized – in some cases demonstrating improved cost and product performance relative to conventional production. This process can enhance the strength and durability of the concrete, as well as reduce the amount of cement and other materials needed. By converting CO2 into products with economic value, CCU fosters a circular economy, where emissions are repurposed, contributing to a more sustainable and resource-efficient model by ensuring the final emissions to be appropriately repurposed or captured and the cycle continues.

Abstract Chichimene is an oil field located in the Colombian eastern basin. Since 2014, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) through the water injection process has been carried out successfully in part of this field. A polymer injection pilot was carried out over five injection patterns to optimize this process as a promising strategy for polymer-based EOR in challenging reservoir conditions with high temperatures and heavy oil. Polymer injection started in 2015 in the first injection pattern, and it was extended between 2018 and 2019 to five injector wells covering different areas of the oil field. 21.65 MSTB of polymer-augmented water were injected (approximately 7,000 t of polymer). At the end of 2022, the incremental oil production had reached around 4.9 MBbls (Million barrels of oil), and it is expected to increase up to 6.9 MBbls, resulting in a 9.84% incremental oil recovery factor. Considerable incremental oil recovery concerning the pilot patterns’ production baseline and notable carbon and energy intensity improvements were observed. Life cycle GHG (Green House Gas) emissions and energy consumptions associated with the crude oil production chain were estimated. Moreover, a suitable calculation tool of carbon footprint and energy intensity related to each stage of crude oil recovery by polymer injection processes was performed. The main contributions of GHG emission and energy consumption for the polymer-based EOR process analyzed were linked to lifting, oil dehydration, water clarification treatment, and Injection systems. The contribution of each stage in the total carbon footprint of crude oil production was calculated for the polymer flooding and compared with oil baseline production. The carbon footprint of implementing the oil recovery project was calculated for eight years. The results show that the carbon intensity of the crude oil baseline production in the five patterns is close to 20 kg CO2-eq/BO (barrels of oil) on average. Nevertheless, EOR by polymer injection decreases to 19.3 kg CO2-eq/BO. Regarding the energy intensity, the oil baseline production of the five patterns achieved 8.5 kWh/BO; however, the specific energy consumption in the EOR process by polymer injection decreased to 6.7 kWh/BO. The reduction is attributed mainly to energy use optimization in crude oil lifting and enhanced water re-injection with polymer. Furthermore, the carbon intensity reduction could lead to more than 3,200 t of CO2-eq avoided and improve the energy performance of polymer-based EOR by more than 20% concerning the baseline case. Nevertheless, a significant potential GHG emissions reduction of more than 4,000 t CO2-eq could be expected for the whole impact of this project in the Chichimene field.

Summary The development of unconventional liquid-rich reservoirs, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) considers a promising fluid to further improve oil recovery of shale oil reservoirs in and after hydraulic fracturing. However, the scCO2 has some disadvantages to limit its application in hydraulic fracturing, such as ultra-low viscosity, asphaltene deposition and high miscible pressure. Diluted microemulsion (DME) shows great potential as the additive of fracturing fluid to improve the well productivity through strengthening the spontaneous imbibition during the shut-in period after hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, it is essential to further understand the synergic effects between scCO2 and DME at the pore scale. In this study, three soaking sequences are designed and compared, which include only scCO2 soaking, water-scCO2-DME soaking sequence, and DME-scCO2-DME soaking sequence using shale cores from the Lucaogou Formation. Low-field nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) technique are utilized to quantify the oil distribution among different pores in each soaking stage. Furthermore, component change of the produced oil is characterized by the gas chromatography (GC). Notably, T1-T2 spectra are introduced to verify the results of T2 spectra and GC. Results show that DME can replace the oil from small pores into large pores and thus improve the extraction effects of scCO2. The solid-liquid and oil-water/scCO2 interactions determine the adhesion work of heavy components. DME can enhance the heavy component (C17+) mobilization through interfacial tension (IFT) reduction and wettability alteration. Combing scCO2 and DME can effectively improve the mobilization of both light and heavy components of crude oil, and thus achieve a better ultimate oil recovery rate.

The main objective of the current study is to examine the impact of institutional performance, digital governance, and green finance on environmental performance within expanded BRICS nations that have undergone expansion. Key findings indicate that enhancing digital governance significantly reduces emissions; therefore, policies should be implemented to fortify digital infrastructure and promote environmentally responsible practices. The study utilized three discrete regression models to analyse the ecological impact and emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, providing insights into the primary greenhouse gases contributing to global climate change. In light of the intricate correlation between emissions and institutional performance, it is imperative to develop nuanced policies that effectively reconcile the need to strengthen institutions with environmental concerns. Green financing is a crucial element that advocates for policies that encourage investment in environmentally friendly initiatives and technology and has a net positive impact on emissions reduction. The adoption of sustainable practices is imperative for economic expansion due to the observed correlation between heightened emissions and economic capacity. To decouple environmental degradation from economic expansion, policies should be implemented to support green technologies. In summary, these results provide evidence in favour of a comprehensive policy approach within the BRICS countries, which ought to achieve a harmonious coexistence of environmental conservation and economic advancement, to the advantage of all stakeholders. The current study is carried out to promote environmental sustainability, reduce harmful activities, strengthen institutions for collaborative pollution management, and enforce stringent environmental regulations on foreign direct investment, the expanded BRICS nations should strive to reduce detrimental activities. Placing significant emphasis on the interdependent nature of economic development and its environmental ramifications is of utmost importance.

Abstract A major part of the energy transition transformation is reduction of carbon footprint in the current oil and gas operations. The energy consumption in the whole chain of operations needs to be evaluated. The energy efficiency of water flooding is compared to polymer flooding for extraction of heavy oil from an oil field in the UK sector of the North Sea is evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with the concept of Exergy-Return-on-Exergy-Investment (ERoEI). The LCA allows for separation of the process into material and work streams, assessing the impact of each separately. By applying the exergy concept, i.e. the amount of useful energy invested or returned, a comparison of different process steps and different extraction strategies can be achieved. The Oil field, characterized by an oil viscosity of approximately 80 cP, poses challenges for water flooding operations. Early water breakthrough in producers and high water cuts are anticipated outcomes. While thermal EOR methods could potentially address sweep efficiency concerns, they come at a considerable energy and CO2 cost. Building upon recent advancements in the understanding of polymer flooding for heavy oil extraction, a low-dosage polymer flood was implemented, yielding highly positive results. By utilizing the established water channels in the field, cross-flow of oil into the channels generates a rapid increase in oil production by polymer. In this paper we present the results of an expansion of the current polymer flood to new sections of the field. When comparing like for like development infrastructure and UR recovery times scales, polymer flood leads to a strong acceleration of the oil production which results in a significant increase in Net-Present-Value (NPV). Furthermore, there is an increase of 2.4 times the exergy return on exergy investment and a reduction of 35 % in CO2 emissions. Extraction of heavy oil has for a long time been dominated by energy intensive and/or inefficient methods. Our study demonstrates that the implementation of low-dosage polymer flooding not only significantly enhances recovery rates, accelerating production by decades, but also accomplishes this with reduced energy cost. The CO2 intensity (kg CO2/bbl oil) is quantified and providing a useful optimization factor for the polymer flood design.

Abstract The dihydrogen (H2) sector is undergoing development and will require massive storage solutions. To minimize costs, the conversion of UGS sites, such as deep aquifers, used for natural gas storage into future underground hydrogen storage (UHS) sites is the favored scenario. However, these sites contain microorganisms capable of consuming H2, mainly sulfate reducers and methanogens. Methanogenesis is therefore expected but its intensity must be evaluated. Here, in a deep aquifer used for UGS, 17 sites were sampled, with low sulfate concentrations ranging from 21.9 to 197.8 µM and a slow renewal of formation water. H2 selected communities mainly were composed of the families Methanobacteriaceae and Methanothermobacteriaceae and the genera Desulfovibrio, Thermodesulfovibrio and Desulforamulus. Experiments were done under different conditions, and sulfate reduction, as well as methanogenesis, were demonstrated in the presence of a H2 or H2/CO2 (80/20) gas phase, with or without calcite/site rock. These metabolisms led to an increase in pH up to 10.2 under certain conditions (without CO2). The results suggest competition for CO2 between lithoautotrophs and carbonate mineral precipitation, which could limit microbial H2 consumption.

Solar-integrated fuel cell systems are widely regarded as an effective means of saving energy and reducing emissions, given their ability to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. However, solar thermal power systems are intermittent, whereas fuel cell waste heat power generation has continuous power output. The paper proposes a novel solar and molten carbonate fuel cell complementary driven supercritical-CO2 cycle system. The performance of multi-energy complementary driven supercritical-CO2 cycle and system operation mode conversion is being investigated. The complementary operation mode ensures the continuous output of the proposed system through the switching of the solar module and the fuel cell module. The result indicates that the fuel cell module operates for 23.5 % of the time in a year, resulting in a reduction of the storage tank volume by 14,723 m3 and a decrease of the fixed heliostat area by 108,237 m2. The efficiency of the supercritical-CO2 cycle individually is 43.1 %, and with the addition of the waste heat utilization subsystem, the cycle efficiency of the proposed system reaches 50.89 %. Furthermore, the levelized cost of electricity for the proposed system is 0.1861$/kWh, and the research results can serve as a reference for the design of complementary energy systems.

Industrial electrification is a crucial strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and tackling the challenge of renewable energy consumption. With the advancement of low-carbon electricity, chemical process electrification has garnered extensive attention. This work focuses on the electrification reconfiguration and carbon emission reduction of traditional chemical process, which mainly concerns the indirect electrification of processes and direct electrification of utilities, using the state-of-the-art Coal-to-Ethylene glycol (CtEG) process as a case study. The conventional CtEG process results in high CO2 emissions due to water gas shift reaction. The indirect electrification path of the conventional CtEG process is achieved by introducing green hydrogen from solid oxide electrolysis cell technology (SOEC-CtEG). Electric heaters are directly used for the hot utility in SOEC-CtEG process to form a semi-electrification scenario (SES). To investigate the performance of different electrification levels, the full-electrification scenario (FES) is also designed. The results showed that the total CO2 emissions for the four scenarios are 3.047, 0.576, 0.278 and 0.334 t/t EG, with energy efficiencies of 47.86%, 50.11%, 50.07% and 46.74%, respectively. Production costs are 3024.4, 3497.4, 3869.4, and 6147.8 CNY/t EG, respectively. The present work will contribute to the carbon reduction and process electrification of the CtEG process.

Abstract A CO2-modified alkyl polyglycoside (C-APG) surfactant was synthesized from a commercial APG product under mild reaction conditions including a low temperature at 50 °C and a low pressure of 2.5 bar. With this reaction, CO2 was successfully incorporated into APG molecules for efficient reduction of carbon footprint. The performance of applying C-APG as chemical flooding for improved oil production application in carbonate reservoirs with heavy crude oil was investigated and compared with its precursor - APG surfactant. The synthesized C-APG was characterized by FTIR and the physicochemical properties of both APG and C-APG including compatibility, surface tension, interfacial tension (IFT) were evaluated. Both surfactants were compatible with the high-salinity water (HSW) and had a similar critical micelle concentration (CMC). However, C-APG exhibited a much pronounced effect in reducing IFT between oil and water. The IFT of C-APG was 10-fold lower than original APG surfactant, suggesting great potential in chemical flooding for oil displacement. Micromodel test showed that the produced heavy oil by injection of APG or C-APG solution was further enhanced after water flooding. C-APG shows higher effectiveness on oil displacement due to lower IFT and stronger emulsification. Core-flooding oil displacement test indicated that C-APG injection resulted in a lower differential pressure and a higher cumulative oil production comparing APG chemical flooding. The produced fluids from C-APG flooding and extended water flooding exhibited very strong emulsification comparing the fluids produced by APG flooding. The incomplete phase separation resulted in an underestimated oil displacement efficiency by C-APG flooding. This study shows a great potential of C-APG surfactant in terms of CO2 reduction and improving oil production.

China's climate and environmental problems remained prominent. Energy transition was the key to improve climate and pollution, and it was at a critical period. Previous studies mostly focused on the impact of climate policies on the reduction of air pollutants and the environmental health impacts of individual sector or pathway policies. Thus, focusing on the synergistic abatement of CO2 and air pollutants and health effects of energy transition in carbon neutrality was significant for building beautiful and healthy China. LEAP-HEA model was constructed to project energy demand, CO2 and air pollutants, and assess energy transition's environmental health effects from 2020 to 2060. LMDI model was adopted to decompose the abatement contribution. Synergistic assessment index was used to estimate the coordinated abatement effects. Cost-effectiveness of energy transition and regional heterogeneity of PM2.5 toxicity were not considered. The results indicated: (1) energy demand would decrease and structure would be optimized significantly under deep energy transition scenario. (2) Deep energy transition could promote earlier realization of carbon neutrality. It would contribute significantly to CO2 and air pollutants abatement with strong synergistic effects. (3) Energy transition would reduce health risks with large economic benefits. Recommendations were proposed based on the conclusions.

Introduction:Teleconsultations for preoperative evaluation in anesthesiology proved to be feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, widespread implementation of teleconsultations has not yet occurred. Besides time savings and economic benefits, teleconsultations in anesthesia may have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions.Methods:We conducted a life cycle assessment based on prospective surveys to assess the potential environmental benefits of preoperative anesthesia teleconsultations in comparison to the status-quo in-person consultations. Within 1 month, all patients presenting at the preoperative anesthesia clinic at RWTH Aachen University Hospital were asked about the distance traveled and mode of transportation to the hospital. The main outcome measure was the potential environmental benefit resulting from the implementation of teleconsultations.Results:In total, 821 out of 981 patients presenting at the anesthesia clinic participated in the survey. Most patients visited on an outpatient basis (62.9%) and traveled by car (81.7%). The median travel distance was 25 km [interquartile range 12-40]. If patients who came to the hospital solely for the anesthesia appointment had scheduled virtual appointments, the emissions of 3.03-ton CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq) could be avoided in the first month after implementation. The environmental impact associated with the production of teleconsultation equipment is outweighed by the reduction in patient travel. If all outpatient appointments were performed virtually, these savings would triple. Within 10 years, more than 1,300 tons CO2-eq could be avoided.Conclusion:Teleconsultations can mitigate the environmental impact of in-person anesthesia consultations. Further research is essential to leverage teleconsultations for preoperative evaluation also across other medical specialties.

Abstract. In order to reduce aviation’s CO2 emissions and comply with current climate targets, the European Union plans a mandatory quota of 2 % sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, rising up to ≥ 70 % SAF by 2050. In addition to a reduction of life cycle CO2-emissions the use of SAF can also have a positive impact on particle emissions and contrail properties. In this study we present observations from the ECLIF3 (Emission and CLimate Impact of alternative Fuels) aircraft campaign, which investigated exhaust and contrail characteristics of an Airbus A350-941 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines. For the first time, non-volatile and total particle emissions of 100 % HEFA-SPK (Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids – Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) SAF, a blended fuel and a reference Jet A-1 were measured in flight. A maximum reduction in non-volatile particle number emissions of ∼41 % compared to the reference Jet A-1 fuel was measured at low cruise engine power settings when using 100 % HEFA-SPK. The reduction decreases to ∼29 % for typical cruise engine settings and to ∼22 % at high cruise engine power settings. The size of non-volatile particles was slightly smaller for HEFA-SPK compared to Jet A-1. We show a comprehensive analysis of the hydrogen content of globally available fuels. Our results demonstrate the impact of the fuel composition in terms of its aromatic, hydrogen and sulfur content as well as of the effect of engine power settings on particle emissions. We demonstrate that the use of HEFA-SPK can significantly reduce particle emissions and thus contrail ice particles, and therefore can provide an aviation climate benefit.

Revealing the long-term development trajectory and peak scenarios of the urban residential building sector is crucial for formulating targeted emission reduction strategies and contributing to achieving the "Dual carbon" target. Given that, significant variables affecting carbon emissions from urban residential buildings (URBCE) at both macro and end-use building levels are identified in this study. Furthermore, an innovative dynamic simulation model is developed by integrating the Monte Carlo simulation model with the Kaya identity model, taking into account the uncertainties of the variables. Subsequently, the long-term evolution trajectories, potential emission peaks, and peak time of the URBCE close to 2060 in China's hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) zone are simulated. Results indicate that URBCE is expected to reach its peak of 272.43 Mt CO2 in 2040 under the baseline scenario. Through the dynamic simulation, the probable peak time of energy consumption in the HSCW zone is 2044 (±1.85), with a peak of 145.42 (±6.91) Mtce, and the possible peak time of carbon emissions is probably 2039 (±1.60), with a peak of 271.93 (±13.40) Mt CO2. According to dynamic sensitivity analysis, carbon emission factor, per capita residential space, and heating energy intensity can promote the peak size and timing. These findings lay a robust foundation for the formulation of regionally specific carbon reduction targets and initiatives.

The growing demand for sustainable and efficient gas separation technologies has prompted the exploration of advanced materials to enhance the gas permeability and selectivity. Polyethersulfone (PES) membranes are widely used in gas separation, gas upgrading, and clean energy production owing to their environmental friendliness and low cost. However, their gas permeability and selectivity can be further improved for commercial application. This study explored the incorporation of 10 wt. % of MIL-68(ln)-NH2 into PES membranes using a phase-inversion approach to enhance gas permeability and selectivity. The morphological, structural, and thermal properties of the resulting MOF/PES membrane were characterized using SEM, AFM, BET, XRD, FTIR, and TGA-DTG. Gas permeation experiments were conducted using different gases (CO2, N2, CH4, and H2) under different heating conditions (20-60 °C) to evaluate the gas permeability and selectivity of the MOF/PES membrane. The results showed that the incorporation of MOF into the mixed matrix membrane (MMMs) led to a 9% increase in porosity, 87% reduction in roughness, and 32% decrease in pore size compared to neat PES membranes. Significant changes in the morphology, crystallinity, and thermal stability were observed, with notable improvements of up to 22%. Moreover, the MOF/PES membrane exhibited high gas permeability (CO2 = 124656, N2 = 83650, CH4 = 159298, and H2 = 427075 Barrer) and selectivity (H2/N2= 5.7, H2/CO2= 4, CH4/N2= 2, and CH4/CO2= 1.7) for flammable gases. The optimal gas separation performance was observed at 20°C and 60°C for H2/N2 and H2/CO2 separation, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of MOF-based PES membranes for gas separation applications, particularly in H2 purification.

Abstract In pursuit of the 1.5°C climate threshold set by the Paris agreement above pre-industrial levels, achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 is identified as crucial. This necessitates leadership from the energy industries in formulating and executing sustainability development goals. Addressing all emissions sources is imperative for the success of this ambitious endeavor. The study investigates the application of an optimized dosage of a novel single-phase retarded acid (SPRA) fluid system to reduce the carbon footprint in stimulating horizontal extended reach wells targeting lower-permeability reservoirs in Middle East. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is commonly employed in matrix acidizing for creating wormholes in carbonate reservoirs, faces challenges in achieving the desired productivity index due to rapid reactions at high bottomhole static temperatures. The development of SPRA, an HCl-based fluid with enhanced retardation factor, demonstrated superior wormhole penetration depth through the synergistic action of two retarding agents. Employing stimulation modeling analysis, this work investigated optimized SPRA dosage and demonstrated its superior performance over regular HCl acid in post-stimulation skin reduction and wormhole generation. In most of the SPRA applications, the performance of the stimulation treatment is still higher compared to the straight acid, even at reduced volume. Subsequent history matching exercises confirmed the generation of longer wormholes and the effective reduction of skin across the entire lateral section of the well. Validation of simulation findings was achieved through flowback and production data collected after stimulation. The presented case studies demonstrate the implementation of the innovative SPRA fluid system, resulting in a significant reduction of up to 51%, equivalent to 274 metric tons of CO2 emissions throughout the entire value chain. This includes a 50% reduction in total acid volume and a substantial 67% decrease in flowback time. These findings underscore the considerable environmental and operational benefits of the SPRA fluid system in advanced carbonate acidizing of extended reach wells.

Abstract Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are among the most popular formations for large-scale geologic CO2 storage. While extensive research and characterization have been conducted on the geological structure and physical properties of many of these fields, the lack of field and core sample data related to reservoir flow and mechanical properties has hindered the assessment and modeling of CO2 storage, especially in offshore areas. In this study, we developed a coupled flow-geomechanical numerical model to evaluate the potential for storing CO2 in the soft sediments of the West Delta field of the Gulf of Mexico. The poroelastic parameters of the reservoir rocks were measured in the laboratory and the geological model of the reservoir was constructed based on the available seismic and well logs. The process of reservoir depletion was simulated to consider the effect of porosity reduction and permeability change. Pore volume multipliers were employed at the boundary to reach realistic pressure in the reservoir after depletion. A modified Cam-Clay model was used as the mechanical failure criterion to trace the porosity and formation subsidence. The results showed that the porosity reduced somewhat during the depletion and then increased during the CO2 injection. The porosity, however, did not fully recover after the injection process was completed. The maximum subsidence of the storage formation top reached almost 24 cm at the well location once the depletion completed. The pressure buildup at fault zones varied based on the vicinity of faults to the injection well, fault dip, dip direction, and CO2 injection rate. Sensitivity analysis using Fault Slip Potential (FSP) showed that various geomechanical parameters such as SHmax orientation, friction coefficient and dip of the fault influenced the probability of fault slip markedly. Assuming that faults are sealed, the pressure perturbation required to slip one of the major faults in the reservoir volume studied was lower than the calculated pressure buildup after the CO2 injection. The other two major faults are not predicted to have the potential for activation in any scenario. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct additional mechanical characterization particularly focusing on in-situ stress orientation and the transmissibility of faults as further work. This precautionary measure aims to mitigate the risk of fault activation during or after the injection phase.

Conventional usage of tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) via being supported on porous solid materials for carbon capture is susceptible to oxidative degradation during regeneration cycles. This study reports a novel method to synthesize a TEPA based solid polymer for efficient CO2 removal via direct air capture (DAC). The polymer was obtained through epoxy‐amine crosslinking reaction, leading to the transformation of liquid TEPA to a self‐supported solid polymer. The synthesis was conducted under ambient conditions via a one‐pot process with no waste products, which is aligned with green synthesis. The performance of the solid amine was evaluated in DAC under realistic conditions and compared with TEPA supported on SiO2 and zeolite 13X prepared through the conventional method. The solid TEPA amine exhibited a high CO2 uptake of 6.2 wt.% comparable to the conventional counterparts. More importantly, the solid TEPA amine demonstrated high resistance to oxidation during the accelerated ageing process at 80 °C in air for 24 h, whereas the two supported TEPA samples experienced severe degradation, with zeolite 13X supported TEPA incurring a reduction of 86.5% in CO2 capturing capacity after the ageing. This work sheds light on the novel usage of TEPA as an efficient solid amine for practical DAC operation.

Enhanced efforts in the transportation sector should be implemented to mitigate the adverse effects of CO2 emissions resulting from zoning-based planning paradigms. The concept of a 15-minute city, emphasizing proximity-based planning, holds promise in reducing unnecessary travel and progressing towards carbon neutrality. However, a critical research question remains inadequately explored: to what extent is the 15-minute city concept feasible for American cities? This paper presents a comprehensive framework to evaluate the 15-minute city concept using SafeGraph Point of Interest (POI) check-in data across 12 major American cities. Our findings suggest a prevailing reliance on cars among residents due to the spatial distribution of essential activities beyond convenient walking, cycling, and public transit distances. Nevertheless, there exists significant promise for realizing the 15-minute city vision, given that most residents' daily activities can be accommodated within a 15-minute radius by low-emission modes transportation modes. When comparing cities, it appears that achieving a 15-minute walking city is more feasible for metropolises like New York City, San Francisco, Boston, and Chicago, while proving to be challenging for cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix. In examing inter-group comparisons, neighborhoods with higher proportion of White residents and higher median incomes tend to have more accessible POIs, with a substantial percentage of activities concentrated within a 15-minute radius. This demographic also shows a greater propensity to fulfill daily activities through walking, cycling, or public transit trips within a 15-minute travel time, thus presenting a greater potential in CO2 reduction compared to African Americans. This study can offer policymakers insight into how far American cities are away from the 15-minute city concept. It also highlights the potential CO2 emissions reductions that could be achieved through successful implementation.

Ethane, one of the key components of shale gas, is a valuable feedstock for the production of syngas (CO + H2) via the CC bond cleavage during dry reforming of ethane (DRE) reaction. Selective catalysts are needed to direct this reaction pathway against the competing CH bond cleavage for ethylene formation. In this study, Fe, V and Rh oxides supported on TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method. The catalysts were tested for DRE with the main target of enhancing selectivity to syngas (CO and H2) and reducing byproducts (methane and ethylene) formation. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, NH3/CO2 temperature programmed desorption and H2-temperature programmed reduction. Temperature programmed oxidation was utilized to characterize the coke contents of the spent catalysts. The catalysts were evaluated for DRE reaction in a fixed-bed reactor at the temperature range from 500 °C to 650 °C and CO2/ethane ratio from 2.0 to 10.0 (mol/mol). It was found that ethane conversion over the three catalysts increased in the order Rh/TiO2 > Fe/TiO2 > V/TiO2. Rh/TiO2 catalyst exhibited > 99 % ethane conversion, 36 % and 61 % yields of H2 and CO, respectively, at 650 °C and CO2/ethane ratio of 5.0. The high conversion of ethane was mainly attributed to the enhanced dispersion of Rh oxides on the TiO2 support coupled with the balanced surface acidic and basic sites. The Rh catalyst facilitated CC bond dissociation of ethane thereby forming methyl intermediates which then reacted with adsorbed CO2, thereby enhancing syngas production during DRE reaction.

Abstract The study aims to quantitatively assess the risk of hydrate formation within the porous formation and its consequences to injectivity during storage of CO2 in depleted gas reservoirs considering low temperatures caused by the Joule Thomson (JT) effect and hydrate kinetics. The aim was to understand which mechanisms can mitigate or prevent the formation of hydrates. The key mechanisms we studied included water dry-out, heat exchange with surrounding rock formation, and capillary pressure. A compositional thermal reservoir simulator is used to model the fluid and heat flow of CO2 through a reservoir initially composed of brine and methane. The simulator can model the formation and dissociation of both methane and CO2 hydrates using kinetic reactions. This approach has the advantage of computing the amount of hydrate deposited and estimating its effects on the porosity and permeability alteration. Sensitivity analyses are also carried out to investigate the impact of different parameters and mechanisms on the deposition of hydrates and the injectivity of CO2. Simulation results for a simplified model were verified with results from the literature. The key results of this work are: (1) The Joule-Thomson effect strongly depends on the reservoir permeability and initial pressure and could lead to the formation of hydrates within the porous media even when the injected CO2 temperature was higher than the hydrate equilibrium temperature, (2) The heat gain from underburden and overburden rock formations could prevent hydrates formed at late time, (3) Permeability reduction increased the formation of hydrates due to an increased JT cooling, and (4) Water dry-out near the wellbore did not prevent hydrate formation. Finally, the role of capillary pressure was quite complex, where it reduced the formation of hydrates in certain cases and increased in other cases. Simulating this process with heat flow and hydrate reactions was also shown to present severe numerical issues. It was critical to select convergence criteria and linear system tolerances to avoid large material balance and numerical errors.

The first part of this research article documents the impact of the studied Regenerative Agriculture models in tea in respect of crop sustainability, pesticide load reduction and reduction of pest management cost. The findings indicated an increase (78 kg/ha) in crop productivity in the project area as against crop loss of 118 kg/ha in the non- project area during the same period. The finding also indicated a 52 to 77% reduction in the accumulated toxicity potential of the applied pesticides, improvement of soil quality indices and a 6.72% increase in the soil organic carbon stock. Most importantly, carbon assessment in terms of kg CO2 equivalent/ kg made tea (using ACFA version 1.0) indicated approximately 65 to 70 % lower footprint in the project area. The lowering of carbon footprint was due to a 20 to 30 % reduction in the chemical fertilizers along with improvement in carbon sequestration potential of the soil due to quality compost application and reduction of herbicides. The study indicated that Inhana Rational Farming (IRF) Technology can serve as an effective tool towards development of resource based Regenerative Agriculture Models that can ensure safe and low carbon tea cultivation without compromising crop yield and without increasing the cost of cultivation.

The rates of many electrocatalytic reactions can be strongly affected by the structure and dynamics of the electrochemical double layer, which in turn can be tuned by the concentration and identity of the supporting electrolyte’s cation. The effect of cations on an electrocatalytic process depends on a complex interplay between electrolyte components, electrode material and surface structure, applied electrode potential, and reaction intermediates. Although cation effects remain insufficiently understood, the principal mechanisms underlying cation-dependent reactivity and selectivity are beginning to emerge. In this Perspective, we summarize and critically examine recent advances in this area in the context of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2-to-CO conversion, which are among the most intensively studied and promising electrocatalytic reactions for the sustainable production of commodity chemicals and fuels. Improving the kinetics of the HER in base and enabling energetically efficient and selective CO2 reduction at low pH are key challenges in electrocatalysis. The physical insights from the recent literature illustrate how cation effects can be utilized to help achieve these goals and to steer other electrocatalytic processes of technological relevance.

Electromethanogenesis has emerged as a biological branch of Power-to-X technologies that implements methanogenic microorganisms, as an alternative to chemical Power-to-X, to convert electrical power from renewable sources, and CO2 into methane. Unlike biomethanation processes where CO2 is converted via exogenously added hydrogen, electromethanogenesis occurs in a bioelectrochemical set-up that combines electrodes and microorganisms. Thereby, mixed, or pure methanogenic cultures catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methane via reducing equivalents supplied by a cathode. Recent advances in electromethanogenesis have been driven by interdisciplinary research at the intersection of microbiology, electrochemistry, and engineering. Integrating the knowledge acquired from these areas is essential to address the specific challenges presented by this relatively young biotechnology, which include electron transfer limitations, low energy and product efficiencies, and reactor design to enable upscaling. This review approaches electromethanogenesis from a multidisciplinary perspective, putting emphasis on the extracellular electron uptake mechanisms that methanogens use to obtain energy from cathodes, since understanding these mechanisms is key to optimize the electrochemical conditions for the development of these systems. This work summarizes the direct and indirect extracellular electron uptake mechanisms that have been elucidated to date in methanogens, along with the ones that remain unsolved. As the study of microbial corrosion, a similar bioelectrochemical process with Fe0 as electron source, has contributed to elucidate different mechanisms on how methanogens use solid electron donors, insights from both fields, biocorrosion and electromethanogenesis, are combined. Based on the repertoire of mechanisms and their potential to convert CO2 to methane, we conclude that for future applications, electromethanogenesis should focus on the indirect mechanism with H2 as intermediary. By summarizing and linking the general aspects and challenges of this process, we hope that this review serves as a guide for researchers working on electromethanogenesis in different areas of expertise to overcome the current limitations and continue with the optimization of this promising interdisciplinary technology.

Abstract DNA variation analysis has become indispensable in many aspects of modern biomedicine, most prominently in the comparison of normal and tumor samples. Thousands of samples are collected in local sequencing efforts and public databases requiring highly scalable, portable, and automated workflows for streamlined processing. Here, we present nf-core/sarek 3, a well-established, comprehensive variant calling and annotation pipeline for germline and somatic samples. It is suitable for any genome with a known reference. We present a full rewrite of the original pipeline showing a significant reduction of storage requirements by using the CRAM format and runtime by increasing intra-sample parallelization. Both are leading to a 70% cost reduction in commercial clouds enabling users to do large-scale and cross-platform data analysis while keeping costs and CO2 emissions low. The code is available at https://nf-co.re/sarek.

High-performance catalysts are crucial for sustainable energy conversion and human health. However, the discovery of catalysts faces challenges due to the absence of efficient approaches to navigating vast and high-dimensional structure and composition spaces. In this study, we propose a high-throughput computational catalyst screening approach integrating density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). Within the BO framework, we propose an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model, UPNet, which enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional catalyst structures and achieves principled uncertainty quantification. Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy, facilitates interpretable feature extraction, and enables multicriteria design optimization, leading to significant reduction of computing power and time (10x reduction of required DFT calculations) in high-performance catalyst discovery.

The integration of digital technologies into forest management is crucial for the European Union’s Green Deal, the Forestry Strategy 2030, and Italy’s national forestry strategy, aiming to enhance governance and efficiency. However, sustainable forest management’s administrative aspects are often overlooked, despite the potential for digital tools to significantly improve environmental performance. Through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for a case study in the Umbria region, the research quantifies CO2 emissions associated with over-threshold forestry administrative procedures under both current and future digitalisation scenarios. Data were collected from legislative documents, interviews with forestry professionals, and emissions calculated according to ISO standards. The findings reveal a considerable reduction in CO2 emissions through digitalisation, from 75.07 kgCO2 to 38.14 kgCO2, with the implementation of the LIFE FOLIAGE project’s digital platform. This underscores digitalisation’s role in climate change mitigation, highlighting the significant, albeit modest per procedure, of the cumulative national impact. The main findings support further digitalisation in forest management as a method of increasing resource efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to the Green Deal’s and Italy’s forest sustainability goals.

Plant biomass is the largest renewable energy source. Republic of Srpska and the Republic of Serbia are among the top European countries in terms of the amount of available and unused biomass. Biogas is a product obtained by anaerobic decomposition of organic matter with the help of a complex of microorganisms in biogas power plants. All types of biomass which contains carbohydrates, proteins, fats, cellulose and hemicellulose can be used to obtain biogas. In theoretical terms, biogas can be produced from any substrate of organic origin. Also, there are possibilities to combine different types of substrates in one biogas plant. However, there are technical or economic limitations to this, which is why it is best to use several types of substrates of different origins in practice. Depending on the physical state, substrates are divided into solid and liquid. Liquid substrates include sewage and various wastewaters with a significant content of organic matter, while solid substrates include manure, various types of silage, food waste, solid organic municipal waste and other types of organic waste. The special importance of the production and use of biogas, as a type of renewable energy source, is the prevention of emissions of methane, a gas that increases the greenhouse effect (the intensity is 23 times higher than carbon dioxide). Also, the use of biogas as a fuel, most often produces electricity, and thus contributes to the realization of the set goals of greater use of renewable energy sources. An additional positive impact is the reduction of the spread of unpleasant odors, prevention of soil and groundwater pollution. Positive socioeconomic effects are also being achieved, rural development is being encouraged, and human and material resources are being used better at the local level. When studying the possibilities of biogas production, the quantities and prices of individual substrates are first considered. Their characteristics are analyzed, which determine the potential for biogas production, and thus the size of the biogas plant. Only a small part of the liquid and solid biomass in the fermentation plant is transformed into biogas. The rest of this process needs to be taken care of and used in an adequate way. The rest of the fermentation is aby-product in the production of biogas, and it is most often used as a fertilizer. It contains plant nutrients and organic matter, and by returning to agricultural areas, it contributes to preserving the fertility of the land. One of the ways to use the rest of the fermentation is to produce pellets or briquettes after separation and drying, and to use it as a solid fuel. Thanks to the development of new technologies for processing bio-waste into energy, the rate of increase in the use of alternative fuels is growing significantly.

CO2, a primary byproduct of anaerobic digestion, significantly reduces the calorific value of biogas, necessitating its enhancement through biogas upgrading to increase the CH4 content. The hydrogen oxidizing bacteria (HOB) Cupriavidus necator H16 demonstrates potential as a candidate for biological biogas upgrading due to its efficient CO2 capture and biosynthesis capabilities. Results indicated that in batch experiments, the concentration of CH4 could be elevated from 57.09 % to 98.46 % within 72 h by HOB, with a maximum CO2 assimilation efficiency of 27 mL/(L·h), meeting the requirements for biomethane. In bioreactor scale-up experiments, the CH4 concentration was increased to 94.22 % within 96 h. Beyond biogas upgrading, HOB also produces biomass usable as single cell protein (SCP), with its protein content varying between 43.75–70.83 % depending on the gas supply ratio. A total of 17 amino acids were identified, including eight essential amino acids. The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) indicated that the essential amino acid content in the HOB-based protein was well-balanced, closely approximating the quality of fishmeal and pork. A techno-economic analysis revealed that the net revenue from the anaerobic digestion process could be enhanced by 48.49 % using HOB-based biogas upgrading. In contrast, biogas upgrading processes based on hydrogenotrophic methanogens (HM) resulted in a 57 % reduction in net revenue. This study establishes a carbon flow pathway from organic solid waste to biomethane and utilizable protein sources, facilitating sustainable nutrient recovery. This approach not only enhances economic benefits but also reduces carbon emissions associated with the anaerobic digestion process.

Decarbonizing industrial processes is crucial for achieving net-zero targets, with process heat electrification emerging as a key pathway. Heat pumps (HPs) are pivotal for this transition. This study introduces a novel methodology to construct exemplar profiles for specific energy demands, representative profiles for various production capacities, and energy demand profiles at product, subsector, or sector levels, using Swiss chocolate production as a case study. Exemplar profiles offer flexibility in generating representative profiles based on production capacities, aiding in identifying integration opportunities and sizes for HPs. Sector-wide profiles provide a broader perspective, aiding in visualizing bottom-up sector-wide potential for HPs. Through analysis of four representative profiles for Swiss chocolate production, two potential standard heat pump (SHP) and three high-temperature heat pump (HTHP) integration opportunities were identified. Techno-economic data from 30 commercially available HPs were collected, assessing their cost-effectiveness for Swiss chocolate manufacturing using the levelized cost of saved energy and CO2 abatement. Factors such as company size and electricity and natural gas prices impact the cost-effectiveness of HP integration. Despite variations, HPs with real coefficients of performance above 2.6 generally prove cost-effective for average energy prices and current CO2 levies in Swiss chocolate production. Bottom-up estimations of HP integration potentials using product-specific energy demand profiles suggest a potential reduction of CO2 emissions by up to 56% and an improvement in energy efficiency by up to 28% in Swiss chocolate production.

Abstract Sulfur Recovery unit is an essential part in Oil Refinery and gas treatment unit, it consist of MDEA enrichment unit, Claus Unit, Tail gas treatment unit and thermal incineration unit. Incineration process is used in order to make the process effluents releasable into the atmosphere. In which the hazardous and pollutant sulfur containing compounds are converted to sulfur dioxide. The case study of this work is about an existing thermal incinerator in Sulfur Recovery Unit, its streams are mainly consist of combustion air, MDEA waste gas, tail gas and fuel gas. Feed stream temperatures will be maximize more than current operating temperature in order to reduce fuel gas consumption and CO2 emission as well. The idea is utilized the produce high pressure steam from its Waste heat Boiler WHB to preheat feed stream including combustion air 40°C and tail gas 140°C and MDEA waste gas 40°C. in this study the target preheating temperature is 290°C for each stream. PROMAX Software is used as simulation tool, three scenarios have been chosen including maximize tail gas temperature, combustion air temperature and finally waste gas temperature. All input field date have been collected from operating system called distribution control system (DCS). Result show remarkable reduction of fuel gas consumption and CO2 emission for three scenarios (12.5%, 26 % and 36% respectively) comparing to existing situation for the case study. So installing high pressure steam pre-heaters on feed streams is strongly recommended for this case study in order to reduce operation cost and CO2 emission.

Abstract A large amount of toxic smoke and heat generated by the combustion of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) poses a significant threat to human fire escape evacuation. This work aims to use γ-ray to prepare e-MXene@Ag hybrid flame-retardant materials by the method of in-situ reduction, and EVA composites are prepared by melt blending to reduce the smoke and toxic gases produced during combustion significantly. Compared with pure EVA, the total heat release, total smoke release, and the production rate of CO and CO2 produced by the combustion of EVA composite with 1wt% e-MXene@Ag1.0 decreased by 30.3%, 33.3%, 18.2%, and 20.1% respectively, while the content of residue increased by 907.4%. The fire hazard reduction of EVA composite materials was due to the physical barrier, catalytic carbonization and adsorption of the e-MXene@Ag1.0 hybrid. In addition, e-MXene@Ag1.0 can also further increase the mechanical properties of EVA composites due to its own "multi-contact point limit structure."&#xD;

Adaptive management is the basic concept of forest ecosystem management strategy in conditions of increased risks. Therefore, there is a need to develop key theories and information on which adaptive forest management is based. Adaptive management of forest resources has become the premise of modern forestry development strategies in Europe, and the main ideas about this method of management have developed primarily on the knowledge of forest ecology. Adaptive management is the monitoring of activities (monitoring) in order to adjust future activities to the desired effects of management. The main causes that have influenced the application of adaptive management in forestry are related to strategic forestry principles and global challenges. Forest ecosystems are exposed to natural and social risks that cause disturbances and adverse effects of management. In order to reduce the risk for the realization of strategic goals in forestry, there is a need to develop management mechanisms for the adaptation of forest ecosystems. Global activities, in addition to the implementation of measures for mitigation (mitigation) of climate change, include measures for adaptation (adaptation) to climate change, especially for underdeveloped countries and developing countries, in order to ensure sustainable development and mitigate the negative consequences for forest ecosystems. It is necessary to go beyond the management framework based mainly on a simplified balance between volume, increment and stature, and to systematically integrate the results of all interventions and external influences on forests in order to improve the condition of forests and adapt to changes. The best indicator of endangerment of species and forest plant communities is the reduction of their range and biodiversity. Most climate models predict large changes within forests due to the high rates of climate change and the limitations of adaptation of many tree species to climatic extremes. Forests are slowly adapting to new conditions, especially due to increasing temperatures, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations and increasing nitrate deposition. The most influential climate variable for forests is the one that determines wind disturbance. The key to forest management in risk conditions lies in increasing the participation of more resistant species adapted to future climatic conditions, ie in promoting the diversity of tree species and their provenances and the heterogeneity of structural forms of forests. To create such forests, it isnecessary to cultivate forests whose characteristics are close to natural and potential forest communities for appropriate habitat conditions and indigenous species. Adaptive forest management implies a multidisciplinary approach and a four-phase cycle of strengthening understanding of complex biophysical, socioeconomic and political systems with constant monitoring (ecosystem control) and acquiring new empirical knowledge whose positive effects are applied in practice. The advantage of adaptive management is that plans and activities are adjusted based on the results of monitoring in the newly created unforeseen conditions.

Abstract Polymer injection projects need to reduce CO2 emissions, material demand for facilities, water use, and waste to compete as viable solutions in the energy transition. Steel production process is the main contributor to CO2 emission. To address this issue, we have embarked on reducing in 50% our mobile expansion concept, which replaces conventional massive injection plants with reusable ones storing energy in the subsurface. Here we propose to design a polymer injection project that is in line with circular economic concepts. We reduce the size of the needed facilities and reuse them by storing energy in the formation during injection periods (On) in half patterns and releasing it during shut-in periods (Off) in the other half of patterns. This mechanism is based on the high rock compressibility of the fluvial system in Manantiales Behr. Coupling the high rock compressibility with an On-Offcyclical injection strategy makes the system behave analogue to a spring-mass system that can store and release energy and has resonance conditions. We tested the idea in a conceptual simulator model, then in a sector model and finally, we implemented a pilot in four patterns that already had an oil response baseline by continuous polymer injection. Now, We expanded it to 14 patterns. We reduced more than 50% of the needs in steel consumption and the energy requirement for constructing and mounting a polymer injection unit. These savings amount to 170 to 405 tCO2 depending on the source of the steel which represents about 0.6% of the annual CO2 reduction per year in London. The incremental recovery factor is 19% incremental almost the same as continuous polymer injection. The reservoir simulations carried out show similarincremental recovery factors with this methodology than those that would be achieved with a massive injection for the same injection wells, achieving slightly lower production peaks, but with less decline and with polymer consumption 30% less than in the case of mass injection.On-Off injection strategy allowed us to feed a greater number of injectors with the same modular plant and reduce polymer consumption by not injecting massively into all the wells of the project at the same time. By Implementing this technology, we managed to reduce the environmental impact by lowering the number of modular injection plants needed and we improved the economics of the project by reducing both the CAPEX and OPEX involved. This process has a significant impact on all polymer flooding projects that are being undertaken in fluvial Complex Two of Comodoro Rivadavia Formation. Moreover, our mobile expansion concept with modular reusable plants (SPE-200355-MS) targets the installation of ten plants per year. Therefore, the potential reduction in emissions could be ten times greater.

It remains unclear why type-II antiferromagnetic order with a propagation vector along a trigonal axis and a tetragonal Jahn–Teller deformation coexist in a low-temperature phase of CoO. Nanocrystals generally have a lower magnetic transition temperature but crystal size reduction does not affect structural transition locally induced by a crystal field. On this basis, we investigated the magnetic and structural properties of CoO nanocrystals. Both transition temperatures were equally reduced in nanocrystals, which indicates that magnetic order triggers the tetragonal deformation. This observation is consistent with a model that the Jahn–Teller deformation is assisted by spin–orbit energy splitting of t2g electrons in the high-spin Co2+ ion, proposed by Kugel and Khomskii.

Mineral carbonation provides a way to increase the recycling of concrete waste in added-value products, and contributes to the principles of the circular economy. At present, most concrete waste is still downcycled. The high water absorption of recycled concrete aggregates, among other factors, impedes their recycling in the concrete industry. The quality of coarse recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) can, however, be enhanced by carbonation. Even when starting with high-grade RCA obtained from a selective demolition process, the carbonation process can decrease the water absorption of the RCA to as low as 3.0%. Concrete with a 50% replacement rate of carbonated RCA can be produced without a significant compressive strength reduction. The research further shows that carbonation can be performed at atmospheric pressure and low CO2 concentrations (e.g., 10%). The recycled concrete fines (RCF, 0–4 mm) in combination with 25% stainless steel slag were used to make zero-cement hollow blocks (39 × 19 × 9 cm) by carbonation curing without using any hydraulic binder. The hollow blocks have a compressive strength of 15.4 MPa at the lab scale. Both technologies were demonstrated on a pilot scale. In both processes, CO2 is immobilized in the resulting construction product. The developed production processes use less primary raw materials and cause less greenhouse-gas emissions than the production of traditional concrete products.

Reppe carbonylation of acetylene is an atom-economic and non-petroleum approach to synthesize acrylic acid and acrylate esters, which are key intermediates in the textile, leather finishing, and polymer industries. In the present work, a noble metal-free Co@SiO2 catalyst was prepared and evaluated in the methoxycarbonylation reaction of acetylene. It was discovered that pretreatment of the catalyst by different reductants (i.e., C2H2, CO, H2, and syngas) greatly improved the catalytic activity, of which Co/SiO2-H2 demonstrated the best performance under conditions of 160 °C, 0.05 MPa C2H2, 4 MPa CO, and 1 h, affording a production rate of 4.38 gMA+MP gcat−1 h−1 for methyl acrylate (MA) and methyl propionate (MP) and 0.91 gDMS gcat−1 h−1 for dimethyl succinate (DMS), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra of CO adsorption (CO-DRIFTS) measurements revealed that an H2 reduction decreased the size of the Co nanoparticles and promoted the formation of hollow architectures, leading to an increase in the metal surface area and CO adsorption on the catalyst. The hot filtration experiment confirmed that Co2(CO)8 was generated in situ during the reaction or at the pre-activation stage, which served as the genuine active species. Our work provides a facile and convenient approach to the in situ synthetization of Co2(CO)8 for a Reppe carbonylation reaction.

Abstract The Postle field is located in Texas County in the Oklahoma Panhandle and has been waterflooded since 1960 and CO2 flooded since 1996. In 2022, a streamline-based flood management workflow was initiated to optimize flood performance and improve cashflow. Initial recommendations included cutting existing CO2 purchases by 50%, generating a savings of $7.5MM. In 2023, due to a deterioration in profitability, the field went through several iterations of cost-cutting measures culminating in the elimination of purchased CO2 and a reduction in workover job. The loss of purchased CO2 effectively reduced the volume of injection volumes by about 20%, reducing the VRR from 1.5 to 1.2. This reduced the processing rate in the reservoir from 7% to 5% per year. This work outlines a streamline-based flood management approach, and results achieved from the implementation of this new workflow. The new flood management approach was adopted across the entire Postle field that consists of 4 units. This encompasses nearly 250 producers and 100 injectors. A streamline surveillance model was built for the entire field across the 3 main producing zones. The results from the surveillance model were used to identify interwell connections between producers and injectors. This allowed the injection impact or value of each injector to be properly quantified. The injection efficiencies were used to allocate the limited volume of CO2, where higher efficiency injectors were allocated more CO2. WAG parameters were also calibrated based on rate targets from the surveillance optimization module (floodOPT). The combination of rate targets and ranking of injectors based on efficiencies were used to determine WAG cycle lengths, WAG ratios and injection volumes. The injector efficiencies (or volume of oil associated with each injector) proved an accurate measure to the engineering teams to accurate rank injectors in order of priority for workovers and determine whether an injector was worth repairing or plugging. The initial results from the streamline model was obtained in 2022 and validated and verified with other measurements. The surveillance model produced a connectivity map between injectors and producers (FMAP) that was consistent with flow path directions from a tracer study in 2021. Furthermore, the interwell connectivities in the model across multiple patterns were consistent with well connections from production-injection data and field staff experience. This highlighted the challenge with using classical geometrical pattern allocations that are time-invariant, compared to dynamic patterns that are influenced by geology and rate. The model also flagged underperforming injectors i.e. injectors with low efficiencies that were in relatively immature areas. These injectors were known to have vertical conformance issues. The streamline model-based recommendations continued to be used through 2023. The models were updated with production and injection data quarterly. Injection rates were adjusted based on the updated injection efficiencies calculated from floodOPT with constraints based on the availability of injection volumes, well injectivity limitations, well failures and field facility limits. WAG parameters including cycle lengths and WAG ratios were set based on injection efficiency, area maturity and available CO2. Injectors with higher efficiency and lower maturity were allocated lower WAG ratios. CO2 allocation became more critical when purchases were eliminated in 2023. When the new flood management workflow was implemented, the field oil cut declines were approximately 14% pa with increasing GOR and WOR. Over a period of 6 months, favorable results were seen in these trends; GOR and WOR trends stabilized and reduced, and the oil cut decline was mitigated to less than 10% pa. Despite losing 20% of the available CO2 for injection, the oil rate in multiple patterns increased. The impact of the oil rate increase was difficult to observe on a field level because of multiple well failures and operational challenges. Nevertheless, field oil rate declines reduced from 14% pa to 9% pa; at the current decline rate, the improved management would yield an additional 300,000 bbls of oil production.

The demand for renewable energy resources has increased significantly in recent years due to environmental concerns. The hybrid energy system is proposed as a solution to meet this demand. In this work, the HOMER software is used to design and optimize a hybrid model for electricity and hydrogen coproduction. The proposed model consists of various green energy resources such as solar PV, wind for hydrogen production. The system includes a green hydrogen storage facility while excess electricity is produced from renewable sources. The cost of energy production is found to be $0.08/kWh, which is competitive with conventional fossil fuel-based energy generation. In addition, the system has a lower environmental impact, with a 72% reduction in CO2 emissions as compared to regular energy production methods.

The diversity of manufacturing processes is staggering, and they contribute to various degrees of carbon emissions too, depending on the materials processed and the parameters of machine tools and equipment used. Most of the time, production managementManagement is focused on optimization of the machine use and the reduction of nonconformities, while at the same time keeping a high level of productivity and just-in-time connectivity within the global supply chains. In more complex situations, the sustainabilitySustainability factor is also taken into consideration, in terms of materials use, scrap and waste, emissions and spills, and human resource involvement. We aim to complete these approaches with a methodology for the identification of the level of CO2 emissionsCO2 emissions on small-scale machining processes, in order to further develop a mathematical model of enterprise-wide contributions to carbon emissions, focusing on the decarbonization of the economy.

In today's life, humans compromise with nature while evolving into a more advanced species. One of the main effects of that advancement is air pollution. Air pollution seriously threatens human health, the environment, and the general quality of life worldwide. A quantitative analysis of air quality was the purpose of developing the Air Quality Index (AQI), an indexing approach. The air quality index is computed using measurements for particulate matter (PM), PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, CO2, NH3, and other contaminants. Agnihotra (Yagya) is a method of environmental purification mentioned in the Hindu sculpture (The Book Yagya Vimarsh, written by Dr. Ramprakash, talks about the air pollution reduction method). This paper discusses the Vayu Vishleshan framework for monitoring air quality in the presence of Agnihotra (Yagya). This study is divided into two processes. The first one is AQI monitoring, and the second is AQI reduction. AQI Monitoring covers sensing particulate matter (PM), PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO and performing analysis over the AQI data before, during, and following Agnihotra (Yagya). According to analysis, there is an approximate 6–7% decrease in CO levels and an approximate 10–12% decrease in PM levels following Agnihotra.

Abstract With the current market fluctuations trend outlook, it is severely more challenging to prove the viability of the major greenfield oil and gas field development. Various key factors in the design are identified to be able to contribute to effectiveness of the facilities concept towards achieving fit of purpose design in terms of cost, safety, and reliability. It is paramount deep dive on this study due to the facilities that mostly contributes 50% of the overall development cost and has significant impact on the project economics. Since offshore greenfield developments the cost are generally high, hence, It is paramount for the Field Development Team to find a balance between Facilities cost with strategy to design for GHG emission reduction. Since new upstream project are required to comply with zero flaring & zero venting approach, it is crucial for the project to develop surface facilities to capture the GHG emission in any one of the options i.e., Gas Disposal, Gas Injection for Reservoir Pressure Maintenance or team can also consider any Carbon Abatement Technology. Surface facility is designed to filter the CO2 in the hydrocarbon production at offshore CPP (Central Processing Platform) and re-inject the CO2 back into the formation via a dedicated gas injector well. The selection & optimization of surface equipment CO2 are of critical in ensuring that project will still be economical despite with additional cost invested to reinject the CO2 back into the reservoir. This paper would provide more insight into the study and analysis to be considered during designing new facilities development in a field with high CO2 that integrate development wells producing hydrocarbon and lesson learnt and best practices that are valuable for future project with similar scope. This paper goes beyond mere exposition and meticulously details the established process flow, deftly managed to effectively guide the Field Development Plan (FDP) team in formulating the most cost-effective development concept. This concept not only aligns with the company's aspirations for a sustainable field development plan towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions but also promises positive economic outcomes. Within these pages, the team not only narrates but vividly demonstrates a meticulously selected case or concept deemed as the most cost-effective among all the iterations evaluated. This chosen facilities concept doesn't stand in isolation; rather, it serves as a beacon, illuminating the pathway for other greenfield projects grappling with similar challenges in their fields—be it high contaminants or waxy crudes. It exemplifies the practical realization of an economical and sustainable Field Development Plan, harmoniously meeting the company's ambition of net-zero carbon emissions while ensuring positive economic projections. The insights shared within this paper are poised to resonate with and inspire a broader spectrum of projects facing comparable challenges, fostering a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and economically sound field development practices.

Atomically precise nanoclusters (APN) are more useful for detecting the reaction mechanisms and active sites of the electrocatalysis process at the molecular or atomic level. The atomically precise metal nanoclusters are used as efficient catalysts in most electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reactions, electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions, fuel cell reactions, degradation reactions of contaminants, and electrochemical synthesis of ammonia. The various factors influencing the electrocatalytic properties of metal nanoclusters include the core, charge of the metal, metal atom distribution, kinds of protection ligands, substrates, and the detailed structure of the metal nanoclusters. The design of fuel cells is challenging because of the formulation and design of effective electrocatalysts for the slow cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Amongst the differently designed electrocatalysts, presently the atomically precise electrocatalysts (APE), like single-atom, multi-atom, and dual-atom clusters, have been emphasized by researchers because of their outstanding effectiveness in atom utilization and catalytic performance. The nanoparticle of metal now captures a vital position in the catalytic activity of electrocatalysis. Therefore, APN shows the properties of metal nanoclusters passivated by ligands and is today considered an effective class of model catalyst that provides great potential in the field of catalysis research.

Reducing the energy consumption of hydrogen liquefaction process is an urgent issue to improve the economy of liquid hydrogen transportation. A novel large-scale hydrogen liquefaction system, with a capacity of 100 TPD, is proposed in this paper. The pre-cooling system is composed of a mixed-refrigerant (MR) refrigeration cycle and a CO2–NH3 cascade refrigeration cycle. Due to the auxiliary pre-cooling effect of the CO2–NH3 cascade cycle, temperature of the pre-cooled hydrogen can be as low as −200.9 °C. A modified MR Joule Brayton cycle with an additional compressor is used as the cryogenic system to cool the hydrogen from −200.9 °C to −252.2 °C. Besides, a four-stage ortho-to-para conversion (OPC) process is utilized. Performance of the novel system is investigated and optimized using the Aspen HYSYS software. According to the results, the lowest specific energy consumption (SEC) of the proposed process is 6.15 kWh/kgLH2 and the exergy efficiency is as high as 67.4%. Based on the energy analysis, the best system coefficient of performance is 0.1751 with a 96.3% of p-H2 in the liquid hydrogen. In addition, compared to the initial conceptual system, the proposed system exhibits significant performance enhancements, a 20% reduction in SEC and a 27.9% increase in exergy efficiency. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the impact of refrigerant composition and hydrogen pressure on the system, resulting in the determination of the optimal proportions of refrigerant components and the optimal inlet pressure. Results of the study can provide theoretical reference for the further development of large-scale hydrogen liquefaction technology.

The scientific aim of this article is to elucidate the effects of various tillage practices on soil properties and crop yields; additionally, it seeks to highlight the significant potential of specific farming systems in enhancing soil organic carbon, thereby positively influencing CO2 emissions from soil. In the experimental station of Vytautas Magnus University, Kaunas District, Lithuania (54°52′50″ N and 23°49′41″ E), a long-term field experiment has been established since 1999, and studies have been conducted since 2003. The soil of the experimental site is classified as Epieutric Endocalcaric Planosol (Endoclayic, Episiltic, Aric, Drainic, Endoraptic, Uterquic), according to the World Reference Base (WRB, 2022). Two primary factors were assessed. Factor A incorporated practices of straw removal versus straw chopping and spreading, while Factor B evaluated a spectrum of tillage techniques: conventional deep plowing and two no-tillage practices, one of which involved cover crops. The findings from this long-term study highlight a significant increase in SOC stocks across all treatments over the 20-year period. Notably, the no-tillage practices, coupled with the spreading of chopped straw, demonstrated the most substantial growth in SOC levels, particularly in the top 0–10 cm soil layer. This trend underscores the effectiveness of minimizing soil disturbance and incorporating organic matter in boosting SOC stocks. The different tillage systems influence CO2 emissions from soil. Initially, direct sowing into uncultivated land, both with and without cover crops, led to a notable reduction in CO2 emissions compared to conventional plowing. However, this effect was found to vary over the growth cycle of the plant, highlighting the dynamic interaction between tillage practices, soil properties, and environmental conditions. Collaborative research efforts that involve farmers, scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders are crucial for the development of holistic, practical, scalable solutions that enhance the sustainability and productivity of agricultural systems. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable agriculture, providing insights for farmers, agronomists, and policymakers in their quest to promote environmentally sound and productive agricultural systems.

A critical analysis of alkali-activated cements as sustainable materials demonstrates their advantages compared to traditional Portland cements. It also makes it possible to identify the main drivers of alkaline activation in the production of cements for mortars and concretes used in repairing building construction. These materials are effective for repairing, retrofitting, and rehabilitation of damaged structures (pavement, bridge decks, tunnel structures, highways, airport runways, berths, piers, coast-protecting structures, dams, etc.). Technical drivers are based on cements with high physical and mechanical properties and durability, due to a highly effective hydrate composition in cement stone. This has benefits due to a lack of free Ca(OH)2, ettringite, and highly basic calcium silicates in the presence of low basic calcium silicates and zeolite-like hydration products. Environmental drivers are associated with the reduction or elimination of non-renewable raw materials from Portland cement clinker, and the high clinker efficiency resulting from the activation and application of industrial by-products and wastes, as well as seawater. Commercial drivers are justified by low specific energy consumption in cement production, reductions in costs for exceeding CO2, SO2, and mercury emission quotas, and a low cost of raw materials, due to the use of a high proportion of by-products, such as fuel ashes, metallurgical slags, red mud, silica, ceramic powder, etc.

Abstract We describe how increased root cortical parenchyma wall width (CPW) can improve tolerance to drought stress in maize by reducing the metabolic costs of soil exploration. Significant variation (1.0 to 5.0 µm) for CPW was observed in maize germplasm. The functional-structural model RootSlice predicts that increasing CPW from 2 to 4 µm is associated with ca. 15% reduction in root cortical cytoplasmic volume, respiration rate, and nitrogen content. Analysis of genotypes with contrasting CPW grown with and without water stress in the field confirms that increased CPW is correlated with ca. 32 to 42% decrease in root respiration. Under water stress in the field, increased CPW is correlated with 125% increased stomatal conductance, 325% increased leaf CO2 assimilation rate, 73 to 78% increased shoot biomass, and 92 to 108% increased yield. CPW was correlated with leaf mesophyll midrib parenchyma wall width, indicating pleiotropy. GWAS analysis identified candidate genes underlying CPW. OpenSimRoot modeling predicts that a reduction in root respiration due to increased CPW would also benefit maize growth under suboptimal nitrogen, which requires empirical testing. We propose CPW as a new phene that has utility under edaphic stress meriting further investigation.

Submarine mud-volcanoes are globally distributed in the plate convergent margins1,2. The mud-volcanism transports deep-sourced fluids and hydrocarbons to the seafloor3, which upward supply often supports chemosynthetic benthic life and microbial communities that play significant ecological roles in biogeochemical carbon cycle4,5. Yet, geochemical and microbiological characteristics of the deep mud-volcano subsurface remain largely unknown. Here, we studied an active submarine mud-volcano in the Nankai Trough by drilling down to 200 meters from the summit. Cell count and molecular analyses indicate that relatively small (102~105 cells/cm3) but phylogenetically diverse microbial populations are present throughout the cored sediment. In the pore water, carbon isotopic compositions of bicarbonate and acetate are notably 13C-enriched up to the maximum value of +40 and -25, respectively. High concentrations of hydrogen (up to 1,800 nM) are observed, suggesting a thermodynamically feasible condition for microbial acetogenesis via CO2 reduction. Radiotracer experiments consistently showed that acetogenesis activities are generally 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than those of methanogenesis. These data indicate that the deep biosphere in the submarine mud-volcano is characterized by tectonic and sedimentolgoical regimes of the oceanic accretionary wedge, and hence different from the stratified sedimentary biosphere.

Governments globally have prioritized carbon neutrality and reduction as a response to the intensifying menace of climate change. These objectives align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG-13), stressing the imperative to take decisive action on climate change. Thus, this study aimed to assess the impact of oil price uncertainty, economic policy uncertainty, financial development, and renewable energy on ecological proxies (CO2 emissions, Ecological footprint, and Load capacity factor) using quarterly data spanning from 1990 to 2019. As far as the investigators are aware, this is the first empirical analysis examining the impact of oil price uncertainty on ecological quality. To achieve this, we employed advanced techniques, including quantile-on-quantile KRLS (QQKRLS) and quantile-on-quantile Granger causality (QQGC), to analyse the interconnections among these variables. The findings based on the load capacity factor exposed that renewable energy, economic policy uncertainty, financial development, and economic growth positively contribute to ecological quality, whereas oil price uncertainty has a detrimental effect. Additionally, as a measure of robustness, CO2 emissions and ecological footprint were included in the analysis, demonstrating comparable outcomes when assessed alongside the load capacity factor model. Furthermore, QQGC results demonstrated that all regressors significantly forecast ecological quality. Drawing from the findings, policy interventions ought to prioritize incentivizing the adoption of renewable energy, mitigating economic policy uncertainty, fostering financial development, and stimulating economic growth as pivotal strategies for augmenting ecological quality. Furthermore, integrating measures to alleviate oil price uncertainty stands as a crucial imperative for ensuring environmental sustainability.

Building materials are responsible for significant CO2 emissions and energy consumption, both during production and operational phases. Earth as a building material offers a valuable alternative to conventional materials, as it naturally provides high hygrothermal comfort and air quality even with passive conditioning systems. However, disadvantages related to high density, conductivity, and wall thickness prevent its effective inclusion in the mainstream. This research explores enhancing the thermophysical properties of compressed earth blocks (CEBs) by using locally sourced natural materials. The study is framed in the Portuguese context and the natural materials involved are wheat straw (WS) as a by-product of wheat harvesting, cork granules (CGs) from bottle caps, and ground olive stone (GOS) residues from olive oil production. Blocks were produced with different mixtures of these materials and the thermal response was examined in a hot box apparatus. Best results include a 20 and 26% reduction in thermal conductivity for mixtures with 5v.% CG and 10v.% GOS, respectively, and an associated reduction in bulk density of 3.8 and 5.4%. The proposed approach therefore proves to be effective in improving the key thermophysical characteristics of CEBs. The article includes a comparative analysis of the experimental data from this study with those from the literature. The study contributes to the growing knowledge of sustainable materials, providing insights for researchers and practitioners looking for innovative solutions for low-carbon and energy-efficient materials.

The use of phase change materials in building envelopes has attracted the attention of researchers to minimize cooling and heating loads and for thermal comfort regulation. A research gap was found regarding the numerical analysis of lightweight roofs with PCM considering conjugate heat transfer. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the thermal performance of a lightweight hollow concrete roof with a phase change material (PCM) in a subhumid climate. Three roof configurations with two PCMs were numerically analyzed through computational fluid dynamics. Simulations were conducted using the open-source code OpenFoam and were verified and validated with good agreements proving the confidence of the proposed methodology for building envelope design purposes. The roof configurations with fully-filled PCM exhibited the best thermal behavior, reaching higher temperature reductions between 1.4 °C to 2.0 °C, respectively, and reductions of indoor peak heat flux by approximately 47 % compared with the reference case. The roof fully-filled with an inorganic PCM with a melting temperature of 25 °C was the most energy-efficient roof configuration because it achieved the highest energy savings of 65.5 %, lowest electricity costs of 0.85–4.33 USD m−2, and lowest CO2 emissions of approximately 18.31 kgCO2e m−2. The results demonstrated that the utilization of PCM into lightweight concrete roofs in subhumid climates is very promising.

Bangladesh faces challenges with global carbon emissions and energy security due to its heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels. This paper investigates the techno-economic viability of photovoltaic (PV) systems for achieving net-zero energy in academic buildings as a sustainable alternative. The study evaluates the performance of PV systems based on factors including annual energy production, capacity factor, net-zero energy potential, self-consumption/sufficiency ratio, renewable fraction, levelized cost of energy, net present value (NPV), payback period, profitability index (PI), and carbon emission reduction. The results indicate that optimally sized PV systems can generate net positive energy: 6.18 MWh for universities, 4.04 MWh for high schools, and 3.62 MWh for primary schools. Economic viability was assessed under two billing methods (net metering and all buy/sell), and all cases showed positive NPV and PI values greater than 1. Decarbonization analysis revealed significant reductions in CO2 emissions: 2026.5 tons for universities, 18.9 tons for high schools, and 9.7 tons for primary schools. Finally, a sensitivity analysis assessed the optimal PV system size for seven other regions in Bangladesh. These findings suggest that the widespread adoption of PV systems in academic buildings can play a crucial role in achieving net-zero energy, contributing significantly to the government and policymakers' pursuit of sustainable development goals.

Ferromagnetic metallic cobalt and nickel nanoparticles were synthesized by intramolecular metal-hydrazine ligand oxidation reduction reaction in basic media and the solid state. Nickel nanoparticles Ni1 and Ni2 are obtained from two complexes, Ni(N2H4)2(C2O4) and Ni(N2H4)2(HCO2)2, respectively. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) data show pure fcc crystal structures of nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed both Ni1 and Ni2 nanoparticles have agglomerated sphere morphologies. The crystallite size estimated by using the Scherer method for Ni1 and Ni2 were 18.7 and 6.2 nm. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) data show the coercivity of metallic nickel samples Ni1 and Ni2 are 50 and 153 Oe, respectively. Both nanoparticles cause an increase in the temperature of water under applied alternative magnetic field and showed specific loss power (SLP) of 70 W/g and 104.8 W/g, respectively. The same method is used in preparation of cobalt nanoparticles from two complexes, Co(N2H4)2(C2O4) and Co(N2H4)2(HCO2)2. XRD analysis data show both nanoparticles have hcp crystal structure. SEM images show nanosheet structure with sheet thickness of 10 to 30 nm. Coercivity of Co1 and Co2 nanoparticles obtained by VSM and Hc are 182 and 171 Oe, respectively. In spite of high coercivity in both Co1 and Co2 nanoparticles, the magnetic hyperthermia heating effects are not observed in practice and specific loss power (SLP) is zero.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to feedstocks competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) immobilized onto carbon driven by π-π interaction represents a classical type of heterogeneous molecular catalyst for CO2R. However, the impacts of π conjugation on the electrocatalysis have not been clarified. Herein, the electrochemical properties of CoPc were investigated by comparison of its analogue to 2,3-naphthalocyanine cobalt (NapCo) having extended π conjugation. It is found that CoPc is redox-active on carbon to provide low oxidized Co sites for improving the CO2R activity and selectivity, while NapCo on carbon turned out to be redox-inert leading to lower performance. In addition, the redox-mediated mechanism for CO2R on CoPc tends to operate with increasing electrolyte alkalinity, which further enhances the reaction selectivity. We speculated that moderate π conjugation allows the redox-mediated mechanism on CoPc, which is critical to promote CO2R performance while depressing the competing HER.

Soil formation is a long-lasting natural process, but quickly destroyed by degradation which leads to decrease in soil potential, as a condition for the survival of mankind and the living world on the planet. In order to increase yield of cultivated plants and food production in the second half of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, agrochemicals - chemical fertilizers and pesticides were intensively applied, which led to deterioration of the dynamic balance of soil ecosystems and water pollution. Surface layer of agricultural arable land is loose and often insufficiently protected by vegetation during the year, and it is exposed to water and wind erosion. In addition to natural, anthropogenic factors contribute to the reduction of agricultural land and the reduction of the quality of arable land. Although it is the most important natural resource of mankind, excessive or irresponsible use of soil leads to a decrease in its productivity and finally permanent degradation. The increase in the use of artificial fertilizers, manures and slurry produced on farms, and changes in land use are the main factors causing progressive increase of nitrates and nitrites in water in last 25 years. During intensive use, the fertility of the soil changes - mainly caused by depletion due to plant yields and loss of plant nutrients, acidification or alkalization and reduction of organic matter content. Soil fertility is strongly correlated with soil quality and represents the ability of soil to enable cultivated plants to optimally accumulate biomass with minimal use of manure and mineral fertilizers. Concern for soil, its natural resources and biological divergence is becoming the subject of interest of an increasing part of human population, and not just the ones engaged in agriculture, and thus becomes the responsibility of a society as a whole. Due to his activities, most often agricultural production, men can increase or decrease the fertility of the soil. Protecting the soil from erosion and increasing the amount of organic matter in the soil are particularly important measures in the sustainable management of agricultural soil. Incorporating crop residues increases the content of organic matter in the soil, and the application of green manure and cover crops in the crop rotation protects the soil from erosion and improves its physical, chemical and biological properties. Ploughing crop residues increases the content of nutrients, organic matter and humus, and microbiological activity in the soil, improves water, air and physical properties of the soil, improves soil structure, which consequently contributes to increase in soil fertility and ultimately yields. Harvest residues are a valuable product due to high energy content necessary for microorganisms, which should not be removed, but used on the plot by ploughing. The nutrients in the crop residues are at the place of their application, transport is unnecessary, and they have the same nutritional value as manure. Depending on the plant species, ploughing crop residues provides 20–25% of nitrogen, 25–50% of phosphorus, and 30–80% of potassium for the next crop. Decomposition of crop residues in the soil is done by two processes: (1) decomposition to water, carbon dioxide, ammonia and minerals that can be used by the next crop and (2) transformation into humus. The application of nitrogen fertilizers with ploughed aboveground biomass significantly contributes to the increase of humus content and the efficiency of carbon retention in the soil. Planned input into the soil of aboveground biomass of a crop grown exclusively for that purpose is called green manuring or sideration, and the crop itself used for green manure is called green manure or siderate. Siderates have numerous positive effects on the soil - organic matter enrichment, improved biological activity in the soil, effect on pedohygiene, physical, chemical and biological properties, absorption of more difficult-to-access nutrients and prevention of nutrient leaching, especially nitrogen. Planting of green manure, included in the crop rotation, contributes to the control of pests and diseases and reduces weeding of arable land, which would otherwise be unsown. Growing green manure in the summer months has a positive effect on reducing soil temperature, water retention, preservation of microorganisms from direct sunlight and protection of the soil from erosion. Plants used for green manure should have a strong root system and be characterized by rapid growth and rapid development of green mass. It is desirable that they have the ability to bind atmospheric nitrogen and absorb more difficult-to-access nutrients from deeper soil layers. The selected crop for green manure should create the maximum green mass in a certain climate. In organic agriculture, the main source of nitrogen is leguminous plants, living in symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria, which have the ability to fix airborne nitrogen and convert it into a form accessible for plant absorption. It is desirable to use mixtures of legumes with non-legumes for green manure for better adaptation and creation of biomass as large as possible. The application of green manure also has certain disadvantages: additional costs for seeds, cost of soil cultivation and sowing, lack of income-producing crops, additional seasonal field labour, possible problems with pests and diseases due to the "green bridge" effect and the possibility that green manure becomes weed. Cover crops have a large capacity to contribute to sustainable agricultural soil management and the realization of sustainable agricultural production. These crops primarily maintain and improve soil properties and capacity through its protection against water and wind erosion, improvement of soil structure (aggregate stability), improvement of soil hydraulic properties (water infiltration), increase in soil organic carbon content and microbiological activity, and decrease of nitrogen leaching, thus reducing groundwater pollution. Cover crops play a useful role in adapting to climate change and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The different benefits of cover crops depend on the plant species used as cover crops (legumes, non-legumes, grasses, Brassicaceae), the time of sowing and termination of vegetation of cover crops and the manner of termination of vegetation - mechanically or chemically. Cover crops that have an adventitious root are more effective in protecting the soil from erosion than cover crops with an axial root. Cover crops manifest their positive economic effect after long-term use. In addition to the main effects on the soil, cover crops have other effects, such as allelopathic and the effects of using different mixtures of cover crops on the health and quality of the soil.

Depolymerization of carbohydrate biomass using a long-chain alcohol (transglycosylation) to produce alkyl glycoside-based bio-surfactants has been gaining industrial interest. This study introduces microwave-assisted transglycosylation in transforming wheat bran, a substantial agricultural side stream, into these valuable compounds. Compared to traditional heating, microwave-assisted processing significantly enhances the product yield by 53 % while reducing the reaction time by 72 %, achieving a yield of 29 % within 5 h. This enhancement results from the microwave's capacity to activate intermolecular hydrogen and glycosidic bonds, thereby facilitating transglycosylation. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) demonstrate the benefits of microwave heating in reducing energy consumption by 42 %, CO2 emissions by 56 %, and equipment, operational and production costs by 44 %, 35 % and 30 %, respectively. The study suggests that microwave heating is a promising approach for efficiently producing bio-surfactants from agricultural wastes, with potential cost reductions and environmental benefits that could enhance industrial biomass conversion processes.

The aim of this study is to perform the thermal analysis of an existing building by a software, hence determine the possible improvements and energy savings. In this context, the existing model and two different improved models of a building are compared. The 1st case covers the existing situation of the building while the 2nd and 3rd cases are related to two improved cases for the building. The improvements are focused on heat insulation, infiltration and lighting system of the building. The results point out that 2nd and 3rd cases provide a reduction in electricity consumption by 15% compared to the 1st case. Similarly, annual natural gas consumption is decreased about by 76% and 90% in 2nd and 3rd cases, respectively in comparison with the 1st case. The total energy consumption by electricity and natural gas per unit area for 1st, 2nd and 3rd cases is also determined as 55.7, 35.7 and 33.1 kWh/m2, respectively. Moreover, annual CO2 emission is ensured to reduce nearly by 23% in both 2nd and 3rd cases compared to 1st situation.

Abstract The combination of downhole electric heaters with Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) operations has been successfully piloted in a California heavy oil field. This paper focuses on a field case study of the installation of an electric heater in a horizontal CSS producer with the primary objective of extending the duration of the production phase of the well’s average steam cycle. History matched thermal reservoir simulations based on the results of this field trial predict that operating an electric heater in a comparable well from the beginning of its life could extend the duration of the average CSS cycle by at least 90% while maintaining equivalent cumulative oil production over a 5-year period. The history matched model was adapted for steam cycles of various durations ranging from 3 to 8 months, and the benefits of extending these cycles’ durations using the hybrid downhole heater application are analyzed. Further modeling work determined that doubling the length of the productive interval of the field’s average horizontal CSS well while electrically heating could completely eliminate the need for steam injection and increase oil production on a per-well basis by more than 10%. Reductions in CO2 emissions through the elimination of steam are estimated to be greater than 80%, and reductions in water consumption can reach as high as 100%. Whether electric heaters are used to complement CSS operations by extending steam cycle duration, or to replace CSS operations with longer horizontal wells, significant economic and environmental benefits can be realized by implementing the technology.

Abstract Associated gas needs to be handled properly especially if the gas is deemed to be uneconomical as flaring emerges as being the first ad-hoc" solution" and for many cases prolongs for a long time. Such flaring practices are exercised even more for the gas streams with undesirable compositions such as high CO2, as the separation costs could be significant. When the daily amount reaches significant numbers such as 60 MMSCF/D, the impact in terms of emission of greenhouse gases, air pollution and waste of resources become very significant. In this study, new approaches of zero gas flaring coupled with supplemental CO2/gas injection, for not only mitigating the flaring but also for recovery improvement, were introduced. The feasibility of gas re-injection was assessed using real field data. Input data was assessed using experimental information as well as numerical, and custom-made machine learning models. Reservoir fluid characterized using the available PVT reports from two oil production wells and one shut-in gas injection well were used to develop the EOS model in use. Moreover, the combination of produced gases and supplemental CO2 are evaluated in terms of solubility/swelling and miscibility and as well as compatibility with the in-situ reservoir fluids. Performance of the gas re-injection was evaluated and optimized using the final calibrated reservoir simulation model for the gas injection process. This study quantifies the amount of incremental oil recovery and improving field performance from the re-injection of produced gas. Produced gas is intended to increase reservoir energy through re-pressurizing the reservoir and as well as displacing the remaining oil with the optimized injection gas compositions, and thus, reducing the oil viscosity due to swelling, reduction in interfacial tension leading to increase in local displacement efficiency. Furthermore, the gas re-injection process leads to relaxing the GOR constraints from 2000 scf/stb up to 4000 scf/stb, as the excess gas can be utilized in the injection process. The placement of new gas injectors is optimized considering the existing gas injector location and by injecting into the gas-cap close to GOC while targeting the best rock types locally aiming to ensure that sustained good injectivity is achieved. The outcome of this coupled process demonstrated enhancement in the reservoir energy management by mitigation of the gas coning due to the movement of the secondary gas cap towards the producers and optimum utilization of the natural reservoir energy in combination with the injection process. Furthermore, injection of the gas in up-dip of formation and in the gas cap with optimum gas injection rate yield stable gas sweep efficiency with the help of the gravity forces. In this study, re-injection of the produced gas considering the reservoir heterogeneity, optimum injection gas compositions (including CO2 enhancement options) and limiting injection pressure of 5500 psi (below fracturing pressure) results in improved oil recovery while reducing the gas emission with the optimum utilization of reservoir energy. This paper presents guidelines for mitigation of gas flaring by re-injection of the produced gas along with the supplemental gas (where available)/water and hence leading to reduced emissions.

Any decrease in global warming and its effects can only occur with a substantial reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In this context, renewable energy sources, particularly emerging sources, may play a central role in accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. Emerging energy sources are renewable and have the potential to reduce global warming emissions; however, they are in the early development stages. These technologies include enhanced geothermal processes, artificial photosynthesis, and marine energy. In this study, we assess the main attributes that determine the social acceptance of renewable marine energy projects, highlighting individual preferences and heterogeneity for these projects. The results show that energy generation, ecological impact, job creation, co-ownership, and distributional justice are statistically significant attributes that support projects. However, individual preferences are highly heterogeneous. The existence of distinct classes (two in this case) with different preferences for marine energy attributes indicates that the one-size-fits-all approach may be inappropriate. Instead, policymakers and energy producers should tailor their proposals to meet the needs of both groups, considering their preferences and concerns.

A new afterburner installation is proposed, fueled with pure hydrogen (100%H2) or hydrogen–methane mixtures (60% H2 + 40% CH4, 80% H2 + 20% CH4) for use in cogeneration applications. Two prototypes (P1 and P2) with the same expansion angle (45 degrees) were developed and tested. P1 was manufactured by the classic method and P2 by additive manufacturing. Both prototypes were manufactured from Inconel 625. During the tests, analysis of flue gas (CO2, CO, and NO concentration), PIV measurements, and noise measurements were conducted. The flue gas analysis emphasizes that the behavior of the two tested prototypes was very similar. For all three fuels used, the CO2 concentration levels were slightly lower in the case of the additive-manufactured prototype P2. The CO concentration levels were significantly higher in the case of the additive-manufactured prototype P2 when 60% H2/40% CH4 and 80% H2/20% CH4 mixtures were used as fuel. When pure H2 was used as fuel, the measured data suggest that no additional CO was produced during the combustion process, and the level of CO was similar to that from the Garrett micro gas turbine in all five measuring points. The NO emissions gradually decreased as the percentage of H2 in the fuel mixture increased. The NO concentration was significantly lower in the case of the additive-manufactured prototype (P2) in comparison with the classic manufactured prototype (P1). Examining the data obtained from the PIV measurements of the flow within the mixing region shows that the highest axial velocity component value on the centerline was measured for the P1 prototype. The acoustic measurements showed that a higher H2 concentration led to a reduction in noise of approximately 1.5 dB for both afterburner prototypes. The outcomes reveal that the examined V-gutter flame holder prototype flow was smooth, without any perpendicular oscillations, without chaotic motions or turbulent oscillations to the flow direction, across all tested conditions, keeping constant thermal power.

Diesel-fueled heavy-duty (HD) trucks are a key component of global freight transport, but consume 25% of the transportation industry's energy and emitting substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Utilizing low-carbon fuels like natural gas (NG), combined with hybridization, presents an excellent opportunity for reducing GHG emissions and fuel consumption. Micro-pilot dual fuel diesel/NG engines offer high engine brake thermal efficiency (BTE) with an efficient three-way catalyst (TWC) to limit pollutant emissions like CO2 without the need for costly exhaust aftertreatment systems. This engine is particularly well-suited for hybridization, as it features high-efficiency under stable, mid-, and high-load conditions, but with reduced performance at low loads. This paper validates two conventional baseline models (X15 Cummins diesel engine and micro-pilot NG engine) based on a tested class 8 regional-haul truck on highway. The study investigates the combined effect of low-carbon fuels and hybridization on improving the fuel economy and GHG emissions of class 8 regional-haul trucks. This involves designing pre-transmission parallel and plug-in hybrid configurations with downsized 6.7-liter micro-pilot NG engines. The cargo load and performance requirements are maintained equivalent to the conventional diesel baseline. Results show comparable fuel economy and engine BTE between conventional diesel baseline and NG models on highways with full cargo load. The parallel and series plug-in hybrid NG designs exhibit fuel economy improvements of 2.9% and 26%, respectively, compared to the micro-pilot NG over highway with full cargo load. In the same conditions, the CO2 emissions reductions for parallel and series plug-in hybrid NG designs are 15% and 51%, respectively, relative to the conventional diesel baseline. In addition, this article provides a detailed comparison and analysis of non-plug-in and plug-in hybrids based on component energy losses and internal combustion engine (ICE) operating points.

AbstractObjective To compare the effects of fractional CO2 laser and microablative fractional radiofrequency treatment with promestriene topical estrogen on sexual function and genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms. Methods This was a prospective randomized open-label clinical trial conducted with 62 postmenopausal women assigned to three intervention groups: a) topical promestriene for 90 days (n = 17); b) fractional CO2 laser treatment (n = 24); and c) microablative fractional radiofrequency treatment (n = 21). Each of the latter two groups underwent three treatment sessions at 4-week intervals. At baseline and at the end of the study, all participants had a gynecological examination that included vaginal pH measurement, and the completion of the Vaginal Symptom Score, the Vaginal Health Index, and the Female Sexual Function Index. For the energy treatment groups, adverse effects were evaluated after each session. Group homogeneity was assessed at baseline, and results were evaluated over time (from baseline to the end of treatment) and between groups over time. Results All baseline parameters were similar among studied groups. At the end of the study, all 3 treatments had produced similar effects: a reduction of vaginal pH, and an improvement of vulvovaginal symptoms (Vaginal Symptom Score and Vaginal Health Index scores) as well as sexual function (higher total Female Sexual Function Index, and in the desire, arousal, lubrication and pain domain scores), with no differences observed between groups. Side-effects were slight for both energy treatment groups, mainly represented by vaginal discharge. Conclusion The present study suggests that the two energy treatments were efficient along with promestriene at improving postmenopausal genitourinary and sexuality symptoms. Clinical trial identification number NCT04717245.

The accumulation of large amounts of steel slag (SS) and oil shale residue (OSR) causes serious pollution due to the lack of effective ways to utilize them. In this study, OSR, SS, and soda residue (SR) were used to synergistically prepare all-solid-waste low-carbon cemented backfill material (ALCCB). No cement and chemical additives were added to this material, and synergistic activation enabled full utilization of the solid wastes. The total solid waste utilization rate was 100%. The mechanical characteristics of the ALCCB and the heavy metal leaching rates were determined. The unconfined compression strength of the ALCCB after 28 days was 5.97 MPa, while the slump was 205 mm. These results met the performance requirements for a filling material. The leaching rates for the heavy metals after 28 days conformed to the guidelines for Class III groundwater quality. The mechanism underlying synergistic hydration of the solid wastes was analyzed at the micro- and macroscale with X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The results indicated that hydration of the ALCCB occurred continuously during curing, and the faster early hydration reaction stabilized heavy metal curing at 7 d. In addition, ALCCB offers greater economic and environmental advantages than cementitious materials. Notably, the economic and environmental benefits of ALCCB were found to supersede those of cement-based materials, with a cost reduction of 42.6% and a CO2 emission reduction of 86.9%. This innovative low-carbon mine backfill material effectively promotes the utilization of solid waste resources and supports sustainable development.

In this paper, the design and carbon credit evaluation of a grid-connected solar photovoltaic (SPV) power system for campus street light, a case study of the University of Uyo main campus at Nsukara Offot in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, is presented. The campus streetlight has a total path length of 3.45 km, a daily energy demand of 144.96 kWh with 1717.2 kWh/m2 yearly solar irradiation on the horizontal plane, and a mean ambient temperature of 24.9 °C. The SPV power system design and determination of the energy yield are done using PVSyst simulation software. The results show that the SPV has yearly energy yield of 51.6 MWh, with performance ratio of 76.9%. Also, a maximum energy yield of 5462 kWh occurred in the month of January, while the lowest energy yield of 3401 occurred in the month of July. Furthermore, the CO2 emission reduction value is 48.0912 tons per year, and this amounts to carbon credit of 1322.51 USD, which is equivalent to 1,005,106.08 Naira. In essence, over one million Naira carbon credit is realized by the installation of the grid-connected SPV power system for the campus streetlight.

Wastewater treatment plants are highly energy-intensive systems. This research uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to determine the impacts generated during the operation of a wastewater treatment plant. Three different scenarios are analyzed: a baseline scenario that considers a conventional activated sludge treatment technology exploiting data from an existing plant located in central Italy, a second scenario that involves the implementation of MBR technology applied to the baseline scenario, and finally a third scenario that consists of the addition of an anaerobic digester that allows energy recovery from biogas production, followed by a photovoltaic plant capable of supplying the plant energy demand. Global warming potential, eutrophication, and acidification are the environmental categories considered most relevant to emissions. The results showed that the effluent had the highest impact in terms of CO2 equivalent in all three situations due to the presence of N2O. Since emissions from biological processes, transportation, and wastewater are almost similar in all three scenarios, it is preferable to focus on the environmental impacts associated with energy consumption. The third scenario involves careful resource management and the use of treatment technologies that allow for a reduction in the use of nonrenewable energy sources in favor of renewable ones.

In order to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality by 2045, the Climate Protection Act sets emission reduction targets for the years 2030 and 2040, as well as decreasing annual emission volumes for some sectors, including the building sector. Measures to decarbonize the building sector include energy retrofits and the expansion of renewable, decentralized power generators and low-CO2 heat generators. These measures thus change both the load and the generation of the future energy supply concept. Considering the interactions of the changed installed technologies on the building level and their influence on the electrical grid infrastructure is necessary. The grid operator will remedy the future congested grid states by grid expansion measures and pass on the costs to the connected grid users, which in turn could influence their behaviour and decisions. The aim of this work is a holistic analysis of the staggered interactions of generation expansion and grid expansion for a future decentralized energy supply concept conditioned by the expansion in the field of self-generation. To enable the analysis of the interactions, a multi-criteria optimization procedure for expansion and operation decisions at the building level is combined with an approach to determine grid expansion. As part of this work, the effect of an expansion of hosting capacity on the grid charges and thus the decision-making behaviour was investigated.

This Letter reports the device and material investigations of enhancement-mode p-GaN-gate AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) for Venus exploration and other harsh environment applications. The GaN transistor in this work was subjected to prolonged exposure (11 days) in a simulated Venus environment (460 °C, 94 bar, complete chemical environment including CO2/N2/SO2). The mechanisms affecting the transistor performance and structural integrity in harsh environment were analyzed using a variety of experimental, simulation, and modeling techniques, including in situ electrical measurement (e.g., burn-in) and advanced microscopy (e.g., structural deformation). Through transistor, Transmission Line Method (TLM), and Hall-effect measurements vs temperature, it is revealed that the mobility decrease is the primary cause of reduction of on-state performance of this GaN transistor at high temperature. Material analysis of the device under test (DUT) confirmed the absence of foreign elements from the Venus atmosphere. No inter-diffusion of the elements (including the gate metal) was observed. The insights of this work are broadly applicable to the future design, fabrication, and deployment of robust III-N devices for harsh environment operation.

This study deals with the treatment of a two-phase olive mill waste (TPOMW), with simultaneous bio-electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 using a Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC). For this purpose, a dual-chamber MEC was constructed using carbon felt as anodic and cathodic electrodes. The performance was assessed in terms of COD removal, the degradation of the phenolic compounds as well as the electromethanosynthesis potential of the MEC bio-cathode. The MEC operated for 120 days and the results showed that increasing the concentration from 3 to 7 and 38 gCOD/L led to an increase of the COD removal from 74%, to 77% and to 87%, respectively, of the total phenolic content removal from 73%, to 76% and to 79%, respectively, as well as of the produced CH4 from 0.04, to 0.09 and to 0.07 mmols/gCODconsumed, respectively. Increasing the applied potential from 0.5 V to 1 V, while the TPOMW was employed in the anode with no dilution, resulted in further increase of both the COD and the total phenolic content removal from 87% to 79%, respectively, to 91%, while the produced CH4 further increased from 0.07 to 0.08 mmols/gCODconsumed. The results indicate that the MEC technology can be potentially exploited for the treatment of the TPOMW and produce CH4 as a waste-to-energy source.

This paper examines the economic feasibility of implementing a Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FSPV) system in a Philippine Lake using the PVsyst simulation tool. The study involved a detailed simulation of the FSPV system's performance, considering various environmental and technical parameters. Key aspects such as system configuration, energy yield, and financial metrics including payback period and net present value were analyzed. Results indicate that the FSPV system could significantly contribute to local energy needs while proving to be a financially viable investment due to substantial reductions in CO2 emissions and lower energy costs compared to traditional power sources. According to assessments and simulations performed using PVSyst software, the FSPV system would possess a capacity of 10 kWp, with an expected available energy output of 13,599 kWh per year and an expected energy consumption of 12,940 kWh per year. The economic modeling of the FSPV system revealed a relatively short payback period of 4.8 years, with a net present value of Php 741,732.00 and a substantial return on investment of 227.5%. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) was estimated at Php 6.18 per kWh. The study underscores the potential of FSPV systems to meet the renewable energy needs of isolated communities by leveraging local water bodies for solar installations.

ABSTRAKPembangkit Listrik Tenaga Uap Batu bara menghasilkan zat SO2, CO2, NO2, dan partikel yang merupakan emisi dari proses pembakarannya. Emisi tersebut menyebabkan peningkatan efek pemanasan global, kerusakan lingkungan, dan merusak kesehatan. Dikarenakan pembangkit batu bara masih banyak digunakan di Indonesia maka Economic Emission Dispatch yang dikombinasikan dengan algoritma Whale Optimization Algorithm menjadi solusi dalam pengurangan emisi pembangkit listrik. Dengan cara memasukkan nilai weighted sum pada fungsi biaya dan emisi agar dapat dilihat pembangkit mana yang memiliki kadar emisi lebih rendah untuk memenuhi beban listrik yang dibutuhkan. Pada simulasi tersebut didapatkan pengurangan kadar emisi sebesar 12,73% dibandingkan tanpa menggunakan weighted sum dengan algortima WOA. Hal ini mampu untuk membantu program pemerintah dalam mengurangi emisi karbon agar tidak melebihi standar emisi yang telah ditetapkan sesuai dengan Peraturan Menteri Nomor P.15/MENLHK/SETJEN/KUM.1/4/2019.Kata kunci: PLTU batu bara, emisi, EED, WOA, weighted sum ABSTRACTCoal-fired power plants produce SO2, CO2, NO2, and particulate matter as emissions from the combustion process. These emissions cause increased global warming effects, environmental damage, and damage to health. coal plants are still widely used in Indonesia, Economic Emission Dispatch combined with the Whale Optimization Algorithm is a solution for reducing power plant emissions. By entering the weighted sum value in the cost and emission functions, it can be seen which plants have lower emission levels to meet the required electricity load. The simulation obtained a reduction in emission levels of 12.73% compared to not using weighted sum with the WOA algorithm. This method is able to help government programs in reducing carbon emissions so as not to exceed the emission standards that have been set in accordance with Peraturan Menteri Nomor P.15/MENLHK/SETJEN/ KUM.1/4/2019.Keywords: coal power plant, emission, EED, WOA, weighted sum

Abstract. A natural plankton community from oligotrophic subtropical waters of the Atlantic near Gran Canaria, Spain, was subjected to varying degrees of ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) to assess the potential physiological effects, in the context of the application of ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques. We employed 8.3 m3 mesocosms with a sediment trap attached to the bottom, creating a gradient in total alkalinity (TA). The lowest point on this gradient was 2400 μmol · L-1, which corresponded to the natural alkalinity of the environment, and the highest point was 4800 μmol · L-1. Over the course of the 33-day experiment, the plankton community exhibited two distinct phases. In phase-I (days 5–20), a notable decline in the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) was observed. This change was accompanied by substantial reductions in the abundances of picoeukaryotes, small size nanoeukaryotes (nanoeukaryotes-1), and microplankton. The cell viability of picoeukaryotes, as indicated by fluorescein-di-acetate hydrolysis by cellular esterases (FDA- green fluorescence), slightly increased by the end of phase-I whilst the viability of nanoeukaryotes 1 and Synechococcus spp . did not change. Reactive oxygen species levels (ROS-green fluorescence) showed no significant changes for any of the functional groups. In contrast, in phase-II (days 21–33), a pronounced community response was observed. Increases in Fv/Fm in the intermediate OAE treatments of ∆900 to ∆1800 μmol · L-1  and in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chlorophyll-c2 (Chl-c2) , fucoxanthin and divinyl-Chl-a were attributed to the emergence of blooms of large size nanoeukaryotes (nanoeukaryotes-2) from the genera Chrysochromulina, as well as picoeukaryotes. Synechococcus spp. also flourished towards the end of this phase. In parallel, we observed a total 20 % significant change in the metaproteome of the phytoplankton community. This is considered a significant alteration in protein expression, having substantial impacts on cellular functions and the physiology of the organisms. Medium levels of ∆TA showed more upregulated and less downregulated proteins than higher ∆TA treatments. Under these conditions, cell viability significantly increased in pico and nanoeukaryotes-1 in intermediate alkalinity levels, while in Synechococcus spp., nanoeukaryotes-2 and microplankton remained stable. ROS levels did not significantly change in any functional group. The pigment ratios DD+DT : FUCO, and DD+DT : Chl-a increased in medium ∆TA treatments, supporting the idea of nutrient deficiency alleviation and the absence of physiological stress. Taken all data together, this study shows that there is minimal evidence indicating a harmful impact of high alkalinity on the plankton community. The OAE treatments did not result in physiological fitness impairment, thus OAE did not cause cellular stress in the phytoplankton community studied.

Regulating the binding energy between the catalysts and reaction intermediate species is crucial for electrocatalytic processes. As according to the Sabatier principle, excessively strong binding energies can be detrimental. The presence of oxygen vacancy defects is beneficial, leading to a relatively lower binding energy. In this study, ZnO catalysts with varying oxygen vacancy contents were successfully synthesized with different solvents and hydrothermal treatment temperatures. The oxygen vacancy content of prepared samples was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, while the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) experiments were performed in a flow cell. A proportional relationship was observed between the CO production rate and oxygen vacancy content. As a result, the catalyst with a hydrothermal temperature of 180 °C for 3 h (ZnO-EG-180-3) exhibited the highest oxygen vacancy content, accompanied by a high CO yield. The sample was stable in CO2RR for over 50 h at a constant current of 150 mA, maintaining a stable CO faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 90%, and the CO yield was more than 2625 μmol·h–1·cm–2, while lower than 10% for H2. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the presence of oxygen vacancies in ZnO catalysts reduces the binding energy of the *CO intermediate, facilitating *CO desorption, mitigating the poisoning effect of *CO on active sites, and promoting the generation of CO generation.

The silicon nanosheet/carbon composite emerges as a promising anode material for the next-generation commercial lithium-ion batteries. However, complex, costly, and energy-intensive synthesis procedures impede its practical application. Herein, the carbon-coated silicon nanosheets (Si/C) have been successfully synthesized via a one-pot strategy, involving a modified magnesiothermic reduction of talc followed by a reaction with CO2. The distinct chemical composition and layered nanostructure of talc enable the retention of Si nanosheets during exothermic reactions without additional templates or heat absorbents. The method shows significant potential for the scalable production of Si/C owing to the abundant silicon source, sustainable carbon source, and straightforward protocol. The resulting Si/C displays a hierarchical porous structure, with both macropores and mesopores, and an interconnected network of carbon-coated Si nanosheets. These structural characteristics facilitate rapid Li+ diffusion and enable the material to accommodate the lithiation-induced mechanical strains. As a result, the Si/C electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance, including a remarkable rate capability (with a specific capacity of 1220 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1) and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88%. The work opens a new avenue for the development of Si/C composites from natural clay minerals through an economical and scalable strategy, which would contribute to the practical application of advanced Si-based anodes in lithium-ion batteries.

Accumulation of geogenic phosphorus (P) in groundwater is an emerging environmental concern, which is closely linked to coupled processes involving FeOOH and organic matter under methanogenic conditions. However, it remains unclear how P enrichment is associated with methane cycling, particularly the anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO). This study conducted a comprehensive investigation of carbon isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, and CH4, alongside Fe isotopes, microbial communities, and functions in quaternary aquifers of the central Yangtze River plain. The study found that P concentrations tended to increase with Fe(II) concentrations, δ56Fe, and δ13C-DIC, suggesting P accumulation due to the reductive dissolution of FeOOH under methanogenic conditions. The positive correlations of pmoA gene abundance versus δ13C–CH4 and Fe concentrations versus δ13C–CH4, and the prevalent presence of Candidatus_Methanoperedens, jointly demonstrated the potential significance of Fe(III)-mediated AMO process (Fe-AMO) alongside traditional methanogenesis. The increase of P concentration with δ13C–CH4 value, pmoA gene abundance, and Fe concentration suggested that the Fe-AMO process facilitated P enrichment in groundwater. Redundancy analysis confirmed this assertion, identifying P concentration as the primary determinant and the cooperative influence of Fe-AMO microorganisms such as Candidatus_Methanoperedens and Geobacter on P enrichment. Our work provided new insights into P dynamics in subsurface environments.

While high-quality climate reconstructions of some past warm periods in the Cenozoic era now exist, the geological processes responsible for driving the observed longterm changes in atmospheric CO2 are not sufficiently well understood. The long-term change in atmospheric CO2 across the Cenozoic has been proposed to be driven by processes such as terrestrial weathering, organic carbon production and burial, reverse weathering, and volcanic degassing. One way of constraining the relative importance of the various driving forces proposed so far is to better understand the degree to which ocean chemistry has changed because the chemistry of seawater responds to geologic processes that drive atmospheric CO2. In addition, knowledge of the concentration of the major elements in seawater is crucial for accurately applying proxies such as those based on the boron isotopic composition and Mg/Ca of marine carbonates (a proxy for palaeo pH/CO2 and palaeotemperature, respectively). Previously reported records of seawater composition are primarily derived from fluid inclusions in marine evaporites; however, the results are sparse due to the limited availability of such deposits. In this thesis, changes in the Eocene seawater chemistry were reconstructed using trace element (elements/Ca) and isotopic (δ26Mg) proxies in a Larger Benthic Foraminifera (LBFs), i.e., Nummulites sp., to constrain the driving processes of long-term changes in seawater chemistry. To achieve the objective of this thesis, first, a measurement protocol was established using LA-ICPMS to measure the K/Ca ratio simultaneously with other element/calcium ratios, which is challenging due to the interference of ArH+ on K+. Utilising this newly established measurement protocol, laboratory-cultured Operculina ammonoides grown at different seawater calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]), repeated at different temperatures, as well as modern O. ammonoides collected from different regions exhibiting a range of seawater parameters, were investigated. A significant correlation was observed between K/Casw and K/CaLBF, allowing K/CaLBF to potentially be used as a proxy for seawater major ion reconstructions. In addition, modern O. ammonoides demonstrated no significant influence of most seawater parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, or [CO32-]) on K/CaLBF. Modern O. ammonoides were also assessed for their Mg isotopic composition (δ26Mg), revealing no significant effect of temperature or salinity on δ26MgLBF. Furthermore, the Mg isotopic fractionation in O. ammonoides was found to be close to that of inorganic calcite, indicating minimal vital effects in these large benthic foraminifera. Operculina ammonoides is the nearest living relative of the abundant Eocene genus Nummulites, enabling the reconstruction of seawater chemistry using the calibration based on O. ammonoides. The trace elemental/calcium proxies, including Na/Ca, K/Ca, and Mg/Ca, as well as the δ26Mg proxy, were investigated in Eocene Nummulites. The result showed that during the Eocene, [Ca2+]sw was 1.6-2 times higher, while [K+]sw was ~2 times lower than the modern seawater composition. Furthermore, [Mg2+]sw decreased from the early Eocene (54.3− +9 7..69 mmol kg-1 at ~55 Ma) to Late Eocene (37.8− +4 4..3 4 mmol kg-1 at ~31 Ma), followed by an increase toward modern seawater [Mg]. In contrast, the variability in δ26Mgsw values remained within a narrow range of ~0.3 ‰ throughout the Cenozoic. The reconstructed [Ca2+]sw agrees with the suggestion that Cenozoic seawater chemistry changes can be explained via a change in the seafloor spreading rate. When combined with existing records, the observed minimal change in δ26Mgsw with an increase in [Mg2+]sw suggests an additional possible role of a decrease in the formation of authigenic clay minerals coincident with the Cenozoic decline in deep ocean temperature, which is also supported by the increase in the [K+]sw reconstructed here for the first time. This finding highlights that the reduction in seafloor-spreading rate and decline in reverse weathering during the Cenozoic era has played a significant role in the evolution of seawater chemistry, emphasizing the importance of these processes in driving long-term changes in the carbon cycle.

The measures needed to limit global warming pose a particular challenge to current fossil fuel exporters, who must not only decarbonise their local energy systems, but also compensate for the expected decline in fossil fuel revenues. One possibility is seen in the export of green hydrogen. Using Algeria as a case study, this paper analyses how different levels of ambition in hydrogen exports, energy efficiency and fuel switching affect the cost-optimal expansion of the power sector for a given overall emissions reduction path. Despite falling costs for photovoltaics and wind turbines, the results indicate that in countries with very low natural gas prices, such as Algeria, a fully renewable electricity system by 2050 is unlikely without appropriate policy measures. The expansion of renewable energy should therefore start early, given the high annual growth rates required, which will be reinforced by additional green hydrogen exports. In parallel, energy efficiency is a key factor as it directly mitigates CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and reduces domestic electricity demand, which could instead be used for hydrogen production. Integrating electrolysers into the power system could potentially help to reduce specific costs through load shifting. Overall, it seems advisable to analyse hydrogen exports together with local decarbonisation in order to better understand their interactions and to reduce emissions as efficiently as possible. These results and the methodology could be transferred to other countries that want to become green hydrogen exporters in the future and are therefore a useful addition for researchers and policy makers.

Abstract In this paper, the impact of different input variables on the performance and emission features of a pongamia pinnata and rapeseed oil biodiesel with n-Butanol additive were investigated, statistically analyzed, and optimized by employing the powerful response surface methodology (RSM) based design of experiment (DOE) techniques. The vegetable oils (pongamia pinnata and rapeseed oils) were transesterified and their corresponding methyl esters were blended with diesel and n-Butanol at blend ratios 10:84:6, 10:78:12, 20:74:6 and 20:68:12. The samples were tested on a direct injection CI engine at a rated speed of 1500 rpm and standard CR of 17.5:1 at different loads. In each test, performance and emission parameters were measured. Expert machine learning (ML) methods were used to forecast these features. In addition, polynomial equations were developed for each blend using regression techniques and compared with an artificial intelligence technique. It was observed that the engine performance increased as biodiesel and additive weight percentage increased. Regardless of the loads placed on the engine and the blend ratios, the use of PPME and RSME combined with n-Butanol blends demonstrated a clear decrease in NOx compared to diesel (7.07% for P20B12 and 6.58% for R20B12). As per the trend, it is seen that the percentage reduction in CO2 emissions is greater with high percentage increase of n-Butanol in the tested sample irrespective of loads applied on the engine (2.95% more P20B12 for as compared to P20B6). For the emission characteristics, ANN demonstrated a range of 87.92% to 98.83% prediction accuracy while that of regression varies from 81.4% to 98.8% for all the samples of PPME blended biodiesel.

Abstract In the Mediterranean region, a reduction of annual precipitation and a longer and drier summer season are expected with climate change by the end of the century eventually endangering forest survival. To cope with such rapid change, trees may modulate their morpho-anatomical and physiological traits. In the present study, we focused on the variation in leaf gas exchange and different leaf morpho-anatomical functional traits of Quercus pubescens Willd. in summer using a long-term drought experiment in natura consisting of a dynamic rainfall exclusion system where trees have been submitted to amplified drought (AD) (~ −30% of annual precipitation) since April 2012 and compared to trees under natural drought (ND) in a Mediterranean forest. During the study, we analyzed net CO2 assimilation (An), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), water use efficiency (WUE), stomatal size and density, density of glandular trichomes and non-glandular trichomes, thickness of the different leaf tissues, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf surface. Under AD, tree functioning was slightly impacted, since only An exhibited a 49% drop, while gs, E and WUE remained stable. The decrease in An under AD was regulated by concomitant lower stomatal density and reduced leaf thickness. Trees under AD also featured leaves with a higher non-glandular trichome density and a lower glandular trichome density compared to ND, which simultaneously limits transpiration and production costs. This study points out that Q. pubescens exhibits adjustments of leaf morpho-anatomical traits which can help trees to acclimate to amplified drought scenarios as those expected in the future in the Mediterranean region.

Solar driven cooling system is a promising and sustainable substitute for conventional cooling systems to soften the impact of energy deficit and environmental degradation. In this study, a solar hybrid cooling system for an institutional building is investigated, which combines solar photovoltaic (PV) technology with traditional vapor compression systems and/or absorption cooling systems. The performance of the proposed solar hybrid cooling system is simulated and compared at four (04) locations in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region: Riyadh (Saudia Arabia), Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Doha (Qatar), and Jaww (Bahrain), with different cooling system configurations from technical, economic, and environmental standpoints. The simulation findings show that the solar driven absorption chiller reduces the maximum CO2 emissions by 42.7% in Riyadh, while the solar driven compressor system gives a maximum Greenhouse gas emissions reduction (99.1%) for the location of Dubai. To determine the most practical design in terms of economics, metrics such as net present value, payback, and benefit–cost ratio (BCR) and several cooling scenarios are also rigorously studied. According to model findings, the solar absorption cooling system presented the most feasible scenario with the shortest payback of 5.8 years, the highest internal rate of return (IRR) of 38.8%, and BCR of 5.4% for the location of Dubai, and the same trend holds for all other locations. Conversely, the solar-powered vapor compression system was the least suitable option for Riyadh city, with the longest payback period of 21.9 years, the lowest IRR of 2.4, and a BCR of −0.06. In addition, optimization results show that ground mounted PV systems outperform building integrated PV (BIPV) systems owing to their higher capacity factor: 21% in case of PV and 12.8% in case of BIPV systems.

With pronounced differences in emission factors among vehicle types and marked spatiotemporal heterogeneity of vehicle fleet composition, extrapolating fleet composition from insufficient sample hour periods and road segments will introduce significant uncertainty in calculating regional daily road traffic emissions. We proposed a framework to manage uncertainty in urban road traffic emissions associated with vehicle fleet composition from the perspective of spatiotemporal sampling coverage. Initially, the respective relationships of the temporal and spatial sampling coverages of fleet composition with the resulting regional daily road traffic emission uncertainties were determined, using the core area of a typical small and medium-sized city in China with the widely-used International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) model as example. Subsequently, function models were developed to explore the determination of the spatiotemporal sampling coverage of fleet composition. These results of emission uncertainties and function models implied that gases with larger emission factor discrepancies between vehicle types, such as NOx, required greater spatiotemporal sampling coverage than gases with smaller discrepancies, such as CO2, under the same uncertainties target. Therefore, sampling efforts should be prioritized for gases with larger emission factor discrepancies. Additionally, increasing sampling coverage in one dimension (either spatial or temporal) can reduce the minimum required coverage in the other dimension. To further reduce uncertainty, enhancing both spatial and temporal sampling coverage of the fleet composition is more effective than enhancing one type of coverage alone. The framework and results proposed in this work can reduce the uncertainty of emissions calculations caused by insufficient sampling coverage and contribute to more accurate transport emission reduction policy formulation.

Background: During ischemia, anaerobic metabolism prompts intracellular acidosis with activation of the sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1), resulting in intracellular Na+ overload consequent to reductions in Na+-K- ATPase activity. The Na+ excess prompts Ca2+ entry through the sodium-calcium exchanger, leading to Ca+ overload. Ca+ overload, predisposes cells to hypercontracture upon reoxygenation. NHE-1 inhibition reduces Na+ overload and the subsequent Ca+ overload. We developed a programmable system to model ischemia and reperfusion by dynamically blending O2, CO2, and N2 and used it to model changes in gas tension at the tissue levels during ischemia and reperfusion. We validated the model by comparing the effects of reoxygenation with and without the NHE-1 inhibitor zoniporide in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes. Methods: The set-up included: (i) a programmable dynamic gas blender developed by us, (ii) equilibration of ischemic buffer with anoxic gas mixture at 3-5 LPM and perfusion within an imaging chamber at 2.5 ml/min, (iii) a glass reservoir and stainless steel tubing to avoid gas diffusion, (iv) an acrylic hood, constantly flushed with anoxic gas mixture, covering the chamber on the stage of the microscope, and (v) an O2 microelectrode to continuously monitor PO2 in the chamber. The set-up resulted in PO2 of 0 mmHg during ischemia. The cells were subjected to 15 min of baseline stabilization, 45 min of ischemia, and 120 min of reperfusion. Zoniporide (at a final concentration of 3 μM) was administered starting at 10 min of ischemia and was maintained throughout reperfusion. Results: Zoniporide significantly attenuated development of rigor and subsequent hypercontracture (P=0.001, Gehan Breslow survival analysis). Conclusion: The newly develop system reproduced at the cell level effects of ischemia and reperfusion. These effects were attenuated by NHE-1 inhibition as it has been reported in isolated organs and in the in situ heart.

Climate change is a reality and its impact on the tea plantations is apparent in the rise of pest intensity, higher agrochemical use, inconsistent crop yields, declining grand growth period, increased abiotic stress and various other challenges; that threaten long-term sustainability of the Indian tea sector. The urgency to adopt sustainable practices is increasing by the day but to gain time bound results a comprehensive focus encompassing soil and plant health development will be crucial. To deal with climate challenge head-on, the Indian tea industry is making changes at various levels of operations. The sustainable tea initiative at Lakhipara tea estate, was one such attempt by the Goodricke Group Limited in their Dooars tea growing region of West Bengal. The program was initiated in 2014 with an aim to reduce pesticide use, improve soil quality, and produce quality teas while sustaining crop yields, improving renewable energy use and lowering the carbon footprint. Adoption of Inhana Rational Farming (IRF) Technology and taking the essence from ‘Trophobiosis Theory’ of French Scientist F. Chaboussou, the program focused on management of soil and plant health. Three years evaluation of crop yields in respect of the budgeted crop, revealed on an average an excess of 78 kg/ha/year in the project area. In rest of the garden area a contrasting crop loss of 118 kg was recorded per ha during the same period. The higher crop performance positively correlated with the higher nutrient use efficiency which was 17.7 percent higher in the project area (NUENPK : 8.86) as compared to the general garden area (NUENPK : 7.53), which reflected the impact of plant health management towards enhanced nutrient uptake, assimilation and utilization. Assessment of pesticide usage, revealed up to 77% decrease in usage in the project area during 2014-16, as compared to the pre- project year. Comparison with pesticide usage of the Dooars tea growing region during this same period, indicated a 62% lower Crop Pesticide Pollution Index (CPPI) in the project area. The finding indicated a 52 to 77% reduction in the accumulated toxicity potential of the applied pesticides in the project area; thereby accrediting safer tea development under this program, when adjudged in terms of pesticide residue. Assessment of soil quality revealed an overall eight percent increment in Soil Fertility Index (FI) value, with significant improvement in soil microbial activity potential (MAP) values i.e., by almost four times. The finding pointed towards the favourable impact of soil health management primarily through Novcom composting towards enhancement of soil microbial interactions. Post three years of experimentation the overall Soil Quality Iindex (SQI) value increased by 6% in the project area. The finding corroborated a concurrent 6.72% increase in the soil organic carbon stock during the same period. Reduction in use of non- renewable inputs viz. chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the project area was indicated by approximately 40 percent enhancement in energy use efficiency and energy productivity post the assessment period. Carbon assessment in terms of kg CO2 equivalents/ kg made tea (using ACFA version 1.0) indicated approx. 65 to 70 % lower footprint in the project area, primarily due to 20 to 30 % reduction in chemical fertilizers and 60 to 70 % reduction in the use of synthetic pesticides. The results indicated that while integrated soil management is the pre-requisite criteria towards rejuvenation of soil health and for restoration of the habitat for predators, it does not play a direct role in reducing the pest pressure and simultaneously the requirement of pesticides. Physiologically activated plants/ bushes on the other hand; due to their higher nutrient assimilation capacity and efficient protein synthesis are always lesser susceptible to pest attack. Hence, focus on activation of plant physiology can reduce the plant- pest interaction leading to a natural reduction in the requirement for pesticides vis-à-vis the pesticide usage.

Electrocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction that are pivotal for the energy transition, are multi-step processes occurring in a nanoscale electric double layer (EDL) at solid-liquid interfaces. Conventional analyses based on the Sabatier principle, using binding energies or effective electronic structure properties of the d-band center as descriptors, are able to grasp overall trends in catalytic activity in groups of catalysts. However, thermodynamic approaches fail to account for a plethora of electrolyte effects that arise in the EDL, including pH effects, cation effects, and anion effects. These effects have been observed to strongly influence electrocatalytic reactions. There is a growing consensus that the local reaction environment (LRE) prevailing in the EDL is the key to deciphering these complex and hitherto perplexing electrolyte effects. Equal attention is thus paid to designing appropriate electrolytes, positioning the LRE at center stage. Achieving this is essential for designing electrocatalysts with specifically tailored properties, which could enable much needed breakthroughs in electrochemical energy science. Theory and modeling are becoming increasingly important and powerful in addressing this multifaceted problem that involves physical phenomena at different scales interacting in a multidimensional parametric space. Theoretical models developed for this purpose should treat intrinsic multistep kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions, EDL effects from sub-nm scale to the scale of 10 nm, and mass transport phenomena bridging scales from < 0.1 to 100 μm. Given the diverse physical phenomena and scales involved, it is evident that the challenge at hand surpasses the capabilities of any single theoretical or computational approach. In this Account, we present a hierarchical theoretical framework to address the above challenge. It seamlessly integrates several modules: (i) a comprehensive microkinetic model accounting for various reaction pathways; (ii) an LRE model that describes the interfacial region extending from the nanometric EDL continuously to the solution bulk; (iii) first-principles calculations that provide parameters, e.g., adsorption energies, activation barriers and EDL parameters. The microkinetic model considers all elementary steps without designating an a priori rate-determining step. The kinetics of these elementary steps are expressed in terms of local concentrations, potential and electric field that are co-determined by EDL charging and mass transport in the LRE model. New insights on electrode kinetic phenomena, i.e., potential-dependent Tafel slopes, cation effects, and pH effects, obtained from this hierarchical framework are then reviewed. Finally, an outlook on further improvement of the model framework is presented, in view of recent developments in first-principles based simulation of electrocatalysis, observations of dynamic reconstruction of catalysts, and machine-learning assisted computational simulations

Application of biochar has been demonstrated to be a successful strategy for boosting soil carbon sequestration and altering the agricultural soil carbon cycle. However, in the studies involving biochar worldwide, the effects of different types of biochar on the soil carbon component response direction and increase are not consistent. Therefore, to assess the effects of applying four types of biochar during the soil carbon cycle on carbon components on a farmland, we performed a meta-analysis of 1150 comparisons from 86 peer-reviewed publications. Generally speaking, the types of biochar raw materials have a significant impact on soil carbon cycle. The application of chaff biochar significantly inhibited (10.0 %) soil respiration, while the application of manure biochar (47.0 %), straw biochar (11.2 %) and wood biochar (8.7 %) showed a strong promotion effect on CO2 emission. In addition, although the soil organic C, microbial biomass C and dissolved organic C all had positive responses to the application of the four biochar types, the degree and increase in their response varied greatly due to the differences in biomass raw materials. Moreover, by increasing the biochar rates applied to coarse-textured soils with low average annual rainfall and an average temperature under controlled circumstances, the relative increase in SOC was encouraged. Meanwhile, applying low temperature pyrolytic biochar (≤400 °C) at a lower rate (<25 t/ha) in the long-term experiment (>3 years) is more beneficial to soil C sequestration and emission reduction. Hence, climatic conditions, agricultural management practices, and initial soil properties jointly constrained and influenced the ability of biochar to alter the soil C cycle. Based on this, our research offers a fresh viewpoint for making a profound study biochar-enhanced soil C cycle.

Phosphonate is becoming a global interest and concern owing to its environment risk and potential value. Degradation of phosphonate into phosphate followed by the recovery is regarded as a promising strategy to control phosphonate pollution, relieve phosphorus crisis, and promote phosphorus cycle. Given these objectives, an anion-membrane-coated-electrode (A-MCE) doped with Fe-Co based carbon catalyst and cation-membrane-coated-electrode (C-MCE) doped with carbon-based catalyst were prepared as catalytic electrodes, and a novel electrocatalytic capacitive deionization (E-CDI) was developed. During charging process, phosphonate was enriched around A-MCE surface based on electrostatic attraction, ligand exchange, and hydrogen bond. Meanwhile, Fe2+ and Co2+ were self-oxidized into Fe3+ and Co3+, forming a complex with enriched phosphonate and enabling an intramolecular electron transfer process for phosphonate degradation. Additionally, benefiting from the stable dissolved oxygen and high oxygen reduction reaction activity of C-MCE, hydrogen peroxide accumulated in E-CDI (158 μM) and thus hydroxyl radicals (·OH) were generated by activation. E-CDI provided an ideal platform for the effective reaction between ·OH and phosphonate, avoiding the loss of ·OH and triggering selective degradation of most phosphonate. After charging for 70 min, approximately 89.9% of phosphonate was degraded into phosphate, and phosphate was subsequently adsorbed by A-MCE. Results also showed that phosphonate degradation was highly dependent on solution pH and voltage, and was insignificantly affected by electrolyte concentration. Compared to traditional advanced oxidation processes, E-CDI exhibited a higher degradation efficiency, lower cost, and less sensitive to co-existed ions in treating simulated wastewaters. Self-enhanced and selective degradation of phosphonate, and in-situ phosphate adsorption were simultaneously achieved for the first time by a E-CDI system, showing high promise in treating organic-containing saline wastewaters.

Preliminary studies suggest that moderate ARDS and acute renal failure might benefit from extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) coupled with CRRT. However, evidence is limited and potential for this coupled treatment may need to be explored. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a protective driving pressure was obtained applying low-flow ECCO2-R plus CRRT in patients affected by moderate ARDS with COVID-19 compared to an historical group without COVID-19.A case-control study has been conducted comparing a group of consecutive moderate ARDS patients presenting AKI and affected by COVID-19, who needed low-flow ECCO2-R plus CRRT to achieve an ultra-protective ventilatory strategy, with historical group without COVID-19 that matched for clinical presentation and underwent the same ultra-protective treatment. VT was set at 6 mL/kg predicted body weight then ECCO2R was assessed to facilitate ultra-protective low VT ventilation to preserve safe Pplat and low driving pressure.ECCO2R+CRRT reduced the driving pressure from 17 (14-18) to 11.5 (10-15) cmH2O (p<0.0004) in the fourteen ARDS patients by decreasing VT from 6.7 ml/kg PBW (6.1-6.9) to 5.1 (4.2-5.6) after 1 hour (p <0.0001). In the ARDS patients with COVID-19, the driving pressure reduction was more effective from baseline 18 (14-24) cmH2O to 11 (10-15) cmH2O (p<0.004), compared to the control group from 15 (13-17) to 12(10-16) cmH2O (p< 0.03), after one hour. ECCO2R+CRRT did not affected 28 days mortality in the two groups, while we observed a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (19 {7-29} vs 24 {22-38} days; p=0.24) and ICU length of stay (19 {7-29} vs 24 {22-78} days; p=0.25) in moderate ARDS patients with COVID-19 compared to control group.In moderate ARDS patients with or without COVID-19 disease, ECCO2R+CRRT may be and effective supportive treatment to reach protective values of driving pressure unless severe oxygenation defects arise requiring ECMO therapy initiation.

Abstract North Kuwait Jurassic Gas (NKJG) fields are challenging HPHT wells with near-critical fluids in reservoir conditions. These wells are deep and sour with 2-8 % H2S and 1-3 % CO2 with average reservoir pressure ranging from 10,000 – 4,000 psi and average reservoir temperature of ~275oF. Best practices in terms of developing these fields by using the best technologies in drilling, completion, and production are essential to maximize the reserve recovery in order to deliver hydrocarbon to the market. Due to anhydrite presence and existing high variation of natural fracture distribution along the wellbore with different lithology and reservoir properties. There is differential pressure depletion happens within the entire reservoir, so these reservoirs have been divided into different flow units based on stratigraphy and pressure differential. These layers have different productivity index based on production logging records and calibrated well production models due to existence of dual-porosity tight matrix with natural fracture system which require proper pinpoint activation protocol by treating these layers separately. During the early development stages of these fields, these wells were completed with tapered type of completion with 3.5″ production tubing, which was used as the optimum flow rate for virgin or slightly depleted reservoirs. Nowadays, Monobore completion has been deployed so that these flow zones can be perforated, activated, stimulated, tested and isolated using plug and perf technique which provide proper stimulation fluids propagation into the target reservoir. In addition, the cluster perforation leads to better effective stimulation fracturing by bypassing formation damage due to drilling, completion & perforation debris from the illustrated case studies. This paper aims to illustrate the successful story of the cluster perforation technique in tight carbonate reservoir layers, and share its impact on pinpoint stimulation and hydraulic fracturing treatment by comparing the production performance of the studied wells with offset wells. As an additional achievement, the cluster perforation leads to cost reduction by reducing the perforation gun length, volumes of pumped treatment/wellbore diverters fluids and accelerating the well hookup to the production facility beside the sustainability of the production during the LTT. Also, that technique is better in terms of reservoir management as it supports depleting the reservoir layers uniformly. The success of this approach was proven by calibrated nodal analysis assessment and sustainability of well production at a stabilized rate, which supports reaching "optimal inflow distribution" along the different flow zones, which become a best practice approach in the newly completed wells aiming to maximize the gas recovery.

Abstract Background/Aims Activated CD4+T cells make a significant contribution to inflammation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. CD4+T cells can also express activating NK receptors such as NKG2D that can engage with stress-induced ligands such as MICA, as noted in lupus nephritis, and mediate nonspecific tissue injury. We know that cellular metabolism regulates the activation of T cells. Evidence from patients with multiple sclerosis indicates that dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an electrophile, targets cellular metabolism to modulate CD4+T cell activation and function. Here, we investigated whether DMF modulates T cell metabolism and function in samples from patients with SLE in a series of in vitro experiments. Methods All experiments were performed using isolated T cells from freshly drawn whole blood samples from patients with SLE. T cells were isolated using negative selection using stem cell or Miltenyei magnetic bead separation kit. Isolated T cells were activated with anti-CD3 and IL-2 and incubated with either DMF at 25μM concentration or DMSO alone for three or seven days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before harvesting. Results In Seahorse experiments, after three days of incubation, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) inhibited Figure A-i) the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and A-ii) extra cellular acidification rate (ECAR) in isolated T cells when compared with samples incubated with vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Our results revealed that DMF significantly inhibited: 1) aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in activated T cells from patients with SLE (n = 4) (Figure A- i and ii) in vitro; 2) T cell activation and proliferation as assessed by a reduction in the frequency of CD69 (n = 4) and D) Ki67 (n = 2) positivity, respectively (Figure B-E); 3) Collectively, these results suggest that DMF inhibits T cell activation and proliferation in samples from patients with SLE. After 7 days of incubation, DMF significantly inhibited the expression of activating NK receptors CD158a and NKG2D on T cells whereas there was a trend toward enhancing the expression of inhibitory NK receptors NKG2A and CD158b (Figure F-I). After 7 days of incubation, DMF significantly reduced intracellular expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17 and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in supernatants (Figure J - N). Conclusion Our preliminary data indicated that, in SLE patient samples, DMF modulates metabolic programming of CD4+ T cells and inhibits glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation of activated CD4+ T cells. In vitro, DMF inhibited: T cell activation; proliferation; the expression of activating NK receptors; and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from T cells patients with SLE. Taken together with the existing safety data in humans, these data provide mechanistic rationale for investigating the potential of dimethyl fumarate, with a distinct mechanism of action, as a novel therapy for SLE.

Abstract An offshore Libya mature oil field with a large gas cap underlies a massive aquifer located in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir producing an extremely corrosive crude – naturally- from [SD3][AS4]14 monobore horizontal oil wells and one gas observation well drilled across gas cap. The field suffers from increased water cut and major crossflows across perforated intervals. In previous years, all systematic and maintenance shutdowns, including those caused by force-majeure due to security and political instability in the country, were feasibly overcome by naturally restarting the field. However, recently with the increased water cut, a greater volume of water flooding into the oil-producing zones would make it impossible to reactivate the field without use of artificial lift systems. Installing any artificial lift means in a monobore completion in the depleted field would require a large investment that would make the installation uneconomical. Hence, all future planned shutdowns would be at risk without making a big investment or developing an innovative solution. Developing such a solution meant solving a complex problem in short time that demanded attention to detail, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving, using the already available operational structure to restart the field safely. N2 kickoff was initially performed to reactivate the field without success due to the large N2 quantities required to produce all flooded water into oil zones which takes from a week to few months of lifting, in additional to the logistical challenges and involved cost. A rigless electrical submersible pump does not meet the required flow rates of more than 3,000 BLPD to stop the dynamic crossflow and hence, the reactivation would not be successful. The field was already producing 46 MMscf/D of gas, most of which was burnt out. It was proposed to use part of that wasted gas or to divert the gas production of the only gas well and inject the gas through temporarily installed coiled tubing as a single gas injection point at a predefined depth to offload the flooded water and reestablish the previous production figures. In 2017, 2 wells out of 14 producing wells suffered from liquid loading and were successfully revived using conventional carbon steel single-point coiled tubing gas lift system (CTGL). In 2022, all wells in the field were affected by increasing water cut. The field went on a complete shutdown and all wells required reactivation using the CTGL technique. However, the issues that were faced in the 2017 CTGL operation would be more challenging and complex due to the greater number of wells. These challenges included corrosion pitting, upstream pressure decline (the gas well's wellhead pressure) and lifting time and efficiency with more than 1 month required per well. The greater number of wells would increase CT cost, and the increasing water cut would increase lifting time per well, which would reduce production efficiency and increase corrosion rate. Additionally, because of the urgent timeline requirement for the execution, the single injection point design was extremely critical and had to work within the specifications of the available injection pressure, required flow rates of greater than 4000 BOPD, and available CT reels in country to reactivate all wells. A small error on chosen the injection point would compromise the entire reactivation process. Because this is a sour field, two categories of CT material were required to achieve a durable CT string with acceptable pitting based on a corrosion test. Carbon steel was chosen for a 2- to 3-week lifting period and chrome for a lifting period greater than 4 weeks. This innovative solution uses the already existing platform structure to deliver a green solution. Using the only gas well as a source of gas and pressure, the reinjected gas method aligns with green business objectives with a reduction of up to 80% less CO2 compared to the other possible long-term solutions available to the project.

In order to improve forest management and forestry policy development, the development of long-term plans for the development of forests and forestry, as well as other sectors related to forestry, requires reliable data and information on the state of the forest fund. The first forest inventory in BiH was conducted in the period 1964‒1968. years, and the second only a few decades later (2006‒2009). The area of forests in Europe has been steadily declining over the last 5,000 years as a result of deforestation. The area of forests in Europe is about 227 million hectares or about 35% of the total area of the continent and since 1990 it has increased by 9.0%. The total area of forests and forest land in the Republic of Srpska is 1,352,031 hectares or 54.3% of the total area of the Republic of Srpska, and the Republic owns 1,044,939 ha (77.3%), and in private 307,092 ha or 22, 7%. One inhabitant of Republika Srpska has about 0.8 hectares of forested land. The most represented in the forest fund of the Republic of Srpska are beech forests, which cover an area of 353,751 hectares or 37.3% of the total overgrown area without shrubs. Semi-natural areas are spreading to former agricultural lands, and the largest reductions in agricultural land areas have been recorded in areas with natural bushy forest vegetation. A special problem is the area of karst (174,662 hectares), where only in some places black pine afforestation has been successfully carried out. There are very few economically valuable forests in the karst area (about 22,000 hectares), and especially high accessible forests (only 3,617 ha). The size of the mine suspected area in BiH is 965 km2 or 1.97% with 8,525 suspicious micro-locations, which are estimated to be planted with about 79,000 mines. The total wood volume of the forests of the Republic of Srpska is about 250 million m3, and the forests owned by the Republic account for about 200 million m3 (78%), and the private ones about 50 million m3 or 25%. The average volume per hectare increased in all forest categories except high degraded forests. In relation to the basic production indicators, it can be stated that the most valuable part of the inventory in the forests of Republika Srpska is related to forests belonging to the complex of mesophilic types of beech and coniferous forests in the complex of frigorophilous coniferous types of mixed beech and spruce forests forest areas (without shrubs), of which the dominant part (92%) is owned by the Republic of Srpska. Most forests (about 60% of the total forest fund of Republika Srpska) are located in the mountain zone (1000‒1500 m above sea level) with a predominance of beech and fir forests with spruce (71%), slightly less (about 36%) is in the hilly zone (500‒1000 m above sea level) with the highest share of beech forests (47%), and the lowest (about 4%) in the lowland zone (lower than 500 m above sea level) where oak forests dominate sessile on the surface of 95%. For the territory of the Republika Srpska, 9 basic groups of forest vegetation, 27 subgroups and 169 basic types of forests have been recorded on its territory. Warnings of constant climate change (average temperature rise of 0.3 to 0.6 degrees Celsius in the last decade) indicate the great importance of forest ecosystems in combating global warming. It is estimated that the forests of Republika Srpska have a total carbon reserve of about 54 million tons, and an average net annual absorption of about 1.5 million tons of carbon (or 5.6 million tons of CO2. In private forests, the size of the realized etat is higher if the average area of cadastral parcels per owner is higher even if the area of pure stands in the ownership structure is larger.It is characteristic that the realized etat with increasing area of mixed stands decreases slightly on average (Govedar et al. 2018). are composed of spruce, white and black pine, and black pine was used to establish forest crops in almost all habitats. The condition of these forests is very complex and diverse in terms of overgrowth, quality (participation of III cultivation-technical class in forest crops greater than 40%), health status, productivity, settlement of primary vegetation and deterioration of edaphic conditions, which affects the relatively poor quality of yield and often pre cheating pure into mixed stands. These stands are characterized by a large spatial dispersion of relatively small areas (over 6,000 sections with an average area of 6.85 ha). In order to improve management, urgent and timely cultivation measures are needed, primarily thinning with the use of previous yields and shortening the production period by 20‒40 years in relation to high forests of the same tree species and habitat conditions. Forest management planning was strongly intensified after the Second World War, and then it was pointed out that forests should be managed according to the principle of sustainable yield, all in order to supply the people and the industry with wood products. The basic planning level for ensuring sustainability was the forest management area, and plans based on the principle of continuity of management were made for business units, management classes and departments using the project for the execution of works. The content of forest management plans in Republika Srpska has not changed since 1992. It is unified regardless of forest quality and management intensity, and biodiversity assessment and habitat indicators are not included in management plans. There is a clear need to change attitudestowards forests and the basis is the acceptance of the principle of sustainability and multifunctionality in forest management. At the same time, the necessity of integrated, integrated and participatory forest management planning imposes a close connection between forestry and other branches (sectors). Contemporary topics in the field of forestry planning are: broad participation of stakeholders, negotiations on the rights to use forest resources and decisions leading to sustainable forestry.

The SG is a modern grid that uses digital technology to manage the flow of electricity from generators to consumers. Clean ES to SG Access to SG is a critical step towards reducing carbon emissions and increasing the use of sustainable ES. Clean ES to SG can be achieved in a number of ways, including the use of distributed generation, energy system storage, and demand response programs. Distributed ES is the use of small-scale energy production technologies, such as photovoltaic panels, wind farms and microturbines, to generate electricity near the point of use. The SG system is used to store the surplus energy generated by cleaning the ES for later use. Demand response systems encourage users to minimize electricity consumption during peak hours when demand is high. The reduction in carbon emissions is one of the main benefits of incorporating a spotless ES into an SG. The use of sustainable ES such as sustainable helps minimize CO2 emissions in the energy sector. Additionally, utilizing energy storage can help minimize the need for fossil fuels to meet peak electricity demand, thereby lowering carbon emissions. Another advantage of incorporating clean ES into SG is higher reliability of energy supply. However, there are significant difficulties in incorporating this issue into the SG. One of the most important issues is the unpredictability of sustainable energy sources such as solar or wind power. Output from these architectures can fluctuate based on weather and other conditions, making it challenging to balance market dynamics on the grid. Energy storage devices can help address this difficulty by storing the extra energy generated during high production times for use during low output times. The need for additional infrastructure to support clean ES integration with SG is another issue. This requires new supercapacitors, demand response programs, distribution networks and technologies to connect clean ES to the grid. In conclusion, incorporating this topic into SG is a key step towards reducing carbon emissions and encouraging the use of sustainable ES in the electrical industry. The benefits of SG's Sustainable Power Convergence, such as cleaner energy, greater reliability of power supply and lower total cost of power ownership, make it a valuable addition for the future, despite some drawbacks such as dispatchable Variability of ES with common project requirements.

Full text Figures and data Peer review Side by side Abstract Editor's evaluation Introduction Methods Results Discussion Data availability References Article and author information Metrics Abstract Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients experience immune compromise characterized by complex alterations of both innate and adaptive immunity, and results in higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination. This immune compromise, coupled with greater risk of exposure to infectious disease at hemodialysis (HD) centers, underscores the need for examination of the immune response to the COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines. Methods: The immune response to the COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was assessed in 20 HD patients and cohort-matched controls. RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed longitudinally before and after each vaccination dose for a total of six time points per subject. Anti-spike antibody levels were quantified prior to the first vaccination dose (V1D0) and 7 d after the second dose (V2D7) using anti-spike IgG titers and antibody neutralization assays. Anti-spike IgG titers were additionally quantified 6 mo after initial vaccination. Clinical history and lab values in HD patients were obtained to identify predictors of vaccination response. Results: Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated differing time courses of immune responses, with prolonged myeloid cell activity in HD at 1 wk after the first vaccination dose. HD also demonstrated decreased metabolic activity and decreased antigen presentation compared to controls after the second vaccination dose. Anti-spike IgG titers and neutralizing function were substantially elevated in both controls and HD at V2D7, with a small but significant reduction in titers in HD groups (p<0.05). Anti-spike IgG remained elevated above baseline at 6 mo in both subject groups. Anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 were highly predictive of 6-month titer levels. Transcriptomic biomarkers after the second vaccination dose and clinical biomarkers including ferritin levels were found to be predictive of antibody development. Conclusions: Overall, we demonstrate differing time courses of immune responses to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in maintenance HD subjects comparable to healthy controls and identify transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG titers in HD. Analyzing vaccination as an in vivo perturbation, our results warrant further characterization of the immune dysregulation of ESRD. Funding: F30HD102093, F30HL151182, T32HL144909, R01HL138628. This research has been funded by the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) award UL1TR002003. Editor's evaluation Chang et al. demonstrate through their findings that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination of hemodialysis patients produces no significant difference in antibody levels achieved across the vaccination series. However, they find that T-cell responses may be delayed in hemodialysis patients as they have lower activation of T-cell genes than healthy controls. The RNA sequencing evidence is solid. However, they lack data on a clinical correlation to T-cell responses. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83641.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most advanced stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with prevalence in the United States reaching 809,000 in 2019 (Johansen et al., 2022). The most used form of renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients in the United States is hemodialysis (HD). Despite significant improvements in HD technology, the mortality rate in ESRD patients is still as high as 20% annually (Williams et al., 2004), with infections being the most common cause of hospitalization and mortality after cardiovascular disease (Kato et al., 2008). The immunocompromised state of ESRD is characterized by simultaneous immunodepression due to the impact of uremic milieu on immunocompetent cells and immunoactivation due to the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines (Kato et al., 2008). There are alterations to both innate and adaptive immunity, including elevated levels of mannose-binding lectin (Satomura et al., 2002), impaired maturation of monocytes and dendritic cells (Satomura et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2007), increased B cell apoptosis (Fernández-Fresnedo et al., 2000), and decreased T-cell proliferation with elevated Th1/Th2 ratio (Stenvinkel et al., 2005). Studies of genome-wide expression (i.e., transcriptome) profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ESRD demonstrate a complex picture of immune alterations. One study found upregulation of genes involved in the complement and oxidative metabolism pathways, and downregulation of genes associated with the clathrin-coated vesicle endosomal pathway and T-cell receptor signaling (Scherer et al., 2013). Two other studies have demonstrated impaired expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function (Granata et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2002). A study identifying a group of inflammatory genes playing a causative role in oxidative stress in dialysis patients showed unique gene expression alterations in maintenance HD patients compared to un-dialyzed CKD patients and compared to patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (Zaza et al., 2008). These studies indicate a range of immune pathways that may impair vaccination response, and further suggest that dialysis leads to unique immune profile alterations. These alterations may lead to higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination (Ghadiani et al., 2012). For example, while more than 90% of patients without CKD develop protective antibodies against HBV after vaccination, only 50–60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert. There have also been higher vaccination failure rates demonstrated against influenza virus, Clostridium tetani, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae in ESRD (Eleftheriadis et al., 2007). Understanding the immune response to vaccines in ESRD is particularly important for the new mRNA vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have proven to be efficacious in non-immunocompromised individuals, with initial reports showing 95 and 94.1% reduction of COVID-19 disease in recipients (Baden et al., 2021; Polack et al., 2020). However, certain immunosuppressed populations remain at risk of infection. Given the widespread transmission of COVID-19, detailed assessments of degree, duration, and determinants of immune protection conferred by these vaccines are vitally needed in immunocompromised patient populations including those with ESRD. While recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 BTN162b2 vaccine in HD demonstrate high levels of seroconversion ranging from 84 to 96% (Grupper et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021; Attias et al., 2021; Anand et al., 2021), they also demonstrate quantitatively reduced SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We posit that characterization of the transcriptomic underpinnings of antibody titer development on a continuous scale may identify biomarkers for weaker or less durable immune protection in this population. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses may identify strategies for the development of new, effective vaccines against other infectious diseases for this population. Thus, we characterized the immune response of the HD population to the COVID-19 mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine using mRNA sequencing, anti-spike antibody ELISA, and neutralization titers across multiple time points. We then integrated these data to identify transcriptomic and clinical determinants of the humoral immune response in HD patients. Methods Study population and sample acquisition The study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago IRB (#2018-1038) Ethics Review Committee. Maintenance HD patients undergoing vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021 were recruited from the outpatient HD unit at the University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) in Chicago, IL. Control subjects consisted of UIH employees undergoing BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination at UIH from December 2020 to January 2021 with no self-reported history of kidney disease or immune disorders. All subjects provided informed consent for participation in this research and for publication of results. A subset of control subjects matched for age, gender, and COVID-19 history was also analyzed for this study. Blood was collected at 0–48 hr prior to and at multiple time points after both the first (V1) and second vaccination doses (V2), which were administered 3 wk apart. Control samples were collected prior to each vaccination dose (D0) and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7. Blood was collected from HD subjects prior to each vaccination dose and at 2 d (D2) and 7 d after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D2, V1D7, V2D0, V2D2, and V2D7. A final blood sample was drawn 6 mo after initial vaccination (M6) for measurement of antibody titers, prior to additional vaccination doses. Serum and PBMCs were extracted within 2 hr of blood collection, then stored at –80°C. PBMCs were extracted using density gradient centrifugation at 400 × g with Ficoll–Paque PLUS. The extracted buffy coat was stored in RNAlater (Invitrogen). Clinical and demographic characterization Demographic and clinical data was collected from the electronic health record (EHR) for HD subjects, including medical diagnoses, medications, and laboratory values. Laboratory values included monthly SARS-CoV-2 test results, as well as urea reduction ratio (URR, a measure of dialysis adequacy), hemoglobin (Hgb), ferritin, transferrin saturation, albumin levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, and WBC differential counts obtained during standard of care monthly blood draws for the 3 mo preceding vaccination. Within our analyses, ferritin was coded as either low risk (200–1200 ng/ml) or high risk (<200 or >1200 ng/ml) since ferritin levels 200–1200 ng/ml have been shown to be associated with lowest all-cause mortality in HD patients (Kalantar-Zadeh et al., 2005). Baseline clinical lab values were calculated as the median of three lab values across the 3 mo prior to vaccination. Demographic and clinical data was collected from a medical questionnaire at time of consent for control subjects, and included medical history, medications, and self-reported prior SARS-CoV-2-positive test results. RNA extraction and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) RNA sequencing was performed on PBMCs at all V1 and V2 time points for all subjects for whom RNA libraries were successfully built at >5 time points. PBMCs stored in RNAlater were thawed and diluted 1:1 with 1× phosphate buffered saline. The mixture was then pelleted and RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini kit (Invitrogen). DNase treatment to remove genomic DNA contamination was performed using either the PureLink DNase kit or DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Invitrogen). Purified RNA in sterile water was stored at –80°C. Each RNA sample was quantified using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity kit (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer RNA Pico kit (Agilent) with RIN ≥ 8. For library construction, 50 ng of RNA from each sample was aliquoted in 96-well plates. Libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with the optional NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England BioLabs). Each individual sample library was barcoded during PCR amplification using unique dual indexed i5 and i7 primers from the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit. Each sample library was quantified using the Qubit DNA High Sensitivity kit and Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity kit. Samples were then pooled and sequenced using the MiSeq Nano V2 kit (Illumina) to check read proportions between samples. Samples with lower-than-expected percentage of reads detected were supplemented with an additional spike-in of sample library to the main pool. The supplemented pooled library was sequenced again using the MiSeq Nano V2 kit to verify adequate adjustment. The finalized library was sequenced using a NovaSeq S2 flow cell configured for 75 bp paired end output. Differential gene expression analysis Raw demultiplexed reads were filtered using fastp to remove adapters and short reads (Chen et al., 2018). Trimmed reads were then quantified using the Salmon pipeline with an hg38 reference transcriptome index (Patro et al., 2017). Quantified data was imported into R using the tximeta package (Love et al., 2020) to convert Salmon quantification and index data to a count matrix. Transcript names were extracted and matched using Entrez IDs with the AnnotationHub package (Love et al., 2020). This finalized count matrix was then imported into a DESeqDataset object and normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation in DESeq2. The DESeq2 R package was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed at each time point after vaccination for each subject group. Specifically, we implemented a design incorporating group-specific condition effects with individual subjects nested within groups. We performed the classical Deseq2 workflow of estimation of size factors, estimation of dispersion, and negative binomial GLM fitting for βi and Wald statistics, increasing the maximum number of iterations for estimation of the negative binomial distribution to 500. We then generated contrasts to obtain differentially expressed genes for controls at V1D1 and V1D7 (compared to V1D0), and at V2D1 and V2D7 (compared to V2D0). Differentially expressed genes for HD were similarly obtained at V1D2 and V1D7 (compared to V1D0), and at V2D2 and V2D7 (compared to V2D0). We also directly compared gene expression between controls and HD at V1D7 and at V2D7. The significance threshold to determine differential expression was FDR-adjusted (p<0.05). Anti-spike (trimer) IgG titer quantification The Human SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Trimer) IgG ELISA Kit from Invitrogen was used to quantitate IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples at V1D0, V2D7, and M6 time points. All samples were initially diluted 1:100 (in addition to the 1:10 assay buffer dilution on the 96-well plate) and assayed in duplicate, with twofold serial dilution of the 150,000 units/ml standard control in duplicate for relative quantification. Absorbance at 450 nm was quantified using a Spark multimode microplate reader. Samples that produced signals greater than the upper limit of the standard curve were diluted 1:2000 and assayed again. IgG concentration was calculated by fitting four-parameter logistic curves to the standard controls and taking the average concentrations of duplicates. Antibody neutralization assays Neutralization assays were performed on serum samples from V1D0 and V2D7 using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus (pseudovirus). To produce pseudoviruses, an expression plasmid bearing codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length S plasmid was co-transfected into HEK293T cells using the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particle Kit (BEI # R-52948). The cell supernatants were collected 72 hr after transfection, divided into aliquots and cryopreserved at −80°C. To titrate the pseudovirus, 5 × 103 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin. Twenty-four hours later, the pseudovirus was diluted 1:10, followed by fivefold serial dilutions for a total of nine dilutions, with each dilution performed in six replicate wells. After incubation at 37°C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 72 hr, the luciferase substrate was added to the 96-well plate for chemiluminescence detection. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the pseudovirus was calculated according to the Reed–Muench method in the titration macro template (Matumoto, 1949). Neutralization activity against SARS-2-CoV was measured in a single-round-of-infection assay with pseudoviruses as previously described (Nie et al., 2020). 5 × 103 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, serial dilutions of the serum samples were performed, incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with ~1000 TCID50/ml of pseudovirus, then added to monolayers of ACE2-overexpressing 293T cells in quadruplicate. The cell control with cells alone and the virus control (VC) with pseudovirus were set up in each plate. The target cells were incubated for 65–72 hr at 37°C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2. Then, 50 µl of Bright-Glo, reconstituted following the manufacturer's instructions, was added to each well of the 96-well plate and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The 96-well plate was read by a 96-well luminescence plate reader (Tecan Genius Pro plate reader) (Ferrara and Temperton, 2018). Percent neutralization was calculated as 100 * ([Virus-only control] – [Virus plus serum])/[Virus-only control], and neutralizing titer levels are reported as the serum dilution required to achieve 50% neutralization (50% inhibitory dilution [ID50]) (Pegu et al., 2021). The input dilution of serum was 1:20, thus 20 is the lower limit of quantification. BTM module enrichment analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for each contrast generated in the DESeq2 analysis above using blood transcription module (BTMs) gene sets (Li et al., 2014). BTMs with FDR-adjusted p<0.05 were considered significantly enriched. Enriched BTMs were further characterized using the distribution of Wald statistics of membership genes from DESeq2. To summarize BTM analyses, BTMs were categorized into different families: B cells, cell cycle, dendritic cell/antigen presentation, type I interferon (IFN type I), myeloid activity/inflammation/ T/NK cells, and 'others' (Braun et al., 2018). The percentage of BTMs in each BTM family with significant enrichment at each time point was then quantified over time. Statistical analysis of antibody response To determine the effect of vaccination on anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 and M6, Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed separately for HD subjects and controls. For each group, anti-spike IgG titer levels were compared to assess for the significant effect of time (V1D0, V2D7, M6), and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed with FDR correction to assess significant differences between each pair of time points (V2D7 vs. V1D0, M6 vs. V1D0, M6 vs. V2D7). To determine the effect of vaccination on antibody neutralization activity (ID50) at V2D7, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed for each group to compare V2D7 vs. V1D0. Linear models were constructed to establish the effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and subject group on anti-spike IgG titer development at V2D7 and M6 and neutralization activity at V2D7. Specifically, log-transformed V2D7 anti-spike IgG titers or V2D7 neutralization activity (ID50) were modeled as the dependent variable, with subject group (HD or controls), log-transformed V1D0 anti-spike IgG titers or V1D0 neutralization activity (ID50), gender, age, race, and ethnicity as independent predictors. To determine predictors of anti-spike IgG at 6 mo, a linear model was constructed with the log-transformed M6 anti-spike IgG titers as the dependent variable, and V2D7 anti-spike IgG titers, SARS-CoV-2 history, gender, age, race, and ethnicity as independent predictors. Identification of BTM and clinical predictors of Ab response in HD BTM predictors of antibody response in HD were identified by first calculating a representative expression level of each BTM per sample, which we will refer to as the eigengene. Specifically, the first principal component of each BTM was calculated using DESeq2-derived variance-stabilized gene counts from each module's member genes across the HD V1 time points, and then across the HD V2 time points. Signs (positive or negative) were assigned to the eigengenes such that samples with higher expression of member genes in a BTM would be given a positive sign, while those with lower overall gene expression would be given a negative sign. This was accomplished for each BTM by (1) computing the median gene expression level across membership genes in a given BTM for each sample, (2) computing the Pearson correlation between the eigengene of the BTM and the median gene expression level across all samples, and (3) multiplying the eigengene of the BTM by –1 if the correlation was negative. Subsequently, we constructed linear models with log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 as the dependent variable and change in BTM eigengene expression after vaccination as the independent variable, controlling for SARS-CoV-2 history. Separate models were constructed for each BTM that was enriched at each time point after vaccination in HD (V1D2 vs. V1D0, V1D7 vs. V1D0, V2D2 vs. V2D0, V2D0 V2D7). Change in BTM expression was calculated as the BTM eigengene after vaccination minus the BTM eigengene before vaccination. p-values were FDR-adjusted across number of enriched BTMs per time point. Additionally, baseline clinical laboratory values predictive of antibody response in the HD subjects were identified. Linear models were separately constructed using URR, ferritin (high risk vs. low risk), transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and WBC count to predict log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 and M6. Finally, clinical laboratory values responding to vaccination that predicted antibody titer response in the HD subjects were identified. Linear models were separately constructed using log-fold change (LFC) from baseline measurements of ferritin (continuous instead of binarized low- and high-risk), transferrin saturation, and WBC count to predict log-transformed anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 and M6. Results Demographic and clinical characterization Demographic and clinical data of the 20 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and controls (HC) are summarized in Table 1. The racial distribution differed between cohorts with more Black/African American subjects in the HD cohort. The cohorts were otherwise demographically similar. The subjects within the HD cohort had significantly more comorbidities, most notable of which include type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular conditions. The most common causes of renal failure were T2DM and HTN, with a minority of cases attributed to anatomic defects (reflux uropathy) and autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematous and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura).

Five control subjects self-reported a prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with positive test dates ranging from 8 mo to 4 wk preceding vaccination. Detailed clinical characterization of HD subjects is summarized in Table 2. Notable laboratory data includes an elevated ferritin from normal (with high population variance) and anemia.

All subjects received two BTN162b2 vaccination doses with the second dose (V2) administered 3 wk after the first (V1). Anti-spike IgG binding and neutralizing assay data were obtained for all subjects prior to V1 (V1D0) and 7 d after V2 (V2D7). RNA sequencing data was obtained for all control subjects prior to each vaccination dose (D0), and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7. One control subject is missing V2D0 data, and one is missing V2D1 data. RNA sequencing data was obtained for 12 HD subjects prior to each vaccination dose, and at 2 d (D2) and 7 d after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D2, V1D7, V2D0, V2D2, and V2D7. Two HD subjects are missing V2D2 data. Sequencing data was not obtained for subjects with fewer than five time points of successfully constructed RNA libraries due to time points without sample collection or failure to extract high-quality mRNA from PBMCs. Six-month follow-up (M6) anti-spike IgG binding titers were obtained for 15 HC subjects and 19 HD subjects. One HD subject tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 14 d after the second vaccination dose, demonstrating mild symptoms. None of the other subjects reported SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 6 mo follow-up after the second vaccination. Differential gene expression analysis To characterize the molecular basis of immune responses to vaccination in HC and HD, we performed differential gene expression analyses of the PBMC RNA sequencing data. There are substantially more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to V2 compared to V1, and at D1 and D2 post-vaccination compared to D7 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). For HC, the largest number of DEGs is found at V2D1 (3974), indicating the most transcriptional activity immediately after the second vaccine dose, followed by V2D7 (177), V1D1 (128), and V1D7 (10). HD follows a similar pattern, with the largest number of DEGs found at V2D2 (1,111), followed by V2D7 (153), V1D2 (68), and V1D7 (8). Notably, HD subjects with no SARS-CoV-2 history (n = 6) have substantially lower numbers of DEGs than HD subjects with positive SARS-CoV-2 history (n = 6) at each time point, and particularly at V2 time points (Figure 1A).Direct comparison of gene expression between HC and HD with no prior reported SARS-CoV-2 infection at V1D7 yielded five DEGs in HD versus HC including increased expression of chemokine CCL19 in HD (p<0.05, FDR-corrected). Comparison of these same groups at V2D7 yielded 18 DEGs including increased expression in HD of TIA1, which encodes a granule-associated protein expressed in cytolytic lymphocytes (Anderson et al., 1990) and natural killer cells, and BH3, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member and mediator of lymphocyte apoptosis (Labi et al., 2008).

See Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for healthy control (HC) and HD data independent of SARS-CoV-2 history.

Density plots for each BTM represent Wald statistics from DESeq2 analysis for each membership gene, thereby representing increased or decreased expression per gene at each time point compared to baseline (V1D0 or V2D0).

Full text Figures and data Peer review Side by side Abstract Editor's evaluation Introduction Methods Results Discussion Data availability References Article and author information Metrics Abstract Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients experience immune compromise characterized by complex alterations of both innate and adaptive immunity, and results in higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination. This immune compromise, coupled with greater risk of exposure to infectious disease at hemodialysis (HD) centers, underscores the need for examination of the immune response to the COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines. Methods: The immune response to the COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was assessed in 20 HD patients and cohort-matched controls. RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed longitudinally before and after each vaccination dose for a total of six time points per subject. Anti-spike antibody levels were quantified prior to the first vaccination dose (V1D0) and 7 d after the second dose (V2D7) using anti-spike IgG titers and antibody neutralization assays. Anti-spike IgG titers were additionally quantified 6 mo after initial vaccination. Clinical history and lab values in HD patients were obtained to identify predictors of vaccination response. Results: Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated differing time courses of immune responses, with prolonged myeloid cell activity in HD at 1 wk after the first vaccination dose. HD also demonstrated decreased metabolic activity and decreased antigen presentation compared to controls after the second vaccination dose. Anti-spike IgG titers and neutralizing function were substantially elevated in both controls and HD at V2D7, with a small but significant reduction in titers in HD groups (p<0.05). Anti-spike IgG remained elevated above baseline at 6 mo in both subject groups. Anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 were highly predictive of 6-month titer levels. Transcriptomic biomarkers after the second vaccination dose and clinical biomarkers including ferritin levels were found to be predictive of antibody development. Conclusions: Overall, we demonstrate differing time courses of immune responses to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in maintenance HD subjects comparable to healthy controls and identify transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG titers in HD. Analyzing vaccination as an in vivo perturbation, our results warrant further characterization of the immune dysregulation of ESRD. Funding: F30HD102093, F30HL151182, T32HL144909, R01HL138628. This research has been funded by the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) award UL1TR002003. Editor's evaluation Chang et al. demonstrate through their findings that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination of hemodialysis patients produces no significant difference in antibody levels achieved across the vaccination series. However, they find that T-cell responses may be delayed in hemodialysis patients as they have lower activation of T-cell genes than healthy controls. The RNA sequencing evidence is solid. However, they lack data on a clinical correlation to T-cell responses. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83641.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most advanced stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with prevalence in the United States reaching 809,000 in 2019 (Johansen et al., 2022). The most used form of renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients in the United States is hemodialysis (HD). Despite significant improvements in HD technology, the mortality rate in ESRD patients is still as high as 20% annually (Williams et al., 2004), with infections being the most common cause of hospitalization and mortality after cardiovascular disease (Kato et al., 2008). The immunocompromised state of ESRD is characterized by simultaneous immunodepression due to the impact of uremic milieu on immunocompetent cells and immunoactivation due to the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines (Kato et al., 2008). There are alterations to both innate and adaptive immunity, including elevated levels of mannose-binding lectin (Satomura et al., 2002), impaired maturation of monocytes and dendritic cells (Satomura et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2007), increased B cell apoptosis (Fernández-Fresnedo et al., 2000), and decreased T-cell proliferation with elevated Th1/Th2 ratio (Stenvinkel et al., 2005). Studies of genome-wide expression (i.e., transcriptome) profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ESRD demonstrate a complex picture of immune alterations. One study found upregulation of genes involved in the complement and oxidative metabolism pathways, and downregulation of genes associated with the clathrin-coated vesicle endosomal pathway and T-cell receptor signaling (Scherer et al., 2013). Two other studies have demonstrated impaired expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function (Granata et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2002). A study identifying a group of inflammatory genes playing a causative role in oxidative stress in dialysis patients showed unique gene expression alterations in maintenance HD patients compared to un-dialyzed CKD patients and compared to patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (Zaza et al., 2008). These studies indicate a range of immune pathways that may impair vaccination response, and further suggest that dialysis leads to unique immune profile alterations. These alterations may lead to higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination (Ghadiani et al., 2012). For example, while more than 90% of patients without CKD develop protective antibodies against HBV after vaccination, only 50–60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert. There have also been higher vaccination failure rates demonstrated against influenza virus, Clostridium tetani, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae in ESRD (Eleftheriadis et al., 2007). Understanding the immune response to vaccines in ESRD is particularly important for the new mRNA vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have proven to be efficacious in non-immunocompromised individuals, with initial reports showing 95 and 94.1% reduction of COVID-19 disease in recipients (Baden et al., 2021; Polack et al., 2020). However, certain immunosuppressed populations remain at risk of infection. Given the widespread transmission of COVID-19, detailed assessments of degree, duration, and determinants of immune protection conferred by these vaccines are vitally needed in immunocompromised patient populations including those with ESRD. While recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 BTN162b2 vaccine in HD demonstrate high levels of seroconversion ranging from 84 to 96% (Grupper et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021; Attias et al., 2021; Anand et al., 2021), they also demonstrate quantitatively reduced SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We posit that characterization of the transcriptomic underpinnings of antibody titer development on a continuous scale may identify biomarkers for weaker or less durable immune protection in this population. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses may identify strategies for the development of new, effective vaccines against other infectious diseases for this population. Thus, we characterized the immune response of the HD population to the COVID-19 mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine using mRNA sequencing, anti-spike antibody ELISA, and neutralization titers across multiple time points. We then integrated these data to identify transcriptomic and clinical determinants of the humoral immune response in HD patients. Methods Study population and sample acquisition The study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago IRB (#2018-1038) Ethics Review Committee. Maintenance HD patients undergoing vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021 were recruited from the outpatient HD unit at the University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) in Chicago, IL. Control subjects consisted of UIH employees undergoing BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination at UIH from December 2020 to January 2021 with no self-reported history of kidney disease or immune disorders. All subjects provided informed consent for participation in this research and for publication of results. A subset of control subjects matched for age, gender, and COVID-19 history was also analyzed for this study. Blood was collected at 0–48 hr prior to and at multiple time points after both the first (V1) and second vaccination doses (V2), which were administered 3 wk apart. Control samples were collected prior to each vaccination dose (D0) and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7. Blood was collected from HD subjects prior to each vaccination dose and at 2 d (D2) and 7 d after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D2, V1D7, V2D0, V2D2, and V2D7. A final blood sample was drawn 6 mo after initial vaccination (M6) for measurement of antibody titers, prior to additional vaccination doses. Serum and PBMCs were extracted within 2 hr of blood collection, then stored at –80°C. PBMCs were extracted using density gradient centrifugation at 400 × g with Ficoll–Paque PLUS. The extracted buffy coat was stored in RNAlater (Invitrogen). Clinical and demographic characterization Demographic and clinical data was collected from the electronic health record (EHR) for HD subjects, including medical diagnoses, medications, and laboratory values. Laboratory values included monthly SARS-CoV-2 test results, as well as urea reduction ratio (URR, a measure of dialysis adequacy), hemoglobin (Hgb), ferritin, transferrin saturation, albumin levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, and WBC differential counts obtained during standard of care monthly blood draws for the 3 mo preceding vaccination. Within our analyses, ferritin was coded as either low risk (200–1200 ng/ml) or high risk (<200 or >1200 ng/ml) since ferritin levels 200–1200 ng/ml have been shown to be associated with lowest all-cause mortality in HD patients (Kalantar-Zadeh et al., 2005). Baseline clinical lab values were calculated as the median of three lab values across the 3 mo prior to vaccination. Demographic and clinical data was collected from a medical questionnaire at time of consent for control subjects, and included medical history, medications, and self-reported prior SARS-CoV-2-positive test results. RNA extraction and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) RNA sequencing was performed on PBMCs at all V1 and V2 time points for all subjects for whom RNA libraries were successfully built at >5 time points. PBMCs stored in RNAlater were thawed and diluted 1:1 with 1× phosphate buffered saline. The mixture was then pelleted and RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini kit (Invitrogen). DNase treatment to remove genomic DNA contamination was performed using either the PureLink DNase kit or DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Invitrogen). Purified RNA in sterile water was stored at –80°C. Each RNA sample was quantified using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity kit (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer RNA Pico kit (Agilent) with RIN ≥ 8. For library construction, 50 ng of RNA from each sample was aliquoted in 96-well plates. Libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with the optional NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England BioLabs). Each individual sample library was barcoded during PCR amplification using unique dual indexed i5 and i7 primers from the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit. Each sample library was quantified using the Qubit DNA High Sensitivity kit and Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity kit. Samples were then pooled and sequenced using the MiSeq Nano V2 kit (Illumina) to check read proportions between samples. Samples with lower-than-expected percentage of reads detected were supplemented with an additional spike-in of sample library to the main pool. The supplemented pooled library was sequenced again using the MiSeq Nano V2 kit to verify adequate adjustment. The finalized library was sequenced using a NovaSeq S2 flow cell configured for 75 bp paired end output. Differential gene expression analysis Raw demultiplexed reads were filtered using fastp to remove adapters and short reads (Chen et al., 2018). Trimmed reads were then quantified using the Salmon pipeline with an hg38 reference transcriptome index (Patro et al., 2017). Quantified data was imported into R using the tximeta package (Love et al., 2020) to convert Salmon quantification and index data to a count matrix. Transcript names were extracted and matched using Entrez IDs with the AnnotationHub package (Love et al., 2020). This finalized count matrix was then imported into a DESeqDataset object and normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation in DESeq2. The DESeq2 R package was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed at each time point after vaccination for each subject group. Specifically, we implemented a design incorporating group-specific condition effects with individual subjects nested within groups. We performed the classical Deseq2 workflow of estimation of size factors, estimation of dispersion, and negative binomial GLM fitting for βi and Wald statistics, increasing the maximum number of iterations for estimation of the negative binomial distribution to 500. We then generated contrasts to obtain differentially expressed genes for controls at V1D1 and V1D7 (compared to V1D0), and at V2D1 and V2D7 (compared to V2D0). Differentially expressed genes for HD were similarly obtained at V1D2 and V1D7 (compared to V1D0), and at V2D2 and V2D7 (compared to V2D0). We also directly compared gene expression between controls and HD at V1D7 and at V2D7. The significance threshold to determine differential expression was FDR-adjusted (p<0.05). Anti-spike (trimer) IgG titer quantification The Human SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Trimer) IgG ELISA Kit from Invitrogen was used to quantitate IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples at V1D0, V2D7, and M6 time points. All samples were initially diluted 1:100 (in addition to the 1:10 assay buffer dilution on the 96-well plate) and assayed in duplicate, with twofold serial dilution of the 150,000 units/ml standard control in duplicate for relative quantification. Absorbance at 450 nm was quantified using a Spark multimode microplate reader. Samples that produced signals greater than the upper limit of the standard curve were diluted 1:2000 and assayed again. IgG concentration was calculated by fitting four-parameter logistic curves to the standard controls and taking the average concentrations of duplicates. Antibody neutralization assays Neutralization assays were performed on serum samples from V1D0 and V2D7 using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus (pseudovirus). To produce pseudoviruses, an expression plasmid bearing codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length S plasmid was co-transfected into HEK293T cells using the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particle Kit (BEI # R-52948). The cell supernatants were collected 72 hr after transfection, divided into aliquots and cryopreserved at −80°C. To titrate the pseudovirus, 5 × 103 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin. Twenty-four hours later, the pseudovirus was diluted 1:10, followed by fivefold serial dilutions for a total of nine dilutions, with each dilution performed in six replicate wells. After incubation at 37°C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 for 72 hr, the luciferase substrate was added to the 96-well plate for chemiluminescence detection. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the pseudovirus was calculated according to the Reed–Muench method in the titration macro template (Matumoto, 1949). Neutralization activity against SARS-2-CoV was measured in a single-round-of-infection assay with pseudoviruses as previously described (Nie et al., 2020). 5 × 103 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, serial dilutions of the serum samples were performed, incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with ~1000 TCID50/ml of pseudovirus, then added to monolayers of ACE2-overexpressing 293T cells in quadruplicate. The cell control with cells alone and the virus control (VC) with pseudovirus were set up in each plate. The target cells were incubated for 65–72 hr at 37°C and 5% (vol/vol) CO2. Then, 50 µl of Bright-Glo, reconstituted following the manufacturer's instructions, was added to each well of the 96-well plate and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The 96-well plate was read by a 96-well luminescence plate reader (Tecan Genius Pro plate reader) (Ferrara and Temperton, 2018). Percent neutralization was calculated as 100 * ([Virus-only control] – [Virus plus serum])/[Virus-only control], and neutralizing titer levels are reported as the serum dilution required to achieve 50% neutralization (50% inhibitory dilution [ID50]) (Pegu et al., 2021). The input dilution of serum was 1:20, thus 20 is the lower limit of quantification. BTM module enrichment analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for each contrast generated in the DESeq2 analysis above using blood transcription module (BTMs) gene sets (Li et al., 2014). BTMs with FDR-adjusted p<0.05 were considered significantly enriched. Enriched BTMs were further characterized using the distribution of Wald statistics of membership genes from DESeq2. To summarize BTM analyses, BTMs were categorized into different families: B cells, cell cycle, dendritic cell/antigen presentation, type I interferon (IFN type I), myeloid activity/inflammation/ T/NK cells, and 'others' (Braun et al., 2018). The percentage of BTMs in each BTM family with significant enrichment at each time point was then quantified over time. Statistical analysis of antibody response To determine the effect of vaccination on anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 and M6, Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed separately for HD subjects and controls. For each group, anti-spike IgG titer levels were compared to assess for the significant effect of time (V1D0, V2D7, M6), and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed with FDR correction to assess significant differences between each pair of time points (V2D7 vs. V1D0, M6 vs. V1D0, M6 vs. V2D7). To determine the effect of vaccination on antibody neutralization activity (ID50) at V2D7, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed for each group to compare V2D7 vs. V1D0. Linear models were constructed to establish the effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and subject group on anti-spike IgG titer development at V2D7 and M6 and neutralization activity at V2D7. Specifically, log-transformed V2D7 anti-spike IgG titers or V2D7 neutralization activity (ID50) were modeled as the dependent variable, with subject group (HD or controls), log-transformed V1D0 anti-spike IgG titers or V1D0 neutralization activity (ID50), gender, age, race, and ethnicity as independent predictors. To determine predictors of anti-spike IgG at 6 mo, a linear model was constructed with the log-transformed M6 anti-spike IgG titers as the dependent variable, and V2D7 anti-spike IgG titers, SARS-CoV-2 history, gender, age, race, and ethnicity as independent predictors. Identification of BTM and clinical predictors of Ab response in HD BTM predictors of antibody response in HD were identified by first calculating a representative expression level of each BTM per sample, which we will refer to as the eigengene. Specifically, the first principal component of each BTM was calculated using DESeq2-derived variance-stabilized gene counts from each module's member genes across the HD V1 time points, and then across the HD V2 time points. Signs (positive or negative) were assigned to the eigengenes such that samples with higher expression of member genes in a BTM would be given a positive sign, while those with lower overall gene expression would be given a negative sign. This was accomplished for each BTM by (1) computing the median gene expression level across membership genes in a given BTM for each sample, (2) computing the Pearson correlation between the eigengene of the BTM and the median gene expression level across all samples, and (3) multiplying the eigengene of the BTM by –1 if the correlation was negative. Subsequently, we constructed linear models with log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 as the dependent variable and change in BTM eigengene expression after vaccination as the independent variable, controlling for SARS-CoV-2 history. Separate models were constructed for each BTM that was enriched at each time point after vaccination in HD (V1D2 vs. V1D0, V1D7 vs. V1D0, V2D2 vs. V2D0, V2D0 V2D7). Change in BTM expression was calculated as the BTM eigengene after vaccination minus the BTM eigengene before vaccination. p-values were FDR-adjusted across number of enriched BTMs per time point. Additionally, baseline clinical laboratory values predictive of antibody response in the HD subjects were identified. Linear models were separately constructed using URR, ferritin (high risk vs. low risk), transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and WBC count to predict log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 and M6. Finally, clinical laboratory values responding to vaccination that predicted antibody titer response in the HD subjects were identified. Linear models were separately constructed using log-fold change (LFC) from baseline measurements of ferritin (continuous instead of binarized low- and high-risk), transferrin saturation, and WBC count to predict log-transformed anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 and M6. Results Demographic and clinical characterization Demographic and clinical data of the 20 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and controls (HC) are summarized in Table 1. The racial distribution differed between cohorts with more Black/African American subjects in the HD cohort. The cohorts were otherwise demographically similar. The subjects within the HD cohort had significantly more comorbidities, most notable of which include type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular conditions. The most common causes of renal failure were T2DM and HTN, with a minority of cases attributed to anatomic defects (reflux uropathy) and autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematous and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura).

There were eight HD subjects who previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with positive test dates ranging from 7 mo to 4 wk preceding vaccination. Five control subjects self-reported a prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with positive test dates ranging from 8 mo to 4 wk preceding vaccination. Detailed clinical characterization of HD subjects is summarized in Table 2. Notable laboratory data includes an elevated ferritin from normal (with high population variance) and anemia.

All subjects received two BTN162b2 vaccination doses with the second dose (V2) administered 3 wk after the first (V1). Anti-spike IgG binding and neutralizing assay data were obtained for all subjects prior to V1 (V1D0) and 7 d after V2 (V2D7). RNA sequencing data was obtained for all control subjects prior to each vaccination dose (D0), and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7. One control subject is missing V2D0 data, and one is missing V2D1 data. RNA sequencing data was obtained for 12 HD subjects prior to each vaccination dose, and at 2 d (D2) and 7 d after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D2, V1D7, V2D0, V2D2, and V2D7. Two HD subjects are missing V2D2 data. Sequencing data was not obtained for subjects with fewer than five time points of successfully constructed RNA libraries due to time points without sample collection or failure to extract high-quality mRNA from PBMCs. Six-month follow-up (M6) anti-spike IgG binding titers were obtained for 15 HC subjects and 19 HD subjects. One HD subject tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 14 d after the second vaccination dose, demonstrating mild symptoms. None of the other subjects reported SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 6 mo follow-up after the second vaccination. Differential gene expression analysis To characterize the molecular basis of immune responses to vaccination in HC and HD, we performed differential gene expression analyses of the PBMC RNA sequencing data. There are substantially more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to V2 compared to V1, and at D1 and D2 post-vaccination compared to D7 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). For HC, the largest number of DEGs is found at V2D1 (3974), indicating the most transcriptional activity immediately after the second vaccine dose, followed by V2D7 (177), V1D1 (128), and V1D7 (10). HD follows a similar pattern, with the largest number of DEGs found at V2D2 (1,111), followed by V2D7 (153), V1D2 (68), and V1D7 (8). Notably, HD subjects with no SARS-CoV-2 history (n = 6) have substantially lower numbers of DEGs than HD subjects with positive SARS-CoV-2 history (n = 6) at each time point, and particularly at V2 time points (Figure 1A).Direct comparison of gene expression between HC and HD with no prior reported SARS-CoV-2 infection at V1D7 yielded five DEGs in HD versus HC including increased expression of chemokine CCL19 in HD (p<0.05, FDR-corrected). Comparison of these same groups at V2D7 yielded 18 DEGs including increased expression in HD of TIA1, which encodes a granule-associated protein expressed in cytolytic lymphocytes (Anderson et al., 1990) and natural killer cells, and BH3, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member and mediator of lymphocyte apoptosis (Labi et al., 2008). Figure 1 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Results of differential gene expression and blood transcription module (BTM) analysis. (A) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased after second vaccination dose compared to first, and at early time points compared to day 7 (D7). DEGs are shown for maintenance hemodialysis (HD) with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) prior SARS-CoV-2 history. See Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for healthy control (HC) and HD data independent of SARS-CoV-2 history. The DESeq2 R package was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed at each time point after vaccination for each subject group (p<0.05, FDR-adjusted). (B) HC and HD with no SARS-CoV-2 history demonstrate distinct longitudinal enrichments of BTMs. Left: in HC, the most significantly enriched BTMs are shown (up to six) for day 1 (D1) and day 7 (D7) after each vaccination dose (V1, V2) (p<0.05, FDR-adjusted). Density plots for each BTM represent Wald statistics from DESeq2 analysis for each membership gene, thereby representing increased or decreased expression per gene at each time point compared to baseline (V1D0 or V2D0). Right: similarly in HD, the most significantly enriched BTMs for day 2 (D2) and day 7 (D7) are shown. (C) HD demonstrates diminished transitioning from innate to adaptive immune BTM enrichment after each vaccination dose. Percentages of BTMs in each BTM family with significant enrichment are shown at each time point after each vaccination dose (V1, V2) for day 1 (D1) and day 7 (D7) in HC, and day 2 (D2) and D7 for HD in subjects with no prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05, FDR-adjusted). Direction of enrichment was determined using the median Wald statistic from DESeq2 analysis for each BTM membership gene, thereby representing overall increased or decreased expression of membership genes at each time point compared to baseline (V1D0 or V2D0). Blood transcription module (BTM) enrichment BTM enrichment analysis of subjects without SARS-CoV-2 history reveals the vaccine-induced progression of various immune processes at each time point after vaccination (Figure 1B). Following V1, HC demonstrate early (V1D1) enrichment of 29 BTMs, with substantial upregulation of monocyte and antiviral IFN ac

Countries all over the world are trying to cut down on current energy needs and look for alternatives and better utilization of renewables. This paper aims at giving insights on the measures taken by some countries towards making shelters as ZEBs. The key factors kept in mind are in terms of effective design and smart energy management. Countries like China (the largest consumer of building energy), Iran, Australia, Belgium, Sri Lanka, and the European Union have prioritized ZEBs to reduce pollution for the betterment of future generations. Calculative changes in design, management of heating and cooling loads, and integration of RES into smart grids are common measures taken in the case studies of the above mentioned countries.
