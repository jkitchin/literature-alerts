Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce value‐added chemicals such as carbon monoxide (CO) and multicarbon (C2+). However, the complex reaction pathways of CO2 electro‐reduction reaction (CO2RR) greatly limit the product selectivity and conversion efficiency. Herein, the Cu‐Cd bimetallic oxides catalyst was designed and applied for the CO2RR. The optimized 4.73%Cd‐CuO exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic CO2RR activity for selective CO production in H‐cell using 0.5 M 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)/MeCN as electrolyte. The Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE(CO)) can be maintained above 90% over a wide potential range of −2.0 to −2.4 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Particularly, the catalyst achieves an impressive FE(CO) of 96.3% with a current density of 60.7 mA cm−2 at −2.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Furthermore, scaling up the 4.73%Cd‐CuO catalyst into a flow cell can reach 56.64% FE of C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol and n‐propanol) with a current density as high as 600 mA cm−2 steadily. The excellent CO2RR performance of the as‐synthesized 4.73%Cd‐CuO can be mainly attributed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost activation and conversion key intermediates of CO2RR and ensure the continuous stability of 4.73%Cd‐CuO in electrolysis process.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction by CO2 reductases is a promising approach for biomanufacturing. Among all known biological or chemical catalysts, hydrogen-dependent carbon dioxide reductase from Thermoanaerobacter kivui (TkHDCR) possesses the highest activity toward CO2 reduction. Herein, we engineer TkHDCR to generate an electro-responsive carbon dioxide reductase considering the safety and convenience. To achieve this purpose, a recombinant Escherichia coli TkHDCR overexpression system is established. The formate dehydrogenase is obtained via subunit truncation and rational design, which enables direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalysis with a near-zero overpotential. By applying a constant voltage of −500 mV (vs. SHE) to a mediated electrolytic cell, 22.8 ± 1.6 mM formate is synthesized in 16 h with an average production rate of 7.1 ± 0.5 μmol h−1cm−2, a Faradaic efficiency of 98.9% and a half-cell energy efficiency of 94.4%. This study provides an enzyme candidate for high efficient CO2 reduction and opens up a way to develop paradigm for CO2-based bio-manufacturing. Thermoanaerobacter kivui-drived CO2 reductase (TkHDCR) requires hydrogen as substrate, which can lead to safety issue. Here, the authors engineered TkHDCR into an electro-responsive carbon dioxide reductase to harvest electrons from either an external mediator or a polarized electroactive surface.

A computational investigation of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) on metalloporphyrin (M-POR) catalysts, featuring varying metal centres (Ni, Fe, Cu, and Co), oxidation states, and anchoring ligands, was conducted using density functional theory calculations. The evaluation of the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of the M-POR systems concluded that neutral systems are more stable than charged systems, with the doubly reduced systems being the most unstable. The reaction free energy profiles for CO2R to the C1 products CO and HCOOH were computed according to two possible mechanisms: coupled proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and proton transfer – electron transfer (PT-ET). The PCET pathways was found to be by far the most favourable, leading to the preferential formation of HCOOH over CO. Among the catalysts, Fe-POR exhibited the best catalytic performance for CO/HCOOH formation. To evaluate competition with the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), overpotentials of the CO2R and HER were compared for all systems. This comparison, along with the PCET analysis, revealed that most systems favour HCOOH production. The most promising M-PORs were then to generate models of two-dimensional (2D) carbonaceous frameworks, exploring their potential for CO2R, with 2D Fe-PORs being active towards C1 formation.

A new ruthenium(II) NAD (NAD = Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) type bis‐carbonyl complex, [Ru(bpy)(pbn)(CO)2]2+ [pbn = 2‐(pyridin‐2‐yl)benzo[b]‐1,5‐naphthyridine; bpy = 2,2'‐bipyridine] [1]2+, was successfully synthesized and fully characterized by single‐crystal X‐ray structural analysis, ESI‐MS, IR and NMR spectroscopy. Complex [1]2+ together with [Ru(bpy)(pbn)(CO)(COOH)]+ and/or [Ru(bpy)(pbn) (CO)(CO2)]0 complexes exist as equilibrium mixtures in aqueous solutions as evident from spectroscopic study. Chemical reduction of [1]2+ resulted the formation corresponding NADH form i.e., [Ru(bpy)(pbnHH)(CO)2]2+ (pbnHH = 2‐(pyridin‐2‐yl)‐5,10‐dihydrobenzo[b][1,5]naphthyridine) [1.HH]2+ as a two‐electron‐reduced species. The electrochemical behavior of complex [1]2+ in the presence of acid was investigated based on cyclic voltammetry analysis. A control potential electrolysis of [1]2+ afforded formate (HCOO‐) as the major product with a lesser amount of CO and H2, whereas that of [Ru(bpy)2(CO)2]2+ complex produced CO as the main product with a lesser amount of HCOO‐ and H2. The experimental results suggest that the selectivity of HCOO‐ over CO should be due to catalytic hydride transfer from the NADH‐type ligands of [1]2+ to CO2.

Excessive fossil burning causes energy shortages and contributes to the environmental crisis. Light-driven thermocatalytic CO2 reduction by methane (CRM) provides an effective strategy to conquer these two global challenges. Ni-based catalysts have been developed as candidates for CRM that are comparable to the noble metal catalysts. However, they are prone to deactivation due to the thermodynamically inevitable coking side reactions. Herein, we reported a novel Co-Ni/SiO2 nanocomposite of Co cluster-modified Ni nanoparticles, which greatly enhance the catalytic durability for light-driven thermocatalytic CRM. It exhibits high production rates of H2 (rH2) and CO (rCO, 22.8 and 26.7 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively), and very high light-to-fuel efficiency (ƞ) is achieved (26.8%). Co-Ni/SiO2 shows better catalytic durability than the referenced catalyst of Ni/SiO2. Based on the experimental results of TG-MS, TEM, and HRTEM, we revealed the origin of the significantly enhanced light-driven thermocatalytic activity and durability as well as the novel photoactivation. It was discovered that the focused irradiation markedly reduces the apparent activation energy of CO2 on the Co-Ni/SiO2 nanocomposite, thus significantly enhancing the light-driven thermocatalytic activity.

Reducing energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions in buildings is one of the key aspects of climate change on a global level. To put the building sector on a low carbon development path, policies and adequate financing play a crucial role in each region. In the global South, policies and regulations related to the decarbonization of the building stock are increasingly being implemented. For policy and decision makers, adequate data on the status quo of the building stock, as well as the quantification of energy reduction measures, are essential to make informed decisions on the building regulatory and funding framework. The objective of this study is to provide data-driven insights into the potential for energy and CO2 reduction in buildings across various hot climate zones in the Global South. A simulation-based approach was employed to model five different building types, ranging from residential homes to office buildings, under a variety of architectural and building services scenarios. The simulations were conducted using the dynamic building energy simulation tool EnergyPlus, which assessed the impact of various energy-saving measures under both current and projected future climate conditions. This study concludes that optimizing passive design features, such as improved windows, solar shading, and reflective surfaces, in conjunction with active systems like decentralized cooling units and renewable energy integration, can result in a notable reduction in energy demand and emissions. Our findings provide a robust basis for policymakers to develop targeted energy efficiency strategies for buildings in hot climate zones, which will play a crucial role in achieving climate goals in the Global South.

Abstract Global climate change is an urgent environmental challenge . To mitigate global warming, Solar Radiation Management (SRM) is being explored as a means to reduce the solar energy reaching Earth’s surface, thus controlling temperature rise. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions remain the main cause of global warming. Large-scale photovoltaic installations, which are key for renewable energy generation, can also exacerbate local heat island effects and potentially impact both local and global climates . To address these issues, recent advancements in selective transmission and reflection photovoltaic materials have offered promising solutions. These materials achieve high energy conversion efficiency while reflecting significant portions of sunlight, thereby lowering surface temperatures. By combining solar radiation reflection with CO2 emissions reduction through clean energy generation, photovoltaic panels play a dual role in climate regulation . This study utilizes numerical simulations to evaluate the long-term climate impact of these novel photovoltaic materials, focusing on their effectiveness in surface temperature regulation and CO2 reduction.

Abstract Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) involves capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it for decades to millennia. Alongside deep emissions reductions, CDR is required for meeting the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (IPCC 2022). However, parties to the agreement do not currently distinguish CDR from emissions reductions in their climate pledges. In this perspective, we argue that this lowers transparency and hinders the assessment of how credible and ambitious mitigation plans are.

Capturing and repurposing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is the traditional way to deal with climate change and lack of fossil fuel. CO2 adsorption (reduction) is the first step in this process. We have employed density functional theory-based calculations to investigate CO2 activation over the pristine and Cu-decorated carbon-based two-dimensional ψ-graphene material and its hydrogenated forms, i.e., ψ-graphone (half hydrogenated) and ψ-graphane (fully hydrogenated). ψ-graphene is a metallic allotrope of graphene containing 5-6-7 membered carbon rings. Our study found exothermic binding of CO2 with all three materials (for both pristine and Cu-decorated materials), indicating spontaneous physisorption. The presence of single atoms of the transition metal plays a significant role in increasing the activity of materials towards CO2 activation. We observed that the adsorption energy increases about three times after decorating a ψ-graphene sheet with Cu atoms. In contrast, no significant variation is observed on ψ-graphone or ψ-graphane materials. Our Bader charge analysis confirms the charge transfer from 2d nano-sheets to the molecule, where the values of calculated adsorption energies and the density of states suggest that the interaction between CO2 and these three materials can be categorized as weak physisorption., while Cu decoration enhances the CO2 adsorption.

Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to a decrease in anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such a decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this timescale. The rate of decrease in excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments have been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above the pre-pulse amount for the pulse experiment or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above the preindustrial amount for the abrupt cessation experiment) were found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.

The UK Net Zero by 2050 Policy was undemocratically adopted by the UK government in 2019. Yet the science of so-called &lsquo;greenhouse gases&rsquo; is well known and there is no reason to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), or nitrous oxide (N2O) because absorption of radiation is logarithmic. Adding to or removing these naturally occurring gases from the atmosphere will make little difference to the temperature or the climate. Water vapor (H2O) is claimed to be a much stronger &lsquo;greenhouse gas&rsquo; than CO2, CH4 or N2O but cannot be regulated because it occurs naturally in vast quantities. This work explores the established science and recent developments in scientific knowledge around Net Zero with a view to making a rational recommendation for policy makers. There is little scientific evidence to support the case for Net Zero and that greenhouse gases are unlikely to contribute to a &lsquo;climate emergency&rsquo; at current or any likely future higher concentrations. There is a case against the adoption of Net Zero given the enormous costs associated with implementing the policy, and the fact it is unlikely to achieve reductions in average near surface global air temperature, regardless of whether Net Zero is fully implemented and adopted worldwide. Therefore, Net Zero does not pass the cost-benefit test. The recommended policy is to abandon Net Zero and do nothing about so-called &lsquo;greenhouse gases&rsquo;.

Abstract. Ocean liming has gained attention as a potential solution to mitigate climate change by actively removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The addition of hydrated lime to oceanic surface water leads to an increase in alkalinity, which in turn promotes the uptake and sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Despite the potential of this technique, its effects on the marine ecosystem are still far from understood, and there is currently no information on the potential impacts on the concentration and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is one of the largest, most complex and yet least understood mixtures of organic molecules on Earth. The aim of this study is to provide the first experimental evidence about the potential effects of hydrated lime addition on DOM dynamics in the oceans by assessing changes in its concentration and optical properties (absorption and fluorescence). To investigate the effects of liming on DOM pools with different concentrations and quality, seawater was collected from two contrasting environments: the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea, known for its dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration comparable to that observed in the oceans, and the eutrophic Baltic Sea, characterized by high DOM concentration mostly of terrestrial origin. Hydrated lime was added to both waters to reach pH values of 9 and 10. Our findings reveal that the addition of hydrated lime has a noticeable effect on DOM dynamics in both the Mediterranean Sea and Baltic Sea, determining a reduction in DOC concentration and a change in the optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) of DOM. These effects, detectable at pH 9, become significant at pH 10 and are more pronounced in the Mediterranean Sea than in the Baltic Sea. These potential short-term effects should be considered within the context of the physicochemical properties of seawater and the seasonal variability.

By hydrogenating carbon dioxide to value-added products such as methanol, heterogeneous catalysts can lower greenhouse gas emissions and generate alternative liquid fuels. The most common commercial catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to methanol is Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, where ZnO improves conversion and selectivity toward methanol. The structure of this catalyst is thought to be Zn oxy(hydroxyl) overlayers on the nanometer scale on Cu. In the presence of CO2 and H2 under reaction conditions, the Cu substrate itself can be restructured and/or partially oxidized at its interface with ZnO, or the Zn might be reduced, possibly completely to a CuZn alloy, making the exact structure and stoichiometry of the active site a topic of active debate. In this study, we examine Zn3 clusters on Cu(100) and Cu(111), as a subnano model of the catalyst. We use a grand canonical genetic algorithm to sample the system structure and stoichiometry under catalytic conditions: T of 550 K, initial partial pressures of H2 of 4.5 atm and CO2 of 0.5 atm, and 1% conversion. We uncover a strong dependence of the catalyst stoichiometry on the surface coverage. At the optimal 0.2 ML surface coverage, chains of Zn(OH) form on both Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), the catalyst has many thermally accessible metastable minima, whereas on Cu(111), it does not. No oxidation or reconstruction of the Cu is found. However, at a lower coverage of Zn, Zn3 clusters take on a metallic form on Cu(100), and slightly oxidized Zn3O on Cu(111), while the surface uptakes H to form a variety of low hydrides of Cu. We thus hypothesize that the 0.2 ML Zn coverage is optimal, as found experimentally, because of the stronger yet incomplete oxidation afforded by Zn at this coverage.

Indoor air quality (IAQ) and energy consumption (Q) are well-known building estimators, but they are used separately. Energy consumption is used during the design stage, while IAQ is used during operation. The novelty of our approach is that we propose using both estimators simultaneously during building operations. The purpose of this study was to find an adaptive ventilation strategy that maintained good indoor air quality with minimal energy consumption. The second novelty of our approach consists of IAQ estimation. While the operation of ventilation systems depends only on the indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at present, our novel approach uses a more global IAQ index that includes four different air pollutants. Physical models are used for the hourly prediction of the two indices: global IAQ and Q. This study presents a comparative analysis of several ventilation operations strategies: fixed versus adaptive. The main findings show that a decrease in the ventilation rate, na, from 3.5 h−1 to 2.0 h−1 leads to a diminishment in energy consumption of 42.9%, maintaining the global IAQ index under the limited health risk value (VRL). Moreover, an adaptive ventilation strategy of na, maintaining the global IAQ index value under VRL, achieves a further reduction in energy consumption of 72.9%, highlighting its efficiency.

This thesis explores the important role of last-mile delivery in the logistics sector, with a particular focus on the e-commerce sector. Daraz, a leader in e-commerce, currently relies on two- and four-wheeled gasoline-powered vehicles for last-mile deliveries, using a hub-based model spread across nine locations across the Kathmandu valley. In line with its commitment to environmental sustainability, Daraz aims to convert its entire fleet of gasoline-powered vehicles to electric alternatives, thereby contributing to the global effort to reduce the carbon emissions. Our research yields compelling findings that highlight the significant benefits of transitioning from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to electric vehicles in the context of e-commerce last-mile delivery. These results highlight the financial and ecological benefits of adopting electric mobility in the logistics sector. We recommend that organizations involved in last-mile delivery, especially in e-commerce, carefully consider the use of electric vehicles as a financially prudent and environmentally friendly option. This conversion promises significant fuel savings, significantly improved fuel efficiency and an extremely short payback period of less than 5 years. In addition to these findings, our research also examines the transformative potential of energy consumption and emissions reduction in last-mile logistics. The energy consumption by EV is found to be less than 50% than that of petrol option. We reveal a stark disparity between petrol and electric vehicles, with petrol two- and four-wheelers showing significant energy consumption and emissions, especially in the area of carbon dioxide (CO2). In summary, our research makes a compelling case for a cleaner, more sustainable and more economically viable future in last-mile logistics through the adoption of electric vehicles and other innovations.

Given the global urgency to mitigate climate change, a key action is the development of effective carbon concentration reduction policies. To this end, an influential factor is the availability of accurate predictions of carbon concentration trends. The existing spatiotemporal correlation as well as the diversity of influential factors, pose important challenges in accurately modeling these trends. In this work, different strategies based on deep learning are proposed with the aim of predicting global carbon dioxide and methane concentrations. For this purpose, satellite observations are used for six-month projections, covering geographical regions that span the globe. In addition, complementary environmental variables are integrated to improve the predictive capacity of the proposed models. The results obtained demonstrate the high accuracy of the predictions, in particular of models based on graphical neural networks, reaffirming the great potential of deep learning techniques in predicting carbon dioxide and methane concentrations. Likewise, the effectiveness of models based on deep learning to accurately predict carbon concentrations by incorporating dynamic and static information is demonstrated.

Abstract Bohai is rich in heavy oil. And its efficient development is significant. In this essay, ordinary heavy oil and extra one were selected, and the viscosity characteristics was also investigated referring to its internal composition. And so as the reducing viscosity effects of steam, oil-soluble viscosity reducer, diesel, emulsifier, flue gas and carbon dioxide. The experimental results show that resin and asphaltene content have positive effect on the viscosity of heavy oil. Compared with ordinary heavy oil, the drop is significantly greater when the temperature increases by 10°C. For ordinary heavy oil, the inflection point temperature is from 50°C to 70°C, and for extra-heavy oil, it is above 100°C. For ordinary heavy oil, its flow effect can be better improved without too high temperature, while it’s totally different for super heavy oil. For which, higher temperature and other auxiliary viscosity reduction methods are needed to achieve better flow performance. Diesel oil reduce viscosity of heavy oil by similar solubility principle, but the demand for diesel oil is large. At 50°C, the viscosity of super heavy oil with 0.5% emulsion viscosity reducer added is 36 mPa·s, but the water content needs to reach above 30%.Oil-soluble viscosity reducer reduces viscosity by dissolving asphaltenes and resins and dismantling aggregate structure of heavy oil aromatic flakes.However, the dosage should reach about 20 %, so that the viscosity of super heavy oil can be reduced to the level of dilute oil. Overall, for developing super heavy oil, steam compound with oil soluble viscosity reducer can be taken into account at the early production stage, and the emulsion viscosity reducer can be used in the middle development stage and wellbore viscosity reduction and lifting process. Finally, for ordinary heavy oil, flue gas’s viscosity reduction effects, nitrogen and carbon dioxide are investigated. It is found that the viscosity reduction effect of carbon dioxide is the best, followed by flue gas and nitrogen. Considering the offshore gas source, cost and carbon emission requirements, it is recommended to use flue gas in the field. The research provides theoretical guidance and technical reference for development of different types of offshore heavy oil.

Cities are key areas for carbon control and reduction. The study of the decoupling between CO2 emissions and gross domestic product (GDP) and the drivers of CO2 emissions in cities facilitates the reduction of CO2 emissions to safeguard the development of the economy. This paper first calculates the CO2 emissions in Tianjin, China, from 2005 to 2022, then uses the Tapio decoupling index to quantify the decoupling status, and, finally, explores the energy-CO2-emission drivers through the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model. The findings indicate that (1) the decrease in CO2 emissions from industrial products and transport is the main reason for the decline. (2) During the period under investigation, the predominant condition observed was a state of weak decoupling. (3) Given the economic-output effect is the primary and substantial driver of energy CO2 emissions, it is essential to harmonize the interplay between economic-development approach and CO2 emissions to foster sustainable development in Tianjin. The industrial structure plays the most critical role in hindering the reduction of CO2 emissions; therefore, optimizing industrial structure can help achieve carbon reduction and control targets. These findings enrich the study of CO2 emission factors and can also interest urban policymakers.

Abstract The era of an energy economy driven by “carbon neutrality” is putting forward stricter requirements for the use of carbon resources and the governance of CO 2 . Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide reaction (CO 2 RR), driven by renewable energy, is a practical energy storage technology with broad application prospects. It can reduce CO 2 into carbon‐based fuels and chemical products. Among them, multi‐carbon (C 2+ ) products have higher energy density and larger market size, and can significantly reduce the global demand for fossil fuels and close the artificial carbon cycle. Introducing additional active sites into Cu‐based catalysts to prepare dual‐site tandem catalysts can regulate the electronic and geometric structure of the catalysts, break linear scale relationships, reduce reaction potential barriers, and bring superb and stable catalytic performance. Various types of dual‐site tandem catalysts are developed, and the understanding of the tandem effect is pushed to a higher level. This paper reviews several typical dual‐site tandem catalysts: atom–atom dual‐site tandem catalysts, atom‐particle dual‐site tandem catalysts, particle–particle dual‐site tandem catalysts, and heterogeneous interface dual‐site tandem catalysts. It then deeply analyzes the reaction mechanism and research progress of these advanced catalysts in CO 2 RR. In addition, the challenges and opportunities faced by such catalysts are also discussed.

The primary ecological challenges in citrus orchards include soil acidification, nutrient depletion, and significant carbon dioxide emissions resulting from conventional cultivation practices. To address these challenges, citrus peel residues and cassava stalks underwent pyrolysis at 500 °C to generate biochars. Different proportions of these biochars (1%, 2%, and 4%) were applied under controlled laboratory conditions to assess their impact on the mineralization of soil organic carbon in citrus orchards. The results indicated that both types of biochar effectively regulated the soil pH to approximately 5.5. Significantly, the addition of 4% cassava stalk biochar significantly increased the levels of available phosphorus and potassium. The phosphorus levels rose by 512.55%, and the potassium levels surged by 1434.01%. Additionally, the soil organic carbon increased to 16.7 g/kg. Conversely, the citrus peel biochar decreased the availability of phosphorus but resulted in the highest increase in available potassium, at 1523.75%, and elevated the soil organic carbon content to 13 g/kg. Both types of biochar enhanced the soil organic carbon mineralization rate to varying extents with increasing application ratios, simultaneously boosting the cumulative amount of organic carbon mineralized. Among the treatments, cassava stalk biochar displayed the lowest C0/SOC ratio, of 0.169, indicating its superior carbon retention capacity. Furthermore, cassava stalk biochar showed inhibitory effects on soil catalase and urease activities within the citrus orchard. Overall, the application of 4% cassava stalk biochar appears to be more beneficial for nutrient regulation and carbon sequestration in citrus orchard soils, while also contributing to the reduction in soil acidification by adjusting pH levels.

Jimsar shale oil in China has undergone a rapid decline in formation energy and has a low recovery rate, with poor reservoir permeability. CO2 injection has become the main method for improving oil recovery. Pre-fracturing with CO2 energy storage in Jimsar shale oil has been performed, yielding a noticeable increase in oil recovery. However, the CO2 injection mechanism still requires a deeper understanding. Focusing on Jimsar shale oil in China, this paper studies the effect of CO2 on crude oil viscosity reduction, miscible phase testing, and the law of imbibition displacement. The results show that CO2 has a significant viscosity reduction effect on Jimsar shale oil, with a minimum miscible pressure between CO2 and Jimsar shale oil of 25.51 MPa, which can allow for miscibility under formation conditions. A rise in pressure increased the displacement capacity of supercritical CO2, as well as the displacement volume of crude oil. However, the rate of increase gradually declined. This research provides a theoretical basis for CO2 injection fracturing in Jimsar shale oil, which is helpful for improving the development effects of Jimsar shale oil.

The article considers the direction of increasing the energy and environmental efficiency of the city's energy infrastructure through the modernization of existing thermal power plants (TPP) and combined heat and power (CHP) plants using combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. Fuel and energy balances of electric power plants have been constructed, and the energy and environmental effects of the use of CCGT have been assessed. The modeling of energy and environmental indicators for the thermal circuits of the CCGT was conducted using the Thermoflex, GT PRO software (Thermoflow) and the ISC Manager program developed at the National Research University "Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI)". The analysis of CCGT efficiency in urban energy applications is based on modeling and optimizing the city’s fuel and energy balance (FEB). For this purpose, the OptiTEB program developed at the Department of PTS at the National Research University "MРEI" is used. Constructing fuel and energy systems in cities and regions is a pressing task that enables the planning of a strategy for the development of the urban fuel and energy complex (FEC), with an assessment of the magnitude of harmful emissions, including greenhouse gases. The article presents the results of work on establishing scientific foundations for modern heat supply systems, exemplified by a mathematical model of the Moscow thermal power plant and its optimization, taking into account the projected development of electric transport infrastructure over the coming decades, improving the thermal protection characteristics of newly constructed buildings, and the potential increase in the use of renewable energy sources (RES). The growth in the share of electric transport should be linked to an increase in the share of renewable energy sources (RES). Simply increasing the number of electric vehicles without a significant rise in renewable energy usage in the city's energy balance will not result in a reduction of carbon dioxide and harmful substance emissions. Expanding electricity generation through CCGT, alongside the growth of renewable energy use in the city, can lead to a significant decrease in carbon dioxide emissions.

We conducted combustion tests with marine gas oil (MGO) blended with bioethanol (BE) in ratios of 0%–30% to address International Maritime Organization air pollution regulations on exhaust gases emitted from ships and fossil fuel resource depletion and achieve carbon neutrality. We designed and manufactured a standard 1-ton combustion chamber, using an attached gun-type burner to analyze the exhaust gases of each sample under similar conditions. Compared to pure MGO (BE0), the oxygen content increased by approximately 1.91% at the maximum blend ratio (BE30), while carbon dioxide decreased by 1.39%. Nitrogen oxides were reduced by approximately 30%. Sulfur oxides were minimal (<0.03%), with MGO alone at approximately 0.08 ppm, confirming the superior quality of low-sulfur fuel. In all blends containing BE, no sulfur oxides were detected. Additionally, exhaust gas temperature decreased by 5.8%, and combustion efficiency decreased from 72.24% to 70.33%, a reduction of approximately 1.9%. This indicated that BE has a relatively lower calorific value; however, it provides a similar thermal output, with some reduction of exhaust emissions. A one-way ANOVA and post-hoc verification confirmed that with increased BE content, emission differences were significant ( p < 0.01 level in all areas). Through this study, it was confirmed that the use of eco-friendly fuels such as bioethanol has excellent effects on reducing exhaust emissions. It is analyzed that it would help solve global warming and air environment pollution problems. Therefore, it is determined that the future application of MGO-bioethanol blended fuel as an eco-friendly alternative fuel for ships holds significant potential, and positive outcomes are anticipated.

The establishment of a more realistic CO2 fracturing model serves to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying CO2 fracturing transformation. Additionally, it furnishes a foundational framework for devising comprehensive fracturing construction plans. However, current research has neglected to consider the influence of CO2 on rock properties during CO2 fracturing, resulting in an inability to precisely replicate the alterations in the reservoir post-CO2 injection into the formation. This disparity from the actual conditions poses a substantial limitation to the application and advancement of CO2 fracturing technology. This work integrates variations in the physical parameters of rocks after complete contact and reaction with CO2 into the numerical model of crack propagation. This comprehensive approach fully acknowledges the impact of pre-CO2 exposure on the mechanical parameters of reservoir rocks. Consequently, it authentically restores the reservoir state following CO2 injection, ensuring a more accurate representation of the post-fracturing conditions. In comparison with conventional numerical simulation methods, the approach outlined in this paper yields a reduction in the error associated with predicting fracturing pressure by 9.8%.

Objective The study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of different noninvasive ventilation (NIV) modalities as primary respiratory support following extubation in Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS). Methods A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Network (CNKI), Wanfang database, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Literature databases with a search time limit of April 2024 for the year of construction, and included randomized controlled clinical trials of different modes of noninvasive respiratory support after extubation in NRDS. The primary outcome indicators were the need for re-tracheal intubation within 72 h of extubation on noninvasive ventilatory support and carbon dioxide retention (PCO2) 24 h after extubation. Secondary outcome indicators included the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), nasal injury, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular white matter softening (PVL), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and mortality rate. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of the literature was performed by two investigators who screened, extracted, and evaluated the quality of the data. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were then performed using R software. Results A total of 23 studies involving 2,331 neonates were analyzed. These studies examined four noninvasive respiratory modalities: continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (NCPAP), noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (N-BiPAP), and noninvasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (NHFOV). Results indicated that NHFOV, NIPPV, and N-BiPAP were significantly more effective than NCPAP in reducing the risk of reintubation (all P &lt; 0.05), with NHFOV being the most effective. For carbon dioxide clearance, NHFOV outperformed both NIPPV and NCPAP ( P &lt; 0.05). Regarding the reduction of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) incidence, NHFOV and NIPPV showed a significant advantage over NCPAP. Conclusions This network meta-analysis (NMA) suggested that NHFOV is the most effective mode of noninvasive respiratory support post-extubation, while NCPAP is the least effective. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number and quality of the studies included.

Abstract The invasive pest, spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura, 1931) or SWD), damages various soft-skinned fruits, severely impacting orchards and vineyards economically. Current sorting practices in commercial production may overlook early-stage SWD infestations, as visible signs take a few days to appear. Our study focused on managing SWD infesting fruits (blueberry, cherry, and raspberry) without visible signs using an artificial atmosphere with elevated CO2 and low temperature. We hypothesized that these factors affect SWD survival and possibly interact, with potential variations among different soft- or stone-fruit species or varieties. High CO2 concentrations and cold storage both negatively affected SWD development. A 24-h 100% CO2 fumigation, without cold storage, significantly reduced SWD infestations in all 3 fruit species studied. On the other hand, 10% CO2 without cold storage did not cause a significant infestation reduction in cherries. Cold storage alone was too slow to be considered effective. Concurrent low-temperature treatment and CO2 treatment reduced the insecticidal efficacy of CO2 fumigation. Optimal fruit sanitation was achieved with a 3-h 100% CO2 treatment at ambient temperature before cold storage. Raspberries were the most suitable host for SWD development, with over a 5-fold higher SWD development compared to blueberries and over 50 times more than in cherries. We discussed the observed interactions between CO2 fumigation and chilling and suggested a simple postharvest SWD management protocol using optimal CO2 levels, exposure times, and chilling periods—achievable without complex equipment.

Abstract In 2023, sea-surface temperatures (SST) reached record highs. Based on historical responses, this SST anomaly would suggest an increased oceanic CO2 uptake (-0.11±0.03 PgC yr-1). In contrast, our observation-based estimates reveal that the global non-polar ocean absorbed about 10% less carbon than expected (+0.16±0.28 PgC yr-1). This weakening occurred despite reduced CO2 outgassing in the tropics associated with El Niño. Hence, the decline in CO2 uptake in 2023 materialised entirely in the extratropics, driven primarily by elevated SSTs in the Northern Hemisphere. Two ocean biogeochemical models demonstrate that in the subtropical North Atlantic the thermally-induced reduction in CO2 uptake was strongly mitigated by the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface mixed layer. Such negative feedbacks cause an overall muted response of the ocean carbon sink to the record high SSTs, but this resilience may not persist under long-term warming or more severe SST extremes.

The present work is devoted to assessing the effect of heat treatment of iron oxide catalysts promoted by potassium and cerium on their activity, which is expressed quantitatively in the form of methylbutenes conversion, and selectivity in the process of methylbutenes dehydrogenation to isoprene, and interpreting the results obtained using kinetic modeling. Iron oxide catalysts were prepared by heat treatment of iron (II) hydroxide Fe(OH)2. The concentrations of the components of the reaction mixture, the conversion of methylbutenes and selectivity were experimentally determined during methylbutenes dehydrogenation in the presence of heat-treated iron oxide catalysts. It has been shown that an increase of α-Fe2O3 hematite phase in the iron oxide catalyst helps to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide and cracking products in the products of the methylbutenes dehydrogenation, which contributes to increased selectivity. The increase of α-Fe2O3 hematite phase is observed with increasing heat treatment temperature from 298 K to 873 K. In all iron oxide catalysts promoted by potassium and cerium, after the methylbutenes dehydrogenation, the main phase is magnetite Fe3O4 (62.17% by wt.) and a more reduced form of iron oxide wustite FeO (13.81% by wt.) was identified. It can be assumed that the reduction of iron oxides in the iron oxide catalyst during the methylbutenes dehydrogenation is associated with the activity of the catalyst. The higher the activity of the iron oxide catalyst, the higher the concentration of hydrogen in the reaction mixture, which leads to a deeper reduction of iron oxide. As a result of kinetic modeling, it was demonstrated that the kinetic scheme, consisting of the reactions of methylbutene isomers dehydrogenation, isomerization of methylbutenes, cracking of methylbutene isomers and isoprene, interaction of coke with water, is complete enough to adequately describe the experimental data of the methylbutenes dehydrogenation.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) offers the opportunity to store renewable energy in the form of chemicals and fuels while simultaneously reducing CO2 emissions. Compared to low‐carbon products such as carbon monoxide and formic acid, multicarbon products have demonstrated greater value in terms of economic feasibility. To date, various strategies have been developed to enhance electrocatalytic performance, with tandem strategies emerging as a promising approach, particularly for the formation of multicarbon products. In this review, current tandem strategies regarding CO2RR are thoroughly discussed, covering electrocatalyst designs from atomic‐scale tandem electrocatalysts to macroscale electrode configurations as well as reaction system designs. Additionally, the internal reaction processes involving reduction product upgrades, the application of multi‐physical tandem fields, and the tandem reaction systems are further summarized. This review aims to provide more fundamental insights into tandem strategies for CO2RR applications and inspire more creative ideas in the research community of CO2RR in light of this promising approach with its wide versatility, diversity and flexibility.

Abstract An increasing amount of effort has been directed to ensure the minimization of carbon dioxide emissions within the transport industry, particularly in the light passenger vehicle segments. This has been achieved through many advancements such as mass and aerodynamic drag reduction as well as the electrification of powertrains. The heavy-duty vehicle segment contributes significantly to the total emissions of the transport sector, however fuel consumption through electrification poses some limitations. Fuel efficiency has been achieved by adopting higher fuel injection pressures generating an increase of the crankshaft nose oscillation making Front-End Accessory Drive (FEAD) design more challenging. This paper provides a solution, with the incorporation of a crank pulley decoupler that isolates the irregularities from the FEAD that arise at the crank of the internal combustion engine. The analysis of a 12.7 L engine tested with a steel pulley and with the decoupler is presented. The brake-specific fuel consumption map is obtained for the engine mounted with the steel pulley and with the decoupler through a dynamometer test. The engine maps are incorporated into a tractor trailer with a 4 × 2 configuration in the Vehicle Energy consumption Tool (VECTO), evaluated over three driving cycles: long-haul delivery, regional delivery, and urban delivery. The outcome indicates a maximum relative fuel saving of 0.63% for a vehicle mounted with a decoupler compared to one mounted with a solid steel pulley.

This study focused on the utilization of active carbon derived from coconut shells as an adsorbent to reduce exhaust gas emissions in motorcycles. The research aimed to compare the exhaust emissions before and after installing active carbon in the muffler and to analyze its effect on the levels of CO, HC, and CO2 at different engine speeds. A laboratory experiment was conducted with varying masses of active carbon, and emission data were collected and analyzed using two-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that with the use of 200 grams of active carbon, the CO emission decreased by 12.06%, HC by 16.96%, and CO2 by 9.17%. These reductions are attributed to the strong adsorptive properties of active carbon, which facilitated the physical and chemical separation of harmful gases. The study concluded that active carbon significantly reduces exhaust emissions, providing a practical solution for improving air quality in motorcycles. The findings offer an effective method for emission control that could be applied under various operating conditions, making it suitable for widespread implementation in emission-reduction systems for small engines.

The increase in carbon emissions in the construction industry is one of the factors that lead to environmental problems and hinder the sustainable development of society and the construction industry. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rationally control carbon emissions by formulating scientific and effective energy-saving and emission reduction policies so as to safeguard the development of the industry. However, because of the uncertainty and complexity of CO2 emissions, more reliable prediction and assessment tools are needed to comprehensively analyze and predict CO2 emissions. This study combines the gray system theory and Markov principle to give full play to the advantages of the two methods, using Markov theory to determine the state transition probability, find out the characteristics of carbon emissions in the construction industry, and form a suitable gray Markov prediction model. The feasibility of the prediction model is demonstrated by calculating and examining the prediction model using data related to carbon emissions from the U.S. buildings from 2002 to 2022, which greatly improves the accuracy of CO2 emissions prediction.

This investigation analyses the influence of private AI investment and financial development (FD) on CO2 emissions in the United States, using the STIRPAT framework to account for the functions of GDP, population, and foreign direct investment (FDI). The data's robustness was verified through the application of a variety of unit root tests, which confirmed that the variables are free of unit root issues and exhibit a varied order of integration. The ARDL bound test was used to investigate the cointegration among the variables and it found a long-run equilibrium relationship. The ARDL model results show that income, FDI, FD, and population significantly increase CO2 emissions in both the short and long term. In contrast, we found that private investment in AI led to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions over these time frames. Additional estimations were conducted using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR methods to verify the ARDL results, all of which attested to the initial findings' robustness. In addition, the study implemented a pairwise Granger causality test to illustrate the directional relationships between the variables. There is a unidirectional causal link between GDP, private AI investment, FDI, population, and CO2 emissions, according to the findings. Most notably, we observed bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and FD. Diagnostic tests further corroborated the validity of the study's conclusions, confirming that the model is free from specification errors, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity.

Abstract This paper investigates the use of discrete event simulation (DES) as a potential decision-support tool for environmentally sustainable production planning. We propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates DES design, dynamic CO2 intensity calculations, and in-depth scenario analysis. This approach facilitates simulation-driven production planning with an emphasis on evaluating and reducing the environmental impacts of manufacturing. Our methodology is applied to the evaluation of an industrial progressive die stamping process (PDSP). The PDSP is a part of a production line in a large Danish manufacturing company. The performance of the PDSP was simulated and evaluated for two working days: 09 Jan 2024 and 10 Jan 2024. Key performance indicators like utilization rate and lead time are assessed alongside environmental sustainability metrics such as process CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions per product. Building upon this baseline, we then simulate and compare two alternative production scenarios: i) increased production capacity and ii) variations in planning orders. These scenarios are then contrasted with the baseline model. Our results demonstrate the potential of DES in identifying new production strategies. The first scenario demonstrates a 7% increase in production capacity, corresponding to a 2.6% increase in process CO2 emissions. The second scenario demonstrates a 5% reduction in process CO2 emissions while retaining the same production capacity as the baseline model. These findings illustrate how DES can uncover production plans that prioritize sustainable manufacturing.

Abstract. Coastal acidification, warming, and nutrient management actions all alter water quality conditions that marine species experience, with potential impacts to their physiological processes. Decreases in calcite saturation state (ΩCa) and food availability, combined with warming water temperatures, pose a threat to calcifying organisms; however, the magnitude of future changes in estuarine systems is challenging to predict and is not well known. This study aims to determine how and where oysters will be affected by future acidification, warming, and nutrient reductions, and the relative effects of these stressors. To address these goals, an oyster bioenergetics model for Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) was embedded in a 3-D coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemistry model implemented for two tributaries in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Model simulations were forced with projected future conditions (mid-21st century atmospheric CO2, atmospheric temperature, and managed nutrient reductions) and compared with a realistic present-day reference run. Together, all three stressors are projected to reduce ΩCa and growth of oyster shell and tissue. Increased atmospheric CO2 and temperature are both projected to cause widespread reductions in ΩCa. The resulting reductions in oyster shell and tissue growth will be most severe along the tributary shoals. Future warming during peak oyster growing seasons is projected to have the strongest negative influence on tissue and shell growth, due to summer water temperatures reducing filtration rates, enhancing shell dissolution and oyster respiration rates, and increasing organic matter remineralization rates, thus reducing food availability. Nutrient reductions will exacerbate deficits in oyster food availability, contributing to further reductions in growth. Quantifying the effects of these stressors provides insight on the areas in the lower bay where oysters will be most vulnerable to mid 21st-century conditions.

The trade-off effect of the oxygen permeability and stability of oxygen transport membranes (OTMs) still exists in working atmospheres containing CO2. Herein, we reported a new series of 60 wt%Ce0.9Ln0.1O2-{\delta}-40wt%Ln0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Ti0.1O3-{\delta} (CLnO-LnSFTO, Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb) dual-phase OTMs by selecting different Ln elements based on the reported highly stable Ti-doped CPrO-PrSFTO. The effects of different Ln elements on the structure and oxygen permeability of Ti-doped dual-phase OTMs were systematically studied. Basically, as the atomic number of Ln elements increases, the unit cell parameters of both the fluorite phase and the perovskite phase become smaller. The unit cell volume and spatial symmetry of the perovskite phase are reduced, resulting in a reduction in oxygen permeability. The optimal CLaO-LaSFTO showed JO2 of 0.60 and 0.54 mL min-1 cm-2 with He and CO2 sweeping at 1000 oC, respectively. In addition, all CLnO-LnSFTO OTMs could work for more than 100 hours with no significant performance degradation in a CO2 atmosphere, maintaining excellent stability. This work explores candidate OTM materials for CO2 capture and oxygen separation, as well as provides some ideas for addressing the trade-off effect.

Abstract Aims Amyloid cardiomyopathy is caused by the deposition of light chain (AL) or transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) fibrils, that leads to a restrictive cardiomyopathy, often resulting in heart failure (HF) with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. This study aimed to determine whether cardiac output reduction or ventilation inefficiency plays a predominant role in limiting exercise in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy. Methods We conducted a multicentre prospective study in patients with AL or ATTR cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing across four centres. Patients were compared with a propensity‐score matched HF cohort based on age, gender, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 ). Results Data from 267 amyloid patients aged 77 (72, 81) years, 86% male, with a median N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) of 2187 (1140, 4383) ng/L, exercise parameters of peak VO 2 of 14.1 (11.6;16.9) mL/min/kg, a minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO 2 ) slope of 37.4 (32.5, 42.6) and a LVEF of 50% (44%, 59%) were analysed. We identified 251 amyloid cardiomyopathy–HF matches. Amyloid patients had a signifnicantly higher VE/VCO 2 slope [37.4, inter quartile range (IQR): 32.7, 43.1 vs. 32.1, IQR: 28.7, 37.0, P < 0.0001], NT‐proBNP (2249, IQR: 1187, 4420 vs. 718, IQR: 405, 2161 ng/L, P < 0.001), peak heart rate (121 ± 28 vs. 115 ± 27 beats/min, P = 0.007) and peak ventilation (51, IQR: 42, 62 vs. 43, IQR: 33, 53 L/min, P < 0.0001) with earlier anaerobic threshold (VO 2 at AT: 8.9, IQR: 6.8, 10.8 vs. 10.8, IQR: 8.9, 12.7 mL/min/kg, P < 0.0001) compared with HF. Between amyloid patients, AL patients ( n = 27) were younger (63, IQR: 58, 70 vs. 78, IQR: 72, 81 years, P < 0.0001), had lower VE/VCO 2 slope (35.0, IQR: 30.0, 38.7 vs. 38.0, IQR: 32.8, 43.1, P = 0.019), higher end‐tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure both at AT (35.1 ± 4.8 vs. 31.4 ± 4.7 mmHg, P < 0.001) and peak exercise (32, IQR: 28, 35 vs. 30, IQR: 26, 33 mmHg, P = 0.039) as compared with ATTR ( n = 233). Conclusions A higher VE/VCO 2 slope and an earlier AT, determining functional capacity impairment, was assessed in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy compared with the matched HF cohort. Additionally, patients with ATTR might display more severe exercise limitations as compared with AL.

Based on the experimentally reported stable and conductive two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) as building block and cyan substituted phenyl as connector (CuCOF-CN) as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction reaction (RR), first principle calculations were performed on CuCOF-CN and its analog with the CN being replaced by H (CuCOF). Comparatively studied on the crystal structures, electronic properties, and CO2RR performance of the two catalysts found that CuCOF has reduced crystal unit size, more positive charge on Cu and CuPc segments, smaller band gap, and lower reaction barrier for CO2 RR than CuCOF-CN. CuCOF is proposed to be good potential electrocatalyst with good environment friendliness. The substituent effect and structure-property-performance relationship would help for designing and fabricating new electrocatalysts.

Effective climate action depends on dismantling the assumptions and oversimplifications that have become the basis of climate policy. The assumption that greenhouse gases (GHG) are fungible and the use of single-point values in normalizing GHG species to CO2-equivalents can propagate inaccuracies in carbon accounting and have already led to failures of carbon offset systems. Separate emission reduction targets and tracking by GHG species are recommended to achieve long-term climate stabilization.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to alleviate the energy crisis and CO2 pollution, for which a wide variety of catalysts are under development. Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) with clear and designable structures are an excellent platform for ECR. Here, two isostructural N, O‐coordinated Zn‐MOFs, FJU‐126‐4F and FJU‐126‐CH3, based on terephthalic acid ligand with different groups (one is ‐4F, the other is ‐CH3) on the benzene ring, have been constructed for ECR catalysts. Significantly, the different functional groups make the performance difference of ECR. The maximum Faraday efficiency of formate (FEformate) for FJU‐126‐4F is 60.5% with the partial current density of formate (jformate) of ‐19.35 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.47 V, while the optimum FEformate of FJU‐126‐CH3 is 50.2% with the jformate of ‐10.04 mA cm‐2 at ‐1.57 V. The work provides insight into the rational design of MOF catalysts for ECR.

In this study, the thermodynamic analysis of a combined cycle gas turbine integrated with post-combustion carbon capture and storage using the solvent method is performed. The syngas obtained from the gasification of sewage sludge is mixed with methane and nitrogen-rich natural gas fuels at different proportions, used in the gas turbine, and the properties of fuel and flue gases are analyzed. The flue gas obtained from the fuel mixture is passed through the post-combustion carbon capture and storage at various load conditions to assess the heat and electricity required for the carbon capture process. The solvent used for the carbon capture from flue gases enables CO2 capture with the high efficiency of 90%. With the calculated results, the load conditions of flue gas using fuel mixtures are identified, which reduces the heat and power demand of post-combustion carbon capture and storage and provides the possibility to achieve neutral emission. The impact of selected operating conditions of post-combustion carbon capture and storage on the CO2 emission reduction process and on the power plant performances is investigated. Considering the factors of electricity generation, energy efficiency, heat supply to the consumers, operating load of post-combustion carbon cap-ture and storage and CO2 emission, the 50% mixture of syngas with both fuels performs better. Also, the use of a mixture of 2-amino-2methyl-1-propanol and piperazine with reboiler duty 3.7 MJ/kgCO2 in post-combustion carbon capture and storage slightly enhanced the performance of the power plant compared to the use of monoethanolamine with reboiler duty 3.8 MJ/kgCO2.

In recent years, the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has increased significantly, contributing to global warming. Among these GHGs, CH4, CO2, and CO are particularly potent contributors. Remediation techniques primarily rely on materials capable of capturing, storing, and converting these gases. Catalytic processes, particularly heterogeneous catalysis, are essential to chemical and petrochemical industries as well as environmental remediation. Due to the growing demand for catalysts, efforts are being made to reduce energy consumption and make technologies more environmentally friendly. Green chemistry emphasizes minimizing the use of hazardous reactants and harmful solvents in chemical processes. Achieving these principles should be paired with processes that reduce time and costs in catalyst preparation while improving their efficiency. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) has been widely used for the preparation of supported metal catalysts. NTP has attracted significant attention for its ability to improve the physicochemical properties of catalysts, enhancing process efficiency through low-temperature operation and shorter processing times. NTP has been applied to various catalyst synthesis techniques, including reduction, oxidation, metal oxide doping, surface etching, coating, alloy formation, surface treatment, and surface cleaning. Plasma-prepared transition-metal catalysts offer advantages over conventionally prepared catalysts due to their unique material properties. These properties enhance catalytic activity by lowering the activation energy barrier, improving stability, and increasing conversion and selectivity compared to untreated samples. This review demonstrates how plasma activation modifies material properties and, based on extensive literature, illustrates its potential to combat climate change by converting CO2, CH4, CO, and other gases, showcasing the benefits of plasma-treated materials and catalysts. A succinct introduction to this review outlines the advantages of plasma-based synthesis and modification over traditional synthesis techniques. The introduction also highlights the various types of plasma and their physical characteristics across different factors. Additionally, this review addresses methods by which materials are synthesized and modified using plasma. The latter section of this review discusses the use of non-thermal plasma for greenhouse gas mitigation, covering applications such as the dry reforming of CH4, CO and CH4 oxidation, CO2 reduction, and other uses of plasma-modified catalysts.

Boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDDEs) offer a highly efficient pathway to mineralize recalcitrant compounds due to their reduced energy requirements, fewer chemical inputs, and mechanical stability. In this work, the electrochemical degradation of paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) was studied using an undivided cell (Condiacell®-type) at circumneutral pH, and under galvanostatic control. The roles of applied current density, volumetric flow rate, and herbicide concentration were systematically studied through a central composite design (CCD) using a closed-flow reaction setup. Under the best operating conditions (i.e., for PQ: 1.6 mA/cm2, 80 mL/min, and 70 mL/min, and 70 mg/L; and for DQ: 1.5 mA/cm2, 80 mL/min, and 73 mg/L), a spectrophotometric analysis evidenced that the herbicides were satisfactorily removed (ca. 100%) while mineralization degrees were above 90%. Furthermore, the produced effluents yielded significant increases in seed germination and root length, which suggest a reduction in toxicity. Energy consumptions of 0.13 and 0.18 kWh/g of TOC are reported with the electrochemical cells for the PQ and DQ treatments, respectively. The PQ and DQ treatments by electrooxidation are estimated to emit nearly 2.7 and 38.9 kg CO2/m3 of water treated, with a cost around USD 250/m3. Carbon emissions could be greatly decreased for PQ (0.28 kg CO2/m3) and DQ (0.40 kg CO2/m3) if electricity were generated from renewable resources. Although this study suggests that the use of BDDE can be considered as a green alternative for agrochemical removal due to lower carbon emissions, the environmental profile of the process is determined by the degree of renewability of the electrical grid of each country or region.

To achieve carbon neutrality in China’s fossil energy sector, saline aquifer CO2 geological storage has become a critical strategy. As research into carbon reduction and storage potential evaluation advances across various geological scales, the need arises for consolidating key CO2 storage cases and establishing a standardized classification system and evaluation methodology. This paper provides a comprehensive review of notable CO2 storage projects in saline aquifers, covering aspects such as project overviews, structural and reservoir characteristics, caprock integrity, and seismic monitoring protocols. Drawing on insights from mineral and oil and gas exploration, as well as international methods, this paper outlines the stages and potential levels of saline aquifer storage in China. It proposes an evaluation framework with formulas and reference values for key coefficients. The study includes successful global projects, such as Sleipner and Snøhvit in Norway, In Salah in Algeria, and Shenhua in China’s Ordos Basin, which provide valuable insights for long-term carbon capture and storage (CCS). By examining geological characteristics, injection, and monitoring protocols in these projects, this paper analyzes how geological features impact CO2 storage outcomes. For example, the Sleipner project’s success is linked to its straightforward structure, favorable reservoir properties, and stable caprock, while Snøhvit illustrates diverse structural suitability, and In Salah demonstrates the influence of fractures on storage efficacy. CO2 storage activities are segmented into four stages—survey, investigation, exploration, and injection—and are further categorized by storage potential: geological, technical, techno-economic, and engineering capacities. This study also presents evaluation levels (prediction, control, technically recoverable, and engineering) that support effective reservoir selection, potential classification, and calculations considering factors like reservoir stability and sealing efficacy. Depending on application needs, volumetric or mechanistic methods are recommended, with precise determination of geological, displacement, and cost coefficients. For China, a dynamic evaluation mechanism characterized by multi-scale, tiered approaches and increasing precision over time is essential for robust storage potential assessment. The levels and methods outlined here serve as a scientific foundation for regional and stage-based comparisons, guiding engineering approvals and underground space management. To align with practical engineering demands, ongoing innovation through laboratory experiments, simulations, and field practice is crucial, supporting continual refinement of formulas and key parameter determinations.

Electrochemical urea synthesis under ambient conditions offers a promising alternative to traditional methods, yet suffers from inefficient production due to poor binding of reactants to the catalyst surface, leading to competitive pathways. Here, we report an electrochemical route for urea synthesis by dual reduction of CO2 and N2 gases using FePc catalyst. The FePc electrocatalyst showed a urea yield rate of 357 µmol h−1 gcat−1 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 14.36% at −0.4 V vs RHE. This insight offers an awareness into the development of an electrochemical route for the efficient electrosynthesis of urea via C–N coupling.

Aggregates are the second-most consumed product in the world after water. This geological resource is used as building and construction material, and its production in quarries and delivery to customers generates several environmental problems. Their transport from quarries to consumption points, almost entirely done by truck, also generates impacts such as an increase in traffic and noise and the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Transportation and storage of goods account for 15% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and will increase significantly by 2050. To mitigate this, the European Union suggested shifting 30% of long-distance road freight to cleaner alternatives, such as rail or waterborne transport. This approach neglects the enormous volume of short-distance freight movement and its impact on achieving the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, the hypothesis to test is whether the use of an intermodal rail/road transport mode, instead of just roads, for the transport of some products can help reduce global CO2 emissions even for short distances. To test this, this study investigates the carbon emissions (and transport cost reduction) generated by rail/road intermodal aggregate transport for short distances in the Madrid region (Spain), rather than the currently used direct truck transport. An analysis of variables, such as aggregate supply, demand locations and amounts, and road and rail networks, using a geographical information system provides the associated carbon emissions of the different transport alternatives. To obtain a reduction in CO2 emissions, this study proposes the establishment of intermodal transfer facilities near consumption centers, where materials are primarily transported by rail, with road transport limited to the final delivery to consumption areas. The results anticipate a notable decrease in carbon emissions in aggregate transport and allow the establishment of more efficient and environmentally friendly rail/road intermodal transport that would help to meet the goals of reducing climate change while making the use of aggregates more environmentally friendly.

This study investigates the current processes and technologies for remanufacturing vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) recovered from end-of-life refrigerators, with a focus on making them reusable. The potential industrial applications of these re-VIPs in the building and cold chain sectors are also explored. Based on the above remanufacturing process information, the carbon reduction potential through the reuse of VIPs was assessed using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The study concluded that VIPs intended for reuse are most suitable for the cold chain sector. Additionally, it was estimated that assuming 15,600 VIP refrigerators are processed annually at one recycling centers, approximately 32 tons of VIPs can be reused, potentially reducing carbon emissions by −94,282 kg CO2-eq.

In analyzing the decoupling of emissions from economic growth, current literature foregoes the nonlinear complexities of macroeconomic systems, leading to ineffective energy transition policies, specifically for developing countries. This study focuses on the Indian energy–economy–emission nexus to establish a control system that internalizes inflation, trade openness, and fossil fuel imports with economic growth and macro-emissions to visualize the complex pathways of decoupling. Through long-term cointegration and vector error correction modeling, it was found that GDP and energy affect capital, inflation and energy imports, which are locked in a long-run negative feedback loop that ultimately increases emissions. Capital growth enables decoupling at 0.7% CO2 emissions reduction for every 1% capital growth, while 1% inflation growth inhibits decoupling by increasing CO2 emissions by 0.8%. A cybernetic fractional circuit of R-C elements and operational amplifiers was utilized to examine the delay of pulses from GDP to the loop elements, which revealed that capital is periodic with GDP pulses. However, inflation, being aperiodic with the clock pulses of GDP, causes the pulse-width of capital to decrease and fossil fuel imports to increase. Through the circuital model, it was possible to determine the exact policy intervention schedule in business cycle growth and recession phases that could build clean energy capital and limit inflation-induced recoupling.

This is the first review study that focuses on the interplay between China’s regulated and voluntary carbon markets, the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) scheme, and their combined influence on the development of renewable energy in the country. Through a comparative literature review of 52 peer-reviewed academic papers published between 2009 and 2024, this study aims to elucidate how these market mechanisms interact to drive renewable energy deployment. The findings indicate that both the ETS and the CCER system positively affect China’s renewable energy landscape. The ETS, with its Cap-and-Trade (CaT) mechanism, sets a cap on total emissions and allows for the trading of emission quotas, thereby creating financial incentives for companies to reduce emissions and invest in renewable energy. The CCER scheme complements the ETS by allowing companies to use the CCER scheme for a capped share of their ETS certificates, whereby the lower CCER price diverts investments to where the saved ton of CO2 in China is cheapest, further incentivizing investments in renewable energy. This dual mechanism allows for a more flexible and cost-effective approach to achieving emission reduction targets, thereby fostering an environment conducive to investment in renewable energy. It will stimulate additional investment in renewable energy projects in the long run, particularly in economically underdeveloped regions, contributing to both local economic development and national emission reduction targets.

This paper presents research in the field of optimization in maritime passenger traffic that can ensure the long-term sustainability of coastal maritime passenger lines system. For the purpose of the research contained in this paper, it has been hypothesized that the optimal arrangement of boats within a coastal maritime passenger lines system will reduce the consumption of propulsion energy, the emission of harmful gasses and operating costs. The aim of this paper is to present an efficient algorithm for a reduction in propulsion energy consumption in coastal maritime passenger lines systems by reassigning boats to lines that they service. The problem is modeled using a bipartite graph and the solution is obtained by searching for optimal matching using Edmonds’ algorithm. The authors apply, for the first time, Edmonds’ algorithm to the problems of the optimization of assignments of boats to lines. The research results were confirmed by tests on a representative example. The optimization results on only 10 ships in the given example show yearly savings of 91,097.30 L of fuel (lowering costs by EUR 69,233.95) and reducing CO2 by 243.59 tons, which proves that this algorithm found a much more efficient arrangement that could result in a significant reduction in propulsion energy consumption, thus providing economic and ecological benefits.

Abstract Gas Turbines will need to reduce CO2 emissions and prove their flexibility based on market needs and new proposed rules [2]. Economically, utilizing existing gas turbine assets to meet these requirements will be of great benefit as compared to building new turbines. Even better, determining the lowest cost least intrusive upgrades required is of great interest to power producers. The demonstration described here was conducted on one (1) GT unit at the Constellation Hillabee power plant (Siemens Energy SGT6-6000G 2x1 configuration) which doubled the mass flow of hydrogen of previous record-breaking DLN demonstrations. The testing was done on an unaltered, existing GT asset, which provides great value for those GTs which are already providing power using natural gas. The demonstrated hydrogen blending percentage of 38.8% (resulting in approximately 18% reduction in CO2 emissions) proved the system capable of meeting the first BSER goals set forth in recent proposed US EPA gas turbine rules. Such demonstrations are of critical importance as they show the inherent capability to meet reduced carbon power generation requirements without more significant cost outlays. This report documents the evaluation, preparation, execution, and results from this demonstration testing. The results are provided for the gas turbine community to use as insight into the capability and flexibility of existing assets to meet the future demands of reduced carbon power generation. Specific information around safety, reliability, emissions, and operability are discussed to provide context around existing asset capability.

This paper outlines the role that satellite-based services currently play in the European Air Traffic Management (ATM) system, and describes the expected evolution of this role as per the vision for integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (iCNS) put forward in the European ATM Master Plan Edition 2020. The focus of the paper is on the environmental benefits, including a quantification of the reduction in CO2 emissions that can be expected in the 2035 timeframe once the ATM concepts that are currently under Research and Development (R&amp;D) in the SESAR Digital European Sky Programme are deployed. Close collaboration between European ATM and space stakeholders is required during the R&amp;D and the deployment phases in order for these environmental benefits to be realised, including in particular collaboration between the SESAR programme and the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) and the European Space Agency (ESA).

Renewable energy has provided a stable electricity supply with a guaranteed reduction in CO2 production. There are various types of renewable energy, but wind energy appears to be the least expensive option compared to other renewable energy sources. The current study involves the performance investigation of an H Darrius wind turbine in Ilorin Kwara State, Nigeria. Using Ilorin wind data obtained from the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET), a 2-dimensional CFD analysis was performed on a two- bladed NACA 0018 airfoil profile with the aid of Ansys (Fluent) to unravel the implications of tip-speed ratio( TSR) and azimuthal increments on the instantaneous moment and power coefficients. The study shows that the accuracy of the results depends on the azimuthal increment used. An acceptable azimuthal increment is required for a low TSR, while an increment of 0.5 is a good choice for a high TSR, and the maximum power coefficient was obtained at a TSR of 4.5.

Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high‐value product with less energy consumption. Two‐dimensional conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (2D c‐MOFs), comprising square‐planar metal‐coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c‐MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm‐2, significantly reducing the overall water‐electrolysis‐voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4>CoO4>Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non‐noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high‐performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.

In general, an internal combustion engine vehicle is still the convention in personal and commercial transport, but due to its high use stage CO2 emission, a shift is occurring in propulsion methods, and the use of battery electric vehicles (BEV) will become the new norm. BEV’s curb weight is, in general, greater than that of a conventional fuelled vehicle (CFV) for equivalent classes. Consequently, it is questionable that the level of BEV’s energy consumption is acceptable. The aim of this paper is to compare the mass induced energy consumption of CFV and BEV. The expectation is that the comparative study of energy consumption between CFV and BEV will provide insight for proposing a strategy to determine the extent to which lightweighting can be introduced to a BEV. Encouragingly, less exhaustive energy consumption can help by reducing range anxiety by increasing BEV range, resolving one issue facing a BEV. With a typical road condition for hilly and flat roads, various drive cycles are also taken into consideration, and the energy consumption profiles for CFV and BEV can be determined. The vehicle model involved using the MATLAB/Simulink software underpinned by longitudinal vehicle dynamic methods. The idea is to determine the amount of lightweighting of various components of a BEV through an iterative process based on energy consumption profiles. As a function of mass reduction, for comparative energy expenditure, the results showed that a range of 28 to 36% reduction in BEV mass was achieved, which in turn can increase the driving range by 36.4 to 46.8%.

Background: Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) analyzes physiologic information with gas exchange during exercise. Peak oxygen volume consumption (absolute peak VO2 and percent predicted peak VO2), minute ventilation divided by carbon dioxide volume (VE/VCO2 slope) and heart rate reduction after 1 minute of recovery (heart rate recovery, HRR) all have well-established prognostic cardiovascular implications. Aim: Given the wider use of echocardiography, we aimed to see if important CPET data could be determined from resting transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Methods: In this retrospective study, cardiology patients above 18 years who underwent both resting TTE and a max-effort CPET within 3 months of each other (2017-2022) were included. Patients with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery, pacemakers, congenital heart disease, severe valve dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension were excluded before analysis. Univariate analysis with Spearman correlations was used to assess the relationship between 4 CPET measurements {absolute peak VO2 per kg, percent predicted peak VO2/kg (adjusted for age, sex and body surface area), HRR, and VE/VCO2}; and 22 quantitative TTE parameters. Bonferroni correction was applied within each set of correlations, with significance set at p-values <0.025. Multivariate linear regression models were built for all the related TTE measurements to assess relationship with the 4 CPET parameters, adjusting for age and sex. Results: Table 1 shows, out of 1909 patients analyzed, our regression model is strongest for absolute peak VO2/kg (R-squared=0.57), with 3 significantly associated TTE parameters. For percent-predicted peak VO2 per kg, 4 TTE variables were significantly associated. For heart rate recovery, only LV stroke-volume index was correlated. No TTE parameters were associated with VE/VCO2. Conclusion: Notably, echocardiographic stroke volume and tricuspid valve regurgitation peak velocity exhibited a strong correlation with absolute peak VO2/kg and percent predicted peak VO2/kg. LV stroke volume index was correlated with heart rate recovery. VE/VCO2 was not associated with any resting echocardiographic parameters, suggesting this parameter is truly exercise-dependent.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to play a significant role in the future development of smart cities, which are designed to be environmentally friendly. However, the proliferation of these devices, along with their frequent replacements and the energy required to power them, contributes to a significant environmental footprint. In this paper we provide scientific evidences on the advantages of using an energy design pattern named ‘Batch Operations’ (BO) to optimize energy consumption on mobile devices. Big ICT companies like Google already batch multiple API calls instead of putting the device into an active state many times. This is supposed to save tail energy consumption in communication peripherals. To confirm this, we set up an experiment where we compare energy consumption and carbon emission when BO is applied to two communication peripherals on Android mobile device: 4G and GPS. Results show that (1) BO can save up to 40% energy when sending HTTP requests, resulting in an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions. (2) no advantages for the GPS interface.

Development of photovoltaic–electrochemical (PV‐EC) systems for energy storage and industry decarbonization requires multidisciplinary collaborative efforts of different research groups from both photovoltaic and electrochemical research communities. Consequently, the evaluation of the solar‐to‐chemical or solar‐to‐fuel efficiency of a new electrolyzer (EC) as a part of a PV‐EC system is a time‐consuming task that is challenging in a routine optimization loop. To address this issue, a new rapid assessment method is proposed. This method employs power balance requirements to unfold the input EC characteristics into the parameter space of PV‐EC systems. The system parameters, composed with the EC output characteristics, yield the solar‐to‐chemical efficiency attainable by the electrolyzer in combination with any PV device under any irradiance at any relative PV‐to‐EC scaling and any mode of power coupling. This comprehensive overview is achieved via a mathematically simple conversion of the EC characteristics in any spreadsheet software. The method, designed to streamline the development and minimize the efforts of both the photovoltaic and electrochemical communities, is demonstrated via the analysis of CO2‐reduction electrolyzer characteristics and verified with dedicated PV‐EC experiments.

Chemical looping combustion (CLC) emerges as a cost-effective CO2 capture technology, demonstrating high competitiveness for both industrial and energy applications. This study explores the synthesis of a Cu-based, praseodymium (Pr)-modified gamma-alumina-supported (20CuPA) oxygen carrier (OC) through the wet impregnation method and investigates its performance in CLC. The characteristics of the synthesized OC were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The CLC of methane gas was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA-Q50). The oxygen transport capacity (OTC) of the 20CuPA-based OC was investigated for 10 redox cycles. The impact of temperature and time as process variables in determining the OTC of OCs was studied. The TGA results indicated that the most important factor influencing the optimization of the OTC of OCs was time. In comparison to time, temperature had less of an impact on the OTC of 20CuPA-OC. The maximum OTC of 20CuPA-OC, which was 0.0546 mg of O2/mg of OC, was reached using optimized process variables, including a temperature of 800 °C and a time of 3 min.

Electric mobility is a global trend and necessity, with electric and solar boats offering a promising alternative for transportation electrification and carbon emission reduction, especially in the Amazon region. This study analyzes the system of a solar boat from an electric mobility project—to be implemented at Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA)—using MATLAB software for modeling. The Simulink tool was utilized to model the system, focusing on operational parameters such as module voltage, converter voltage, and speed. The results indicate that the solar boat’s operational cost is significantly lower compared to a similar internal combustion model, considering diesel’s high consumption and cost. The environmental impact is also reduced, with nearly 72 tons of CO2 emissions avoided annually, thanks to Brazil’s renewable energy matrix. Simulations confirmed the project’s parameters, demonstrating the efficiency of digital-twin technology in monitoring and predicting system performance. The study underscores the importance of digital twins and renewable energy in promoting sustainable transportation solutions, advocating for the replication of such projects globally. Future research should focus on further advancing digital-twin applications in electric mobility to enhance predictive maintenance and operational efficiency.

This article presents a comparative assessment of energy consumption and fume emissions such as NOx, CO2, and CO associated with the excavation of a specified gypsum volume using two mining methods (blasting and mechanical extraction). The analysis was carried out based on a case study gypsum open-pit mine in Poland where both extraction methods are applied. The findings indicate that, for the same output volume, blasting operations require significantly less energy (ranging from 1298.12 MJ to 1462.22 MJ) compared to mechanical excavation (86,654.15 MJ). Furthermore, a substantial portion of the energy in blasting operations is attributed to explosive loading and drilling (970.95 MJ). Conversely, mechanical mining results in higher fume emissions compared to blasting. However, during mechanical extraction, the fumes are dispersed over a prolonged period of 275 h, whereas blasting achieves the same gypsum volume extraction in approximately 7.5 h. The prediction model suggests that, based on the obtained data, overall gypsum extraction will decline unless new operational levels are developed or the mine is expanded. This reduction in gypsum extraction will be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in energy consumption and emission of fumes.

The objective of this work is to investigate the implications of geological influence factors on gas content and geochemical characteristics of deep-buried (> 800 m) coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs. Results show that bituminous coal accounts for the majority, which exhibits similar maturity but differ in maceral and chemical constituents. CBM reservoirs show low porosity, low permeability and moderate temperature, with thickness of 0.85–4.15 m. In addition, the total gas content is 4.58–12.33 m3/t (average of 8.83 m3/t). CH4 is the main component with concentration of 92.83−99.22% (average of 96.68%), and the δ13CCH4 and δ13DCH4 is − 53.78‰–−44.62‰ (average of − 48.82‰) and − 223.93‰––−4.49‰ (average of − 215.37‰), respectively. All CBM samples are the mixtures of thermogenic gases and secondary biogenic gases with CO2 reduction. In addition, gas content characteristic at the critical point of burial depth is the result by positive and negative geological effects. CH4 concentration shows a wide range with the increases of buried depth, while the numerical values of which for the selected samples display complex variation characteristics. Furthermore, the values of δ13CCH4 and δ13DCH4 become heavier with the increases of buried depth. Besides, the above two geochemical parameters are related to Ro, max and reservoir temperature.

Single atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted significant interest due to their unique properties and potential for enhancing catalytic performance in various chemical reactions. In this study, we atomistically explore adsorption properties and catalytic performance of single Cu atoms anchored at low-index CeO2 surfaces, focusing on the oxidation of CO and H2. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we report that Cu adatoms bind favorably on different CeO2 surfaces, following a stability order of (100)>(110)>(111). The charge transfer from a single adsorbed Cu atom to Ce leads to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the oxidation of Cu0 to Cu+. This strengthens molecular bonds at Cu sites, particularly for CO due to the less populated d-band, while H2 shows a by ~1 eV weaker adsorption. CO oxidation is energetically more favorable than H2 oxidation on the Cu/CeO2(111) surface. The rate-controlling steps for the Mars-van Krevelen oxidation involve the formation of a bent CO2- intermediate for CO and H2O for H2. The lattice oxygen atom at the interface plays a key role for both oxidation processes. Our findings highlight the potential of single atom catalyst, Cu/CeO2, for CO adsorption and oxidation in heterogeneous catalysis.

This study investigates the effectiveness of combining magnets with parabolic and truncated fins in enhancing the distillation process of solar stills. The integration of magnets accelerated evaporation rates, while the fins increased the heat absorption area, resulting in improved output, vis-à-vis traditional solar stills. A comparative assessment revealed that the parabolic fin solar still (PFS) with magnets outperformed the truncated fin solar still (TCFS), producing 20%, 15%, and 16% more distillate at three different depths (1, 2, and 3 cm). The superior performance of the PFS is attributed to the magnetism of the water and the fins’ more extensive surface area for heat absorption. Efficiency measurements at a water depth of 1 cm showed that the PFS achieved the maximum energy and exergy efficiencies at 30.49% and 8.85%, respectively, compared with TCFS’s 25.23% and 6.22%. Economically, the PFS setup proved more feasible, with a 20.9% lower cost per liter of distilled water than TCFS. Additionally, the environmental impact assessment indicated a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, potentially generating revenues of approximately USD 1242.32 through carbon credits. These results reflect a considerable margin to enhance the efficiency of solar desalination through well-planned adjustments, which bodes well for the future of optimized solar distillation systems from an economic and environmental perspective.

Abstract Knowing the effect of different load distributions on the optimized sizes of the hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) and the fixed price of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station can be useful to potential investors in this sector. Additionally, the amount of CO2 emission under different load demands can help decision-makers in the installation of environmentally friendly EV charging stations. Investigation of fixed prices of installing power stations under different load demands leads to know whether electricity sell prices, and serves by the station owners are economically or not. This would also lead to give a reliable and economical plan to customers by station owners, where both time of arrival and charging prices have a pivotal role. Unlike previous similar studies that mostly consider one type of load demand, this study investigates the optimized HRESs including Photovoltaic panel (PV), Wind Turbine (WT), Diesel Generator (DG), and Battery (Bat) under five different proposed load demands (as electricity serving plans), reaching to the best economic, environmental, and space optimality systems. Three main sensitivity analyses upon the capacity shortage/inflation rate, capital cost of PV/WT, and solar global horizontal irradiation (GHI)/wind speed show the effect of changing the mentioned parameters on the economic, environment, and optimized systems’ sizes. It is observed that increase in the solar radiation and/or wind speed leads to reduction in the optimal size of designed systems.

Every year, 10.8 to 19.1 billion tonnes of CO2 are emitted through food exports, which accounts for roughly 21% - 37% of the world’s global total emissions. In the urge to expand businesses and ensure availability of all crops throughout the year, the quality of air is being compromised. The demand for crops rises in tandem with population growth and improvements in human well-being. In addition, most of these exported crops lose their nutritional value due to the unhealthy exposure of preservatives and other farming chemicals. There are multiple factors involved in crop production: land, labour, transportation, storage etc. Aeroponics is a relatively new farming system that eradicates numerous problems by using less land and water and requiring minimal labour and nutrients. The aim of this project is to convert the aeroponic farming unit into a 100% carbon-neutral, self-reliant unit called Aerogarden by integrating modern technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI). Every household having an Aerogarden unit can access fresh organic vegetables and microgreens that actually retain their nutritional value. By achieving this goal, non-agricultural nations' dependence on food imports will lessen, which will ultimately result in a reduction in the sector's carbon footprint. By giving people a way to directly support the international movement, the project also aims to support the UN's initiative to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

ABSTRACT The production–consumption cycle needs a transition towards a circular economy where waste valorization is included. This study investigated briquetting as a stabilization method for black soldier fly frass (BSFF) with faecal matter, pig manure, and poultry manure as the larvae feed. Herein, dried BSFF was pyrolyzed at 350 °C for 2 h to produce biochar then mixed with charcoal dust in equal ratio to produce biobriquettes through densification, with cassava gel (10 wt%) as binder. One-way ANOVA showed statistical significance in carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. There were significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between the calorific value, moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, and fixed carbon of the briquettes. The fixed carbon, volatile matter, moisture, and ash content ranged from 29.66 ± 0.86 to 42.01 ± 0.92, 29.26 ± 0.52 to 32.59 ± 0.80, 2.95 ± 0.1 to 5.08 ± 0.04, and 21.48 ± 0.14 to 37.20 ± 0.29, respectively. The calorific value of the produced briquettes ranged from 16.25 ± 0.57 to 20.70 ± 0.53 MJ/kg, which exceeds the minimum requirement of 14.5 MJ/kg recommended for non-woody briquettes. During combustion, concentrations of NOx, N2O, CO, and CO2 varied significantly across the treatments with the acacia charcoal having the highest concentration of CO. Briquetting is a potential stabilization method for frass resulting in waste reduction, bioenergy production, reduced adverse effects of climate change, and enhanced sustainability.

African countries are committed to the creation of free trade areas as a means of consolidating trade links between African nations. Intra-African trade is expected to boost economic growth and improve macroeconomic performance and living standards in Africa. However, theoretical insights and empirical evidence suggest that these efforts risk being undermined by the adverse environmental consequences of trade, which are likely to undermine the continent's achievements in terms of sustainable development and poverty reduction. This paper aims to examine the environmental impact of intra-African trade while integrating FDI, economic growth, urbanization, and energy consumption. The study used a panel data set for 32 African countries over the period 1990-2020. The empirical analysis was based on the latest panel estimation techniques. More specifically, we used the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test, the second generation of unit root tests on panel data, and the PMG estimator to estimate an ARDL panel. The error correction term reveals the existence of a cointegrating relationship between CO2 and trade, FDI, and the other control variables. The results suggest that intra-African trade worsens environmental quality in Africa in the long term. Similarly, FDI has a similar ecological impact, corroborating the ‘pollution heaven’ hypothesis. The results also refute the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Energy consumption plays a key role in the long-term deterioration of the environment. Finally, urbanization degrades the environment in line with the intuition of urban environmental transition theory.

Electrolyte alkaline cations can significantly modulate the reaction selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R), enhancing the yield of the valuable multicarbon (C2+) chemical feedstocks. However, the mechanism underlying this cation effect on the C–C coupling remains unclear. Herein, by performing constant-potential AIMD simulations, we studied the dynamic behavior of interfacial K+ ions over Cu surfaces during C–C coupling and the origin of the cation effect. We showed that the specific adsorption of K+ readily occurs at the surface sites adjacent to the *CO intermediates on the Cu surfaces. Furthermore, this specific adsorption of K+ during *CO–*CO coupling is more important than quasi-specific adsorption for enhancing coupling kinetics, reducing the coupling barriers by approximately 0.20 eV. Electronic structure analysis revealed that charge redistribution occurs between the specifically adsorbed K+, *CO, and Cu sites, and this can account for the reduced barriers. In addition, we identified excellent *CO–*CO coupling selectivity on Cu(100) with K+ ions. Experimental results show that suppressing surface K+-specific adsorption using the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) significantly decreases the Faradaic efficiency for C2 products from 41.1% to 4.3%, consistent with our computational findings. This study provides crucial insights for improving the selectivity toward C2+ products by rationally tuning interfacial cation adsorption during eCO2R. Specifically, C–C coupling can be enhanced by promoting K+-specific adsorption, for example, by confining K+ within a coated layer or using pulsed negative potentials.

This study presents a bio-inspired design approach for the engineering applications of agricultural implements, with practical implications for the field. The CAD modeling of bio-inspired serrated lawnmower cutter blades was followed by structural and fatigue analysis with a comparative evaluation of the performance of conventional plain cutter blades. This method involved the bionic transformation of a biological model of the serrated leg of the grasshopper, traced using MATLAB edge detection and image processing software. The solid modeling CAD software for the Bionic Blade lawnmower cutter blade converts this biological model into an engineering model. After designing the geometric shape of the bionic tooth profile's serrated cutting edge, the boundary conditions are evaluated for numerical simulation based on the machine specifications of the conventional lawnmower cutter. After analyzing the power of the motor, the rotational speed, and the torque, the static structural and fatigue analysis was carried out in numerical simulation software to synthesize the performance of the bionic lawnmower cutter blade for engineering analysis of deformation, shear stress, and fatigue life. The bionic design of the blade and conventional plain blades were manufactured using an Amada CO2 laser cutting machine and sheet metal bending processes for Stainless Steel (SS 304) material. The experimental validation of software simulation was carried out by field trials using the Bionic design of a lawnmower cutter blade to evaluate the performance improvement in cutting time and yield of grass cut in kg for 60 to 100 meters distance cutting. After comparing the performance of the plain blade and the design of the bionic blade, there was a reduction in abrasive wear, a 12.87% improvement in the cutting time, and a 14.8% increase in the yield of grass compared to the conventional blade. This performance improvement was attributed to the unique bionic design of serrated cutting-edge and ground clearance. The bio-inspired design approach has immense practical applications in designing agricultural implements, as confirmed by this performance evaluation of this case study of bio-inspired lawnmower cutter blades.

Background: Right ventricular pacing (RVP) can have adverse cardiac effects and cause pacing induced cardiomyopathy (PiCM). His bundle pacing (HBP)&Left Bundle Branch area pacing (LBBAP) mimic physiologic conduction (PhysioP) and maintain biventricular synchrony. Hypothesis and Aims: Reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function reserve in the presence of normal baseline LV ejection fraction (EF) could precede development of RV PiCM. Our aim was to compare the effects of RVP vs. PhysioP on bicycle exercise cardiopulmonary performance in patients with normal LVEF who required pacing for bradyarrhythmias. Methods: Patients with sinus rhythm and RVP or PhysioP&ventricular pacing burden of >70% who completed cardiopulmonary exercise test and simultaneous stress echocardiography (SE) were included. Pulmonary gas exchange was calculated using Ventilation/CO2 production at rest and during exercise. Changes in LV size, EF, longitudinal strain and diastolic function and gas exchange parameters were compared post and pre exercise in the 2 groups. Results: 25 of 29 patients completed the study [68 ± 23 yrs, 48% M; LVEF 56±5%, 11 RVP, 14 PhysioP]. There was no difference in baseline demographic&clinical variables, exercise duration, rest and peak heart rate and blood pressure between 2 groups. Pacing duration was 2.61±1.48 yrs in RVP vs. 0.84±0.67 yrs (p=0.003) in the Physio group. Resting echocardiographic parameters ( Table 1A) were comparable. Compared to RVP, reduction in LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) 3.4±14.1 ml vs. -23.1±18.1ml, p=0.006)&LV end-systolic volume (ESV -5.7±11.6 ml vs. -18.0±9.5ml, p=0.01) was more pronounced in the PhysioP group. Changes in LVEF, LV strain&diastolic function were not different between the 2 groups ( Table 1B ). There were no significant differences in changes in pulmonary gas exchange parameters in the 2 groups. Conclusions: In patients with normal LVEF and pacemaker dependent, RVP is associated with impaired but PhysioP with preserved LV systolic function reserve, which can be detected by exercise SE. SE may help identify patients at risk for RV PiCM. Benefit of PhysioP needs to be determined by larger studies with longer follow-up.

Urachal remnant (UR) is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from the obliteration failure of a fibrous tube which connects the umbilicus to the bladder dome during embryological development. Laparoscopic resection has been used for symptomatic UR in recent years, and simultaneous umbilical resection has been reported to prevent the recurrence of umbilical infection.1 Empirically, the CO2 insufflation pressure decreases during umbilical resection, which sometimes makes it difficult to achieve a safe surgical field. The AirSeal™ Intelligent Flow System (SurgiQuest, Milford, USA; ConMed Japan, Tokyo) is an insufflator designed to maintain pneumoperitoneum pressure with continuous smoke evacuation and CO2 recirculation during surgery.2 Several advantages were reported in urologic surgeries, such as shown in Table S1.2 In this report, we evaluated a modified method of laparoscopic surgery for UR, using a 5-mm port connected to AirSeal. A 26-year-old man was diagnosed with UR at a nearby hospital using magnetic resonance imaging due to repeated umbilical infections. The patient visited our hospital for UR surgery, and laparoscopic umbilical resection was performed. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position, and a Foley catheter was inserted. The transperitoneal approach was employed, and the first 12-mm port was inserted using Hasson's open technique on the right border of the rectus abdominis at the level of the umbilicus. Pneumoperitoneum was achieved by CO2 insufflation to a pressure of 10 mmHg, and a 10-mm flexible laparoscope was placed using this port. Next, a 5- and 12-mm working ports were placed under the direct vision; the 12-mm port was located 7 cm caudal, 5 mm lateral to the first port, and the 5-mm port was located 7 cm cranial, 5 mm lateral to the first port, respectively, and AirSeal was connected to the 5-mm port (Figure 1). Between the bilateral umbilical ducts, LigaSure™ MaryLand (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was used to dissect the UR from the posterior layer of the rectus abdominis sheath. UR was dissected in the caudal direction, clipped, and cut just above the bladder dome using a Hem-o-lok (Teleflex, Wayne, USA) (Figure 1b). UR was then dissected in the cranial direction to the rectus abdominis sheath just below the umbilicus, and the resection range of the umbilical skin was determined using a cathelin needle. The cathelin needle was inserted from outside the body along the skin incision line, and the resection range was decided by confirming the needle in intra-peritoneum vision (Figure 1c). The UR and attached umbilical skin were excised using an appropriate resection line (Figure 1d). After urachal excision, Endo Close™ (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was used to secure the closure of the urachal defect. Under intraperitoneal observation of the urachal cavity, an Endo Close needle with a 70-cm absorbable suture was inserted from outside the body, and the rectus abdominis fascia, muscle, and peritoneum were punctured. The suture was then left in the body, the EndoClose needle was inserted again from the opposite side of the urachal cavity, and the suture was captured. The suture was pulled to the skin level and ligated (Figure 1e). This process was repeated to bridge the defects. The insufflation pressure and surgical field were maintained during the procedure, despite the umbilical cavity. Finally, umbilicoplasty was performed with the assistance of a plastic surgeon. Intra- or retro-peritoneal approach, single-site and robot assisted surgery have recently been employed for laparoscopic UR surgery.3-6 The peritoneal approach provides a large enough cavity for laparoscopic working; however, it has a risk of intestine injury and retro-peritoneal approach often does not have enough cavity to set the ports.6 Moreover, single-site or robotic surgery is devoid of umbilical resection.4, 5 Due to the maintenance of insufflation pressure, our modification achieves a large operation field throughout the procedure, which might result in the reduction of risk of not only intestine injury but also abdominal incisional hernia, a known complication of umbilical resection.7 It is sure, that a muscle hook might achieve a similar view by lifting abdominal wall, and a proficient operator might perform the same operation without AirSeal system. However, one of the maximum advantages of AirSeal system is considered to make a safe view and procedure, not depending on the operator's experience. Furthermore, in our active umbilical infection case, this method was useful given the larger umbilical cavity. Despite the diameter being over 5 cm of urachal defect, the surgical field was maintained due to AirSeal (Figure 1f), suggesting that the modification could be effective regardless of the urachal defect size. Our study, for the first time, evaluated the impact of AirSeal on laparoscopic surgery for UR and it can potentially overcome problems associated with other methods.

Introduction/Background: Neurodevelopmental impairment is a challenge for many children with complex congenital heart disease who undergo surgical intervention with cardiopulmonary bypass during the early postnatal period. Research Questions/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (BM-MSC) delivery through cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) will improve neurodevelopmental outcome and post-operative course. Goals/Aims: The primary goal of this single-center, dose-escalation phase 1 trial was to assess the safety/feasibility and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BM-MSC treatment. Methods/Approach: Inclusion criteria of the phase 1 trial were neonates/infants (ages ≤ 6 months) who underwent scheduled two-ventricle repair without arch reconstruction. Dose escalation was guided by a modified continual reassessment method at four dose levels (1-40x10^6 cells/kg). Dose limiting toxicity was assessed for 45 days after BM-MSC delivery. Secondary endpoints before discharge were compared with a historical cohort (n=222) by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score to balance the groups. Results/Data: Seventeen patients were enrolled from July 2020 to June 2023 (ventricular septal defect, n=9; tetralogy of Fallot, n=7; transposition of the great arteries, n=1; male, n=10). There were 3 serious adverse events all of which were related to cardiac surgery and not the BM-MSC product (junctional ectopic tachycardia, n=2; diaphragm paresis, n=1). Among 50 total events, there were no adverse events related to BM-MSCs. The BM-MSC dose was successfully escalated to the planned MTD (40x10^6 cells/kg), demonstrating safety and feasibility of this therapeutic delivery strategy. Consistent with results indicating little interference on CPB functions, electron microscopy studies showed no BM-MSC adherence on the CPB filter mesh at the MTD. Multivariable analyses with IPTW identified a reduction of CO2 and lactate levels in MeDCaP cases. We observed differences in white blood cell, monocyte, and platelet numbers between the two groups, suggesting possible interaction between endogenous blood cells and applied BM-MSCs. Conclusions: We confirmed the safety and feasibility of BM-MSC treatment during CPB at the proposed MTD level. Successful design and completion of a future phase 2 trial is needed to determine efficacy.

Andžs, M. “Loose-fill heat insulation material obtained from hemp shives by steam explosion”. Ph.D. thesis. Jelgava, LBTU, 2024. – 112 pages. The thesis text includes 10 tables, 60 images, 21 formulas and 225 references to the used literature sources. The doctoral thesis was developed in the Biorefining Laboratory of the Latvian State Institute of Wood Chemistry by support of the European Union 7th Framework Programme Wood Wisdom project “ProLignin” (2012-2014), National Research Program “ResProd” (2014-2017), European Regional Development Fund research results commercialization project No 1.2.1.2/16/I/001/ KC-PI-2020/13 "Commercialisation of the technology for the production of lignocellulosic bulk thermal insulation material" (2020–2022) and Fundamental and Applied Research lzp-2021/1-0599 “Investigation of eco-friendly thermal insulation materials from sustainable and renewable industrial crops residuals” project (2022–2024). Regulations’ of the European Union and global best practice trends for limiting climate change have forced Latvia to implement actions for the rational consumption and saving of heat energy. Latvia has the lowest housing quality in the European Union, including buildings with relatively low thermal stability. EU regulations and society demand sustainable, health and environmentally friendly thermal insulation materials. As a solution to the urgent need for a new thermal insulation material produced from non-woody lignocellulosic biomass of local origin, a new loose-fill thermal insulation material that meets current regulations and environmental requirements has been developed from the by-product of agricultural plants – hemp shives – in the research of the doctoral thesis. The thesis is a detailed and fundamental, but at the same time a technological study, which includes the development of the pretreatment methodology for the hemp shives by the steam explosion of hemp shives, the study of the properties of the obtained fibrous materials and the evaluation of loose-fill thermal insulation material samples. As a result of the research, a steam explosion method was applied for the production of environmentally friendly thermal insulation material. The influence of the variable parameters of the steam explosion technology on the structure, properties and application possibilities of the obtained material in heat and sound insulation was studied, thus creating new knowledge about the application of the steam explosion technology in the processing of agricultural residues. The optimal processing parameters of the steam explosion method for obtaining loose-fill thermal insulation material from hemp shives are at a temperature of 235° C, a pressure of 32 Bar with release immediately after reaching it, i.e. holding time 0 minutes. One of the most important scientific findings in the development of loose-fill thermal insulation material with steam explosion technology is the discovery that the most important is the adiabatic process (second phase – explosion), which performs fibrillation of the sample, maximally shortening the thermochemical process (first phase). By choosing the optimal processing conditions, it is possible to reduce the bulkiness up to 2.3 times, obtaining the best indicators of thermal inertia and thermal conductivity. The thermal insulation properties of the developed fiber loose-fill material (λ=0.043 W·m-1·K-1) are equivalent to analogs on the market. The research of the thesis has a significant practical value, as a practically applicable technology has been developed for the processing of by-products of hemp fiber production – hemp shives – into products with high added value, thus creating a knowledge-intensive, innovative product with commercialization and export potential. The developed product contributes to the growing demand for sustainable thermal insulation materials, as well as contributes to the achievement of Latvia's climate neutrality goals and the reduction of CO2 emissions in the field of energy efficiency.
