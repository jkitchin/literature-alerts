Ionic liquids (ILs) containing aprotic N-heterocyclic anions (AHAs) are attractive CO2 capture solvents. However, CO2 uptake has only been measured in a limited subset of AHAs (27 tetraalkylphosphonium AHA ILs with 14 unique AHAs). To evaluate the broader range of possible AHA ILs with tetraalkylphosphonium cations, we develop a CO2 uptake model which is a function of temperature, pressure, and anion–CO2 reaction enthalpy calculated using electronic structure methods (DFT). The resulting model accurately describes CO2 uptake within ±0.046 mol CO2 per mole of AHA ILs on average. We use this model to predict the CO2 uptake for ILs of an additional 267 AHAs, whose uptakes have not been measured, for post-combustion carbon capture. Several identified candidates demonstrate similar or greater CO2 cyclic capacity than the best performing aqueous amines. Additionally, we show that the anion–CO2 reaction enthalpy, and hence the anion's basicity, can be correlated with a novel COSMO-RS descriptor─the σ-potential slope of the uncomplexed anion. This requires only a single DFT calculation, roughly halving the computational requirement to construct the uptake model. Finally, our findings highlight the potential applicability of the σ-potential slope as an electronic descriptor in screening chemical reactivity across various molecular motifs.

Abstract As an effective approach to converting carbon oxide (CO 2 ) into value‐added carbonaceous products, the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) has shown considerable potential for carbon neutrality, addressing global pollution and climate issues. Copper (Cu)‐based electrocatalysts (CuECs) are acknowledged as important candidates for the ECO 2 RR of multi‐carbon products. Nevertheless, the complicated electron transfer and multiple competitive pathways in the multi‐carbon production process raise challenges of product selectivity. While achieving high current density and structural stability, improving the product selectivity of CuECs has become crucial to their practical applications. Herein, an overview of the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic principles of ECO 2 RR are presented. Then, the typical strategies are summarized for increasing CuEC selectivity for the formation of multi‐carbon products from CO 2 , including morphological control, component design, defect design, and interface design. The catalyst design, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanisms involved in these strategies are reviewed. Finally, the major challenges and future prospects for high‐performance electrocatalysts in ECO 2 RR are discussed.

Compared with the large number of publications devoted to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysed by polyoxometalates (POMs), the electrocatalysis of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CDRR) by these molecular catalysts has been only marginally explored. At first glance, this may seem surprising in view of their remarkable electron transfer properties which can be finely tuned by molecular engineering to fit the different proton-assisted multielectron reduction potentials for CO 2 . The possible combination of CO 2 with POMs in the form of coordination complexes appears, however, to be a promising route to develop POM-based electrocatalytic assemblies able to selectively drive CDRR. In this chapter, we provide an up-to-date description of more or less promising examples dealing with CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs in homogeneous (POMs dissolved in the electrolyte solution) and supported (POMs-modified (photo)electrodes) phases. This shows that promoting CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs with excellent performance metrics (efficiency, selectivity and stability) represents a current challenge. As a representative example, a POM-modified electrode that delivers high electrocatalytic current density (>10 mA cm −2 ) and is highly selective for CDRR has yet to be discovered.

Given the increasing emphasis on carbon dioxide (CO2), diverse approaches have been developed and then used to address the issue. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown promise in catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Different types of MOFs have investigated, including Cu-MOFs, Ce-MOFs, and hybrid composites, in order to enhance the catalytic selectivity, activity, and stability of electrocatalysts. MOFs possess distinct structural characteristics such as a large surface area, adjustable pore architectures, and numerous active sites, which provide effective adsorption, activation, and subsequent electrochemical reduction of CO2. The inclusion of metal centres, such as copper, silver, and cobalt, in MOFs has shown a strong preference for valuable chemical products, such as ethylene, formate, methane, and acetic acid. Incorporating MOFs with carbon-based electrodes or photosensitizers has significantly improved the catalytic efficiency and the speed at which charge is transferred in CO2 electroreduction processes. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles to overcome, such as the need to optimize the composition of catalysts, manage particle size, and provide scalability for use in industrial applications. Further study is necessary to expand the range of electrochemical techniques and reaction conditions, enhance the longevity of catalysts, and explore the potential of utilizing these types of catalysts for the specific conversion of CO2 into other valuable liquid fuels.

Abstract This study builds upon the evolving landscape of sustainable construction practices, where optimizing ready-mix concrete for strength, cost-efficiency, and reduced CO2 emissions is crucial in aligning with global environmental sustainability targets. Through an extensive analysis of diverse input parameters, including water-cement ratio, aggregate characteristics, additives, and their interactions with critical output parameters, this research has unveiled a substantial dependence on concrete performance, cost-efficiency, and environmental impact on cement selection and proportioning. This research emphasizes the pivotal role of cement in determining both the cost and CO2 emissions of concrete production, highlighting a notable positive correlation between cement content and compressive strength (R2 = 0.4946), and an even more pronounced correlation with CO2 emissions (R2 = 0.9529). This underlines the importance of optimizing cement use for balanced performance. Furthermore, the study reveals that while admixtures play a limited role in enhancing compressive strength (R2 = 0.0426), their impact on other concrete properties like workability and durability is significant. The optimization of concrete components, including a strategic reduction in admixture use, can lead to considerable cost and CO2 emission reductions, exemplified by a 5% cost decrease and a 7% drop in emissions with a 20% admixture reduction. Overall, these findings highlight the transformative impact of AI in concrete mix design, paving the way for more sustainable construction methods and contributing to global efforts to reduce the infrastructure sector's carbon footprint.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high‐value carbon‐based chemicals provides a sustainable approach to achieving an artificial carbon cycle. In the decade, metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), a kind of porous crystalline porous materials featuring well‐defined structures, large surface area, high porosity, diverse components, easy tailorability, and controllable morphology, have attracted considerable research attention, serving as electrocatalysts to drive CO2 reduction. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structure/component advantages of MOFs meeting the requirements of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are analyzed. After that, the representative progress for the precise fabrication of MOF‐based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation, are systemically summarized. Furthermore, the emerging applications and promising research for more practical scenarios related to electrochemical CO2 conversion are specifically proposed. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook of MOFs for electrochemical CO2 reduction are further discussed.

Abstract: Fine‐tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure‐property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed‐dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal‐on‐nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self‐assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof‐of‐concept demonstration, a series of Au‐on‐Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2‐to‐CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au‐on‐Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface‐dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.

Thermal motor emissions have grown cold and colder over time thanks to the betterment of the yield of motors. This contributes to an inversion of behaviour of CO2, since photosynthesis is endothermic, absorbs heat together with it. New CO2 emissions are coldening the climate where thermal motor efficiency is good. This is confirmed with AI support and shown to explain the late snows this Spring in Europe, as well as the “La Niña” trend that has been announced. Global warming can be totally reduced and reversed with a consistent pattern of smart CO2 emissions, without the heat associated, thanks to new thermally efficient motors.

Background: Ventilatory strategies in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients aim to mitigate the risk of acute lung injury (ALI). However, prolonged utilization of these strategies may precipitate alveolar carbon dioxide elevation and pH reduction. This scoping review endeavors to present extant knowledge concerning hypercapnia effects in experimental models, with or without ALI, specifically focusing on delineating the immunologically mediated pulmonary tissue damage; Methods: A systematic exploration encompassing PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Reviews, and Scielo databases was undertaken. Articles published between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2022, were screened for their elucidation of hypercapnia&#039;s immunological impact on lung tissue, utilizing experimental or biological models, irrespective of ALI presence; Results: Following duplicate removal and predefined criteria filtering, 30 pertinent articles scrutinizing hypercapnia&#039;s influence on pulmonary epithelium were identified. It was observed that hypercapnia induces perturbations in innate immune response gene transcription, mediated via Nuclear Factor-kappa B attenuation. Furthermore, a compromised innate immune response against injurious agents was noted. Concurrently, disruption and subsequent resealing of alveolar epithelial cells were evidenced, primarily through Na/K-ATPase endocytosis, impeding fluid reabsorption at the alveolar epithelium level; Conclusions: In experimental settings, with or without ALI, hypercapnia&#039;s immunomediated mechanisms exacerbate innate immune system impairment and disrupt the respiratory epithelium&#039;s repair and healing processes.

In this work, we have prepared and characterized some gold compounds wearing a N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand as well as alkynyl derivatives with different substituents. The study of their electrochemical behavior reveals that these complexes show an irreversible wave at potentials ranging between −2.79 and −2.91 V, referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene pair. DFT calculations indicate that the reduction occurs mainly on the aryl-C≡C fragment. The cyclic voltammetry experiments under CO2 atmosphere show an increase in the faradaic current of the reduction wave compared to the experiments under argon atmosphere, indicating a possible catalytic activity towards the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR).

Global warming is one of the most important issues that the world is currently facing. The cement industry accounts for around 7% of total global CO2 emissions. According to the 13th United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, cement plants must become carbon neutral by 2050. This neutrality may be achieved by a reduction in CO2 emissions complemented with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies. In accordance with these sustainable goals, several approaches have been studied. This paper investigates life cycle carbon of mortars produced with carbonated recycled aggregates. In previous works, the carbon dioxide capture capacity of construction and demolition waste (CDW) was analysed, and mortars with CDW recycled aggregates submitted to high levels of CO2 were evaluated in terms of their mechanical performance. This paper focus on the life cycle carbon impact assessment (LCCA) of industrial mortar formulations in a cradle-to-gate boundary. This assessment is carried out through a global warming potential environment impact assessment, since it represents the amount of CO2 equivalent that is sent to the atmosphere and contributes to the “greenhouse effect”. This LCCA includes the impacts associated with the treatment and additional transportation routes of the recycled aggregates. With this work, it was found that mortars with carbonated recycled aggregates have a considerably lower global warming potential impact than mortars without recycled aggregates. The mortars with recycled aggregates presented lower CO2 emissions of up to 6.31% for 100% incorporation of non-carbonated recycled aggregates. These values were incremented with the carbonation of the recycled aggregates, achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 36.75% for 100% of incorporation.

Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction. Herein, a unique Co‐N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2'‐bipyridine and triazine‐containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy‐COF‐Co enabled a record‐high CO production rate of 426 mmol g‐1 h‐1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607 h−1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8:1‐1:16). A systematical investigation including operando synchrotron X‐ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in‐situ attenuated total reflection surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine‐based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co‐N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF‐derived single‐atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.

The application of carbon dioxide (CO2) in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects is becoming increasingly more interesting in the petroleum industry because it can boost oil production rates while potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The injected CO2 causes oil swelling and viscosity reduction, making it easier to flow through the reservoir fractures. This article studies the performance of the first EOR CO2 project in Croatia, which started operations in 2014 with a capacity of 0.41 million tons per year (Mtpa). The CO2 source is a natural gas processing plant, which released the CO2 into the atmosphere prior to the EOR project. Now, this CO2 is continuously captured, compressed, transported, liquefied, and injected into the EOR fields of Ivanić and Žutica. Tertiary (EOR) oil recovery at these two oil fields is expected to raise the oil recovery factors up to 55% from the previously achieved 9% in the primary stage and 36% in the secondary stage. Besides the EOR project, this article reviews other carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects in Croatia, for the cement industry, power generation, and biofuel production. All these projects combined could bring the total CCUS capacity up to 1.843 Mtpa by 2030.

This paper aims to verify the possibility of utilising water-in-diesel emulsions (WiDE) as an alternative drop-in fuel for diesel engines. An 8% WiDE was produced to be tested in a four-stroke, indirect injection (IDI) diesel engine and compared to EN590 diesel fuel. An eddy current brake and an exhaust gas analyser were utilised to measure different engine parameters such as torque, fuel consumption, and emissions at different engine loads. The results show that the engine running on emulsified fuel leads to a reduction in torque and power, an increase in the specific fuel consumption, and slightly better thermal efficiency. The highest percentual increment of thermal efficiency for WiDE is obtained at 100% engine load, 5.68% higher compared to diesel. The emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are reduced, but carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) emissions are increased, compared to traditional diesel fuel. The most substantial decrease in NO and CO2 levels was achieved at 75% engine load with 33.86% and 25.08% respectively, compared to diesel.

The notable reduction in forest coverage and usage of nonrenewable energy resources have resulted in accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thus contributing to the worsening of the phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. This research undertook an investigation into the efficacy of a distinct absorbent in eliminating CO2 from the air within a spouted bed reactor. By utilizing the Taguchi methodology, the study examined the capacity of sodium carbonate to eradicate CO2 from the atmosphere across a wide range of concentrations (600–1850 ppm), temperatures (55–90 °C), and molar ratios of Na to C in the absorbent (ranging from 1 to 3). The results indicated that this absorbent effectively eliminated 86% of the initial CO2 at a reaction temperature of 55 °C, a molar Na/C ratio of 1.4, and an initial concentration of 1280 ppm. Additionally, the examination of the solid composition postabsorption using X-ray diffraction revealed the formation of sodium bicarbonate during the absorption process. The novelty of this study resides in the introduction of a novel method for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. Moreover, the viability of regenerating sodium carbonate by liberating CO2 from bicarbonate was also evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis.

The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is one of the most promising ways to valorise CO2 as a source of carbon. The development of novel, efficient and scalable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction within electrolysers is still a big challenge. Here, we report the preparation of sustainable, efficient and stable gas diffusion electrodes utilizing Ag as catalyst for the CO2 electroreduction to CO. These cathodic materials are prepared by sputter deposition and subjected to post-deposition modification using dry, reactive processes. The catalyst is uniformly deposited as a thin layer on the porous structure of PTFE minimizing the amount of Ag required. This approach allows for fine tuning of the morphology, chemical composition and loading of Ag and their impact on the CO2RR. These electrodes have been evaluated for the CO2 electroreduction and for electrocatalytic studies in a flow reactor with gas-fed CO2. The optimized electrodes show high activity, with current densities > 20 mA/cm2 at -1,18 V vs. RHE, and faradaic efficiency for CO > 90 %. The stability was tested over periods up to 24 hours showing a significant impact of the post-deposition modification. Higher porosity, roughness and electrochemical surface area have been achieved after the modification. Noteworthy, our approach allows for outstanding performances using a minimal amount of metal, while using the processing advantages of sputtering as an industrial state-of-the-art, high-throughput, and roll-to-roll compatible technique. Moreover, this route enables the deposition of different metals and alloys of tailored composition for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction beyond CO.

The air–fuel ratio is a crucial parameter in internal combustion engines that affects optimal engine performance, emissions, fuel efficiency, engine durability, power, and efficiency. Positive pressure ventilators (PPVs) create specific operating conditions for drive units, characterized by a reduced ambient pressure compared to standard atmospheric pressure, which is used to control carburetor-based fuel supply systems. The impact of these conditions was investigated for four commonly used PPVs (with internal combustion engines) in fire services across the European Union (EU), using a lambda (λ), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen carbon (HC) analyser for exhaust gases. All four ventilators were found to operate with lean and very lean mixtures, with their lambda coefficients ranging from 1.6 to 2.2. The conducted tests of the CO2, CO, and HC concentrations in the exhaust gases of all four fans show dependencies consistent with theoretical analyses of the impact of the fuel–air mixture on emissions. It can be observed that as the amount of burned air decreases, the values of CO and HC decrease, while the concentration of CO2 increases with the increase in engine load. Such an operation can accelerate engine wear, increase the emission of harmful exhaust gases, and reduce the effective performance of the device. This condition is attributed to an inadequate design process, where drive units are typically designed to operate within atmospheric pressure conditions, as is common for these engines. However, when operating with a PPV, the fan’s rotor induces significant air movement, leading to a reduction in ambient pressure on the intake side where the engine is located, thereby disrupting its proper operation.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) over Cu-based catalysts has emerged as a promising strategy for value-added artificial carbon cycling, addressing the current climate and energy challenges. However, the product selectivity and long-term stability of Cu-based catalysts are limited by their instability at constant potential. Recent advancements in pulsed techniques aim to overcome these limitations, enhancing the industrial feasibility of the CO2RR systems. This review critically examines recent research progress in pulsed CO2RR over Cu-based catalysts, offering a comprehensive synthesis of current findings. Key pulse parameters and characterization strategies are explored to uncover the mechanisms behind the enhanced CO2RR performance. The focus is on surface reconstruction, encompassing the regeneration and stabilization of the Cu oxidation states alongside morphological evolution, while also discussing microenvironment changes, including local CO2 concentration, local pH, and ionic arrangement. The intricate modulation mechanisms of pulse mode, potential, and duration on the CO2RR performance are elucidated, highlighting their interconnections. Finally, we identify the prevailing challenges and propose future directions for achieving environmentally friendly and economically viable artificial carbon cycling. By providing insightful perspectives on optimizing pulsed CO2RR, this review paves the way for developing more efficient and robust Cu-based catalytic systems.

(1) Efforts on harnessing excess emitted CO2 back to the carbon cycle via chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical pathways have seen steady development to produce value-added chemicals for energy storage. (1,2) Among them, an environmentally benign electroreduction approach is the most promising one for valorization of CO2 as fuels and chemicals, albeit the fact that sluggish kinetics and lack of selectivity require the design of suitable catalysts. (3,4) Molecular electrocatalysts have well-defined active sites and accurately tailorable structures that allow mechanism-based performance optimization. Among them, several are based on easily available first-row transition metals to catalyze CO2 reduction (CO2RR) via a 2e–/2H+ mechanism to form CO and HCOOH. (5) Nevertheless, examples of molecular catalysts capable of reducing CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ (e.g., multielectron products) are scarce. A key reason for that is the difficulty in controlling the binding affinity of the catalyst-bound CO intermediate, which often plays a pivotal role in the generation of multielectron/multiproton products. (5,6) Along with this, the complexity of the multielectron/multiproton pathways involving multiple intermediates provides a limited understanding of the reaction mechanism. (5,7) Herein, we would like to highlight several recently reported strategies that show promising CO2RR activity and selectivity toward products beyond 2e–/2H+, such as (i) immobilization of functionalized molecular catalysts over conductive supports, (ii) incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding groups proximal to the active site, and (iii) the use of light illumination during electrochemical CO2RR in molecular catalysts incorporated within porous hybrid platforms.Initially, Wang et al. reported one of the first examples of a molecular electrocatalyst reducing CO2 to value-added multielectron hydrocarbons. They immobilized a cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst (CoPc, Figure 1a) over multiwalled carbon-nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNTs) and used it as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst that, in aqueous solution, undergoes 6e–/6H+ CO2RR to generate CH3OH. (5) They first compared the catalytic performance of CNT-immobilized iron, cobalt, and nickel phthalocyanine (FePc, CoPc, and NiPc, respectively), as metal-to-CO binding energy, EB(CO), varies with different M–N4, spanning over a range of 1.2 eV and found that cobalt provides moderate CO binding. Therefore, among all three catalysts, only CoPc produced MeOH with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 44% at −0.94 V vs RHE (CO and H2 being the major products for FePc and NiPc). Through scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis they have shown that CoPc has molecular level dispersion over the CNT, which is vital for MeOH formation. Otherwise, physical mixtures of CoPc and CNTs showed much less reactivity, despite having higher CoPc content. According to their observation, at lower overpotential, CO was the major CO2RR product, and thus, it was postulated that CO acts as a reactive intermediate toward MeOH formation. Indeed, when an electrocatalytic CO reduction reaction (CORR) using CoPc/MWCNT was performed, it produced MeOH with a FE of 28% at −0.77 V vs RHE. Overall, catalysis goes through a "domino" process where CO2 first reduces to CO, and then undergoes another 4e–/4H+ reduction to MeOH, and the potential-dependent steps of both CO2RR and CORR are very similar. Nonetheless, this catalytic system suffers from rather limited durability. Upon only 1 h of electrolysis, FECH3OH decreased by 18%, while after 4 h of electrolysis, MeOH formation became negligible. UV–visible spectra of the postelectrolysis CoPc molecule from the electrode revealed an undesired reduction of the Pc ligand, eventually leading to hydrogenation of the macrocycle. To avoid the reductive deactivation, Wang and co-workers introduced four electron-donating amino groups in the β position of the CoPc moiety (Figure 1b, CoPc-NH2), which successfully lowered the overpotential and could sustain activity for a longer time with a maximum FECH3OH of 32%.Figure 1Figure 1.

(8) Under heterogeneous conditions in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution (pH = 7.2), they obtained only 0.3% FECH3OH at −0.88 V vs RHE, which increased to 2% when they used CO as substrate instead of CO2. However, at pH 13, when CO was used as a substrate, the same CoPc/MWCNT system exhibited 14.3% FECH3OH at −0.68 V vs RHE, i.e., a 50-fold increase in selectivity at a 170 mV lower overpotential, along with a 10-fold increase in catalytic rate. Subsequent HPLC experiments showed that during CORR at pH 13, formaldehyde (HCHO) is formed. At alkaline pH, there is a chance of Cannizzaro reaction, i.e., a disproportionation of HCHO (aldehyde without α hydrogens) to CH3OH and HCOO– causing an overestimation of CH3OH's FE determination. Knowing that, Robert and co-workers carefully evaluated these nonfaradaic CH3OH formations and concluded that their effect is negligible. In addition, a series of control experiments, along with Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the CoPc before and after electrolysis proved that the observed reactivity was not due to the decomposition of CoPc into metallic Co nanoparticles, thus signifying the molecular nature of the catalyst.Lately, McCrory et al. further investigated the catalytic properties of the CoPc/MWCNT system using a gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) flow-cell. Compared to a conventional H-cell configuration, performing the electrocatalytic reaction in a CO2-fed GDE setup showed appreciably suppressed activity toward MeOH formation. The key explanation for these results lies at the higher CO2 binding affinity of CoPc compared to its affinity to bind CO, as quantitatively measured in this study. (6) The authors varied the partial current density of MeOH (product of CORR) at −0.70 V vs RHE as a function of the partial pressure of CO (PCO), which ultimately reached a plateau at PCO = 1. Thereafter, using a microkinetic analysis, the binding constant of CO to CoPc (KCO) was determined to be 3.0 atm–1. On the contrary, in the case of a CO2RR reaction with CoPc (where the major product is CO), extracted KCO2 was 11.1 atm–1. The high binding constant ratio of KCO2/KCO = 3.7, provides a thermodynamic explanation for the inefficient MeOH formation on CoPc/MwCNTs during CO2RR, where catalyst-bound CO is preferentially displaced by CO2 molecules before it can be further reduced. Thus, the authors suggested that researchers should look forward in the direction of controlling the local concentration of CO2 by construction of catalyst–polymer composites, or via applying modifications to the coordination environments of CoPc. These strategies will strengthen the CO binding, especially when using GDE flow-cells.As opposed to CoPc, in case of metal porphyrins, up until recently, reports of CO2 reduction into multielectron compounds were only available when conducted under photochemical conditions. (10,11) Lately, however, Dey and co-workers designed a distal superstructure in the molecular framework of iron porphyrins, and were able to stop the dissociation of CO from the metal-bound intermediate and simultaneously activated it for further reduction. In this work, an iron porphyrin having a distal basic pyridine residue was synthesized (FeL2, Figure 1C) and used as homogeneous electrocatalyst for CO reduction to CH4, with 93% FE. (2) Spectro-electrochemistry coupled FTIR (FTIR-SEC) was employed to understand the mechanism of the reaction with in situ detection of the metal–carbonyl species, using 12/13CO isotope sensitive absorption. In CO-saturated CH3CN containing 3% H2O, they identified an FeII–CO species being reduced to FeI–CO at applied potential of −1.75 V vs Fc/Fc+, followed by the reduction of FeI–CO to Fe0-CO at −2.35 V vs Fc/Fc+. Interestingly, while holding the potential at −2.35 V for a long period, an FeII–CHO adduct was detected, which then could be further reduced to CH4. In this case, pyridine mediated hydrogen-bonding between water molecules (i.e., proton source) and FeI–CO intermediate allows its stabilization, and activation for further reduction to CH4 (as evidenced by DFT calculation).In another attempt to achieve multielectron CO2 reduction using porphyrins, our group adopted a different approach, based on a photoassisted electrocatalysis pathway for multiproton/multielectron CO2RR. To do so, we have utilized photoactive Co-porphyrin (CoTCPP)-based metal–organic framework (MOF) films (Co-MOF-525). Under 1-sun light illumination (100 mW/cm2), the MOF film can sustain large quantities of long-lived oxidized charged carriers during photocathodic operation and performed a 8e–/8H+ reduction of CO2 to CH4 (in 80/20 (%v/v) CH3CN–H2O with a LiClO4 electrolyte). (9) Subsequent, photoassisted chronoamperometric measurements revealed that in the potential window of −0.39 to −0.64 V, CH4 and CO were produced during CO2RR, with a maximum FECH4 being 14% at −0.49 V, while FECO was only 2%. Yet, in the absence of light illumination, both products were formed in a very negligible amount. At more cathodic potentials, a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) became more prominent and significantly suppressed CO2RR. Generally, CoITCPP is the CO2RR active state that binds CO2 and undergoes 2e–/2H+ reduction to CO. However, thin layer spectro-electrochemical measurements revealed a different mechanism that leads to the unexpected CH4 production. Under dark electrolysis conditions, spectro-electrochemistry analysis showed the formation of bands attributed to CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+, while measurements at more cathodic potentials showed the formation of a new band corresponding to CO2RR active species, [CoITCPP]−. Surprisingly, in photoassisted electrolysis conditions, the formation of a broad band at 460 nm was noticed, suggesting the existence of a higher oxidation form of the catalyst, namely, [CoIIITCPP]2+, which was the product of a porphyrin ring oxidation. Here, with an increase in the cathodic potential, the [CoIIITCPP]2+ band decreased in intensity, while the CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+ bands remained unchanged throughout the course of the reaction. In other words, in these conditions, MOF-525 maintains a high concentration of [CoIIITCPP]+ species (via photo-oxidative accumulation of holes), which is known to stabilize CO by preferentially binding with it, (12) a crucial step that allows its further reduction to CH4.To conclude, despite severe challenges posed in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multielectron products, successful reports of molecular catalysts capable of CO2RR beyond 2e–/2H+ have increased lately. The results highlighted herein could help pave the way toward (i) rational catalyst design, (ii) improved structure–function correlation studies, and (iii) identification of key mechanistic factors necessary to understand molecular catalyst operation both in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous configurations. Nevertheless, realizing the next-generation of molecular catalytic systems will have to involve new approaches for the stabilization of key reactive intermediates while developing means for their assembly onto porous functional supports that allows the incorporation of secondary-sphere interactions to stir the CO2RR path toward the desired products.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsArnab Ghatak - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3027-9359; Email: [email protected]Idan Hod - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4837-8793; Email: [email protected]Author ContributionsThe manuscript was written through contribution of all the authors.

Electricity is fundamental to modern societies and will become even more so as its use expands through different technologies and population growth. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions globally, but it is also the sector that is leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid rise of renewables. The impacts of COVID-19 on the electricity sector led to a reduction in the demand for electricity, while at the same time, the current global energy crisis has placed the security and affordability of electricity at the top of the political agenda in many countries. In this way, the decrease in the demand for electricity, as well as its gradual recovery, makes it necessary to carry out energy planning that considers the adverse effects caused by global events with a high socioeconomic impact. In this article, the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) 2020 software has been used to determine the distribution of energy sources to 2050 for Mexico. The variables that lead to the possible profiles for 2050 are social, economic, and technological. The results correspond to a possible future based on official data from the National Electric System (SEN) of Mexico. The forecast for 2050 indicates that the electricity sector will have almost double the current installed capacity; however, emissions do not correspond to twice as much: they are practically 50% higher.

Predicting carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for addressing climate change and achieving environmental sustainability. Accurate emission forecasts provide policymakers with a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of policies, facilitating the design and implementation of emission reduction strategies, and helping businesses adjust their operations to adapt to market changes. Various methods, such as statistical models, machine learning, and grey prediction models, have been widely used in carbon dioxide emission prediction. However, existing research often lacks comparative analysis with other forecasting techniques. This paper constructs a new Discrete Fractional Accumulation Grey Gompertz Model (DFAGGM(1,1) based on grey system theory and provides a detailed solution process. The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is used to find the hyperparameters in the model. By comparing it with five benchmark models, the effectiveness of DFAGGM(1,1) in predicting carbon dioxide emissions data for China and the United States is validated.

This study compares thermodynamics, economics, and environmental performance of cascaded ORCs operated under a single and dual fluids. In the single fluid cascaded ORC, toluene, benzene, acetone and cyclopentane are run in high and low temperature cycles, whereas in dual fluid cascaded ORC, toluene, benzene, acetone and cyclopentane are run in high temperature cycle and R601a in the low temperature cycle. The analysis compares variations in expander inlet temperature and condensation temperature. Thermodynamic performance involved net power output (Pnet) and thermal efficiency (ηth), while economic indicators included net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In environmental performance, the annual reduction in carbon dioxide emission (CO2-eq) is assessed. The findings revealed that dual fluid cascaded ORC generated the highest Pnet of 1245.11 kW while single fluid cascaded ORC reached 1170.27 kW. The dual fluid cascaded ORC showed the significant increase in Pnet (%DPnet) for about 43% at the lowest expander inlet temperature (500 K). In terms of ηth, dual fluid cascaded ORC attained 37.23 % while single fluid cascaded ORC reached 33.25%. It is further found that acetone+R601a performed well in dual fluid cascaded ORC, resulting in the highest Pnet and allowing system’s NPV to turn positive sooner than other fluids. Furthermore, cyclopentane+R601a had the lowest LCOE of 0.0158 US$/kWh, which is 1.1% lower compared to the single fluid cascaded ORC and competitive in the Thai electricity market. In environmental saving, dual fluid cascaded ORC reduced about 144.96 tCO2-eq/year, and outperformed single fluid cascaded ORC by roughly 6.39%.

The increasing carbon dioxide emissions from human activities present a significant global concern, with approximately two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions attributed to household activities. The Carbon Generalized System of Preferences (CGSP) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism to incentivize voluntary carbon reduction in community households. This paper examines the development of a community digital management platform designed to incentivize voluntary carbon reduction at the community level, highlighting the critical role of reducing emissions in urban community life to meet carbon peak and neutrality targets. This study employs the TAO model of Three-Way Decision to establish a closed-loop operational framework for the CGSP digital platform. The platform features a Trisection mechanism to record and quantify low-carbon behaviors, an Action mechanism to classify and reward community members, and an Outcome mechanism to assess overall community carbon reduction achievements. Additionally, a user interface tailored for community users is developed to enhance platform accessibility. The proposed platform presents a practical and innovative solution for exploring emission reduction potential in urban communities. By systematically recording low-carbon behaviors, providing targeted rewards, and conducting comprehensive assessments, the platform aims to guide community residents in adopting sustainable practices. This study offers a valuable reference for the digital transformation, intelligent system construction, and development of new urban functional units within communities.

To address the increasingly severe issue of carbon dioxide emissions, the Chinese government has set dual carbon goals: achieving peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Studying the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions is crucial for achieving these dual carbon goals and promoting sustainable development. Using balanced panel data from 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region from 2006 to 2019, this paper empirically analyzed the relationship and mechanisms of highway transportation infrastructure’s impact on carbon emissions using fixed effects models, mediating effects models, and threshold effects models. The empirical results indicate: (1) there is a nonlinear inverted-U-shaped relationship between highway transportation infrastructure and carbon emissions; (2) highway transportation infrastructure indirectly affects carbon emissions through foreign direct investment as a mediating variable; (3) the threshold effect model verifies that the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions exhibits threshold effects based on green technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. This study enriches the research content in related fields to some extent and provides specific policy recommendations for achieving carbon reduction goals and promoting sustainable development.

Abstract The use of green renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable chemicals and fuels through CO 2 electrolysis technology (also known as electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction, eCO 2 RR) is an advantageous technology, which could greatly aid the global carbon‐neutral goal. Although progress has been made in alkaline/neutral media, low carbon conversion efficiency to target products, carbonate/bicarbonate salt precipitation, and blockage of electrode holes caused by CO 2 are not conducive to industrial applications. Acidic media could address these issues; however, in these conditions, there are other challenges that need to be addressed, such as hydrogen evolution, poor tolerance of electrocatalysts, and electrolysers. This review discusses recent advances in industrial‐level acidic CO 2 electrolysis, including reaction mechanisms, electrocatalysts, and device design, aiming to promote its commercialization. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation strategy of an acidic eCO 2 RR system is proposed, and perspectives are provided based on related discussion.

Toluene is a pollutant frequently detected in contaminated groundwater, mostly due to leakage from underground gasoline storage tanks and pipeline ruptures. Multi-element compound-specific isotope analysis provides a framework to understand transformation processes and design efficient remediation strategies. In this study, we enriched an anaerobic bacterial culture derived from a BTEX-contaminated aquifer that couples toluene and phenol oxidation with nitrate reduction and the concomitant production of carbon dioxide and biomass. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon data indicated that the toluene-degrading consortium was dominated by an Aromatoleum population (87 ± 2 % relative abundance), and metagenome sequencing confirmed that the genome of this Aromatoleum sp. encoded glycyl-radical enzyme benzylsuccinate synthase (BssABC) and phenylphospate synthase (PpsA1BC) homologous genes involved in the first step of toluene and phenol transformation, respectively. Carbon and hydrogen isotopic fractionation were ε

The growing need for clean and renewable energy sources, driven by a shortage of fossil fuels and serious environmental concerns, has made finding catalysts for energy conversion applications a significant challenge. The key reactions essential for converting and producing green energy include the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Recently, the novel and rapid expansion of coordination materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), porous coordination polymers (PCPs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have led to the creation of remarkable properties, allowing the development of heterostructures for various applications in different fields. Enhancing clean energy production efficiency is considered the essential promise of coordination materials, with their controlled structures, effective functionalizations, large surface areas, and high porosity. In this chapter, we summarize the brief overview of multifunctional coordination materials and their applications for green energy production.

Given the great significance of defect and Cu compounds for the reduction of CO2 as well as the few reaction mechanisms of converting CO2 into different hydrocarbons, the effects of oxygen vacancies and Cu2O on the reduction of CO2 were thoroughly investigated, and possible mechanisms were also proposed. A series of Cu2O/Ov-MgO catalysts were synthesized for photothermal catalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol under visible-light irradiation, among which the 7%Cu2O/Ov-MgO composite exhibited the best reduction activity and the yield of methanol was 19.78 μmol·g–1·h–1. The successful composite of Cu2O and Ov-MgO can yield a loose and porous nanosheet, uniform distribution, favorable absorbance and photoelectric performance, and increased specific surface area and adsorption ability of CO2, which are all vital to the adsorption and conversion of CO2. The introduction of oxygen vacancy and Cu2O not only promotes the adsorption of CO2 but also provides more electron-triggered CO2 activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also performed to reveal the reaction mechanism for effective enhanced CO2 reduction to ethanol or methanol by the comparison of CuO/MgO and Cu2O/Ov-MgO composites, illustrating the reaction pathways of different products. By comparing the key steps in determining the selectivity of C1 or C2, the kinetic barriers of obtaining CH3OH for the Cu2O/Ov-MgO composite with CH3OH as the main product were found to be lower than those of generating CH2*, while the opposite is true for CuO/MgO composites, whereby it may be easier to obtain more C2 products. These insights into the reaction mechanism of converting CO2 into different hydrocarbons are expected to provide guidance for the further design of high-performance photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction catalysts.

Abstract. A growing body of evidence suggests that to achieve the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will likely be required in addition to massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions. Nature-based CDR, which includes a range of strategies to sequester carbon in natural reservoirs, could play an important role in efforts to limit climate warming to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels. Agricultural CDR could enhance soil carbon sequestration, though the climate efficacy of such methods remains uncertain. Here, we use an intermediate complexity climate model to perform simulations of agricultural CDR in the form of soil carbon sequestration at a range of possible rates for different costs under three future emissions scenarios. We found that plausible levels of agricultural CDR were able to reduce CO2 concentration by 5–19 ppm and global surface air temperature by 0.02–0.10 °C by the end of century. This temperature decrease was non-linear with respect to cumulative removals, as any carbon removed remained part of the active carbon cycle, lessening the climate benefit compared to if the removed carbon was permanently stored in geological reservoirs. CDR was found to be more effective at reducing surface air temperature in low emissions scenarios, but less effective at reducing atmospheric CO2, compared to high emissions scenarios. This was because the weaker CO2 sinks in a high CO2 world had a more muted response to removal, so a substantially higher proportion of carbon was removed from the atmosphere for a given amount of CDR in a higher emissions scenario. The enhanced temperature response to CDR in lower emissions scenarios was due to the logarithmic response of radiative effects to changes in CO2, where at low atmospheric CO2 concentrations, small changes in CO2 are more effective at changing the global radiative balance than at higher CO2 concentrations. CDR was substantially more effective when implemented at a higher rate, as CDR makes a proportionally larger difference in a climate with lower cumulative air fraction of CO2. Land and soil carbon responses were driven by the scenario-dependent balances between the impacts of CDR on primary productivity from CO2 fertilization, and the impacts on soil respiration from increased soil carbon availability and global temperatures.

Abstract Limiting the global warming impact requires a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to reach a zero-carbon growth by 2050. Against this backdrop, turbomachinery designers are asked to develop more compact, efficient, and reliable machines. The research focuses on developing machines able to reduce energy losses and overall footprint, thus improving power plants efficiency and operability. To this end, expander-compressors (EC) seem to play a key role in the energy transition and appear a promising technology for high-density plants, especially together with hydrogen (H2) or supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as working fluid. However, when operating conditions changes, a reduction in machine efficiency may be expected, with a consequent degradation of the overall system performance. In order to optimize the operation of the power plant, it is crucial to understand how the variation of the expander-compressor behavior affects the working conditions of the other components of the plant. In this perspective, a fast and reliable way to estimate the EC performance at different operating conditions is necessary. Although the scientific literature shows several studies on mean-line approaches for expanders and centrifugal compressors, the joint use of 1D models with artificial neural networks (ANN) for ECs combined machine is still overlooked. To fill this gap, the prediction of artificial intelligence (AI)-based performance maps is proposed in this work. The tool has been tested in a case study based on a real EC. Results showed a rapid evaluation of EC efficiency while varying the operating conditions.

The global climate is currently warming due to human activity. The period 2011–2020 was recorded as the warmest decade. CO2 produced by human activity is the biggest contributor to global warming. Since every ton of CO2 emitted contributes to global warming, all emissions reductions can help to slow it down. Currently, the cars used by the population still do not ensure a sufficient reduction of CO2 emissions. The purpose of paper is to investigate the potential of electromobility development as a means to mitigate CO2 emissions in EU countries. The research methodology: statistical and comparable analysis of environmental and economic factors influencing the electromobility development in EU countries during last decade were performed. The conclusions of paper provide results of electromobility development, the main obstacles and needed government policies and incentives.

Abstract A sealed reciprocating tribometer has been used to study the influence of different gaseous environments on the friction and wear properties of AISI52100 bearing steel at atmospheric pressure and 25 °C. Helium, argon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen all give high friction and wear, suggestive of very little, if any tribofilm formation under the conditions studied. Dry air and oxygen also give high friction, slightly lower than the inert gases, but produce extremely high wear, much higher than the inert gases. This is characteristic of the phenomenon of “oxidational wear”. The two gases ammonia and carbon monoxide give relatively low friction and wear, and XPS analysis indicates that this is due to the formation of adsorbed ammonia/nitride and carbonate films respectively. For the hydrocarbon gases studied, two factors appear to control friction and wear, degree of unsaturation and molecular weight. For the saturated hydrocarbons, methane and ethane give high friction and wear but propane and butane give low friction after a period of rubbing that decreases with molecular weight. The unsaturated hydrocarbons all give an immediate reduction in friction with correspondingly low wear. Raman analysis shows that all the hydrocarbons that reduce friction and wear form a carbonaceous tribofilm on the rubbed surfaces. Graphical Abstract

Vegetation plays an important role in absorbing carbon dioxide and accelerating the achievement of carbon neutrality. As the ecological barrier of North China, the Taihang Mountains are pivotal to the ecological construction project of China. Nevertheless, the dynamic development of the vegetation carbon sink in the region and the impact factors on the sink have not been systematically evaluated. This study employed a comprehensive approach, utilising remote sensing technology and meteorological and topographic data, in conjunction with the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) estimation model to reveal the characteristics of vegetation carbon sinks in the Taihang Mountain, and then revealed the dynamics evolution of the NEP and the inter-annual trend by using Theil–Sen Median slope estimation, the Mann–Kendall test, and the coefficient of dissociation and analysed the driving roles of the influencing factors by using the parameter optimal geographic detector. Our findings suggest that the NEP in the Taihang Mountain area has a clear growth trend in time, the average value of NEP in the Taihang Mountain area is 289 gC-m−2-a−1 from 2000 to 2022, and the spatial distribution shows the characteristics of high in the northeast and low in the middle and west, with a gradual increase from the northeast to the southwest; the areas with high fluctuation of NEP are mainly distributed in the areas around some cities that are susceptible to the interference of natural or anthropogenic factors. The vegetation carbon sinks in the Taihang Mountains are influenced by a variety of natural factors, among which the explanatory power of each natural factor is as follows: DEM (0.174) > temperature (0.148) > precipitation (0.026) > slope (0.017) > slope direction (0.003). The natural factor DEM had the strongest explanatory power for NEP changes, and the two-by-two effects of the natural factors on vegetation carbon sinks were all significantly stronger than the effects of a single factor, in which the interaction between DEM and precipitation had the strongest explanatory power; distinguishing from climate change factors, the contribution of anthropogenic activities to NEP changes in more than 90% of the area of the Taihang Mountainous Region was more than 60%, and the driving force of anthropogenic factors on NEP changes in the Taihang Mountainous Region was significantly stronger than that of natural climate change. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to NEP changes in the Taihang Mountains was significantly stronger than that of natural climate change. The results of this study can not only provide a reference for carbon reduction and sink increase and ecological restoration projects in the Taihang Mountains but also benefit the research paradigm of vegetation carbon sequestration in other regions.

In this study, we explore a novel approach to nitrogen oxide (NOx) purification based on the principles of the chemical looping (CL) platform. This technique harnesses the reducing power of natural gas (CH4), instead of ammonia, to eliminate NOx in the flue gas, addressing environmental concerns such as ammonia slip in the state-of-the-art selective catalytic reduction process. The CL scheme involves utilizing nickel oxide (NiO) as the solid oxygen carrier to facilitate oxygen transfer from NOx to CH4 in two steps. In the first step (carrier oxidation), NOx in the flue gas reacts with reduced nickel (Ni), transferring its [O] to the carrier, thereby forming NiO. In the subsequent step (carrier reduction), CH4 reacts with the lattice oxygen of the oxidized carrier, generating a pure stream of CO2 and reducing NiO to Ni. We designed a high-performance carrier by dispersing NiO on an inert support to enhance the carrier's kinetics and thermal stability. We evaluated various support materials, and among them, alumina (Al2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2) demonstrated significantly superior reactivity. Notably, the Al2O3-supported carrier outperformed the ZrO2-supported carrier in NO purification and CH4 reduction and demonstrated stable performance over 10 redox cycles. Furthermore, fixed-bed experiments revealed 100% NO conversion during carrier oxidation, with optimal reaction kinetics achieved at lower space velocities, resulting in an overall high carrier utilization. Importantly, CO2 showcased no adverse effects during the NOx purification step. During the carrier reduction, complete combustion was favored, leading to CH4 conversion exceeding 95% and a CO2 selectivity of 90% at 400 °C. The CL NOx purification approach represents a promising strategy for mitigating NOx emissions.

The complexity of a sustainable economy is rooted in its socio-economic and environmental intricacies, particularly in formulating pathways for the harmonious integration of these parameters. This study introduces an extended input-output analysis and a multi-objective optimisation framework designed to discern trajectories for reducing CO2 emissions while simultaneously maximising GDP and employment. The economic alterations are evaluated through metrics facilitating the examination of both direct and indirect consequences stemming from perturbations within the economy. The focus of this research centres on the French economy, concentrating on pivotal sectors where reducing demand could yield the greatest reduction in CO2 emissions with minimal socio-economic ramifications. Additionally, a model is outlined for energy substitution, wherein fossil fuels in the French electricity mix are supplanted with clean energies. The ensuing effects of such a model on emission reduction pathways are scrutinised, followed by a comparison with the baseline case study.

Background: To test the ability of a low-pressure, low-flow, Heliox-based rebreathing system to reduce work of breathing and conserve gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels in a bench study. Methods: We performed a bench study of a novel low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber that was connected to an artificial lung simulator with careful monitoring of flow, pressure, work of breathing, oxygen (O2), carbon-dioxide (CO2), temperature, and humidity levels. Multiple runs of breathing were performed while manipulating levels of resistance (5 – 30 cm H2O/L/sec), gas mixtures (room air, 79% Helium 21% O2, and 70% Helium and 30% O2), and leak levels (ultra-low, low, and high). Results: We found significant reductions in work of breathing (up to 64%) while conserving gas with estimates of up to 54-fold reduction in medical gas wastage (P<0.001). Specifically, at resistances of 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm H2O/L/sec we demonstrated 64%, 57%, 36%, and 7% reduction in work of breathing (P<0.0001). Gas wastage was reduced by 10- to 54-fold while the end-tidal CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature were maintained by the device at physiological levels. Conclusions: In a bench-test, a low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber reduced work of breathing and conserved gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels. Future studies in human subjects need to be performed to determine whether reduction of work of breathing and gas conservation can be achieved.

This study introduces a novel hybrid solar–biomass cogeneration power plant that efficiently produces heat, electricity, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen using concentrated solar power and syngas from cotton stalk biomass. Detailed exergy-based thermodynamic, economic, and environmental analyses demonstrate that the optimized system achieves an exergy efficiency of 48.67% and an exergoeconomic factor of 80.65% and produces 51.5 MW of electricity, 23.3 MW of heat, and 8334.4 kg/h of hydrogen from 87,156.4 kg/h of biomass. The study explores four scenarios for green hydrogen production pathways, including chemical looping reforming and supercritical water gasification, highlighting significant improvements in levelized costs and the environmental impact compared with other solar-based hybrid systems. Systems 2 and 3 exhibit superior performance, with levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of 49.2 USD/MWh and 55.4 USD/MWh and levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOH) of between 10.7 and 19.5 USD/MWh. The exergoenvironmental impact factor ranges from 66.2% to 73.9%, with an environmental impact rate of 5.4–7.1 Pts/MWh. Despite high irreversibility challenges, the integration of solar energy significantly enhances the system’s exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental performance, making it a promising alternative as fossil fuel reserves decline. To improve competitiveness, addressing process efficiency and cost reduction in solar concentrators and receivers is crucial.

Abstract This work reports the production of polymeric nanocapsules of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/phase change materials (PCM), using continuous supercritical emulsion extraction (SEE‐C). Five fatty acids (FAs) were tested: capric (CA), lauric (LA), myristic (MA), palmitic (PA), and stearic (SA) acid, using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO 2 ) operating at 80 bar and 38°C in a tower apparatus. The two fatty acids with lower molecular weight (CA and LA) were extracted by the supercritical solvent and capsules were not obtained. The other three FAs formed spherical, non‐coalescing nanocapsules characterized by mean diameters ranging between 134 and 252 nm, as shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, with a sharp particles size distribution and encapsulation efficiencies up to 99.8%. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) analyses confirmed the successful encapsulation, allowing the measurement of the energy storage properties of produced capsules. Stability analysis performed over 5 months showed that the nanocapsules were stable in this time interval. Thermal cycles experiments confirmed the thermal stability of the capsules. The best performance was obtained for PA based nanocapsules, which showed a stability reduction of only 0.43% after 25 thermal cycles.

Upcycling C- and N-containing pollutants into value-added resources is key to achieving a sustainable society in the near future. In recent years, electrocatalysis powered by renewable energy sources has been utilized to remove C-only and N-only pollutants separately, while C,N co-reduction has been under explored. Compared with C-only or N-only reduction reactions, co-electrolysis to generate structurally complicated and functionally diverse C–N bonds are highly desirable yet more challenging. Oximes, which contain C=N bonds, are important precursors in medicine and fine chemical industry. Previous attempts to co-reduce carbon dioxide and nitrate or nitrite yielded formaldoxime (H2C=NOH) as a byproduct with low selectivity. Herein, we demonstrate a new tandem electrocatalytic pathway to produce H2C=NOH as the target product using NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as efficient catalysts. Upon expanding the interlayer spacing of NiFe LDH using dodecyl-sulfonate as an intercalating anion, this catalyst displays a record-high Faradaic efficiency for H2C=NOH of 31% in aqueous solution at –1.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. Our findings also show that the lengths of alkyl chains can tune the immediate microenvironment surrounding the dual Ni–Fe active sites, thus boosting the C–N coupling yield rate. Kinetic isotopic effect studies and control experiments under H2 are further carried out to interrogate the electrocatalytic mechanism of this tandem C–N bond formation process. Overall, this study offers a compelling approach to form C–N bond via a green electrosynthesis scheme in aqueous medium. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of precisely regulating the electrochemical microenvironment for enhancing the synergy between dual-metal active sites for efficient domino electrosynthesis.

Abstract Microbial valorization of CO2-derived substrates has emerged as a promising approach to address climate change and resource scarcity. Formate, which can be efficiently produced from CO2, shows great potential as a sustainable feedstock for biotechnological production. However, the scope of formate assimilation pathways is restricted by the limited number of natural formate-assimilating enzymes. To overcome this limitation, several new-to-nature routes for formate assimilation based on its reduction to formaldehyde have been proposed, but they suffer from low catalytic efficiencies and cannot yet support bacterial growth. Here, we propose the Serine Shunt as a novel formate reduction route and demonstrate its activity in vivo. In this pathway, formate is attached to glycine to form serine, which is subsequently cleaved into formaldehyde and glycine, thereby effectively converting formate to formaldehyde. Unlike other formate reduction routes, the Serine Shunt mainly utilizes natural reactions with favorable enzyme kinetics, while requiring the same amount of ATP and NADPH as the most efficient new-to-nature route. We implemented the Serine Shunt in engineered Escherichia coli strains using a step-wise approach by dividing the pathway into metabolic modules. After validating the individual module activities, we demonstrated the in vivo activity of the complete Serine Shunt by measuring intracellular formaldehyde production with a GFP sensor and coupling its activity to cell growth. Our results indicate that the Serine Shunt could be applied as a novel formate reduction route in methylotrophic hosts relevant for biotechnology.

The No. 3 coal seam in the Yuxi Coal Mine has a measured maximum gas content of 25.59 m3/t, along with a maximum gas pressure of 2.9 MPa, indicating its high risk to gas and outbursts. To mitigate outburst risks of the coal seam, the 1301 working face has been implemented gas pre-drainage measures by grid boreholes from underlying roadways. After one year of extraction, it was confirmed that the gas content at all 33 test sites was below 8 m3/t, meeting the outburst prevention standards. However, during subsequent coal tunnel excavation, the gas desorption index K1 value frequently exceeded the standard, resulting in numerous occurrences of abnormal gas emission or small-scale outbursts. To tackle the challenges associated with safe excavation following the first round regional outburst prevention measures, a research and industrial trial of CO2 gas fracturing(CO2-Frac) technology for secondary outburst prevention and rapid excavation was completed. Results show that the dual-hole and high-pressure (185MPa) CO2-Frac considerably contribute to outburst prevention. K1 exceedances per hundred meters of tunnel excavations were from average 2.54 without CO2-Frac to average 0.28 after the new technology being implemented, leading to a eight fold reduction. Additionally, the monthly excavation footage increased from average 81.64 m without CO2-Frac to average 162.42 m with CO2-Frac, resulting in a 2-fold improvement. The dual-hole and high-pressure CO2-Frac is an advanced technology for safe and efficient excavation for secondary outburst elimination in highly outburst-prone coal seams in the Yuxi Coal Mine, with potential for widespread application in similar coal seam conditions.

The increasing demand for energy, driven by technological advances, population growth, and economic expansion, has intensified the focus on efficient energy management. Tri-generation systems, such as Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) systems, are of particular interest due to their efficiency and sustainability. Integrating renewable energy sources like solar power with traditional fossil fuels further optimizes CCHP systems. This study presents a novel method for enhancing CCHP system efficiency by identifying optimal design parameters and assisting decision-makers in selecting the best geometric configurations. A mathematical programming model using the Harris Hawks optimizer was developed to maximize net power and exergy efficiency while minimizing CO2 emissions in a solar-assisted CCHP system. The optimization resulted in 100 Pareto optimal solutions, offering various choices for performance improvement. This method achieved higher net power output, satisfactory exergy efficiency, and lower CO2 emissions compared to similar studies. The study shows that maximum net power and exergy efficiency, with reduced CO2 emissions, can be achieved with a system having a low compression ratio and low combustion chamber inlet temperature. The proposed approach surpassed the response surface method, achieving at least a 4.2% reduction in CO2 emissions and improved exergy values.

A promising method for converting greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 into useful syngas is the dry reformation of methane (DRM). 5Ni-ZSM-5 and 2 wt.% Ce, Cs, Sr, Fe, and Cu-promoted 5Ni-ZSM-5 catalysts are investigated for the DRM at 700 °C under atmospheric pressure. The characterization, including XRD, TPR, TPD, TPO, N2 adsorption–desorption, TGA, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, revealed that the catalyst’s active sites are distributed throughout the pore channels and on the surface, contributing to the stability of the catalyst. Specifically, the CO2-TPO followed by the O2-TPO experiment using spent catalysts confirmed the oxidizing capacity of CO2 during the DRM reaction. The Ce-promoted catalyst showed the greatest increase in catalytic activity among other catalysts. The 5Ni+2Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited twice the concentration of acid sites compared to the Cs-promoted counterpart, even though both catalysts achieved similar quantities of active and basic sites. Without compromising H2 and CO selectivity, this finding underscores the crucial role of acid sites in enhancing CH4 and CO2 conversion. With a GHSV of 42,000 mL/(h.gcat), the 5Ni+2Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated impressive CH4 conversion rates of 42% at 700 °C and 70% at 800 °C. The reactants spend more time over catalysts during the subsequent reduction of GHSV to 21,000 mL/(h.gcat), resulting in the best catalytic performance with 80% CH4 and 83% CO2 conversions.

We report a series of isomeric, dicationic Re(bpy2+)(CO)3I complexes with bpy (2,2′-bipyridine) modified by two phenyl-CH2-(NMe3)+ pendants with cations located at variable distances from the active site for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in CH3CN/2.8 M H2O. The position of the cationic groups dramatically increases the rate of catalysis by ∼800-fold, from 1.2 to 950 s–1, with only a minor increase in overpotential. Acceleration is due to stabilization of the initial CO2 adduct and lowering of ΔG‡ for C–OH bond cleavage by Coulombic stabilization of anionic charges. Performance may be enhanced by accumulation in the electrochemical double layer. Transition state stabilization in the optimized isomer unlocks the low overpotential "protonation-first" pathway, highlighting the sizable effects of subtle structural optimization.

Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.

Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic-biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR-1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar-to-chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral-assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non-photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient-lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.

Achieving large-scale electrochemical CO2 reduction to multicarbon products with high selectivity using membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers in neutral electrolyte is promising for carbon neutrality. However, the unsatisfactory multicarbon products selectivity and unclear reaction mechanisms in an MEA have hindered its further development. Here, we report a strategy that manipulates the interfacial microenvironment of Cu nanoparticles in an MEA to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and enhance C2H4 conversion. In situ multimodal characterizations consistently reveal well-stabilized Cuδ+-OH species as active sites during MEA testing. The OH radicals generated in situ from water create a locally oxidative microenvironment on the copper surface, stabilizing the Cuδ+ species and leading to an irreversible and asynchronous change in morphology and valence, yielding high-curvature nanowhiskers. Consequently, we deliver a selective C2H4 production with a Faradaic efficiency of 55.6% ± 2.8 at 316 mA cm−2 in neutral media. The use of membrane electrode assembly electrolyzers in a neutral electrolyte offer potential for large-scale CO2 reduction to multicarbon products, but progress is hindered by low selectivity and unclear reaction mechanisms. Here, the authors regulate the interfacial microenvironment of Cu to stabilize Cuδ + -OH active species for selective C2H4 production.

Abstract Within the energy sector, the mitigation of climate change necessitates a paradigm change towards the replacement of conventional with sustainable power generation technologies. Due to the inherent volatility of renewable power generation technologies, dispatchable components, such as gas turbines (GT) will have to be used increasingly for residual load balancing. In addition, GTs are expected to operate fewer hours per year, more flexibly, and at lower capacities. However, fuel utilization in GT is inherently linked to emissions. As a potentially CO2-free energy carrier, hydrogen is a promising fuel for GTs and manufacturers are working on suitable combustor technologies. However, the availability of large quantities of CO2-free H2 remains unclear in the near future. Other pollutants such as NOx and emissions due to incomplete combustion are formed differently in part-load. Therefore, optimizing natural gas substitution based on available H2 quantities and load profiles can improve the overall emission footprint beyond just reducing CO2 emissions. In this study, a physical-based gas turbine performance model and an emission calculation tool are used to derive an optimized H2 admixture strategy for different load profiles. Characteristic load demand scenarios are derived from actual load profiles of gas power plants and the emission footprints are comprehensively evaluated by different environmental impact categories. In general, the emission footprint is increased significantly and moderately for capacity reduction and flexibility increase of GT operation. The availability of H2 in the near future is derived from forecasts for Germany, and the corresponding quantities are allocated to the partial loads according to the optimized strategy. In most scenarios, the addition of H2 is associated with a reduction in emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel operation. The greatest leverage of H2 admixture in reducing the environmental footprint is found when applied from the lowest load up, thus assisting in the start-up and shut-down process.

This study examines the effects of renewable energy consumption and environmental taxes on CO2 emissions in OECD countries from 1990 to 2022, employing the cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) approach. The findings reveal that both renewable energy consumption and environmental taxes significantly reduce CO2 emissions in both the short and the long term, emphasizing their crucial roles in climate change mitigation and sustainability promotion. Furthermore, this study identifies that industrialization and urbanization contribute to increased emissions, whereas foreign direct investment aids in emission reduction through the facilitation of green technology transfer. Economic growth is initially associated with higher emissions, but this trend reverses as economies mature and adopt sustainable practices. These results highlight the importance of continuous investment in renewable energy infrastructure and the implementation of robust environmental tax policies to achieve long-term sustainability goals. The integration of environmental considerations into economic and urban planning, along with leveraging foreign direct investment for technological advancements, is imperative for balancing economic growth with the necessity to reduce carbon emissions and effectively address climate change. This research provides a better understanding of the diverse factors influencing CO2 emissions and offers critical insights for policymakers.

Aqueous solutions containing both the strong oxidant, peroxydisulfate (S2O82–), and the strong reductant, oxalate (C2O42–), are thermodynamically unstable due to the highly exothermic homogeneous redox reaction: S2O82– + C2O42– → 2 SO42– + 2 CO2 (ΔG0 = −490 kJ/mol). However, at room temperature, this reaction does not occur to a significant extent over the time scale of a day due to its inherently slow kinetics. We demonstrate that the S2O82–/C2O42– redox reaction occurs rapidly, once initiated by the Ru(NH3)62+-mediated 1e– reduction of S2O82– to form S2O83•–, which rapidly undergoes bond cleavage to form SO42– and the highly oxidizing radical SO4•–. Theoretically, the mediated electrochemical generation of a single molecule of S2O83•– can initiate an autocatalytic cycle that consumes both S2O82– and C2O42– in bulk solution. Several experimental demonstrations of S2O82–/C2O42– autocatalysis are presented. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements demonstrate that CO2 is generated in solution for at least 10 min following a 30-s initiation step. Quantitative bulk electrolysis of S2O82– in solutions containing excess C2O42– is initiated by electrogeneration of immeasurably small quantities of S2O83•–. Capture of CO2 as BaCO3 during electrolysis additionally confirms the autocatalytic generation of CO2. First-principles density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and finite difference simulations of cyclic voltammetric responses are presented that support and provide additional insights into the initiation and mechanism of S2O82–/C2O42– autocatalysis. Preliminary evidence indicates that autocatalysis also results in a chemical traveling reaction front that propagates into the solution normal to the planar electrode surface.

The air quality in educational campuses affects the health and work efficiency of teachers and students. Studies into this matter are of great significance for optimizing the management of campus living environments. Low-cost online sensors to monitor PM2.5 and CO2 levels were used in typical functional areas of a university campus in Beijing, China, including offices, dormitories, leisure spaces, canteens, and laboratories. By comparing the findings with data from nearby national monitoring stations, the seasonal and spatial variations in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations were analyzed. Findings indicate PM2.5 levels within the campus were notably lower compared to the surrounding urban environment. There was variation in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations across different functional areas. Typically, indoor PM2.5 levels were lower than outdoor ones, while CO2 concentrations in enclosed indoor spaces with human activities progressively escalated. The main internal emission sources affecting the PM2.5 level on campus included traffic emissions, dust generated by human activities, and emissions from catering. In contrast, in areas with better green coverage or where a lake system participates in the atmospheric circulation, the PM2.5 level and CO2/PM2.5 were lower. This indicates that the cleansing impact of plants and aquatic systems is instrumental in lowering PM2.5 concentrations, offering healthier leisure spaces. Seasonal variations also impact PM2.5 levels. During the non-heating period, less pollution source emissions led to decreased outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. The campus monitoring sites experienced an approximate 5 µg/m3 and 29 µg/m3 reduction in the average PM2.5 levels as compared to the PM2.5 of the surrounding urban environment, respectively, during the non-heating and heating period. During indoor activities or sleep, CO2 levels can build up to as high as 2303 ppm due to breathing. It is advisable to stay indoors on days when pollution levels are high, whereas on days with clean air, it is healthier to be outdoors or to air out indoor areas by opening windows. Our research provides clearer scientific evidence for incorporating behavioral strategies for improving air quality into both daily work and life. Moreover, the findings are quite meaningful for the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor monitoring in various environments, with applications beyond just the campus settings.

This manuscript highlights the mechanical, economical, ecological, and thermal investigations performed on paving quality geopolymer concrete (PQGC) incorporating processed steel slag (PSS) as a substitute for river sand (RSa). The replacement of RSa with PSS ranged from 0 to 100% in the PQGC mix. The mix with 100% PSS content exhibited enhanced geopolymerization, resulting in a denser and more amorphous matrix. This improved the mechanical properties, increasing compressive strength by 10.9%, flexural strength by 23.5%, and splitting tensile strength by 8.3%. The replacement of RSa with PSS in PQGC led to a marginal reduction in (embodied energy) EE and CO2 emissions. However, compared to conventional Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) and Fly Ash PQC (FPQC), the reduction in EE for PQGC was 44% and 34%, while the CO2 emissions of PQGC were reduced by 1.22 and 1.49 times. Despite these benefits, PQGC with 100% PSS was 19% and 30% more expensive than PQC and FPQC, respectively. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of PQGC was approximately one-third that of PQC and FPQC at all levels of replacement of RSa in PQGC when compared to PQC and FPQC. Additionally, thermal conductivity decreased from k = 0.67 W/m °C to k = 0.51 W/m °C with 100% replacement of RSa, keeping the concrete cooler. Therefore, PQGC with 100% PSS, when practically implemented, may help reduce surrounding temperatures. This study concludes that PSS is a feasible and reliable alternative to RSa, enhancing the sustainability of PQGC.

The massive forming industry in Germany produces around 1.4 million parts every year, which are mainly used in safety-relevant areas such as the automotive industry. The production of these parts requires a considerable amount of energy, much of which remains unused and causes high CO2 emissions. An efficient approach to reduce these emissions and improve material utilization is cross-wedge rolling, which enables efficient material utilization but is limited by the so-called Mannesmann effect, which leads to unwanted material defects. This paper describes the development and validation of a safe design criterion for cross-wedge rolling tools in order to avoid material damage caused by the Mannesmann effect and thus increase resource efficiency in forging. Based on simulation-supported investigations and experimental tests, process maps are created for various materials. The validation is carried out both in an experimental test facility with real tools and in an industrial production facility, which leads to a significant reduction in excess material and CO2 emissions. The results show that the full resource potential of cross-wedge rolling can be exploited by optimizing process parameters and tool geometries.

Large-scale cattle farming currently accounts for only 30% of the industry in China, where significant variation in farm sizes and distributions poses challenges to sustainable manure management. Moreover, substantial gaps exist in research on the environmental impacts of manure treatment technologies across different farm scales. The environmental and economic performances of eight different cattle manure management techniques, including six aerobic, three anaerobic, and integrated methods, were evaluated for small, medium, and large cattle farms using life cycle assessment and life cycle cost methods. The results indicate that the black membrane biogas pool (BMBP) offers the best environmental and economic benefits, reducing the global warming potential (GWP) by 101.3% and enhancing the profit by at least 148.7 CNY per ton of dry cattle manure. Significant disparities in cattle farming scale and manure production across provinces necessitate region-specific policies. The GWP from national cattle manure management stands at about 1.3 million tons of CO2 equiv, with major inputs from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia, comprising 25.2% of the total. Increasing the utilization rate of cattle manure from 80% to 90% by 2025 could reduce the GWP by 11.0%. Advancing the BMBP and shifting 5% of aerobic to anaerobic processes could reduce carbon emissions by 0.2 million tons of CO2 equiv and other pollutants by 1.1–23.4%. Therefore, enhancing anaerobic technology and boosting utilization rates promise more efficient and synergistic reductions in CO2 emissions and other pollutants.

Abstract Since their inception, CO2 power cycles have gained prominence for their superior performance and compactness. However, the efficiency of the simple supercritical CO2 cycle is hindered by relatively large temperature differences in the recuperator, leading to increased exergy destruction. Although complex cycles like the recompression or precompression cycles can reduce recuperator irreversibility, their higher complexity and additional equipment requirements raise the cost of the power plant. This paper aims to demonstrate that recuperator irreversibility in a simple recuperated transcritical cycle can be alleviated using CO2-based mixtures, without resorting to complex cycles. This is achieved by comparing the efficiencies of simple and recompression cycles using CO2-based mixtures with nine additives of various molecular complexities: H2S, SO2, C3H8, C4H10, C5H12, C6H6, C4H4S, TiCl4, and C6F6. The effect of additive molar fraction (ranging from 0.05 to 0.5) on the efficiency of both cycles is examined. Thermal efficiency optimisation reveals a correlation between the efficiency difference of the simple and recompression cycles and the molecular complexity of the working fluid. The reduction in recuperator irreversibility is attributed to the decrease in the difference in the isobaric specific heat capacities between the streams in the recuperator with the use of complex additives. Consequently, the advantage of a recompression cycle diminishes as the aggregate molecular complexity of the working fluid increases. Simple additives like H2S, SO2, and C3H8 result in recompression cycles outperforming simple recuperated cycles by 4% to 8% in terms of absolute thermal efficiency, depending on the additive and its molar fraction. Conversely, more complex additives like C4H4S, TiCl4, and C6F6, exhibit thermal efficiencies in simple recuperated cycles comparable to those of recompression cycles. The additive molar fraction at which both cycles achieve similar performances depends on the molecular complexity of the additive; the more complex the additive, the lower the additive molar fraction required to create a complex working fluid. Moreover, the split fraction in recompression cycles exhibits a similar correlation with molecular complexity as observed in the efficiency difference, suggesting that recompression cycles will morph into simple recuperated cycles as molecular complexity increases. In conclusion, the use of additives provides an additional dimension through which the efficiency of CO2 cycles can be optimised, enabling improved performance without the need for complex cycles.

In the field of economic analysis, the study of the EU ETS policy has primarily focused on the impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth, as well as the role of legal and fiscal instruments in the development of clean energy. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the EU ETS policy in altering the energy mix of selected European countries, providing both cognitive and applicational value. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this policy focused on the structure of the energy mix and the relationship between rising CO2 emission allowance prices and the decreasing share of coal in the energy mix. The goal was achieved through statistical analysis of secondary sources, primarily sourced from Bloomberg (2016–2024). The research findings indicated that changes in the structure of energy sources varied across the studied European countries, due to the adopted energy source utilization strategy, resource availability, and geopolitical situations. Additionally, different correlation values were noted between rising CO2 emission allowance prices and the expected reduction in fossil fuel use. Therefore, the EU ETS policy does not fulfill its assigned role—its implementation contributes to disparities in the economic situations of European economies and creates conditions for unequal competition.

Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies are critical to reducing CO2 exhalations on a global scale. This review study synthesizes the many elements of CCUS over 50 years, from R&D to deployment scales, in terms of their mitigation potential for global emission reductions. Next, it discusses existing and new carbon capture techniques from an automation standpoint (e.g., pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture combustion), as well as the economic feasibility of CCUS regionally in terms of capital retail price, operating expenses, and value in the form of potential revenue streams based on CO2, aided by significant range-scaling building blocks such as rising nation. Each technique is thoroughly evaluated in terms of its environmental impact and associated risks, and case studies are used to illustrate practical lessons learnt. The paper also discusses the arguments around what future advances may exist in CCUS technology, and opportunities to scale these up (including research needs for this support), drawing lessons past policy. The findings underscore the importance of integrating CCUS into broader climate strategies to achieve net-zero exhalations while addressing the economic and environmental challenges that remain.

To date, the use of ferrous hydrogen in metallurgy is considered from several positions. First, the partial or complete replacement of carbon with hydrogen reduces greenhouse gas emissions of CO2. Secondly, due to the different chemical affinity for oxygen, it becomes possible to selectively (selectively) extract components from complex complex ores and man-made materials. Thirdly, the absence of carbon in the reaction zone will make it possible to obtain a metal with a low content of carbides, which in many cases increases the demand for the product. Thermodynamic calculations of a multicomponent oxide system (Ni, Fe, P, Zn, Mn, V, Cr, O) in the presence of various reducing agents: carbon, hydrogen are performed using the TERRA software package, and their combined effects are considered. It is shown that the type of reducing agent affects the temperature of the beginning of the reduction of metals and the degree of their metallization. Thus, by selecting the type of reducing agent, its quantity, and the temperature of the process, it is possible to selectively extract some metals, and leave others in an oxidized state. Ilmenite concentrate in the form of a briquette was used in laboratory tests. The analysis of the iron reduction process using carbon or hydrogen as a reducing agent has been carried out. In comparison with the results obtained using carbon, the kinetics of iron reduction with hydrogen is higher. At the same time, the reduction proceeds with the formation of metallic iron, rutile (TiO2) and residual ilmenite. Whereas, in a carbothermic process occurring at higher temperatures (1000–1300 ℃), the reduction products are iron and iron ditanate (FeTi2O5). In addition, an important advantage of selective reduction by gas is the possibility of subsequent separation of the metallic and oxide phases by melting, without fear of secondary reduction due to solid carbon residues.

The steel industry accounts, according to the International Energy Agency, for ~6.7% of global CO2 emissions, and the major portion of its contribution is from steelmaking via the blast furnace (BF) route. In the short term, a significant reduction in fossil CO2 emissions can be achieved through the introduction of bio-coal into the BF as part of cold bonded briquettes, by injection, or as part of coke. The use of bio-coal-containing residue briquettes was previously demonstrated in industrial trials in Sweden, whereas bio-coal injection was only tested on a pilot scale or in one-tuyere tests. Therefore, industrial trials replacing part of the pulverized coal (PC) were conducted. It was concluded that the grinding, conveying, and injection of up to 10% of charcoal (CC) with PC can be safely achieved without negative impacts on PC injection plant or BF operational conditions and without losses of CC with the dust. From a process point of view, higher addition is possible, but it must be verified that grinding and conveying is feasible. Through an experimentally validated computational fluid flow model, it was shown that a high moisture content and the presence of oversized particles delay devolatilization and ignition, lowering the combustion efficiency. By using CC with similar heating value to PC, compositional variations in the injected blend are not critical.

Abstract Aviation is widely recognized as a significant source of air pollutant emissions, encompassing gaseous products such as CO2, CO, NOx, and particulate matter (PM), especially in the form of soot. This study conducted comprehensive emission measurements on an Allison 250 C20B turboshaft engine to investigate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) impact on emissions. Two conventional Jet A-1 fuel blends with 30% and 50% HEFA-SPK synthesized paraffinic kerosene derived from hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) content together with 100% HEFA-SPK were tested regarding their emissions and compared against neat Jet A-1. The study’s primary focus was quantifying ultrafine particulate matter in terms of number and size. The selection of distinct engine power settings was based on the thrust ratios specified in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Landing and Take-off-cycle (LTO-cycle). PM emissions were characterized using multiple measurement techniques. These included the application of two distinct electrical mobility analyzers. An additional concentration particle counter (CPC) was utilized to underscore the reliability of the findings. A standard FTIR/O2/FID system was used to assess gaseous emissions, a well-established method for measuring fundamental combustion products such as CO2, CO, unburned hydrocarbons (UHC’s) and NOx. The particle measurement systems revealed a decrease in both the number and size of particles with increasing HEFA-SPK content. This decrease in particle number appeared linear for the 30% and 50% HEFA-SPK blends and was more pronounced for the 100% HEFA-SPK. Furthermore, a more substantial reduction in PM emissions, reaching up to 82%, was observed at lower load settings, such as Ground Idle (GI), compared to higher load settings like Take-Off (TO), where the reduction was up to 40%. Results of the gaseous emissions are also presented in the study.

Products made from light olefins play an important role in our daily lives. Traditional light olefins production based on stream crackers and fluid catalytic cracking suffer from high energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Thereby, the continually increasing demand of light olefins needs to be met through more environmentally sustainable procedures. On‐purpose production routes are a preferred choice among petrochemicals manufacturers, being energy efficient and having lower carbon footprint. Among them, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light olefins is a thermodynamically favourable exothermic process as compared to non‐oxidative routes. They can be operated at lower temperatures and has low coke deposition on catalyst, thereby resisting rapid catalyst deactivation. Herein, we have analysed various catalytic systems utilised in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. We have reviewed role of support, chemical composition of catalyst, presence of dopant, oxidation state of active metal, controlled surface modification by oxidative and reductive pretreatments, and reaction factors for each system. The performance of various catalytic systems for ODH of ethane, propane and butane in the presence of O2, CO2, N2O and special oxidants have been reviewed. A short critical overview on emerging on‐purpose routes for the production of renewable 1,3 butadiene has also been discussed.

Shipping is a highly energy-intensive sector, and fleet decarbonization initiatives can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the short-to-medium term, internal combustion engines will continue to be used for propulsion or as electricity generators onboard ships. Natural gas is an effective solution which can be used to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the marine sector. Considered to be a transitional fuel, it can provide a potential reduction in CO2 emissions of around 20–30%, compared with conventional marine fuels. This work investigated the influence of diesel-injection strategies on the performance and emissions of a single-cylinder prototype compression-ignition engine for marine applications, retrofitted to run as a Low-Pressure Dual-Fuel Engine using natural gas. Two different injection systems were used: a mass flow controller enabling continuous-mode gas feeding, and a Solenoid-Operated Gas Admission Valve for marine applications, the latter allowing phased natural-gas injection. Experimental tests were focused on partial-load conditions, which are critical for dual-fuel engines, with a natural gas/diesel mass ratio of 4:1. Phased injection resulted in reductions in fuel consumption, compared to continuous mode, of up to 11%. Further experiments demonstrated reductions in fuel consumption of up to 20.7% (in equivalent diesel); on the other hand, the unburned hydrocarbon emissions which resulted were an order of magnitude larger than the reference values for full diesel, reducing the benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, with a reduction in Global Warming Potential of only 3% compared to full diesel.

Chemical looping (CL)-based oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) of ethane (C2H6) and successive CO2 activation to form CO were investigated on FeMTiOx catalysts (M = Ni, Sn, Co, Mn, Ce metal oxide), and a proper reduction extent of active metal oxides was found to be well correlated with C2H6 conversion as well as the amount of oxidized COx formation during the C2H6 activation step. The easily reducible FeCeTiOx showed a higher C2H6 conversion of 19.6% and an ethylene (C2H4) selectivity of 73.4% due to the higher redox property of the CeO2 promoter, which also showed a higher CO2 activation to CO with its productivity of 0.130 mmol/g due to the presence of abundant oxygen vacant sites with smaller crystallite sizes of active metal oxides. The fast oxygen transfer rate and thermal stability of Ce-incorporated FeTiOx were responsible for an enhanced ethylene productivity. The newly formed MnTiO3 phases with coexisting FeTiO3 phases on FeMnTiOx were found to be active sites for the CL-ODH reaction due to an increased number of stable lattice oxygens with the highest C2H4 selectivity of 80%. However, easy reducibility and facile aggregation of NiO and Co3O4 phases on FeNiTiOx and FeCoTiOx revealed a higher selectivity to COx in the range of 18.3–18.9% compared to the optimal FeCeTiOx with a lower COx selectivity of 14.4%. The lower C2H6 conversion on FeSnTiOx was also attributed to the suppressed redox properties of active metal oxides.

Reducing CO2 emissions is becoming a particularly important goal for motorcycle manufacturers. A fully electric transition still seems far away, given the difficulties in creating an electric motorcycle with an acceptable range and mass. This opens up opportunities for the application of hybrid powertrains in motorcycles. Managing mass, cost, and volume is a challenging issue for motorcycles; therefore, an MHEV architecture represents an interesting opportunity, as it is a low-complexity and low-cost solution. Firstly, in this work, an adequate sizing of the powertrain components is studied for the maximum reduction in fuel consumption. This is performed by analyzing many different system configurations with different hybridization ratios. A 1D simulation of the motorcycle traveling along the homologation cycle (WMTC) is performed, and the powerunit use strategy is optimized for each configuration using the Dynamic Programming technique. The results are analyzed in order to highlight the impact of kinetic energy recovery and engine load-point shifting on fuel consumption reduction. The results show the applicability of MHEV technology to road motorcycles, thus providing a useful tool to analyze the cost/benefit ratio of this technology. The developed methodology is also suitable for different vehicles once a specific test cycle is known.

Abstract Gas Turbines will need to reduce CO2 emissions and prove their flexibility based on market needs and new proposed rules [2]. Economically, utilizing existing gas turbine assets to meet these requirements will be of great benefit as compared to building new turbines. Even better, determining the lowest cost least intrusive upgrades required is of great interest to power producers. The demonstration described here was conducted on one (1) GT unit at the Constellation Hillabee power plant (Siemens Energy SGT6-6000G 2x1 configuration) which doubled the mass flow of hydrogen of previous record-breaking DLN demonstrations. The testing was done on an unaltered, existing GT asset, which provides great value for those GTs which are already providing power using natural gas. The demonstrated hydrogen blending percentage of 38.8% (resulting in approximately 18% reduction in CO2 emissions) proved the system capable of meeting the first BSER goals set forth in recent proposed US EPA gas turbine rules. Such demonstrations are of critical importance as they show the inherent capability to meet reduced carbon power generation requirements without more significant cost outlays. This report documents the evaluation, preparation, execution, and results from this demonstration testing. The results are provided for the gas turbine community to use as insight into the capability and flexibility of existing assets to meet the future demands of reduced carbon power generation. Specific information around safety, reliability, emissions, and operability are discussed to provide context around existing asset capability.

Lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) is gaining interest due to its reduced weight, high strength, and durability while being cost-effective. This research proposes a method to design an LWAC by integrating coconut shell (CS) as coarse lightweight aggregate and a high volume of wet-grinded ultrafine ground granulated blast furnace slag (UGGBS). To optimize the mix design of LWAC, a particle packing model was employed. A comparative analysis was conducted between normal-weight concrete (M40) and the optimized LWAC reinforced with basalt fibers (BF). The parameters analyzed include CO2 emissions, density, surface crack conditions, water absorption and porosity, sorptivity, and compressive and flexural strength. The optimal design was determined using the packing density method. Also, the impact of BF was investigated at varying levels (0%, 0.15%, and 1%). The results revealed that the incorporation of UGGBS had a substantial enhancement to the mechanical properties of LWAC when BF and CS were incorporated. As a significant finding of this research, a grade 30 LWAC with demolded density of 1864 kg/m3 containing only 284 kg/m3 cement was developed. The LWAC with high-volume UGGBS and BF had the minimum CO2 emissions at 390.9 kg/t, marking a reduction of about 31.6% compared to conventional M40-grade concrete. This research presents an introductory approach to sustainable, environmentally friendly, high-strength, and low-density concrete production by using packing density optimization, thereby contributing to both environmental conservation and structural outcomes.

Abstract The industrial sector is a key global source of wealth, but it is also recognized as a major challenge toward worldwide decarbonization. Today the industrial sector requires more than 22 % of the global energy demand as thermal energy and produces for this about 40 % of the total CO2 emissions. Solutions to efficiently decarbonize the industrial sector are deemed. This work presents a comparative techno-economic performance assessment of a high temperature heat pump integration within a molten salts based power to heat system for industrial heat flexible generation. The main system performance is reported in terms of required working conditions and temperature for the heat pump and thermal demand size as well as reduction of the attainable levelized cost of heat (LCoH) against non-flexible electric boiler based systems. The impact of different industrial load profiles, electricity prices, heat pump capital cost and heat pump real to Carnot efficiency ratio are also presented. The results highlight that the proposed system can be cost-competitive, particularly for thermal demand around 10 MW and waste heat temperatures above 80°C. Under these conditions LCoH reduction higher than 15 %, with respect to the considered non-flexible electric boiler alternative, are attainable. These LCoH reductions are primarily driven by savings in electrical consumption as high as 30 %. This study sets the ground for further power-to-heat techno-economic investigations addressing different industrial sectors and identifies main system and components design strategies, integrations, and targets.

Abstract It is recognized that Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) will play a significant role in the decarbonization of air mobility and various pathways and feedstocks are considered for their production. This may lead to differences in chemical and physical properties when compared to conventional, fossil, aviation fuel (CAF). SAF available today are blended with CAF and after blending they are compliant with the Jet Fuel norm (ASTM1655). But the goal of achieving 100% SAF could be problematic, as the absence of aromatics, one of the characteristics of SAF produced today, could lead to leaks in the seal. Adding renewable aromatics (Synthesized Aromatic Kerosene, or SAK) to the SAF is therefore seen as an opportunity to reach 100% SAF without impacting the aircraft and airport’s fuel infrastructures, potentially enabling a faster decarbonization of the sector. In this study, we have compared the emissions of a 100% SAF which contains 9% of SAK issued from the biomass (SAF-SPK/A) with a CAF. Performance and behavior: The tests did not identify any performance differences between the two fuels, including turbine reactivity and equipment degradation. This was later confirmed by Bell Helicopter during an experimental test flight campaign. Emissions: the lower CO2 impact is mainly due to the life cycle analysis of the SAF, but the test also showed reduced CO2 emissions during the combustion. While NO and NOx were found equivalent, significant reduction in CO and soot (Smoke Number, SN) were measured: −20 to −50% depending on the mass fuel flow. These improvements could be explained by the lower content of aromatics as well as the nature of these aromatics and this will be further investigated in future studies.

Ensuring food security with limited farm resources under a climate change scenario is a major challenge for agricultural scientists. Conventional farming uses ample fertilizers and pesticides for crop production, which badly impacts the environment. The key to sustainable agriculture is finding ways to boost productivity with sustainability. This chapter focuses on the importance of crop rotations for achieving the said goal by highlighted several benefits of implementing diversified crop rotations, including the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into plant biomass, improving system (pests, diseases, weed infestations, and abiotic and biotic stress) resilience, and enhancing water and fertilizer use efficiencies. Furthermore, legume-based crop rotations also benefit a significant reduction in the use of synthetic fertilizers and augment the sustainability of the agricultural production system. Thus, cropping rotation has become indispensable to transform agriculture and pave the way for a more sustainable future.

The first isolation and characterization of transition metal complexes with the parent Al(I)–H unit were achieved in base-stabilized forms. W and Fe complexes, Cp*(CO)n(H)M←:AlH(NHC)2 (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene, n = 1 or 2), were synthesized in 43–63% yields by the one-step reaction of Cp*M(CO)n(py)Me with H3Al·NHC. The characterization included 1H and 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and infrared (IR) spectroscopic analysis, as well as DFT calculations, which revealed the extremely strong σ-donating ability of the :AlH(NHC)2 ligand, and the highly polarized M(δ−)←:Al(δ+) coordination bonds. The monovalent oxidation state of the Al center of these complexes was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hydroalumination of carbodiimide and the reduction of CO2 to CO were also demonstrated.

Limiting global warming to 1.5-2 °C requires a 50-90% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2050, depending on different scenarios, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage is a promising technology that can help reach this objective. Calcium oxide (CaO) carbon capture is an appealing choice because of its affordability, large potential capacity, and ability to withstand the high temperatures of flue gases. However, the structural instability and capacity fading challenge its large-scale industrial applications. Here, we design a reversible reaction shuttle in CaO-based sorbents to improve the structure stability by changing the initial alumina phases. Diverse alumina phases (x-Al2O3) are first synthesized and utilized as the aluminum source for creating CaO@x-Al2O3 composites. As expected, the CaO@δ-Al2O3 composite demonstrates a carbon capture capacity of 0.43 g-CO2/g-sorbent after 50 cycles, with an impressive capacity retention of 82.7%. Combined characterizations and calculations reveal that this stability improvement is attributed to a transition shuttle between Ca3Al2O6 and Ca5Al6O14, which can effectively restrain the complete decompositions of those structure-stabilized intermediate phases. An economic assessment further identifies the significance of heat transfer efficiency improvement upon cycles, and control of capital/operation cost, energy price and carbon tax for a future cost-effective commercialization of current strategy. Distinct alumina phases lead to various intermediate phases in the CaO@x-Al2O3 composites. Here authors show that δ-Al2O3 induces a transition shuttle between Ca3Al2O6 and Ca5Al6O14 in a classical CaO-Al2O3 system, thus improving its carbon capture stabilities.

Abstract The aim of this study is to analyze methodologies that can reduce performance impact on natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant when integrated with carbon capture plant (CCP) and lower the capital expenditure (CapEX) associated with carbon capture. The conventional approach of providing steam to the carbon capture reboiler for CO2 regeneration is the use of a bolt-on system, which entails an external auxiliary boiler. The study presented four promising technologies that can enhance the integration of NGCC with CCP: steam integration, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), gas turbine improvement, and enhanced control system. The paper analyzes how EGR can decrease CCP CapEX and footprint, focusing on equipment with the most significant CapEX reductions. The steam integration approach refers to extracting steam from various locations in the steam cycle such as the crossover between the intermediate pressure (IP) and low pressure (LP) sections of the steam turbine using a throttle and control valve. The EGR method refers to recirculating a part of the flue gas from the stack back into the gas turbine inlet, where it is combined with ambient air. The analysis reveals that EGR contributes to an increase in the concentration of CO2 in exhaust while simultaneously decreasing the amount of flue gas directed to the CCP. This dual effect is expected to result in a reduction in both the overall CCP CapEX and its footprint. The study delves into the impact of EGR return temperature and EGR ratio on the output of gas turbine and combined cycle systems. NGCC performance has been evaluated utilizing GE’s internal mass and heat balance tools. CCP performance and cost were assessed using commercial tools ProMax and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. The study demonstrates that providing steam to CCP through a steam integration solution is more effective than using a bolt-on solution. The steam integration solution has a potential to achieve up to 30% decrease in CCP CapEX compared to the bolt-on solution utilizing an auxiliary boiler. In addition, using a 30% EGR in the steam integration solution decreases the CapEx for the CCP by an additional 7%. EGR return temperatures ranging from 27°C to 44°C at 1°C intervals are considered, alongside studied EGR ratios of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. The analysis demonstrates that the output of the studied NGCC increases at all studied EGR return temperatures and EGR ratios, reaching a peak at a 35% EGR ratio before leveling off.

Cannabigerol’s (CBG) therapeutic effects are limited by its poor water solubility and low dissolution rate. To improve these properties, supercritical CO2-assisted atomization (SAA) was applied to produce coprecipitates, i.e., CBG nanoparticles coprecipitated in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) microparticles. The experiments were performed by varying the CBG/PVP mass ratio (R) and the overall concentration of solutes CBG+PVP to study the influence of these parameters on particle morphology, particle size, and size distribution. Periodic dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was performed at regular time intervals to measure the size of CBG nanoparticles in PVP microparticles. It showed that CBG nanoparticles down to 105 nm were successfully produced through SAA. Dissolution tests were used to verify that a reduction of CBG particle size significantly increased its dissolution rate. In the liquid medium adopted, untreated CBG powder was released in 210 min, whereas CBG nanoparticles of 105 nm were completely dissolved in only 15 min.

Abstract The increasing commitment to sustainable practices has intensified research into innovative methods to diminish the release of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases, such as CO2, CO, and NOx, into our environment. A promising avenue of exploration lies in the adoption of fuel emulsions enriched with nano-additives aimed at curtailing NOx emissions. In this context, our study delves into the impact of nano-particulate additives — specifically those based on ammonia and water — on the combustion characteristics of Jet-A1 aviation fuel. Utilizing a 300-kW liquid swirl combustor, we conducted a series of experiments across two global equivalence ratios (Φ = 0.24 and Φ = 0.40). Our investigation encompassed the analysis of laminar flame speed (LFS) and an in-depth examination of flame properties through advanced chemiluminescence imaging and modal analysis techniques. The primary objective was to unravel the complexities of how these nano-additives modulate flame dynamics and the intricate web of internal chemical reactions, alongside evaluating the broader environmental ramifications resulting from alterations in the combustion process. The experimental outcomes revealed that the integration of urea and water additives into the fuel matrix distinctly affected LFS, with observed enhancements at the lower global equivalence ratio and detrimental impacts when the ratio was increased. Through modal analysis, we discerned a notable stabilizing influence on the flame’s behavior, which was particularly pronounced at leaner fuel conditions. From the study of the spray, the addition of water and urea appears to influence combustion chemistry, and more uniform sprays facilitate more complete combustion. Chemiluminescence imaging further illuminated these effects, demonstrating a higher emission intensity of NH2* radicals compared to NH* radicals, a variance contingent on the global equivalence ratio. Notably, the experimental data indicated a substantial abatement in NOx emissions, predominantly at the lower equivalence ratios. This reduction was accompanied by a marginal uptick in CO2 and CO emissions — a trade-off that warrants consideration.

Abstract BACKGROUND This study explored the mechanism of irrigation and nitrogen (N) coupling on spring maize yield and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with the objective of achieving water saving, high yield and emission reduction. Field experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of multiple irrigation and N management strategies on GHG emissions and to determine the optimal balance between GHG, water conservation and grain yield. The experiments were conducted on spring maize with three irrigation levels (low, IL; medium, IM; and high, IH) and 4 N application levels (N40, N80, N120 and N160 kg N ha −1 ). RESULTS The IL treatment exhibited the lowest N 2 O and CO 2 emission fluxes and the lowest CH 4 uptake fluxes. The N40 treatment exhibited the lowest N 2 O and CO 2 emission fluxes and the highest CH 4 uptake flux. Significant positive correlations were observed among N 2 O and CO 2 emission fluxes, CH 4 uptake fluxes, and soil moisture and inorganic N content. Maize yield initially increased and then decreased with rising levels of irrigation and N management. By employing the TOPSIS method to assess yield and greenhouse effects, we identified the IMN120 treatment as optimal given that this treatment achieved the highest yield (14 686.26 kg ha −1 ) and water use efficiency (3.51 kg m −3 ) while maintaining relatively low global warming potential (573.30 kg CO2 eq ∙ ha −1 ) and GHG intensity (0.0390 kg CO2 eq ∙ kg −1 ). CONCLUSION Irrigation optimization and N management are key to reducing GHG emissions, enhancing yield, and promoting both the sustainable development of agriculture and environmental protection. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

Abstract. This manuscript presents the results of a cradle-to-gate lifecycle assessment (LCA) conducted on a component manufactured through two distinct process routes: Hot stamping of AA6082-T6 and cold stamping of AA5251-H22. The primary objective of this study is to provide a detailed understanding of the environmental impact associated with these processes and to conduct a comparative analysis of their environmental profiles. A comprehensive process map was developed for each manufacturing route, delineating all inputs and outputs at each step. Forming trials were executed during the LCA, capturing equipment energy consumption. When immediate data was unavailable from trials, the LCA model was supplemented with information from the Ecoinvent 3.6 database. The analysis demonstrates that the adoption of advanced near-net-shape manufacturing, specifically hot stamping, can significantly diminish the environmental impact compared to traditional cold stamping processes. Despite the additional energy requirements for heating in hot stamping, the overall environmental savings, supported by uncertainty analysis, are considerable. In the case of the examined demonstrator part, hot stamping showcased a noteworthy 35% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions, equivalent to 6 kg CO2e per part. This reduction is primarily attributed to two key factors: the decreased material thickness achievable in hot stamping while preserving equivalent mechanical characteristics in the final part and the recycling of any material waste after forming. The results underscore the environmental advantages of embracing advanced manufacturing techniques, contributing valuable insights for environmentally conscious decision-making in the manufacturing industry.

Methane is the second largest contributor to global surface air temperature rise. Reducing atmospheric methane will mitigate climate change and improve air quality. Since the main sink of methane is the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the atmosphere, increasing OH concentration will accelerate the methane oxidation process and reduce methane concentration. Because the primary source of OH is the reaction between water vapor and ozone, scientists have proposed a water vapor enhancement strategy to raise OH concentrations in the atmosphere and remove methane. We use a two-box model to evaluate interactions between OH and methane and a radiative kernel method to calculate radiative responses to water vapor content growth. This proves that increasing OH concentration does have a positive effect on methane reduction. If the concentration of OH is increased by 10% from its current value and maintained for 50 (100) years, 45 Tg yr−1 (67.5 Tg yr−1) more methane will be oxidized by OH, and the cumulative effects of the oxidation are equivalent to a 120.5 Gt (219.6 Gt) reduction in CO2 and will lower the global surface air temperature by 0.054 °C (0.099 °C). Our study also provides insights into a mixed picture of global and regional radiative responses to the growth of water vapor content. The reduced radiative forcing by methane removal cannot overpower the increased radiative forcing by water vapor from the global average point of view. However, due to OH’s greater sensitivity to water vapor and weaker radiative response at higher latitudes, this perspective may be reversed if abrupt CH4 emissions from permafrost thaw occur.

This research discusses administrative challenges and market strategies in implementing a carbon tax in Indonesia. The carbon tax was introduced through the 2021 Harmonization of Tax Regulations Law to control CO2 emissions from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Key challenges include administrative complexity, strong inter-agency coordination, effective monitoring systems, and consistent law enforcement. The global carbon market in 2023 shows great potential for economically efficient emissions reductions, but implementing this model requires adapting to Indonesia's socio-economic landscape. The research method used is a qualitative approach with case studies, combining data from policy documents, interviews with tax experts, and local carbon market analysis. The research results show that the implementation of a carbon tax is faced with several major challenges, including a lack of accurate data on emissions, an immature monitoring system, and resistance from certain industrial sectors. Effective market management strategies, such as the allocation of tax revenues to sustainable projects, are key to mitigating negative economic impacts and encouraging investment in green technologies. This research makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the complexity of carbon tax implementation in developing countries and its relevance in the global context for achieving climate change goals.

Metal formyl and hydroxymethyl complexes are implicated as key intermediates in the (photo)electrochemical reduction of carbon oxides (CO2 or CO) to liquid fuels, such as methanol. Formyl complexes, and to a lesser extent hydroxymethyl complexes, have been previously synthesized and characterized; nevertheless, the influence of electronic modifications to ligands supporting these reactive carbon fragments is not well understood. Herein, we report the synthesis of a family of ruthenium polypyridyl carbonyl complexes of the form [Ru(4,4′-R,R-bpy)(tpy)(CO)]2+ bearing different substituents on the bipyridyl (bpy) ligand (R = OMe, H, CF3). Treatment with NaBH4 as a chemical reductant results in the formation of the formyl and subsequently the hydroxymethyl and methyl complexes; each is characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and isotopic labeling studies. An electron-donating modification (R = OMe) to the bpy ligand is shown to significantly increase the lifetime of the formyl intermediate and the yield of released methanol. We observe a clear linear dependence of thermodynamic parameters on bpy electronics; however, the stability of the formyl complex and the reactivity of the resulting hydroxymethyl complex do not depend linearly on ligand electronics. We anticipate that these results may be extended to future development of (photo)electrocatalytic systems for CO-to-methanol conversion.

To address the carbonate problem in the alkaline electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), more attention has been paid to the CO2RR conducted in acidic electrolytes. The pH stability of such an acidic electrolyte is vital to make sure that the conclusion made in the so-called acidic CO2RR is reliable. Herein, based on reported model electrocatalysts for acidic CO2RR, by monitoring the varying of pH and alkali cation (K+) concentration along with the CO2RR performance in initially acidic electrolyte solution (K2SO4 with pH = 3.5), we unveil their remarkable CO2RR performance along with the rapid pH increase up to 9.5 in the cathode chamber and decrease down to 2.4 in the anode chamber due to the diffusion of K+ along with protons through the proton exchange membrane from the anode to the cathode chamber. We further reveal the rapid collapse of their CO2RR performance in a constant acid solution. This means that some previously reported "remarkable acidic CO2RR performances" actually originate from the alkaline rather than acidic electrolyte, and the conclusions made in such work need to be reconsidered. We also summarize the actual relationship between the CO2RR performance and catholyte pH in widely used Bi- and Sn-based catalysts. This work provides deeper insights into the stability of acidity and the pH effect on electrocatalysts for the CO2RR.

Mechanical air conditioning systems have a significant share of energy consumption in the building sector. Passive solar systems, such as solar chimneys, can reduce building energy demand by supplying space heating, cooling, and ventilation, significantly decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the heating and ventilation efficiencies of a solar chimney integrated system, including a roof solar chimney coupled with an air channel, for a two-story office building in Tehran, Iran. The studied system's conditions are switchable from heating to cooling by changing the opening positions. Computational Fluid Dynamics was employed to numerically investigate the heating and ventilation efficiencies of the proposed solar system. The results confirmed that the system could be utilized for pre-heating purposes during working hours but that the building should be ventilated only for 35% of this time with an air change rate of 0.8 during the year's coldest month. The arrangement could provide thermal and ventilation comfort for the occupied space only at solar intensity and ambient temperature higher than 550 W/m2 and 10 °C, respectively. In addition, the solar system could reduce 32% of the annual heating demand (918 kWh), which is equal to a reduction of 1865 kg of CO2 emissions during working hours.

Solar energy is the most promising source for generating residential, commercial, and industrial electricity. However, solar panels should be eco-friendly to increase sustainability during manufacturing and recycling. This study investigates the potential of using natural fibre composites as eco-friendly alternatives to conventional polyethylene terephthalate (PET) back sheets in solar panels. Furthermore, it examines the performance of sisal fibres coated with zeolite-polyester resin. The chemical composition, structural integrity, and crystalline properties of the composites were evaluated through extensive microstructural analysis. The results from the experimental analysis revealed significant improvements in voltage (8%) and current (6%) for the coated sisal fibre panels compared to conventional panels. Power output increased by 12%, and overall efficiency improved from 9.75 to 10.8%. Solar panels with sisal fibre sheets exhibit adequate tensile strength and impact resistance and reduce operating temperature by 2–3 °C, ensuring stable operation and minimizing heat loss. Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability and significance of these results. The life cycle analysis demonstrated a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions and a 50% decrease in energy consumption during the production, utilization and disposal of sisal fibre sheets. These findings underscore the viability of natural fibre composites in enhancing the performance and sustainability of solar panels.

Indoor air quality (IAQ) has a significant impact on human health, as people spend 90% of their time in various indoor environments. Therefore, research on IAQ is extremely necessary. However, current research on traditional Qiang residences in western Sichuan mainly focuses on the indoor thermal environment and heritage protection, with relatively little attention paid to IAQ. This study investigates the IAQ of traditional Qiang residences in western Sichuan, which have open fire pits as the core of daily life, exploring the impact of passive renovation strategies on the indoor air quality. Using simulation methods, this study employs passive strategies, such as increasing the size of windward windows, changing ventilation methods, relocating the fire pit, and enlarging interior partition openings, to improve and optimize the IAQ through natural ventilation. The results show that when the windward window sizes are 0.8 m × 1.9 m and 0.7 m × 1.55 m, the reduction in the indoor CO2 concentration is the greatest, with a maximum decrease of 0.024% at the 1.5 m plane. This paper proposes passive renovation strategies to improve the indoor air quality of Qiang residences in western Sichuan. These strategies effectively enhance the indoor air quality of Qiang residences and address the research gap on indoor air quality in regional Qiang residences in western Sichuan. The insights and methods presented contribute to the improvement of the indoor air quality in traditional buildings and support the sustainable development of traditional architecture.

Concrete is the most widely used construction material in civil engineering industry because of its proved structural strength and stability when made properly. The concrete industry is constantly trying to evolve to make concrete more sustainable replacing a part of full cement with additives and Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs). Each tonne of cement production releases one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere and hence to greenhouse effect and global warming. A cost effective, alternative and innovative materials called novel additive is taken up for present study to reduce the cement consumption per m3 of concrete/SCC without reduction in strength of required grade. In this project an effort is made replacing cement content of SCC partially with Fly Ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) in combination of novel additive. The study focused at studying the properties of fresh SCC and hardened SCC. The design mix proportion of 1: 2.63: 1.86 with a W/B ratio of 0.36 is taken up and 4 different mixes with different combinations of varied percentage replacement materials with 2% by weight of cement of novel additive.

Abstract The estimation of flame transfer functions (FTF) from time series data generated by large eddy simulation (LES) via system identification (SI) is an important element of thermoacoustic analysis. A continuous time series of adequate length is required to achieve low uncertainty, especially when dealing with turbulent noise. Limited scalability of LES codes implies that the wall-clock-time required for generating such time series may be excessive. The present paper tackles this challenge by exploring how the superposition of multiple simulations with the same excitation signal, but varying initial conditions, increases signal-to-noise ratio and leads to more robust identification. In addition, the established SI approach, which relies on broadband excitation, is compared to excitation with approximate Dirac and Heaviside signals, promising simpler pre- and postprocessing. Results demonstrate that the proposed workflow reduces significantly the wall-clock-time required for robust FTF identification. This reduction in wall-clock-time requires more parallel computational resources, but it does not significantly increase the overall computational cost while also enabling FTF estimation using Heaviside excitation. The proposed method is assessed on a partially premixed, steam enriched (‘WET’) swirl burner with significant turbulent noise levels. Steam enrichment is a combustion concept that reduces harmful emissions such as NOx and CO2 while increasing engine efficiency. However, the effect of steam on the flame response, needs to be better understood. To this end, a combustion model including an optimized global chemical mechanism for partially premixed wet methane combustion, is presented and validated against experimental data.

A water diversion system (WDS) with cascade pumping stations (CPSs) plays an important role in the application of water resources. However, high energy consumption is reported due to unreasonable scheduling schemes and long decision times. Herein, this paper presents a new method to achieve optimal scheduling schemes effectively, including the head allocation of CPSs, the number of running pumps, and pump blade angles. A double-layer mathematical model for a WDS was established with the goal of achieving minimal energy consumption, considering the constraints of flow rate, water level, and the characteristics of pump units. The inner-layer model was used to obtain scheduling schemes of single-stage pumping stations, as well as the water levels and flow rates of water channels, while the outer-layer model was used to optimize inter-stage head allocation. An improved wolf-pack algorithm (IWPA) was proposed to solve the model, using a Halton sequence to obtain the uniform initial population distribution and introducing simulated annealing (SA) to improve the global searchability. Moreover, an idea for a pre-established scheme library was suggested for inner-layer models to obtain the solutions in real time with less calculation workload. Taking an actual project as a case, in contrast with the actual schemes, the optimal scheduling method could result in energy savings of 14.37–20.39%, a CO2 emission reduction of 13–32 tons per day, and water savings of 0.14–18.34%. Moreover, the time complexity decreased to square order, and the CPU time of the optimal method was about 1% that of the traditional method. This study provides an efficient method for the high-value utilization of energy and water resources for a WDS.

Abstract In the search for alternative aviation fuels, ammonia shows much promise. The higher density and boiling point of ammonia compared to hydrogen could mean ammonia could be used without a dramatic rethinking of aircraft architecture. Instead, the possibility exists that current aircraft and engines could be retrofitted to use ammonia instead of traditional jet fuel. This paper aims to address the engine aspect of such a retrofit. The open-source Toolbox for Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS) is modified to allow for the modeling of ammonia fueled engines and the addition of heat exchangers and other technologies. A thermodynamic cycle model of a baseline ammonia engine is created retaining the turbomachinery maps, duct sizes, nozzle areas, and bleed flow rates from a kerosene engine. This engine is then modified by adding heat exchangers and a supercritical CO2 waste heat recovery (WHR) cycle to produce power for the engine and aid in the preheating of the ammonia. Preliminary analysis is performed to determine the ideal location of heat exchangers to benefit cycle efficiency. This analysis suggests that using the ammonia as a heat sink to intercool and recuperate the engine allows for significant improvements over baseline performance. From there, optimization of the geometry of the added heat exchangers is performed to limit heat exchanger size and minimize engine fuel consumption at cruise. The addition of these heat exchangers allows for a reduction in fuel burn of 3%–9% over the baseline engine. Additionally, the WHR cycle can produce the required 250 horsepower (186 kW) of electrical power for the aircraft and the ammonia temperature is increased from 420°R to over 1400°R (233K to 778K). Investigating the results of the optimization shows that making more substantial changes to engines could allow for further improvements to engine performance past that of a retrofit.

This study establishes a life cycle assessment model to quantitively evaluate and predict material resource consumption, fossil energy consumption and environmental emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) by employing the GaBi software. This study distinguishes the environmental impact of different vehicle working conditions, power battery degradation scenarios, and mileage scenarios on the operation and use stages of PHEVs, BEVs, and HEVs. The findings indicate that under urban, highway, and aggressive driving conditions, PHEVs’ life cycle material resource and fossil fuel consumption exceed that of BEVs but are less than HEVs. Battery degradation leads to increased material resource consumption, energy use, and environmental emissions for both PHEVs and BEVs. When the power battery degrades to 85%, the material resource and fossil energy consumption during the operation and use phase increases by 51.43%, 72.68% for BEVs and 29.37%, 36.21% for PHEVs compared with no degradation, respectively, indicating that the environmental impact of BEVs are more sensitive than those of PHEVs to the impact of power battery degradation. Among different mileage scenarios, PHEVs demonstrate the lowest sensitivity to increased mileage regarding life cycle material resource consumption, with the smallest increase. Future projections for 2025 and 2035 suggest life cycle GWP of HEV, PHEV and BEV in 2035 is 1.21 × 104, 1.12 × 104 and 1.01 × 104 kg CO2-eq, respectively, which shows reductions of 48.7%, 30.9% and 36.1% compared with those in 2025. The outcomes of this study are intended to bolster data support for the manufacturing and development of PHEV, BEV and HEV under different scenarios and offer insights into the growth and technological progression of the automotive sector.

Most state-of-the-art electric space propulsion systems, such as gridded and Hall effect thrusters, use xenon as the propellant gas. However, xenon is very rare and expensive to produce, and it is used in a number of competing industrial applications. Iodine is emerging as an attractive alternative to xenon in several electric propulsion technologies. Its lower cost and larger availability, solid state at standard temperature and pressure, its low vapor pressure and its low ionization potential make it an attractive option. Attempts to implement an alternative to xenon propellants (Iodine, O2 , N2 , H2 , CO2 etc) in conventional propulsion systems have been met with measured success. However, the use of chemically reactive species, such as O2, H2, or iodine, requires the chosen propulsion platform to be chemically compatible with the propellant. Significant reductions in the operational lifetime of the thruster because of chemical incompatibility negates any potential increase in thruster performance or propellant availability. Thus, careful material selection for the electric propulsion system itself and for the components employed on the satellite is required in the light of a typical space mission duration of several years. Due to the more complex reaction processes and energy loss channels in iodine plasma´s however, as well as the historical lack of reliable collision cross-section data, the development of accurate theoretical and numerical models has been hindered. The development of techniques that can be applied to chemically dissimilar propellants, focusing on electromagnetic behaviour, would represent a significant improvement in the state of discharge characterization and thruster analysis. In this work, we conducted a comparative analysis of the existing modeling results for various types of electric propulsion using iodine as a propellant gas, as well as the results of experiments with iodine plasma with an emphasis on the thrust-to-power ratio.

Abstract The estimation of a flame transfer function (FTF)from time series data generated by large eddy simulation (LES) via system identification (SI) is an established and important element of thermoacoustic analysis. To achieve results with low uncertainties, continuous (non-truncated) time series of adequate length are required. This can be a challenge in the case of turbulent flames, where signal-to-noise ratio may be low. Because LES codes do not scale to an arbitrarily high degree of parallelism, the wall-clock-time required for confident FTF estimation may be excessive. The present paper tackles this challenge by exploiting characteristic features of linear time-invariant systems. Specifically, we explore how the superposition of multiple simulations with the same excitation signal, but varying initial conditions, increases signal-to-noise ratio and leads to more robust identification, i.e. estimates with narrow confidence intervals. In addition, the established SI approach, which relies on broadband excitation, is compared to excitation with approximate Dirac and Heaviside signals, with the advantage of simpler pre- and post-processing. Results demonstrate that the proposed workflow, which is inherently parallel because it is based on superposition, reduces significantly the wall-clock-time required for robust FTF identification in the case of broadband excitation. This reduction in wall-clock-time requires more simultaneous simulation runs, i.e. more parallel computational resources, but it does not significantly increase the overall computational cost. Furthermore, the new workflow facilitates FTF estimation when exciting with a Heaviside signal. The proposed method is assessed for the case of a partially premixed, steam enriched (“WET”) swirl burner with significant turbulent noise levels. Steam enrichment is a combustion concept that reduces harmful emissions such as NOx and CO2 while increasing engine efficiency. However, the effect of steam on the flame response, i.e. the FTF, needs to be better understood. To this end, a combustion model that includes an optimized global chemical mechanism for partially premixed wet methane combustion, has been formulated and validated against experimental data.

Operating the pressurized catalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction is promising for industrial applications; however, two of the most challenging problems are serious coke deposition and metal sintering, especially under high temperature. Designing a catalyst with a small metal particle size, strong metal–support interaction (MSI), high migration rate of oxygen species, and moderate basicity can be effective to solve these problems. In this work, we prepared Ce and La promoted Co/C catalysts and compared their structural properties, catalytic activity, and stability with Co/C. The results show that 4 wt % Ce promoted Co/C (Co-4Ce/C) exhibits a small average metal particle size of 3.87 nm, larger specific surface area (396 m2/g), stronger MSI, higher reduction degree of active metal, larger content of surface chemical adsorbed oxygen, and medium basicity (0.286 mmol/g), providing better catalytic performance with stable CH4 conversion, CO2 conversion, and H2/CO ratio values of 78.0%, 85.8% and 0.77, respectively, for 100 h of reaction under 800 °C, 0.5 MPa, and 30,000 mL·gcat–1·h–1. Only a slight increase of metal particle size as well as a lower amount of deposited carbon were observed on the reacted catalyst, well explaining its good stability. Moreover, the carbon nanotube structure was detected on the surface of Co-4Ce/C, indicating the formation of a kind of more stable carbon-based catalyst. At last, a bifunctional activation mechanism was proposed based on the analysis of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, which can illustrate the shorter induction period and its enhanced activity. Overall, the Co-4Ce/C exhibits excellent resistance of metal sintering and carbon deposition and would be attractive for the catalytic DRM reaction, especially under an elevated pressure.

Regarding the mineralogy and iron formations, where the total iron content can be up to 40 wt.% [2], the Fe is composed of carbonates, silicates, sulfides, and hydroxide, commonly occurring in variable combinations. The presence of carbonates in Earth's interior is related to the subduction process, one of the first steps in cycling carbon throughout Earth [3]. Carbonate minerals are important constituents of many rock types and are represented by CaCO3 (calcite), MgCO3 (magnesite), and FeCO3 (siderite). Siderite has attracted considerable attention as this mineral is related to CO2 capture [4,5], a natural protection against corrosion [6,7], a source of iron ore [8,9], and much more. The thermal decomposition of siderite is significant because of the industrial relevance of this mineral [10,11]. The mechanism of this process depends on the siderite composition and experimental conditions like temperature, atmosphere, annealing time, or sample microstructure. The process of the thermal decomposition of siderite [12,13] and the products of this transformation under various external conditions are relatively well described. However, most of the research focuses on the final product of siderite decomposition, and such research is usually conducted in air. In this work, we aim to show not only what the final product of the decomposition of this iron carbonate is but also how exactly this process proceeds as the temperature increases. Moreover, in our research, we pay particular attention to the influence of time on the sider decomposition process and the atmosphere in which the investigated sample is located (air or vacuum).The siderite high-temperature decomposition and products of this process in air and a vacuum atmosphere were characterized using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. In this method, the Fe nucleus was treated as a probe of its local surroundings. Based on the results of this method, we obtained information about the iron oxidation states, the iron local microenvironments, the iron magnetic states, and the relative fractions of the iron-bearing components [14]. This study has profound implications for processing siderite ore through metallurgy and ore dressing. The Mössbauer investigation was supported by the X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence methods.Various carbonate rocks are present in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland. These are mainly siderites in the form of spherosiderites, shoal siderites, and carbonaceous siderites. The studied siderites come from the Ruda coal seams' upper parts, in the Chwałowice Trough's eastern part, in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. The research was carried out on two rock samples taken from different seams. These samples were designated Sd1 and Sd3. The siderite samples were heated in air and a vacuum from room temperature to 700 °C for one hour. After heating at a given temperature, the Mössbauer measurements and, for selected samples, XRD measurements were performed.The measurements by XRD revealed that the rock siderite samples contained siderite as the main component and small amounts of accessory minerals. The Sd1 sample contained ~94% siderite and 5% kaolinite. However, the Sd3 sample contained 84% siderite, and the remainder was mainly kaolinite (6%) and quartz (7%). Moreover, the Sd1 sample contained 37% Fe and 1% Mg, and the Sd3 sample contained slightly less, 28% Fe, but much more magnesium, as much as 4%. The only and main phase containing Fe was siderite, which makes 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy an excellent tool for studying the processes it undergoes during annealing. Figure 1 shows the selected Mössbauer spectra for the Sd1 sample heated for one hour at defined temperatures, in air and in a vacuum.The results show that the time and the type of atmosphere influence the siderite decomposition process. Regardless of these factors, the process occurs in the temperature range of 300–400 °C. However, the longer the heating time, the faster the siderite decomposition process begins, and its products are iron oxides (hematite and magnetite).

(1−3) As suggested by the literature survey (Figure S1), it is generally favored over Pt CE (67% vs 29%) when serving as the anode (e.g., as CE for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst evaluation) due to the Pt dissolution, (4,5) yet several issues arise. The primary concern is carbon corrosion, causing graphite particle detachment and CO/CO2 production (Figure 1). (6) These byproducts can harm the accuracy and reliability of electrocatalyst evaluations. Lee et al. and Ji et al. demonstrated that carbon fiber paper and graphite are susceptible to oxidation in acidic conditions and can deactivate Pt electrodes via CO poisoning. (7,8) Separating the CE compartment from the working electrode (WE) can minimize byproduct diffusion, as demonstrated by Sheng et al. using a graphite CE housed in a glass tube in acidic conditions. (9) These suggestions offer a general judgment on the applicability of graphite CE. However, the behavior of the CE depends significantly on factors such as the electrolyte (acidic or basic), the electrochemical methods (e.g., polarization, steady state), and the electrochemical parameters (e.g., scan rate, scan range, and CE area). Therefore, a comprehensive analysis and guidance on the applicability of graphite CE is needed. This Viewpoint aims to provide such guidance by offering a fundamental analysis of graphite CE followed by best practice recommendations.Figure 1Figure 1. Potential/current relationship in a three-electrode cell and possible interferents generated from the CE diffusing to the WE. ϕWE: WE potential; ϕCE: CE potential; ϕREF: reference electrode potential; EWE: WE voltage; ECE: CE voltage; ECELL: cell voltage; i, iCELL, iWE, and iCE: identical currents in the circuit, cell, WE, and CE; QWE, QCE: charge input/output at WE and CE.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint Slide Role of the CEFirst, we need to revisit the role of the CE. In a three-electrode cell, the current flows between the WE and CE (Figure 1). The WE hosts the electrochemical reaction of interest with a precisely controlled voltage (EWE), while the CE completes the circuit by matching the charge requirements. The charge at the WE (QWE) equals the charge at the CE (QCE) at all times, meaning the current at the WE (iWE = QWE/t) always equals the current at the CE (iCE = QCE/t). This current determines the potential applied by the potentiostat on the CE (ECE) (Figure 2A). As the demand for iWE or QWE increases, ECE is increased to drive the corresponding iCE or QCE through Faradaic and/or non-Faradaic processes. Yet, the instrument's compliance voltage (12 V in our case) limits the applicable range of ECE and EWE.Figure 2Figure 2. (A) Changes in ϕWE, Q, i, and ϕCE during an HER polarization study: as ϕWE exceeds the HER onset potential, Q (and i) rises, requiring an increase in ϕCE to produce matching Q and i, involving OER. (B) Potential drops across WE and CE (from EDL of WE, bulk electrolyte, to EDL of CE) in two cases: top, rising i (blue: low current; red: high current); bottom, less active CE (blue: high activity; red: low activity). Ru: solution resistance between WE and REF; EDL: electric double layer.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideAlthough some suggest that a slow kinetic process on the CE (i.e., a less active CE) can limit the current on the WE, (7) this is fundamentally unlikely in a three-electrode cell. The iWE is determined exclusively by the EWE (ϕWE – ϕREF) and the nature of the reaction. Regardless of the CE's activity, the potentiostat will increase or decrease the ECE to achieve the required current at the specific EWE. (10) Assuming the same WE and CE, an increase in i results in a larger potential drop across the bulk electrolyte between the WE and CE (Figure 2B, top), while for a less active CE, a higher ECE within the electric double layer (EDL) of the CE is required to meet the same i requirement (Figure 2B, bottom). (10,11) Therefore, to maximize the i and EWE range, especially with potentiostats having low compliance voltage (e.g., 6 V for many compact models), a shorter WE–CE distance and a CE with faster kinetics (i.e., more active) are recommended.For accurate WE analysis, electrochemical processes at the CE must not interfere with the reaction at the WE. Acceptable scenarios include confined species production (the iCE or QCE is generated by electrochemical processes at the CE that produce species confined to the CE surface or separated from the WE) and nonreactive species production (the iCE or QCE results from electrochemical processes at the CE that produce diffusible but nonreactive species concerning the WE). Inevitably, non-Faradaic charging/discharging at the CE contributes to iCE or QCE, but this contribution is minor and does not interfere with the WE. Anodic Behavior of Graphite CETo analyze how graphite as a CE provides QCE, we used a graphite rod as the WE and another as the CE (cell configuration denoted as C|C). In an acidic electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4), the current increases around 0 V (all potential values in this contribution are calibrated against a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), see Supporting Information) and rises rapidly from ∼1.52 V (Figure 3A), due to sulfate ion intercalation. (12) In an alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH), noticeable current onset occurs at ∼1.70 V. Charge accumulation (Figure 3B) shows that the graphite electrode contributes more charge in acidic conditions than in alkaline ones, indicating a smaller ECE requirement in acid for the same QCE. Differential electrochemical mass spectra (DEMS) (Figure 3C) reveal that in acidic conditions, CO and O2 evolve from ∼2.02 V and CO2 from ∼1.61 V. In comparison, only O2 is produced in alkaline conditions from ∼1.79 V (CO2 is undetectable due to carbonation), which agrees with the DEMS study by Schuhmann et al. that OER can hinder carbon corrosion in alkaline. (6) After a few cycles, black particles appear from ∼1.50 V in the acidic electrolyte, indicating graphite exfoliation and detachment. (12) The cycled graphite surface is rougher in acidic electrolytes than in alkaline ones (Figure S2), suggesting more intense exfoliation in acidic conditions.Figure 3Figure 3. (A) Cyclic voltammograms of graphite electrodes in Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 (orange) and 1.0 M KOH (blue) electrolytes (scan rate: 10 mV s–1). (B) Corresponding charge plots. (C) DEMS signals of O2, CO, and CO2 as a function of potential. (D) Schematic representation of the anodic polarization processes of graphite electrodes.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideFigure 3D outlines the anodic polarization processes on the graphite CE, (6,13) including anion adsorption/intercalation, exfoliation, particle detachment, surface oxidation, OER, and complete oxidation to CO/CO2. Although most processes are surface-bound, released particles and CO/CO2 can diffuse to the WE, potentially interfering with the desired reaction. Thus, the suitability of graphite as a CE depends on the applied ECE and the durations of these processes, which vary with different electrochemical methods. We will focus the discussion on two key methods: cyclic voltammetry (CV) and steady-state electrolysis. CV Using Graphite CE: One vs Two CompartmentsA two-compartment cell (H-cell) is often recommended to mitigate corrosion product diffusion from a carbon CE. (9) We start by analyzing the electrochemical response of Pt WE and graphite CE in two cell configurations under acidic and alkaline conditions.Figures 4A and 4B show the evolution of EWE, ECE, and i in acidic and alkaline conditions within a one-compartment cell (denoted as Pt|C) during 100 cycles of CV study. In the first cycle (insets), as EWE decreases from 0 to −0.20 V, i increases due to HER catalyzed by Pt, requiring a matching iCE from the graphite CE, causing ECE to rise. Two major kinetic zones are identified in both conditions, indicating that graphite CE undergoes at least two processes to provide the matching iCE or QCE (Figure S3). Since ECE exceeds 2.50 V, all anodic processes of graphite are present, producing exfoliated particles and O2 (acid and base) and CO/CO2 (acid). When EWE returns to 0 V, ECE drops to ∼1.50 V, indicating irreversible graphite oxidation as it remains higher than the reduction potentials of surface oxidation species (Figure 3A). Notably, the initial ECE (∼1.07 V) at i = 0 A is never achieved again, as i returns to 0 A in each cycle (ECE ≈ 1.62 V), suggesting a permanent change in the graphite CE surface after the first cycle. Continuous cycling leads to a decline in i and QCE (Figure S3) at EWE = 0.20 V, resulting in a lower ECE demand.Figure 4Figure 4. (A, B) EWE (blue), ECE (orange), and i (green) correlation during CV analysis (100 cycles) in (A) H2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 and (B) H2-saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolytes (scan rate: 10 mV s–1; EWE range: 0 ∼ −0.20 V). (C) Correlation between the i and ECE at EWE = −0.20 V of each cycle in H2SO4 (blue) and KOH (red) electrolytes with (square) and without (circle) involving IEM.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideTo verify if the decline is caused by anodic corrosion products (such as CO, a well-known poisoning species for Pt) (14) of the graphite CE, we separated the Pt WE and graphite CE in an H-cell (denoted as Pt|IEM|C) using a Nafion-117 ion exchange membrane (IEM) to minimize product diffusion (Figure S4). Cycling data and the ECE–QCE correlation (Figures S5 and S6) show similar graphite CE behavior to Pt|C cells. Figure 4C compares ECE and i at EWE = −0.2 V in both configurations. In acidic conditions, the current decline is significantly reduced, from 82% (Pt|C) to 21% (Pt|IEM|C) after 100 cycles, indicating a major negative impact of the unseparated graphite CE on Pt-based HER catalyst benchmarking, likely due to overwhelming CO production and poisoning at Pt WE when ECE > 2.5 V. In alkaline conditions, adding IEM does not affect the current decline (51% for Pt|IEM|C, 55% for Pt|C), suggesting a minor contribution from the graphite CE in Pt|C, which is reasonable because no noticeable CO production of graphite is observed in alkaline electrolyte. The deactivation of polycrystalline Pt in alkaline electrolytes may relate to surface/crystalline structure changes during cycling, (15) though this is beyond our current focus.However, using an IEM has drawbacks. Cells with IEM show smaller currents in the initial 5 cycles due to hindered ion transport between the WE and CE, as indicated by the higher WE-CE resistance (RWE-CE) in the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (Figure S7). Since iR compensation only corrects RWE-REF (∼0.3 ohms for all cells), (16) the activity of the Pt WE can be underestimated (by ∼15% from first cycle data). Additionally, the extra voltage loss requires a higher ECE to achieve the same current, limiting the usable EWE range. (17) As shown in Figure 4C, the IEM increases ECE by ∼0.32 V in alkaline conditions and 0.05 V in acidic conditions.Therefore, separating the graphite CE from the Pt WE is generally preferred for long-term cycling analysis, such as stability evaluation, especially in acidic electrolytes. For accurate Pt activity assessment, the Pt WE and graphite CE should share the same compartment to minimize cell voltage loss. In these cases, using single-run linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) or CV with fewer cycles (<5 in our study) is recommended to avoid the accumulation of oxidation products from the graphite, particularly in acidic conditions. Impact of CV Scan Range and Scan Rate on Graphite CEThe cycle number reflects the total charge associated with the anodic corrosion of the graphite CE under varying ECE, influenced by CV parameters such as scan range (EWE range) and scan rate.Figure 5A compares the highest current in each cycle (imax) and the required ECE at different EWE ranges. Lower EWE results in higher current and higher ECE on the graphite. For instance, cycling between 0 and −0.30 V generally requires an ECE higher than 3.0 V (ECELL > 3.3 V). In alkaline electrolytes, ECE is generally higher than in acidic ones, likely due to sulfate ion intercalation in H2SO4 contributing to iCE at lower potentials.Figure 5Figure 5. (A) Correlation between the max i and ECE of each cycle in H2-saturated H2SO4 (blue) and KOH (red) electrolytes with different EWE range: 0.1 V (0 ∼ −0.10 V), 0.2 V (0 ∼ −0.20 V), 0.3 V (0 ∼ −0.30 V). (B) Correlation between the i and ECE of each cycle at EWE = −0.2 V with different WE/CE ratios: 1:5 and 1:2 (cell configuration: Pt|IEM|C; scan rate: 10 mV s–1).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideA smaller EWE range (lower i) can significantly improve stability, as supported by data with (Figure 5A) and without IEM (Figure S8). Higher scan rates in CV result in higher currents due to increased electron transfer reactions and double-layer capacitive charging, (18) requiring higher ECE (Figure S9). However, higher scan rates also shorten the duration of extensive anodic corrosion on the graphite CE, leading to a lower current decline rate.Overall, while adjusting the scan rate and range is often necessary to obtain electrochemical properties, it is important to consider their impact on the graphite CE. A small scan range and high scan rate with IEM can minimize current decline due to accumulated graphite corrosion products in stability evaluations. However, high scan rates and IEM increase ECE on graphite to achieve the same current as in one-compartment cells, reducing the usable EWE range and potentially reaching the compliance voltage limit. Impact of Graphite CE Properties: Surface Area and Surface StateTwo frequently mentioned suggestions for a good CE are high surface area and activity. (9) Since the CE's sole function is to provide a matching current, a higher surface area offers more charge transfer sites, and a more active CE enables faster charge transfer (i.e., higher current) at the same ECE.The geometric surface area ratio between WE and CE in the previous discussion is fixed at 1:5. Herein, we decrease the CE area, and Figure 5B compares cyclic performance with WE/CE ratios of 1:2 and 1:5. Smaller CE area does not significantly impact iWE, suggesting CE is not limiting WE kinetics. However, ECE increases by ∼0.4 V (acid) and ∼0.5 V (base) with a 60% reduction in graphite area, indicating that the potentiostat compensates areal loss by increasing ECE to match i. The ECE trend is noisier with a 1:2 ratio, indicating higher instability with a smaller CE.In principle, a larger CE area improves charge transport between WE and CE due to a larger liquid projection containing more charge carriers (Figure 6A), allowing for a lower and more stable ECE demand, enabling a wider ECE and i range. While a WE/CE ratio of 1:10 is widely suggested in the literature, (7,9) our results show no significant differences between 1:5 and 1:10 (Figure S10), likely due to the larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of graphite compared to its geometrical area (GA), which is 3.6:1 for ECSA/GA according to our study, meaning that the actual ECSA ratio of WE/CE is 1:18.Figure 6Figure 6. (A) Impact of WE/CE ratio on the RWE-CE: smaller CE leads to larger RWE-CE and lower i allowance. (B) Current profile during 10h-CA analysis in an alkaline electrolyte with different WE/CE ratios (cell configuration: Pt|IEM|C; EWE = −0.20 V).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideDuring cycling, the graphite CE undergoes varying ECE (1.75–2.50 V), leading to reversible (charging/discharging) and irreversible (surface oxidation, particle detachment, full oxidation) anodic behavior. Irreversibility from surface oxidation is evident as ECE never returns to the initial ∼1.0 V at i = 0 A (insets of Figures 4A, 4B, S5A, and S5B). DEMS results (Figure S11) show that cycling alters the graphite CE surface state and anodic behavior. In acidic conditions, overwhelming CO production starts at a lower potential after just 3 cycles, likely due to the oxidized graphite surface being more prone to further oxidation into CO. To avoid significant CO production in initial cycles, it is necessary to remove the oxide layer formed in previous experiments. Polishing the graphite rod with sandpaper to achieve a smooth surface can effectively remove the oxide layer and increase the onset potential of graphite corrosion. (Figures S12 and S13, more details in the Experimental Section of Supporting Information) Steady-State Analysis Using Graphite CESteady-state analysis examines a system under constant conditions. In chronoamperometry (CA), EWE is fixed to monitor changes in i, with the potentiostat adjusting ECE. As the catalyst deactivates, i decreases, resulting in a lower ECE (i.e., a smaller ECELL) (Figure 6B). In chronopotentiometry (CP), i is fixed to monitor changes in EWE. If the CE maintains its activity, EWE remains constant. However, as the catalyst deactivates, EWE increases, leading to a larger ECELL. In this regard, using a larger and more active CE benefits wider i and EWE ranges.For graphite CE, unlike in CV studies, non-Faradaic i from charging/discharging is negligible since ECE does not vary rapidly. Complete oxidation of the graphite surface can be quickly achieved. Thus, during long-term steady-state analysis, iCE or QCE is sustained by exfoliation, OER, and full oxidation to CO/CO2. In alkaline conditions, the electrolyte initially turns brown due to the production of few-layer graphene. In acidic conditions, black particles from the graphite CE settle at the bottom. The graphite surface becomes significantly rougher after 10 h of CA testing (Figure S14) compared to 100 cycles of CV (Figure S2). Similar to CV treatment, irreversible surface changes in graphite after electrolysis are evident (Figure S15), highlighting the importance of polishing the graphite surface to ensure a reproducible experimental setup.To avoid WE surface contamination, using an IEM is essential in steady-state studies. However, some particles may attach to the IEM, potentially reducing ion exchange efficiency. A CE with a larger surface area can mitigate this issue since a lower ECE is needed, decreasing the exfoliation rate. Beyond Pt-Based ElectrocatalystsThe above discussions are based on Pt WE, known to be poisoned by CO. (14) For the CV analysis of other HER catalysts (e.g., MoS2) that do not suffer from CO and significant structural evolution, (8,19) it is expected that graphite CE can still be usable without IEM. Figure S16 confirms that no major current decrement occurs within 100 cycles with and without IEM (by ∼1.8% over 100 cycles). Similar to the previous comparison between Pt|C and Pt|IEM|C, using IEM increases the ECE by ∼170 mV. Therefore, if the graphite corrosion species are known as non-interfering species for the WE reaction, IEM is not essential. However, in reality, such information is mostly unknown, and using IEM is generally suggested despite the higher iR and cell voltage. Best Practices with Graphite CEIn summary, using a Pt WE, we have explored the applicability of graphite as an anodic CE in both acidic and alkaline conditions for HER activity evaluation. We examined several aspects related to two fundamental electrochemical methods, CV and steady-state analysis, focusing on the anodic behavior of the graphite CE and its impact on current and cell voltage. Although the specific WE and condition of the graphite CE may vary from lab to lab, making exact current and potential values less universally applicable, we can draw a few general best practice guidelines:1)Separate graphite CE from WE for long-term cycling and steady-state analysis in acidic conditions: In acidic conditions, aged graphite CE generates lots of CO/CO2 and large particles. Using an H-cell minimizes contamination and ensures accuracy. In alkaline conditions, OER and graphite exfoliation dominate, and while the impact is less distinguishable, a separator prevents unknown interferences. However, a separator can also introduce additional resistance between the WE and CE, lowering the i and EWE–ECE range. A larger CE and shorter WE–CE distance can reduce the resistance.2)Use a shared compartment for accurate activity assessment with single-run LSV or limited CV cycles: The WE and graphite CE should share the same compartment to minimize cell voltage loss introduced by the separator and to ensure precise evaluation. However, the test duration should be as short as possible (<5 cycles) to prevent the accumulation of oxidation products from the graphite in the electrolyte, especially in acidic conditions.3)Perform large current and high potential tests on a potentiostat with large compliance voltage: In principle, the activity of the CE does not matter if sufficient ECE can be provided to meet the current demand. However, the data becomes meaningless if the instrumental compliance voltage is reached. Therefore, researchers need to check the cell voltage regularly. A potentiostat with a larger compliance voltage is generally recommended, as it enables a wider EWE–ECE range.4)Reduce the WE–CE distance to enable a larger current range for testing: A shorter WE–CE distance can reduce the RWE-CE resistance, therefore decreasing the potential drop in the bulk electrolyte between the WE and CE. For a fixed iRWE-CE limited by the compliance voltage, lower RWE-CE means higher i allowance.5)Choose scan range and scan rate wisely: A larger scan range and higher scan rate often lead to increased ECE, while a smaller scan rate prolongs graphite corrosion. Therefore, when selecting CV parameters, a pre-experimental evaluation of the graphite anodic behavior is necessary.6)Use a WE/CE ratio of 1:5 or lower: A larger CE area can decrease the ECE demand and RWE-CE, allowing a wider EWE range and higher current for testing. A WE/CE ratio lower than 1:5 is preferred for graphite CE, especially when using a potentiostat with a small compliance voltage.7)Polish graphite CE before and after each experiment: Graphite CE undergoes irreversible surface oxidation as an anode, making it more susceptible to oxidation in subsequent tests. For reproducible analysis, the surface should be polished with sandpaper to achieve a smooth surface before and after each test to ensure a similar open circuit potential (OCV, i.e., similar surface state). Furthermore, we also recommend storing graphite CE in ion-free water to release the intercalated species from previous experiments.8)Replace the graphite CE regularly: Based on the above discussion, changes (oxidation and intercalation) in the graphite CE can gradually accumulate, leading to permanent deterioration. Researchers should replace the graphite CE if a consistent OCV cannot be achieved or if the ECE becomes abnormally high and unstable compared to a new graphite CE.Supporting InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.4c01869.Experimental details; Literature survey; Graphite morphology before and after CV study; ECE–QCE correlation during the first and 100th cycles in Pt|C and Pt|IEM|C cells; H-cell configuration; CV profile in Pt|IEM|C cell; Resistance introduced by IEM; Impact of CV scan rate/scan range on ECE and i in Pt|C and Pt|IEM|C cells; Impact of WE/CE ratio: from 1:5 to 1:10; DEMS results of repeated staircase voltammetry: aging of graphite surface; Aged graphite surface treatment; ECE–i correlation using MoS2 as WE and graphite as CE (PDF)nz4c01869_si_001.pdf (14.34 MB) Terms & Conditions Most electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

(American Chemical Society) Objective comparisons of electrocatalyst activity and stability using std. methods under identical conditions are necessary to evaluate the viability of existing electrocatalysts for integration into solar-fuel devices as well as to help inform the development of new catalytic systems. Herein, the authors use a std. protocol as a primary screen for evaluating the activity, short-term (2 h) stability, and electrochem. active surface area (ECSA) of 18 electrocatalysts for the H evolution reaction (HER) and 26 electrocatalysts for the O evolution reaction (OER) under conditions relevant to an integrated solar H2O-splitting device in aq. acidic or alk. soln. The primary figure of merit is the overpotential necessary to achieve a magnitude c.d. of 10 mA cm-2 per geometric area, the approx. c.d. expected for a 10% efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device under 1 sun illumination. The specific activity per ECSA of each material is also reported. Among HER catalysts, several could operate at 10 mA cm-2 with overpotentials <0.1 V in acidic and/or alk. solns. Among OER catalysts in acidic soln., no nonnoble metal based materials showed promising activity and stability, whereas in alk. soln. many OER catalysts performed with similar activity achieving 10 mA cm-2 current densities at overpotentials of ∼0.33-0.5 V. Most OER catalysts showed comparable or better specific activity per ECSA when compared to Ir and Ru catalysts in alk. solns., while most HER catalysts showed much lower specific activity than Pt in both acidic and alk. solns. For select catalysts, addnl. secondary screening measurements were conducted including faradaic efficiency and extended stability measurements. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=AC

(4) Interest is particularly growing in the Asia-Pacific area with its expanding population, urbanization, and rising disposable incomes which in turn drives the need for innovative green and sustainable chemical technologies that biocatalysis can provide [https://www.unescap.org/projects/gd]. This strong interest in new green technologies has caused a dramatic increase in fundamental research in biocatalysis, with large numbers of research groups from different disciplines entering the field. The breadth of research in biocatalysis in the Asia-Pacific area is showcased in this Virtual Special Issue, titled Biocatalysis in Asia and Pacific, which includes a snapshot of a collection of articles published in JACS Au in 2023/2024.Despite many successes in the general application of biocatalysis in industry, there remain many fundamental scientific challenges, some of which are addressed in this selection of papers. One particular challenge concerns the need for expensive cofactors such as nicotinamides which are for example needed for reduction and oxidation reactions. A perspective describes the very elegant solution of "biocatalytic hydrogen borrowing", which uses multistep sequences including dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in one pot by hydride shuffling between NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00026]. Another common challenge is active protein expression, and in a novel approach, unspecific peroxygenases have been successfully expressed using a superfolder-green-fluorescent protein in bacteria [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00129]. For multistep biocatalytic processes, cellular engineering guided by proteomic analysis can dramatically increase product titers, as shown for the production of α-bisabolene in yeast [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00106].An area of great interest is the design of reactions and reaction sequences beyond those found in nature. Some successful approaches shown here explore substrate promiscuity for challenging CO2 fixation reactions [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00290] or atroposelective synthesis of aldehydes [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00814]. Alternatively, biocatalysis can be combined with chemical reactions in chemo-enzymatic strategies, including for example Au catalysis [DOIs: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00222, 10.1021/jacsau.3c00688]. Such biocatalytic processes are not only applicable to the synthesis of target molecules but also in bioremediation strategies as demonstrated by removal of the toxic metabolite deoxynivalenol in plants [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00696] and engineering of a metal reductase for the bioremediation of anthropogenic electronic wastes [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00297].In addition to small molecule substrates, biocatalysis is also very attractive for larger biomolecules, such as complex glycoproteins that make up a significant number of the leading biopharmaceutical products. Glycoengineering using biocatalysis provides a tool for improving the therapeutic profile of antibodies, and using a structure-based design approach, an endoglycosidase was engineered to provide a novel toolbox for conjugating glycans to specific glycoprotein sites [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00004]. Glycoengineering often requires sugar nucleotide cofactor regeneration systems, and one such example for UDP-Xylose has been designed as bifunctional chimeras to minimize the need for additional proteins and improved activity [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00288].Computational tools are making a great impact in biocatalysis, in particular in protein engineering, and it is interesting that several papers in this Virtual Special Issue make use of machine learning and modeling tools to find new and better activities: directed evolution and machine learning are used in combination to enhance the diastereoselectivity of a ketoreductase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00284]. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations have been used to redesign a P450 monooxygenase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00075]. Computational enzyme redesign has been used to find mutants of a lyase with enhanced tolerance to denaturants for peptide C-terminal amidation [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00792]. Finally, density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamic simulations were used to identify and reduce energy barriers of key transition states to enhance C–N cleavage efficiency of an amino acid oxidase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00672].It is striking how even a small collection of papers in biocatalysis from Asia and the Pacific showcases the engagement of a very diverse group of scientists in areas ranging from computational to synthetic chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry, and synthetic biology to applications in engineering, cell biology, and medicine. Similarly diverse are the challenges addressed beyond the synthesis of bioactive compounds, driven by demands to solve societal problems in medicine with a more green and sustainable production of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical entities. There are also contributions from biocatalysis in directly solving environmental issues such as detoxification, removal of waste from the environment, and CO2 fixation. This Virtual Special Issue clearly shows that the topic of biocatalysis is very actively pursued at the highest international level using leading experimental and computational tools. Biocatalysis is very important to Asia and the Pacific, and the community is well placed to solve many of the challenges that lie ahead.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsSabine L.

(American Chemical Society) A review. Enzymes have firmly established themselves as bespoke catalysts for small mol. transformations in the pharmaceutical industry, from early research and development stages to large-scale prodn. In principle, their exquisite selectivity and rate acceleration can also be leveraged for modifying macromols. to form bioconjugates. However, available catalysts face stiff competition from other bioorthogonal chemistries. In this review, we seek to illuminate applications of enzymic bioconjugation in the face of an expanding palette of new drug modalities. With these applications, we wish to highlight some examples of current successes and pitfalls of using enzymes for bioconjugation along the pipeline and try to illustrate opportunities for further development. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXptFCisLs%253D&md5=63e807436aa50bfb6f4f9406650aaf73Cited By Click to copy section linkSection link copied!This article has not yet been cited by other publications.Download PDFFiguresReferencesOpen PDF Get e-AlertsGet e-AlertsJACS AuCite this: JACS Au 2024, 4, 8, 2713–2714Click to copy citationCitation copied!https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.4c00693Published August 26, 2024 Publication History Received 2 August 2024Accepted 2 August 2024Published online 26 August 2024Published in issue 26 August 2024Copyright © Published 2024 by American Chemical Society.

These materials encompass various categories and types, including graphene, (1) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), (2) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), (3) MXenes, (4) graphdiyne, (5) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), (6) and monolayer molecular crystals. (7) These materials can exhibit diverse properties as metals, semiconductors, superconductors, insulators, dielectrics, and magnets. Their unique electronic, optical, mechanical, and quantum properties make them suitable for a wide range of applications, from transistors and sensors to quantum information sciences and energy storage. With their highly tunable and versatile physical properties, these atomically thin materials could promise technological opportunities beyond the reach of existing materials.With a thickness measured by a single atom or a few atoms and lateral dimensions extending up to the meter scale, 2D materials feature an extreme aspect ratio of up to 109 or larger. This extreme aspect ratio necessitates highly anisotropic growth, with growth rates differing by millions or billions of times across different dimensions, posing a fundamentally new synthetic challenge. Achieving consistent single-atom thickness while expanding laterally to macroscopic scale requires fine-tuned control over the nucleation and growth process. Precision chemistry holds the key to the production of uniform 2D materials, (8) their heterostructures, (9) and superlattices, (10,11) which are central for consistent electronic and optical properties. Understanding the fundamental growth mechanisms is essential for the controlled synthesis of 2D materials with specific stacking orders, symmetry, and phase characteristics, fundamentally determining their properties. (12) By precisely controlling doping levels, edge termination, heterostructure formation, and intercalation of functional species, researchers can further tailor the electronic and chemical properties of 2D materials, enhancing their functionality for various applications. (13) Given the extreme surface-to-volume ratio of 2D materials, precision surface chemistry is also critical for manipulating and optimizing relevant physical properties, including surface functionalization, surface protection, charge density, and other exotic properties such chiral optical and spintronic properties. Proper surface modification may also enhance the stability and performance of 2D materials in various applications.Precision chemistry plays a central role in tailoring the atomic and molecular structures of 2D materials, thereby unlocking their full potential in various high-impact areas such as lower-power electronics, energy storage, catalysis, and sensing. Precise control over dimensions, chemical compositions, impurity doping, heterostructure interface, or surface modification makes it possible to finely tune the electronic properties of 2D materials, including bandgap engineering, carrier density, and mobility regulation, which are crucial for applications in transistors, sensors, and other electronic devices. 2D materials exhibit unique optical properties, such as layer-number tunable photoluminescence and strong light–matter interactions. (14,15) Precision control over their synthesis allows for the optimization of these properties for use in optoelectronic devices and photodetectors. At the atomic scale, quantum effects become significant. Precision chemistry allows for the control over quantum properties such as spin, (16) valley polarization, (17) charge correlation, (18) and single photon emission, (19) which are important for emerging quantum technologies. (20) Additionally, 2D materials are also promising candidates for energy conversion and storage applications due to their high surface area and unique electrochemical properties. A precise control of their synthesis, surface modification, heteroatom doping, and assembly in higher-order superstructures is critical for capturing the merits of 2D materials in supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, or green hydrogen production. (21−24)This Special Issue (including Part I and Part II) in Precision Chemistry titled "Precision Chemistry for Two-Dimensional Materials" features the latest research and perspectives from the leading scientists in this rapidly developing field, highlighting the development and application of precision chemistry for scalable synthesis of 2D materials, including large-area thin films, single crystals, heterostructures, and superlattices of various 2D materials, as well as rational tailoring of their chemical and physical properties for various applications in unconventional electronics, sensing, catalysis, energy storage, and molecular nanofiltration.The liquid-phase exfoliation technique offers a top-down strategy for scalable processing of 2D-TMDs in large quantities.
