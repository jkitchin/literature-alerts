Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formic acid (HCOOH) is attracted for superfluous CO2 removal and HCOOH production under ambient conditions. Indium based catalysts has considered as a good candidate material for CO2RR‐to‐HCOOH due to their environmentally friendly features. However, the catalytic efficiency is limited by the poor HCOOH Faradaic efficiency (FE) and high reaction overpotential of electrocatalyst, and the activity and stability of indium based catalysts are unsatisfactory, especially in industrial current density that is critical for commercialization. Herein, a fiber Bi‐doped In2O3 was synthesized through electrospinning method, and it demonstrate a FEHCOOH of 88.2% at ‐1.5 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) with partial current density of ‐21.8 mA cm‐2 in H type cell. Specially, the Bi‐In electrocatalyst reach the industrial current density standard, which can work at ‐400 mA cm‐2 current density with FEHCOOH of 92.7% (yield of HCOOH is 6.9 mmol h‐1) in home‐made Flow cell. Importantly, Bi‐In shows 24 hours long‐term stability test in ‐300 mA cm‐2. The improvement catalytic activity of Bi‐In catalyst is ascribed to the optimized electronic structure of In site, and the reduced work function value of Bi‐In is beneficial for reducing the formation energy of the key *OCHO intermediates.

The addition of polar functional groups to porous structures is an effective strategy for increasing the ability of metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture CO2 by enhancing interactions between the dipoles of the polar functional groups and the quadrupoles of CO2. However, the potential of MOFs grafted to polar functional group to activate CO2 has not been investigated in the context of CO2 electrolysis. In this study, we report a mixed‐ligand strategy to incorporate various functional groups in the MOFs. We found that substituents with strong polarity led to increased catalytic performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction for these polarized MOFs. Both experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that the presence of polar functional groups induces a charge redistribution in the micropores of MOFs. We have shown that higher electron densities of sp2‐carbon atoms in benzimidazolate ligands reduces the energy barrier to generate *COOH, which is simultaneously controlled by the mass transfer of CO2. Our research offers an effective method of disrupting local electron neutrality in the pores of electrocatalysts/supports to activate CO2 under electrochemical conditions.

Rational design of robust photocatalytic systems to direct capture and in-situ convert diluted CO2 from flue gas is a promising but challenging way to achieve carbon neutrality. Here, we report a new type of host-guest photocatalysts by integrating CO2-enriching ionic liquids and photoactive metal-organic frameworks PCN-250-Fe2M (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Mn) for artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction in gas-solid phase. As a result, [Emim]BF4(39.3 wt%)@PCN-250-Fe2Co exhibits a record high CO2-to-CO reduction rate of 313.34 μmol g−1 h−1 under pure CO2 atmosphere and 153.42 μmol g−1 h−1 under diluted CO2 (15%) with about 100% selectivity. In scaled-up experiments with 1.0 g catalyst and natural sunlight irradiation, the concentration of pure and diluted CO2 (15%) could be significantly decreased to below 85% and 10%, respectively, indicating its industrial application potential. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that ionic liquids not only benefit CO2 enrichment, but also form synergistic effect with Co2+ sites in PCN-250-Fe2Co, resulting in a significant reduction in Gibbs energy barrier during the rate-determining step of CO2-to-CO conversion. Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction from fuel gas is promising but challenging for carbon neutrality. Here, the authors report a host-guest system by integrating CO2-enriching ionic liquids and photoactive metal-organic frameworks, greatly enhancing CO2-to-CO conversion efficiency.

The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high-value organic chemicals by the microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system relies heavily on the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials. In this work, CO2 reduction for acetate production was greatly boosted by decorating the carbon felt cathode using the Fe–Mn bimetallic oxides, using an enriched anaerobic mixed culture dominated by the homoacetogen Acetobacterium wieringae. In comparison with the unmodified carbon felt as the cathode in the MES reactor, modification with MnFe2O4 increased the acetate production rate from 28 to 78 g/(m2·d), higher than those with MnO at 59 g/(m2·d) and Fe2O3 at 62 g/(m2·d), and the relative abundance of A. wieringae increased dramatically from 51 to 87% in the biofilm. This was probably due to the mediated electron uptake via the redox cycles of Mn(III)/(II) and Fe(III)/(II), improved specific surface area, and enhanced hydrophilicity of the cathode, benefiting from the synergistic effect of Fe and Mn ions. Overall, this study provides a facile and promising electrode modification strategy for MES with Fe–Mn bimetallic oxides for efficient CO2 conversion and acetate production, bringing the world closer to achieving carbon neutrality.

With the excessive use of fossil fuels, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have risen dramatically in recent decades, leading to serious environmental and social issues linked to global climate change. The emergence of renewable energy sources, such as solar, tidal, and wind energy, has created favorable conditions for large-scale electricity production. Recently, significant attention has been drawn to utilizing renewable energy to catalyze the conversion of CO2 into fuels, producing substantial industrial feedstocks. In these CO2 conversion processes, the structure and performance of catalysts are critical. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, offering advantages such as high surface area, porosity, exceptional functionality, and high conversion efficiency. This article provides a comprehensive review of structural regulation strategies for copper-based MOFs, highlighting innovative mechanisms like synergistic bimetallic catalysis, targeted doping strategies, and the construction of heterostructures. These novel approaches distinguish this review from previous studies, offering new insights into the electrocatalytic performance of copper-based MOFs and proposing future research directions for improved catalyst design.

Addressing the rise in global temperatures and the associated increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, is a critical challenge necessitating innovative approaches within the building sector, a significant contributor to worldwide carbon emissions. While previous studies have demonstrated the prefabrication's potential in reducing emissions, comprehensive assessments using actual project data for buildings constructed entirely with modular methods in Hong Kong are lacking. This study bridges this gap by evaluating the modular integrated construction (MiC) method through an embodied carbon assessment of the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility. Using comprehensive project data from China State Construction (HK) Limited, the research conducts a comparative analysis between the actual emissions of the MiC method and those of a hypothetical conventional construction approach. Quantitative analysis reveals that MiC achieves a 20.7% reduction in embodied carbon, primarily due to shortened construction timelines, decreased waste generation, and optimized material usage. This significant reduction suggests substantial potential for decreasing the construction industry's carbon footprint. The study provides empirical evidence supporting the environmental benefits of MiC in Hong Kong construction industry, promoting its broader adoption of MiC as a strategy for achieving carbon reduction targets. The findings align with Hong Kong's carbon neutrality goals and contribute to the global initiative to mitigate the effects of climate change.

Abstract Formic acid (FA) has emerged as a promising candidate for hydrogen energy storage due to its favorable properties such as low toxicity, low flammability, and high volumetric hydrogen storage capacity under ambient conditions. Recent analyses have suggested that FA produced by electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) using low‐carbon electricity exhibits lower fugitive hydrogen (H 2 ) emissions and global warming potential (GWP) during the H 2 carrier production, storage and transportation processes compared to those of other alternatives like methanol, methylcyclohexane, and ammonia. eCO 2 RR to FA can enable industrially relevant current densities without the need for high pressures, high temperatures, or auxiliary hydrogen sources. However, the widespread implementation of eCO 2 RR to FA is hindered by the requirement for highly stable and selective catalysts. Herein, the aim is to explore and evaluate the potential of catalyst engineering in designing stable and selective nanostructured catalysts that can facilitate economically viable production of FA.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) occurs at the nanoscale interface of the electrode‐electrolyte. Therefore, tailoring the interfacial properties in the interface microenvironment provides a powerful strategy to optimise the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts towards the desired products. Here, the microenvironment at the electrode‐electrolyte interface of the flow‐through Ag‐based hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) is modulated by introducing surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte additive. The porous hollow fibre configuration and gas penetration mode facilitate the CO2 mass transfer and the formation of the triple‐phase interface. Through the ordered arrangement of hydrophobic long‐alkyl chains, CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By applying CTAB‐containing catholyte, Ag HFGDE achieved a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 95 % in a wide potential range and double the partial current density of CO. The enhancement of CO selectivity and suppression of hydrogen was attributed to the improvement of charge transfer and the CO2/H2O ratio enhancement. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting the local microenvironment to enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR.

Stabilizing specific intermediates to produce CH4 remains a main challenge in solar‐driven CO2 reduction. Herein, g‐C3N4 is modified with saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x = 12, 11, 9) to tailor the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 in high selectivity. Increased lacuna of phosphotungstates leads to higher CH4 yield and selectivity, with a superior CH4 selectivity of 80% and 40.8 μmol·g‐1·h‐1 evolution rate for PW9/g‐C3N4. Conversely, g‐C3N4 and PWx alone show negligible CH4 production. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 follows a tandem catalytic process. CO2 is initially activated on g‐C3N4 to form *CO intermediates, meanwhile photogenerated electrons derived from g‐C3N4 transfer to PWx. Then the reduced PWx captures *CO, which is subsquently hydrogenated to CH4. With the injection of two photogenerated electrons, PW9 is capable of adsorbing and activating *CO. However, the reduced PW12 and PW11 are incapable of adsorbing *CO due to the small energy of occupied molecular orbitals, which is the reason for the poorer activity of PWx/g‐C3N4 (x = 12, 11) compared with that of PW9/g‐C3N4. This work provides new insights to regulate highly selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 by utilizing lacuna of polyoxometalates to enhance the interaction of metals in polyoxometalates with key intermediates.

This study investigates a novel method of utilizing Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology for fertilizer production. Unlike traditional Direct Air Carbon Capture and Utilization (DACCU) technologies, Direct Air Carbon Capture for Fertilizers (FDAC) has the potential to produce fertilizers directly. This study aims to assess the feasibility of FDAC-based fertilizer production by examining the current state of traditional DAC technologies, evaluating the CO2 fixation potential of FDAC, and analyzing the decarbonization effect of producing fertilizers using FDAC. Our evaluation results indicate that CO2 emissions from producing 1 ton of conventional chemical fertilizer, FDAC fertilizer (current status), FDAC fertilizer with ingredient adjustment (sodium hydroxide), and FDAC fertilizer with ingredient adjustment (magnesium hydroxide) are 1.69, 1.12, 1.04, and 1.06 tons of CO2, respectively. The FDAC fertilizer (current status) emits 0.57 tons of CO2 per ton less than commercial fertilizers. FDAC fertilizers also have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions further when the fertilizer composition is adjusted, offering a promising solution for lowering the environmental impact of fertilizer production. Significant CO2 reduction can be expected by replacing conventional low-intensity chemical fertilizers with FDAC-produced fertilizers.

We have explored the photophysical properties and one-electron reduction process in the dyad photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction, ZnP-phen=Re, in which the catalyst of fac-[Re(1,10-phenanthoroline)(CO)3Br] is directly connected with the photosensitizer of zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnP), using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations. We revealed the following photophysical properties: (1) the intersystem crossing occurs with a time constant of ∼20 ps, which is much faster than that of a ZnP single unit, and (2) the charge density in the excited singlet and triplet states is mainly localized on ZnP, which means that the excited state is assignable to the π–π* transition in ZnP. The one-electron reduction by 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole occurs via the triplet excited state with the time constant of ∼100 ns and directly from the ground state with the time constant of ∼3 μs. The charge in the one-electron reduction species spans ZnP and the phenanthroline ligand, and the dihedral angle between ZnP and the phenanthroline ligand is rotated by ∼24° with respect to that in the ground state, which presumably offers an advantage for proceeding to the next CO2 reduction process. These insights could guide the new design of dyad photocatalysts with porphyrin photosensitizers.

Abstract. Terrestrial isoprene, a biogenic volatile organic compound emitted by many plants, influences atmospheric chemistry and the Earth’s radiative balance. Elucidating its historical changes is therefore important for predicting climate change and air quality. Isoprene emissions can respond to climate (e.g., temperature, shortwave radiation, precipitation), land use and land cover change (LULCC), and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, historical trends of isoprene emissions and the relative influences of the respective drivers of those trends remain highly uncertain. This study addresses uncertainty in historical isoprene emission trends and their influential factors, particularly the roles of climate, LULCC, and atmospheric CO2 (via fertilization and inhibition effects). The findings are expected to reconcile discrepancies among different modelling approaches and to improve predictions of isoprene emissions and their climate change effects. To investigate isoprene emission trends, controlling factors, and discrepancies among models, we analyzed long-term (1850–2014) global isoprene emissions from online simulations of CMIP6 Earth System Models and offline simulations using the VISIT dynamic vegetation model driven by climate reanalysis data. Mean annual global present-day isoprene emissions agree well among models (434–510 TgC yr⁻¹) with a 5 % inter-model spread (24 TgC yr⁻¹), but regional emissions differ greatly (9–212 % spread). All models show an increasing trend in global isoprene emissions in recent decades (1980–2014), but their magnitudes vary (+1.27 ± 0.49 TgC yr⁻², 0.28 ± 0.11 % yr⁻¹). Long-term trends of 1850–2014 show high uncertainty among models (–0.92 to +0.31 TgC yr⁻²). Results of emulated sensitivity experiments indicate meteorological variations as the main factor of year-to-year fluctuations, but the main drivers of long-term isoprene emission trends differ among models. Models without CO2 effects implicate climate change as the driver, but other models with CO2 effects (fertilization only/and inhibition) indicate CO2 and LULCC as the primary drivers. The discrepancies arise from how models account for CO2 and LULCC alongside climate effects on isoprene emissions. Aside from LULCC-induced reductions, differences in CO2 inhibition representation (strength and presence or absence of thresholds) were able to mitigate or reverse increasing trends because of rising temperatures or in combination with CO2 fertilization. Net CO2 effects on global isoprene emissions show the highest inter-model variation (σ = 0.43 TgC yr⁻²), followed by LULCC effects (σ = 0.17 TgC yr⁻²), with climate change effects exhibiting more or less variation (σ = 0.06 TgC yr⁻²). The critical drivers of isoprene emission trends depend on a model’s emission scheme complexity. This dependence emphasizes the need for models with accurate representation of CO2 and LULCC effects alongside climate change influences for robust long-term predictions. Important uncertainties remain in understanding the interplay between CO2, LULCC, and climate effects on isoprene emissions, mainly for CO2. More long-term observations of isoprene emissions across various biomes are necessary, along with improved models with varied CO2 responses. Moreover, instead of reliance on the current models, additional emission schemes can better capture isoprene emissions complexities and their effects on climate.

The production and consumption of protons by an electrocatalyst will, under certain conditions, generate localized microenvironments with properties distinct from those of the bulk solution. These local properties are particularly impactful for reactions involving proton-coupled electron transfer, where the generation of locally basic or acidic environments may significantly influence the energy efficiency and reaction selectivity of the electrocatalyst. Whereas local pH environments have been observed and characterized in reductive half-reactions, including the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, the incompatibility of conventional techniques and materials has limited studies in oxidative half-reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which provides the reducing equivalents for solar-to-fuels electrolysis. With the straightforward parameters bulk pH, buffer composition and pKa, and mass transport, we develop a model for describing local pH as a function of current density regardless of the microscopic details of the mechanism. Using an acid-stable PbOx OER catalyst, we observe the formation and dissipation of pH gradients during the OER and validate the model with voltammetric and potentiometric studies. The model predicts how local acidic environments can develop over a narrow OER current density window, thus providing further motivation for the development of OER catalysts that are stable to acid, even when operating in basic aqueous conditions. More generally, the model is not restricted to the OER and is useful for determining the onset of local pH gradients for other electrocatalytic reactions that involve the consumption or generation of protons in energy conversion reactions.

Copper (Cu)-based nanocatalysts play crucial roles in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) for sustainable energy resources. Particularly, Cu-based nanostructures incorporating Au and Ag are promising, offering enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. However, precise control over the structure and composition of heterostructures remains challenging, hindering the development of highly efficient catalysts. Herein, we present a silver (Ag) transition-layer-mediated approach to synthesize ternary heterostructures with two specific morphologies, namely, Au/Ag–Cu-side and Au/Ag–Cu-tip, which exhibit different Ag–Cu interface epitaxial patterns. The two heterostructures achieve high C2 product selectivity in ECO2RR. Especially, the Au/Ag–Cu-side structure achieves 50.3% C2 selectivity with 35.5% ethanol, while the tip structure shows higher ethylene selectivity. Our study reveals the impact of the Ag layer in directing deposition sites on heterostructure growth and further facilitating the design of multicomponent Cu-based catalysts with enhanced structural integrity and ECO2RR performance.

The growing requirements in terms of CO2 emissions reduction in transports renders necessary the development of new electric traction technologies. This results in new technical constraints for equipment manufacturers, forcing them to reduce the acoustic emissivity of their new products inside and outside vehicles. Heat exchangers for electric cars are part of this new product category. High voltage supplied by the battery of electrical vehicles requires introduction of a new energy conversion process and technology. To this end, components based on ceramics containing barium titanate (BaTiO3) with high electrocaloric coupling properties are selected to provide the heating function. Baryum titanate is ferroelectric. This category of materials is subjected to piezoelectric and electrostrictive effects. The vibrations induced in the components (rods) containing the BaTiO3 ceramics are transmitted through the system, and cause undesired acoustic radiation. This coupling is a suffered effect and is not taken into account in the integration process during the rods manufacturing. In this study, an experimental characterization is proposed to identify the involved electromechanical coupling coefficients. Numerical simulations of the vibrations induced by BaTiO3 are carried out and used to study the possibility of attenuating them by controlling the polarisation of the ceramics or by geometric modifications.

This study addresses the pressing global issue of elevated carbon dioxide emissions (CO2E), with a particular focus on South Africa (SA), which ranks amongst the world's top emitters and largest in Africa. By introducing a novel integration of Change-point Analysis (CPA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, this research addresses significant gaps in CO2E trend analysis. Unlike previous studies, this research applies CPA methodologies within the distinct context of SA, employing algorithms like cumulative sum (CUSUM) and Bootstrap analysis to pinpoint crucial change-points in CO2E data specific to the country. The Bootstrap analysis determines the confidence levels associated with each detected change. Additionally, this study sought to validate historical trends and predict future patterns using ML models, with a specific focus on employing the AdaBoost ensemble learning technique. Drawing on insights from a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA)-based systematic review, the research selects input variables based on the factors identified as significant contributors to CO2E, ensuring the models capture the relevant variables effectively. The results of the systematic review highlight energy production and economic growth as key drivers of CO2E, thus validating their selection as input data for constructing the CPA and ML models. To conduct this study, secondary data was obtained from the World Bank's Open Data initiative data repository, a common source for environmental research. This selection was justified by a literature review, which highlighted the reliability and applicability of this data source. The CPA results reveal significant change-points in electricity generation, economic growth, and CO2E, with an average confidence level of 94%, indicating the accuracy of this analytical approach. Moreover, the CPA results emphasise the relationship between economic growth, electricity production, and CO2E in SA. Before forecasting future CO2E trends, the effectiveness of the AdaBoost regressor in enhancing model performance was benchmarked against traditional ML algorithms, including Linear regression, Polynomial regression, Bayesian Linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression, to determine the most effective technique for forecasting CO2E. The researcher evaluated model performance using key regression ML performance metrics, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2) score, and an additional accuracy score introduced by the researcher. Notably, the AdaBoost models demonstrated superior performance, with an average RMSE score of 10,143.17 kilotons (kt), MAE score of 9,642.64 kt, R2 of 0.90, and accuracy of 96.74%. The study also revealed that, on average, models that were trained using the AdaBoost algorithm surpassed traditional ML models, in terms of performance. They achieved a reduction in RMSE score by 6,417.29 kt, a decrease in MAE score by 4,358.09 kt, an increase in R2 score by 0.07 and enhanced accuracy by 0.60%. Additionally, a comparative analysis of the repeated holdout methods and cross-validation techniques was conducted, with results revealing that repeated holdout had a more significant impact on model performance. After excluding outliers, the average improvement in crossvalidation results, due to the repeated holdout method, was a decrease of 783.32 kt for RMSE, a reduction of 1,289.39 kt for MAE, and an increase of 0.88% for accuracy. The extent to which the repeated holdout method improved the performance of ML models that were integrated with cross-validation techniques, was correlated with the initial model performance. For ML models with RMSE and MAE scores equal to or exceeding 15,000 kt, the findings indicate that the repeated holdout methods studied should enhance performance by at least 2,000 kt. Similarly, an improvement of nearly 3% or higher in accuracy was noted, when the crossvalidation value for this metric was 94% or lower. The AdaBoost model, integrated with repeated holdout, was selected as the optimal model, as evidenced by the results, for forecasting CO2E in SA from 2021 to 2027. The forecasted CO2E trends validate that energy production and economic growth are indeed the primary drivers of CO2E in SA, as previously highlighted by the CPA model. This underscores the importance of addressing these factors to effectively mitigate carbon emissions in the country. Moreover, the forecasted results indicate that SA is unlikely to meet the global temperature limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030, given the trajectory showing a shortfall in achieving the target level of 334 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2E, agreed upon in the Paris Agreement. However, the country did meet its CO2E commitments outlined in the 2030 National Development Plan, showing some progress towards environmental sustainability. Nonetheless, the failure to meet these targets at their lower ranges suggests the need for further efforts to reduce carbon emissions, which is crucial for aligning with the Paris Agreement objectives and achieving a zero net emission rate by 2050. This highlights the importance of ongoing initiatives to enhance environmental policies and practices in SA. Future research should focus on integrating load-shedding dynamics into the analysis to examine and confirm its effects on energy production, economic growth, and CO2E in SA. Additionally, future research should focus on forecasting future change-points for the socio-economic indicators or variables utilised in this study. This can help policymakers anticipate fluctuations and devise proactive strategies, to address environmental and economic challenges effectively. It is also recommended that future research consider the output of renewable energy production, when analysing CO2E trends.

ABSTRACT In the face of escalating global warming and intensified human activities, it is crucial to quantitatively assess the combined impacts of future climate change (CC) and land use change (LUCC) on runoff. This study employed simulation results of future CC and LUCC in the Min-Tuo River Basin, utilizing the CMIP6 and cellular automata (CA)-Markov models in conjunction with the SWAT model to project runoff changes under various scenarios. The findings indicate an anticipated increase in both precipitation and average temperature in the future. Projected LUCC involves a reduction in arable land and grassland, alongside expansion of other land cover types. Changes in basin runoff are predominantly influenced by precipitation, with a higher likelihood of extreme events as CO2 emissions increase. Across four emission scenarios, the impact of future CC on basin runoff varies from −5.21 to +6.09%, while future LUCC's contribution ranges from +0.05 to +0.07%. When both factors are considered, the overall trend indicates a decrease in future runoff changes, ranging from −0.27 to +0.17%. These findings underscore the greater influence of CC on runoff compared with LUCC, thereby providing a scientific foundation for ecological conservation and water resources management in the basin.

Abstract Anaerobic digestion is a common method for managing liquid manure and other biomasses, generating biogas as a renewable energy source. The resulting digestate can be processed into organic fertilizers to enhance nutrient recycling, but its environmental impact warrants investigation. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to examine the impact of fertilizers derived from cattle slurry and grass-clover co-digestion on global warming (measured in CO2 equivalent) compared to untreated cattle slurry. The different treatments analyzed include untreated cattle slurry, digestate, liquid fractions from digestate separation, and an enriched liquid nitrogen-sulfur product derived from post-processing of biogas and drying the solid fraction. The functional units of this study were 100 kg of total nitrogen in the final organic fertilizer (FU1) with the cradle-to-processing gate boundary and the harvesting 1 ton of spring barley dry matter (FU2) with the cradle-to-field application boundary. The carbon footprint ranged from 24 to 49% of the baseline scenario for FU1, and from -6 to 177% of the baseline scenario for FU2. The main contributors to the carbon footprint of fertilizers included greenhouse gas emissions from storage and field application. However, biogas production from anaerobic digestion, together with the concurrent mitigation of CH4 emissions during storage, contributed most to a reduction in the overall global warming potential associated with anaerobic digestate and its liquid fraction. This study showed large climate prospects in replacing untreated slurry as organic fertilizer with alternatives resulting from its anaerobic digestion and post-treatment.

Our understanding of cardiovascular haemodynamics and the factors that govern it is vital for appreciating the workings of a healthy physiological system, as well as elucidating the pathophysiology behind disease and identifying potential treatment options. A recent article in The Journal of Physiology by Watanabe et al. (2024) sought to contribute to this field by exploring the impact of passive hyperthermia on human circulation and the underlying central and peripheral mechanisms. It has traditionally been believed that blood circulation is driven by the pressure created by the heart (Furst & González-Alonso, 2023). In hyperthermia, cardiac output is increased, and the traditional perspective would suggest that this is mainly due to an increased heart rate, supplemented by central mechanisms such as increased left ventricular systolic function. However, studies have shown that an increased heart rate alone is not sufficient to increase cardiac output (Joyce & Wang, 2021). Also, central mechanisms exert their effects with increases in core temperature at rest, which would not explain the increase in cardiac output seen with peripheral hyperthermia that does not affect core temperature. Therefore, it appears that other factors are involved in increasing cardiac output in peripheral hyperthermia, potentially including increased blood velocity or increased systemic vascular conductance. The exact mechanisms and their relationship to central forces are not well elucidated, and this is what Watanabe et al. (2024) set out to understand. The main aim set by Watanabe et al. (2024) was to explore how single-leg, two-leg, and whole-body hyperthermia affect peripheral and systemic circulation, as well as the metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses. They also aimed to investigate the factors affecting central haemodynamic changes in hyperthermia. Their hypothesis was that passive hyperthermia increases cardiac output, not due to central mechanisms like left ventricular contractility, but rather due to peripheral haemodynamic changes. The researchers enrolled eight young healthy males, and each participant was randomly assigned four counterbalanced protocols. These were 3 h of no heating as a control, 3 h of single-leg heating, 3 h of two-leg heating and 2.5 h of whole-body heating. The latter is shorter due to participant discomfort leading to early termination. The heating was provided using a water-perfused garment, and extensive measurements were taken throughout the protocols. To evaluate leg, arm, and head haemodynamics, ultrasound was used to measure blood flow at the common femoral artery, brachial artery, and common and internal carotid arteries. To evaluate cardiac function, echocardiography was used. Participants also underwent blood sampling, as well as respiratory, metabolic, blood pressure, and heart rate measurements. In single-leg heating, the study found that blood flow only increased in the leg. The two-leg and whole-body heating protocols, however, showed increased blood flow to both legs and forearms, with whole-body heating also leading to increased extracranial blood flow. None of the heating trials showed a significant difference in anterior cerebral blood flow. This finding is particularly interesting given the progressive increase in cardiac output across protocols. These results suggest that local mechanisms controlling blood flow differ across body sites, and that increased cardiac output alone does not increase perfusion. Importantly, the authors found that blood velocity increased to a greater extent than vessel diameter size, indicating that velocity predominantly contributed to the observed increase in blood flow. Additionally, there was a progressive increase in systemic vascular conductance across all heating protocols, along with increased blood kinetic energy in both two-leg and whole-body heating. Using correlational analysis, the authors showcased that increased local temperature was associated with increased local blood flow and vascular conductance. Further analysis suggests that increased cardiac output is linked with not only the aforementioned factors but also increased blood velocity and kinetic energy in the limbs and head. This supports the study's hypothesis and highlights that peripheral mechanisms may be more important than previously thought. Evaluating cardiac function revealed some key findings. Left ventricular ejection fraction and heart rate increased in all heating sessions. However, alongside the increase in heart rate was a reduction in left ventricular filling and ejection times. Despite this, stroke volume was increased or maintained in all heating protocols. This finding is likely to be due to an increase in venous return to the heart, with an increase in left ventricular end diastolic volume and a reduction in the end systolic volume. Collectively, these results indicate that hyperthermia not only drives heart rate but crucially increases venous return to enhance cardiac output. This goes against existing literature, which suggests hyperthermia reduces preload (Wilson & Crandall, 2011), possibly due to factors such as the method of assessing preload, environmental conditions, and participant characteristics. Further research would help to confirm this result. A unique finding was that whole-body heating increased left ventricular twist and untwisting rate, an effect not seen with leg-only heating. This suggests that systemic hyperthermia may engage more comprehensive cardiac adjustments, and that peripheral heating increases cardiac output without necessarily relying on central cardiac mechanisms. These findings come together to suggest an alternative model of circulation, contrary to the traditional cardio-centric view. The study found that respiratory and metabolic responses only changed in the whole-body heating protocol. There was an increase in oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, pulmonary ventilation, and end-tidal O2 pressure. In contrast, these changes were not observed in leg-only heating, yet cardiac output still increased. This differentiation suggests that metabolic and respiratory factors are not essential for increasing blood flow in peripheral hyperthermia, thereby strengthening the hypothesis of the study. However, it also shows the ongoing role of central mechanisms in certain hyperthermia conditions. This study is thoughtfully planned and provides robust data supporting the hypothesis. However, it should be noted that there are some limitations. One such limitation is the small and specific sample size of young healthy males. Although this is understandable in the context of an initial study exploring physiology in a normal state, it does reduce the generalisability of the results to other populations such as females and older groups with cardiovascular illness. Additionally, many measurements were derived using ultrasound, which tends to have a degree of inter-operator variability. It is unclear whether one or more operators were involved in conducting these measurements. However, the authors provide a thorough explanation of the ultrasound techniques used. Furthermore, the study did not directly measure right heart function or venous flow to the heart, instead inferring venous return data from their left ventricular recordings. Although this may lead to inaccuracies, similar techniques have been previously used and support this method. The authors also acknowledged that they used correlational analysis to evaluate the link between cardiac output and peripheral circulation, appropriately highlighting that this does not establish causation. The authors provide us with new insights into how human circulation is controlled, in a field where specific mechanisms behind heat-related changes are not well understood. With a deeper understanding of peripheral haemodynamics and the relationship with cardiac output, we are better positioned to conduct future research and explore treatment options for cardiovascular disease. For example, one can evaluate these findings in the context of heart failure and the potential use of lower limb heating to improve cardiac output. Although this has been previously studied (Inoue et al., 2012), there is a dearth of literature. Another interesting possibility is the use of the measurements from this study, such as blood kinetic energy, as markers of disease onset and progression, given their suggested importance. This is an important study from Watanabe et al. (2024), employing a well thought out methodology to suggest that peripheral mechanisms in passive hyperthermia are key to controlling blood circulation. They demonstrate that increases in cardiac output are linked with increases in local velocity and kinetic energy of blood flow secondary to heat, rather than central mechanisms. While there are some limitations to the research, the findings provide new insights into the study of human circulation and establish a platform for further research. This should include further physiological research in diverse populations to confirm the results, as well as clinical research to understand changes found in pathology and to identify possible treatment options.

Radosevich and Hu from MIT succeeded in using sodium cyanate as the cyanide source for electrophilic cyanation through phosphine oxide deoxygenation ( Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., DOI: 10.1002/anie.202409854). The optimized reaction conditions involve a 10 mol % loading of the phosphetane catalyst P4 (see the scheme), 1.5 equiv of diethyl methyl(bromo)malonate as the activator, and diphenylsilane as the reductant to allow catalyst turnover. Moreover, addition of a mild acid (pyridinium bromide) to prevent competition from malonate and insolubility of the cyanate source were found to be crucial to achieve high yields. Single-turnover experiments and computational studies allowed the authors to propose a mechanism involving attack of the nucleophile on N-isocyanatophosphonium followed by dehydration. Several five-membered heterocyclic cores (pyrrole, imidazole, thiophene) as well as electron-rich carbocycles react in good to high yields. Three examples of α,β-unsaturated nitrile synthesis are also provided with modest yields.Synthesis of Alcohols: Streamlined C1 to Cn Hydroxyalkylation through Photoredox CatalysisClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Despite significant recent progress in the field, hydroxyalkylation still relies on classical organometallic addition to carbonyl compounds, complex synergistic systems, or use of tailored additives. Luisi and co-workers from the University of Bari and Politecnico di Bari recently tackled this issue by developing a photochemical protocol using unmodified α-hydroxy acids as hydroxyalkyl radical sources ( Chem. Sci., DOI: 10.1039/D4SC02696A). Preliminary computational studies aided the design of the reaction, whose optimization led to the rapid identification of electron-poor alkenes as somophiles, 4CzIPN as the photocatalyst, and potassium phosphate as the base in dimethyl sulfoxide. Under the best conditions, a variety of alkenes conjugated with esters, ketones, electron-poor (hetero)aromatics, phosphate, sulfoxides, and sulfones efficiently react with secondary or tertiary hydroxyalkyl radicals. The methodology was extended to the use of glyoxylic acid for hydroxymethylation and successfully transposed to flow by shifting to potassium tert-butoxide as a homogeneous base and increasing the light intensity.Electrocatalytic Formal C(sp2)–H Alkylations via Nickel-Catalyzed Cross-Electrophile Coupling with Versatile Arylsulfonium SaltsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Methodologies to forge C(sp2)–C(sp3) bonds have triggered major interest across the synthetic community over the last decades, with photo- and electrochemistry assets being exploited to develop milder conditions compared to cross-coupling reactions involving organometallic reactants. Ackermann and co-workers from the University of Göttingen extended the scope of the cross-coupling reaction of arylsulfonium salts through the implementation of an electrochemical nickel-catalyzed protocol for cross-electrophile coupling ( Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., DOI: 10.1002/anie.202401198). The optimized conditions rely on the use of zinc and nickel electrodes in an undivided cell with tetrabutylammonium iodide as an additive in dimethylacetamide at 60 °C. A number of mono-, di-, and trisubstituted (hetero)aromatic dibenzothiophenium (DBT) salts bearing common functional groups (halogens, esters, N-phthalimide) are alkylated with primary and secondary alkyl iodides in good to high yields. Worthy of note are the facts that selective alkylation can be achieved even with a mixture of positional isomers of the sulfonium salt and that one-pot dibenzothiophenylation/cross-coupling proved viable. Experimental and computational studies support a mechanism involving oxidative addition of the DBT salt and cathodic reduction of the formed Ni complex as first steps, followed by single electron transfer (SET) and radical rebound prior to final reductive elimination from the NiIII complex.Meta-Selective Methylation of Aromatics under Superacidic ConditionsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Developing synthetic methodologies to selectively insert a methyl group onto aromatic compounds is of great interest, especially in biological programs, where the introduction of this functionality, known as the methyl "magic effect", can boost potency. However, a current perusal of benzenoid rings in small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) displays a significant heterogeneous distribution of the substitution patterns, highlighting the lack of existing selective methods to access challenging 1,3, 1,3,5, and 1,2,3,4 patterns. In this prospect, Thibaudeau, Michelet and co-workers, in collaboration with ACTIV-H, proposed an elegant meta-selective methylation of aromatic rings under superacidic conditions ( Nat. Commun., DOI: 10.1038/s41467-024-49421-8). The use of this non-nucleophilic highly acidic reaction medium is necessary to (1) activate the methylating agent, (2) generate a long-lived cyclohexadienyl cation which can then rearrange toward the more stable meta regioisomer, and (3) in most instances prevent overalkylation by shielding the methylated aromatic after protonation. The efficiency of this method was demonstrated on more than 50 examples including APIs (more than 10), hence further highlighting the tolerance of many functional groups under these strongly acidic conditions. Deuterium or 13C isotope labeling was also performed on several APIs using these conditions.Iron-Catalyzed C(sp3)–COOH Decarboxylative Oxygenation with TEMPOClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Creating C(sp3)–O bonds is a valuable transformation which is well-handled in nature using decarboxylative processes from carboxylic acids. In sharp contrast, to date only limited chemical methodologies have described such transformations using aliphatic carboxylic acids directly with a broad scope and full selectivity. Recently, a solution for the direct utilization of carboxylic acids as alkylating agents has been brought forward using photochemistry, but most of the publications still rely on expensive and rare-earth metals such as iridium or rubidium. In this work, Kirchner, Schiemann, Kielb, Bunescu, and co-workers proposed an iron-catalyzed direct decarboxylative oxygenation method starting from aliphatic carboxylic acids under irradiation with light ( Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., DOI: 10.1002/anie.202403292). Under these experimental conditions, more than 40 substrates, including 12 complex bioactive compounds, were successfully oxygenated, hence highlighting the good substrate compatibility of this method. The utility of the synthesized compounds was also demonstrated across the postsynthetic transformations of the C–O(TEMPO) bond to diverse valuable functionalities. A thorough mechanistic study revealed the triple role played by TEMPO in the reaction: (1) as the oxygenation reagent, (2) as an oxidant to turn over the iron catalyst, and (3) as an internal mild base for the carboxylic acid deprotonation.Direct Introduction of the 1-Fluorocyclopropyl Group via Stille Cross-Coupling: A Way of Getting around Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl SubstancesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The tactical introduction of small fluorinated carbocycles proffers many opportunities for those seeking to optimize biochemical engagement and/or physicochemical properties of putative therapeutic agents. More specifically, fluorinated cyclopropanes possess all the benefits associated three-membered carbocycles (e.g., rigidification without loss of three-dimensionality) while also affording improved binding affinity via fluorine's weak non-covalent interactions and beneficial alterations to lipophilicity. Further, these compact units can often serve as bioisosteric replacements for an array of motifs (e.g., CF3-cyclopropanes serving as tert-butyl isosteres). Though well-defined approaches exist for the assembly of certain fluorinated cyclopropane classes, others suffer from limited (and in some cases impractical) methods for their construction. One such group is the 1-fluorocyclopropyl (1-FCp) motif. Common strategies for accessing 1-FCp center on building the ring from fluorinated olefins (which have a tendency to polymerize) or deoxyfluorination of cyclopropanols (wherein ring opening is common). A perhaps more readily deployable strategy, especially from the standpoint of parallel synthesis, would be a bench-stable reagent for 1-FCp cross-coupling. Recently, Leroux and co-workers, in partnership with scientists at Bayer AG, reported the development and implementation of an organostannyl-based 1-FCp reagent that allows for efficient coupling with sp2 electrophiles ( Adv. Synth. Catal., DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202400401). Ultimately, the authors identified a combination of Pd2(dba)3 and JackiePhos with CuCl and KF as additives for successful cross-coupling. Synthesis of the requisite organostannane could be accomplished by a Si-to-Sn swap from commercial (1-fluorovinyl)methyldiphenylsilane followed by iron-catalyzed cyclopropanation. Although the main focus of this report was on 1-FCp installation itself, the process was extended to more complex fluorinated cyclopropanes with stereocontrol.Vinyltriarylbismuthonium Salts: Powerful Vehicles for α-Vinylation of Carbonyl CompoundsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Among strictly carbon-based functionalities, olefins are perhaps the most versatile in terms of breadth of transforms, acting primarily as nucleophiles in polar reactions or Giese acceptors in odd-electron processes. Further, they can be exploited at all levels of development, be it as a synthetic handle for structure–activity relationship interrogation or as a key raw material in a commercial process. One of the simplest olefinic building blocks is gaseous ethylene, a C2 feedstock that is utilized in numerous industrial processes, most notably in polymerization. Though able to be used on scale, its use in research laboratories is hampered by its physical properties and tendency to polymerize. Ethylene "equivalents" are employed in its stead, but the vast majority of such species are nucleophilic in nature. Electrophilic ethylene species often have similar or worse properties compared to ethylene itself, thus making broad implementation problematic. In a recent report, Rawal and co-workers identified vinyltriphenylbismuthonium (VTB) salts as bench-stable vinyl cation equivalents for the α-vinylation of carbon nucleophiles ( J. Am. Chem. Soc., DOI: 10.1021/jacs.4c05709). VTB salts can be engaged with lithium enolates to affect vinylation in good to excellent yields with high dr in systems where diastereomers are generated. The process is presumed to proceed through a pentavalent O-bismuth enolate. This hypervalent species can, in one mechanistic postulate, transfer a carbon "ligand" (in this case the vinyl group) to the α-carbon with release of a trivalent bismuthane. Alternatively, an O-to-C rearrangement would yield an α-keto bismuth(V) species, which upon "reductive elimination" would yield the observed vinylated product. The authors were able not only to extend this strategy to other olefins and tandem reactions (i.e., 1,4-addition followed by trapping) but also to showcase the utility of these reagents in natural product assembly. Further, the authors also devised a practical, scalable preparation of VTB salts from readily accessible organobismuth species and showed that the spent Bi(III) could be recovered and presumably recycled. The methodology was extended to more complex (non-vinyl) bismuthonium ions as well.Sulfone Electrophiles in Cross-Electrophile Coupling: Nickel-Catalyzed Difluoromethylation of Aryl BromidesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Despite its relatively small size and its nearly complete absence in naturally occurring compounds, the influence that fluorine has had on the development of life-changing pharmaceuticals is immense. Introduction of fluorine or, more commonly, fluorinated motifs allows practitioners to surmount challenges relating to metabolism, absorption, and even binding affinity, ultimately translating to longer-lasting therapeutics with higher target fidelity. Because of this proven track record, bioisosteric replacement of certain motifs has become common to the workflow used for triaging targets and identifying metabolic hotspots. One common isosteric "swap" involves replacement of an array of chalcogen-based functionalities with the difluoromethyl (CF2H) group. This fluorinated moiety is a putative C-centered hydrogen-bond donor but generally provides a marked increase in lipophilicity. Although in the past two decades the technology for CF2H incorporation has greatly improved, gaps still remain, especially in a late-stage fashion. The most ideal methods would be those balancing scope with practicality of building blocks; that is, reagents and processes that use commodity and sustainable CF2H feedstocks are likely to have the most industry-wide uptake. Recently, the Weix group at the University of Wisconsin in collaboration with Monfette at Pfizer reported on a practical Ni-based approach for the difluoromethylation of aryl and heteroaryl bromides using difluoromethyl 2-pyridyl sulfone (DFPS) ( ACS Catal., DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.4c01999). The crux of their approach was the SET reduction of DFPS to generate a CF2H radical (whose presence was confirmed by radical cyclization experiments). This radical could then be funneled into a standard Ni cross-electrophile coupling regime. PyBCam was identified as the optimal ligand for this process, and the scope of the transformation proved to be quite wide. Further, the authors were able to define a scalable route to DFPS that is free of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) using 2-chloro-2,2-difluoroacetophenone to deliver the CF2H unit. Alternative heteroaryl difluoromethyl sulfone reagents were also identified, showing this to be a general paradigm for CF2H radical generation/cross-coupling.Ammonia Borane-Dependent Transfer Hydrogenation of Carboxylic Esters to Primary AlcoholsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Among the many interesting hydrogenation reactions, the hydrogenation of carboxylic esters to primary alcohols is an essential transformation as well as a very challenging one. Conventionally, the reduction of esters is achieved by the aggressive action of unstable metal hydride-reducing agents (NaBH4 or LiAlH4), enabling the formation of the alcohol product. An additional option for ester reduction is hydrogenation facilitated with heterogeneous catalysts under harsh conditions. Expanding on their previous work on the use of ammonia borane (NH3·BH3, AB) as a source of dihydrogen, Natte and co-workers at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad reported the catalyst-free reduction of esters to alcohols ( J. Org. Chem., DOI: 10.1021/acs.joc.4c00964). Screening experiments revealed that the stoichiometry was critical to obtain high yields. THF was identified as the preferred solvent, and 120 °C was the preferred reaction temperature. Replacement of AB with other amine borane complexes was less effective. A variety of potentially reducible functional groups, such as boronic ester, nitro, fluoroalkyl, and halo, were not impacted by the reaction with AB. Both aliphatic and aromatic esters were reduced to the corresponding primary alcohols with AB in uniformly good to excellent yields. In conclusion, the reduction of a diverse range of carboxylic esters via the hydrogen transfer agent ammonia borane was reported.Multicomponent Synthesis of α-Branched Amines via a Zinc-Mediated Carbonyl Alkylative Amination ReactionClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The ability of α-branched amine motifs to modulate key biological interactions and regulate the physicochemical properties of small molecules has rendered them as ubiquitous structural features among pharmaceutical agents, agrochemicals, and natural products. For many years, carbonyl reductive amination has been the benchmark for the synthesis of complex alkylamines and is particularly effective when there is limited α-branching in the respective amine and carbonyl components. However, poor reactivity is often observed when sterically encumbered ketones are utilized as substrates. Gaunt and co-workers at the University of Cambridge detailed an operationally simple, efficient, and scalable synthesis of complex alkylamines via a multicomponent carbonyl alkylative amination (CAA) reaction ( J. Am. Chem. Soc., DOI: 10.1021/jacs.3c14037). The reaction was performed with a primary or secondary amine or an aniline, an aldehyde, and an alkyl iodide in the presence of a reductant and a Lewis acid. Screening experiments revealed that the optimal reductant, Lewis acid, and solvent were zinc, TMSOTf, and ethyl acetate, respectively. The reaction is sensitive to air, but simple sparging with nitrogen was sufficient. The reaction was insensitive to the particle size of the zinc; 10–400 μm particles demonstrated equivalent efficacy. The CAA reaction was demonstrated with a variety of primary or secondary amines or anilines, aldehydes, and alkyl iodides; good yields were obtained. Alkyl chlorides and bromides were also viable substrates; the yields were lower than with the corresponding iodides. Ketones were unreactive to the CAA reaction conditions. The alkyl iodides could be successfully replaced with redox-activated esters as the radical precursors under the standard reaction conditions with no deleterious effect on the yields. In conclusion, an economical, robust, and scalable strategy for the synthesis of complex alkylamines under mild conditions via a zinc-mediated carbonyl alkylative amination reaction was detailed.Modular Synthesis of α-Branched Secondary Alkylamines via Visible-Light-Mediated Carbonyl Alkylative AminationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Gaunt and co-workers built on their interests in branched secondary alkylamines using the three-component coupling approach under blue LED irradiation using tris(trimethylsilyl)silane to generate the alkyl radical derived from the alkyl iodide ( Chem. Sci., DOI: 10.1039/d4sc03916e). Key to this approach is the selective addition of an alkyl radical into the electrophilic imine formed in situ from the primary amine and aldehyde. These studies systematically investigated the scope of this transformation through exploring a wide array of individual coupling partners, generating a wide array of secondary amine products (>50 examples). The methodology was further expanded by design of the coupling partners to induce cyclization of the initial products from the three-component coupling step to generate heterocyclic systems in an efficient manner.Synthesis of 2-Pyridones through N-Insertion of CyclopentenonesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A good illustration of how N-heterocyclic compounds are important scaffolds in the pharmaceutical area is reflected by the fact that more than half of FDA-approved drugs feature this moiety. Despite this encouraging statistic, traditional methods for the synthesis of 2-pyridones are still often lengthy, require prefunctionalized building blocks, employ harsh conditions, or lack generality. In this prospect, Morandi and co-workers found inspiration from the famous Beckmann rearrangement, where pyridine-2-ones would be obtained after an N-insertion, ring-expansion rearrangement from readily available cyclopentenones ( Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., DOI: 10.1002/anie.202408230). This one-pot procedure consists of the formation of a transient silyl enol ether which rearranges through N-insertion using a combination of PIDA and ammonium carbamate. Under these mild conditions, a scope of more than 30 examples was obtained, including natural products such as cis-jasmone. Many functional groups are tolerated (free alcohol, carboxylic acid, alkene, alkyne, etc.), and the methodology is also amenable to 15N-labeling of APIs.Sandmeyer Chlorosulfonylation of (Hetero)aromatic Amines Using DABSO as a SO2 SurrogateClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The importance of modern organosulfur chemistry cannot be overstated, as organosulfur compounds find widespread applications in agrochemicals, materials, fine chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Of the many different sulfur-containing functional groups, sulfonamides have a special place in modern drug discovery, as they can act as bioisosteres for carboxylic acids, esters, and amides. Despite the ubiquity of sulfonamides, their synthesis relies nearly exclusively on one textbook transformation, the reaction of an amine with a sulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base. Schäfer at Idorsia Pharmaceuticals, Willis at the University of Oxford, and their co-workers developed a novel Sandmeyer-type sulfonyl chloride synthesis from feedstock anilines and DABCO-bis(sulfur dioxide) (DABSO) as a stable SO2 surrogate ( Org. Lett., DOI: 10.1021/acs.orglett.4c01908). DABSO is a commercially available, inexpensive, bench-stable, easily handled crystalline solid. The diazonium salt was derived from the corresponding aniline by treatment with tert-butyl nitrite and was trapped in situ with DABSO. The resultant sulfonyl chloride could be isolated or treated with an amine to form the sulfonamide directly. RC-1 experiments confirmed the tert-butyl nitrite addition to be fully dose-controlled without any thermal accumulation. The reaction protocol was successful on a variety of electron-neutral and electron-deficient anilines; electron-rich anilines required heating to 75 °C to achieve full conversion. The reaction tolerated a variety of functional groups, including halogen, fluoroalkyl, nitrile, nitro, and ester. Heterocyclic amines were also demonstrated to be suitable substrates. In summary, anilines were converted into the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides by a Sandmeyer-type reaction with DABSO as a SO2 surrogate under mild conditions. The resultant sulfonyl chlorides could be converted in situ into sulfonamides.Palladium(Methylnaphthyl)(tBuBrettPhos) Complexes as Efficient and Selective Catalysts for the Monoarylation of Ammonia and HydrazineClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The transition-metal-catalyzed monoarylation of ammonia is one of the most attractive syntheses of anilines because of its simplicity and atom economy. However, this protocol is challenging since the aniline products are more reactive to a second arylation than ammonia is to the first. For Pd-catalyzed reactions, bulky, electron-rich ligands are essential to achieve selective monoarylation. The selective monoarylation of hydrazine is even harder to achieve. Gooßen and co-workers at Ruhr Universität Bochum reported their discovery of [Pd(MeNAP)(tBuBrettPhos)Br] as an efficient one-component catalyst for the arylation of ammonia and hydrazine ( ACS Catal., DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.4c02624). Catalyst screening experiments revealed the enhanced performance of [Pd(1-MeNAP)(tBuBrettPhos)Br] versus other combinations of palladium sources and electron-rich ligands for the desired monoarylation of ammonia with aryl chlorides. Preformation of this catalyst system was not required. Ammonium triflate and hydrazine triflate were utilized as convenient, solid surrogates for ammonia and hydrazine, respectively. A range of aryl chlorides were converted into the corresponding anilines or arylhydrazines with excellent selectivity for monoarylation. Excellent yields were obtained irrespective of the electronic nature of the aryl chloride substrate. The hydrazine products were converted in situ to pyrazoles to simplify their isolation and quantification on small scale. The reaction scope was extended to multiple heterocycles, including pyridine, pyrazine, thiophene, and quinoline. In conclusion, the bench-stable complex [Pd(1-MeNAP)(tBuBrettPhos)Br] was shown to catalyze the monoarylation of ammonia and hydrazine derivatives with a new level of activity and selectivity.Homoleptic Organolanthanum-Catalyzed CarbohalogenationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Lithium–halogen exchange is a crucial transformation in organic chemistry. The formation of nucleophilic carbanions and generation of organometallic species which can engage in metal-mediated processes enable indispensable synthetic disconnections. Regardless, metal–halogen exchange is rarely used for cascade transformations due to the reactivity of these species, and catalytic methods, especially those using nonprecious metals, are limited. Chen, Maron, Wei, and co-workers recently reported a catalytic lanthanum–halogen exchange and carbometalation/halogenation to furnish functionally dense cyclic systems ( J. Am. Chem. Soc., DOI: 10.1021/jacs.4c10445). The authors employed a homoleptic lanthanum catalyst in conjunction with a mild lithium source and catalytic base to achieve a cascade reaction. Allyloxybromo- and -iodoarenes can undergo carbohalogenation in good yields. In addition to dihydrobenzofuran derivatives, indole and indoline motifs can be accessed when N-allyl bromoanilines are employed. Alternatively, when a fluorine is present at the 3-postion, dihalobiphenyl products are achieved in high yields instead via an aryne-based pathway. Following scope exploration, the authors interrogated the mechanism of each reaction and demonstrated the energetically challenging pathway allowed by this unique set of reaction conditions. In particular, the mechanistic divergence from palladium- and nickel-catalyzed systems was noted. The synthetic value of the products as intermediates en route to pharmaceutical agents was demonstrated through the synthesis of TAK-875, an iterative alkyne addition, and a diastereoselective carbohalogenation. The La-catalyzed cascade and aryne transformations offer new synthetic strategies toward densely functionalized motifs and extend the utility of the classical metal–halogen exchange. More importantly, this method demonstrates the use of highly earth-abundant, nontoxic, and cost-effective lanthanides in the synthesis of complex products and sheds light on the potential to improve current methods or develop novel reactions using more sustainable approaches.CuSO4/N-(9H-Carbazol-9-yl)picolinamide-Catalyzed C–O Coupling of (Hetero)aryl Chlorides with P
