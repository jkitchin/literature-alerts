There is a growing need to utilize CO 2 and realize a carbon-neutral society from the perspective of environmental problems caused by CO 2 from fossil fuel-based processes. In this trend, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which converts CO 2 to valuable fuels and chemicals with renewable energy, is attracting attention [1] . However, CO2RR has many challenges, including its low product selectivity. In particular, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which occurs at the potential close to the standard electrode potential of CO2RR, reduces the selectivity of CO2RR, especially in aqueous electrolytes such as KHCO 3 [2] [3] . Therefore, we focus on a concentrated electrolyte, which is used as a means of HER suppression in water-based Li-ion batteries [4] , to improve the selectivity of CO2RR. A concentrated electrolyte is an electrolyte with a high salt concentration, which can improve the electrochemical stability of water by creating a specific water environment [5] . Furthermore, due to its high salt concentration, the effect of anions and/or cations may become significant [6][7] . However, there has been no detailed understanding of how the electrolyte concentration affects the complex reaction pathway of CO2RR. Here, we report the effect of concentrated electrolytes on the reaction process of CO2RR by directly observing reaction intermediates in situ while applying the potential. The product selectivity of CO2RR in 22.2, 42.0, and 61.7 mol kg – 1 of concentrated electrolyte was evaluated. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis confirms the suppression of HER in the series of concentrated electrolytes compared to 0.1 M KHCO 3 , a common aqueous electrolyte. In addition, an increase in the Faradaic efficiency of C 2 H 4 was observed in ~ 42.0 mol kg – 1 , implying a concentration-dependent change in the CO2RR reaction pathway (Fig.1). To elucidate the cause of the high C 2 H 4 selectivity, in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), which allows direct observation of the reaction intermediates, was performed. The results showed that as the electrolyte concentration was increased, the peaks at 1400 to 1500 cm – 1 region became more pronounced at low potential. We also observed the difference in the potential dependency for the intensity of CO adsorbates peak at 2100 cm –1 by electrolyte concentration. We will then discuss the effect of electrolyte concentration on the intermediates, unraveling the concentration-dependent change of the C 2 H 4 selectivity. The work highlights the use of concentrated electrolytes to open up additional knobs for tuning the product selectivity of CO2RR, simply by designing an electrolyte component.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) electrochemical conversion is vital because it provides a pathway to efficiently valorize CO2 and incentivize CO2 capture. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is of great interest because it is scalable and can be done at ambient temperature and pressure. However, these reactions are typically performed in water which suffers from undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water breakdown. Aprotic nonaqueous electrolytes can suppress HER and enable a wider range of catalysts for CO2RR. However, water is still needed as a proton source and to stabilize charged intermediates. Here, we study the influence of aprotic electrolyte solvent on modulating the water microenvironment, solvation, and dynamics for CO2RR. Furthermore, we probe changes to the water chemical environment in different aprotic media and the ability of aprotic electrolytes to enhance CO2RR or suppress HER. Our work pushes the field in the understanding of electrolyte solvent and water effects for electrochemical transformations such as CO2RR and HER.

The increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration and the associated rise in global temperatures are major global concerns. One mitigation strategy being studied and employed is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Another widely studied mitigation approach is Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), where CO 2 is utilized as the feed for chemical production. The electro-reduction of CO 2 (eCO 2 RR) is a promising technology that can convert captured CO 2 to key intermediates such as carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene, and ethanol, depending on the catalyst used and its selectivity. Most eCO 2 RR studies use close to pure CO 2 streams as the feed, whereas actual feeds at scale from direct air capture or other capture processes may not be close to 100% CO 2 , and may contain other contaminants. Our work explores eCO 2 RR using feeds that are less than 100% CO 2 but still contain substantial fractions of N 2 and/or O 2 . Specifically, this presentation will focus on developing an electrochemical CO 2 reduction approach using a mixed gas feed comprised of O 2 , N 2, and CO 2 for CH 4 production. To mitigate the detrimental effects of the presence of O 2 on the eCO 2 RR rate and selectivity, we employ an electrochemical method to remove O 2 in the first step, followed by the electroreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 in a membrane electrode assembly cell. This two-step strategy is expected to achieve a higher selectivity for CO 2 to CH 4 than the direct reduction of CO 2 (still in the presence of O 2 ) to CH 4 . This work will also investigate the effects of cell flow pattern design, electrolyte, resilience in the presence of O 2 , and performance of CO 2 to CH 4 over multi-hour runs.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction represents a promising strategy for transforming this ubiquitous greenhouse gas into valuable commodities. Moreover, it offers a solution for storing intermittent renewable electricity by converting CO 2 to chemical fuels. Unlike the formation of hydrocarbons, the reduction of CO 2 to carbon monoxide (CO) involves only two electron/proton transfers, making it a less complex process. Also, CO is a very useful product as it can be used as a crucial feedstock for the production of fuels via the catalytic Fischer-Tropsch process. Nevertheless, the electrocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CO, carried out typically at metals, experiences significant challenges due to changing morphology with time, poor CO 2 RR product selectivity, and unavoidable competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction in aqueous environments. Therefore, attention has also been extended to CO 2 RR at carbon-based catalysts, as carbon possesses a plethora of inherent advantages, including its customizable and stable porous structures, high surface area, low cost, and environmental friendliness. While these properties make carbon highly favorable as a catalyst, it is inactive towards CO 2 reduction in its pure state and must be doped or surface modified to achieve reasonable CO 2 RR kinetics. As an example, nitrogen-doped carbons (N-C) have shown acceptable activity towards the CO 2 RR, [1] attributed to the electronic modulation of conjugated sp 2 carbon atoms by adjacent nitrogen dopants, disrupting electroneutrality by delocalizing π-orbital electrons within the carbon framework and creating active sites for CO 2 activation. Even so, as N-C catalysts require significant overpotentials to attain satisfactory reaction rates and as the Faradaic efficiencies can be low and unstable, there is a pressing need to devise novel strategies to enhance the catalytic efficacy of N-C materials and achieve highly efficient CO 2 -to-CO conversion. To overcome these limitations, a dual-doping approach has been suggested, with the observed enhancement in activity of co-doped catalysts (e.g., N and sulfur) generally attributed to synergistic effects between nitrogen and the secondary atoms. [2] Computational simulations have predicted that the inclusion of sulfur into N-graphene could increase the asymmetrical spin density of the carbon system due to the higher polarizability of sulfur atoms compared to nitrogen and carbon atoms, thereby leading to improved catalytic performance. Moreover, sulfur modification can offer a potentially effective avenue for enhancing CO 2 RR performance over N-C materials by leveraging the electronic contribution from sulfur. [3] However, to the best of our knowledge, there are limited reports on the implementation of sulfur decoration strategies for electrocatalytic CO 2 RR. Our team has been working on a family of fully tunable monodisperse mesoporous carbon sheets, designated as nanoporous carbon scaffolds (NCS), along with colloid imprinted carbon (CIC) powders as carbon support materials. The CIC and NCS materials possess identical ordered monodisperse pore diameters, selected to be anywhere between 10 and 100 nm. These mesoporous carbons present numerous advantages compared to microporous carbons, notably their internal accessibility to solutions and gases, as well as their highly defective surfaces, making them easily modified. Specifically, the NCS offers additional benefits due to its self-supported nature and suitability for conducting fundamental CO 2 RR membrane electrode assembly (MEA) studies. To date, we have successfully N-doped both the CICs and the NCS and are now moving towards co-doping with S. N-doping has been achieved by subjecting the carbons to an NH 3 atmosphere at 800 °C and S-doping is carried out by heat treatment of a mixture of the carbons and benzyl disulfide in Ar. We are also investigating a carbon precursor having intrinsic N and S content to simplify the preparation steps. In this case, the N,S-C catalysts were prepared by ball milling of dry silica particles (85 nm) and Alberta-sourced mesophase pitch. Subsequently, the mixture underwent carbonization at 900 °C for 2 hours, followed by removal of silica using a NaOH solution to yield the final product. CO 2 RR testing of these first generation of N,S doped catalysts has been carried out primarily in CO 2 -saturated bicarbonate solutions in an H-cell, giving an impressive CO Faradaic efficiency of 80% at overpotentials of only 390 mV and maintaining their stability for many hours of polarization. XPS studies are underway to establish a correlation between S, N content and speciation with the electrocatalytic activity and durability of these materials, with CO 2 RR testing also being carried out under flow conditions for comparison.

There are several materials design strategies that have been utilized with various levels of success for CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to C 1 , C 2 and occasionally, C 3 products (C i denotes the number of carbon atoms in the product of CO 2 RR). Among those Cu based materials take leading role as this class of catalysts is relatively simple to synthesize and implement. 1 Adding co-catalyst in the composite materials allow for regulating of selectivity towards a specific product while sustaining some simplicity of the synthesis and deployment strategies. 2 Alternatively, CO 2 RR can be carried on carbon-based electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed transition metals, stabilized by nitrogen (known as M-N-C). We synthesized a library of nitrogen-doped carbonaceous materials with atomically dispersed 3d transition metals and corresponding metal-free electrocatalysts. The sacrificial support method (SSM) was used yielding catalyst materials of high dispersity and high graphitic content. The resulting electrocatalysts were impurity free, hence allowing a better understanding of the mechanism of CO 2 reduction. By combining the electrochemical results with density functional theory, we were able to separate the electrocatalysts into several categories, based on their CO 2 → COOH ads free energy and their CO ads binding strength. 3 The ‘strong-CO binder’ electrocatalysts ( e.g. Cr, Mn and Fe – N – C) achieved a Faradaic efficiency up to 50% at – 0.35 V vs. RHE (at pH = 7.5, in 0.1 M phosphate buffer). Such Faradaic efficiency was also achieved for a metal-free electrocatalyst, therefore showing the high activity of the metal-free, N-containing, moieties toward the CO 2 reduction reaction. A separate study showed materials hydrophobicity as one of the major factors of metal-free catalysts selectivity. 4 Among the many practical products of CO 2 RR syngas (an H 2 /CO mixture) attracts special attention. Appropriate electrocatalysts, such as the metal–nitrogen–carbon (M-N-C) materials, allow for the production of CO alongside H 2 (from the hydrogen evolution reaction), and thus leads to syngas generation. 5 Selectivity of mono- and bi-metallic (M-N-C, M = Fe, Mo or FeMo) electrocatalysts towards syngas production have been extensively studied. 6 The ratio of the CO:H 2 in the syngas was tuned by modifying the ratio of metallic precursors in the bi-metallic FeMo-N-C catalysts, tailoring the catalysts’ selectivity towards the CO 2 RR or the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Further development of CO 2 RR towards valorization of its products may lay through its integration with bioprocesses. 7 Success of that strategy will rely on the ability of such systems to result in highly selective synthesis of formate, acetate, or propionate as major products. 8,9 Those examples show the path to designer catalyst materials for a desired scalable CO 2 RR-based electrosynthesis technology.

The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has the potential to convert carbon dioxide to higher value fuels and chemicals, offering a pathway for carbon neutral (or negative) synthesis of carbon monoxide, ethylene, and several other compounds. A common challenge for CO 2 RR research is driving the selective CO 2 RR over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This key performance metric is quantified by the catalyst’s faradaic efficiency (FE): the number of electrons that go toward producing a specific product divided by the total number of electrons passed during electrolysis. FE is often determined by gas and liquid chromatography. However, these methods have long response times (minutes to hours) and therefore prevent selectivity analysis in real-time. Instead, rotating ring disk electrodes (RRDE) have emerged as a rapid and sensitive method for quantitative CO 2 RR selectivity measurements with negligible time delays. To date, work has focused on a polycrystalline Au RRDE, especially for bench scale mechanistic studies. The Au disk electrode catalyzes both CO 2 RR and HER, while the concentric Au ring electrode senses the CO produced at the disk and oxidizes it back to CO 2 . By comparing the ring and disk currents, FE CO and FE HER can be determined using the subtraction method. However, comparison across several works have reported a wide range for FE CO values, 60-83%, despite identical conditions: CO 2 saturated 0.1 M NaHCO 3 (pH = 6.8), E disk = -0.6 V vs RHE, and rotation at 2500 rpm [A. Goyal, et al. , J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 142 , 4154–4161 (2020); R. E. Vos and M. T. M. Koper, ChemElectroChem , 9 , e202200239 (2022)]. This work investigates the possible causes of this poor reproducibility in RRDE selectivity measurements by comparing protocols with different electrochemical methods, reagent purities, and glassware cleaning procedures. Most notably, we observed rapid loss of selectivity toward CO production during chronoamperometry measurements. Lastly, we propose operational bounds for RRDE selectivity measurements on Au under CO 2 RR conditions and provide our perspective on next steps for developing this into a robust analytical technique.

As global warming takes place at an unprecedented pace, it becomes increasingly important to develop negative emission (i.e., CO 2 -depleting) technologies to achieve the hoped-for net-zero target in 2050. The electrochemical CO 2 -reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) or formate is expected to be an economically viable approach to close the carbon cycle while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. [1] In this context, palladium (Pd) has been identified as an interesting CO 2 RR-catalyst owing to its ability to selectively produce formate vs. CO in the lower vs. higher overpotential regimes [i.e., at -0.1 to -0.4 vs. -0.5 to -0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively]. [2] To this day, the reasons for this potential-induced change in product selectivity remain poorly understood and a subject of open debate in the literature. In this regard, several publications have suggested that PdH x forms at the negative potentials at which the CO 2 RR takes place, and that this hydride acts as the active phase in the reduction of CO 2 to formate. [3, 4] To elucidate this catalytic mechanism, we have investigated two different types of Pd catalysts: one consisting of dispersed Pd-nanoparticles supported on a carbon black, and a second one in the form of unsupported Pd nanoparticles tridimensionally interconnected into a network structure (i.e., a so called aerogel). [5] To track these materials’ potential-dependent PdH x -formation using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Pd K-edge under CO 2 RR-conditions and link it to their partial current densities (pCDs) towards formate, we employed a newly designed spectroelectrochemical operando XAS flow cell. The latter enables spectral acquisition in a grazing incidence (GI) configuration allowing the use of thin layer electrodes (i.e., with a thickness < 1 μm) which in turn minimizes the accumulation of evolved gaseous bubbles along the CL-thickness, thus avoiding spectral artifacts related to the present of such bubbles. Moreover, the implementation of an ion-conductive membrane to separate the working- and counter-electrode compartments enables the accurate quantification of gaseous products via mass spectrometry and gas chromatography, as well as of liquid products by collecting aliquots of the electrolyte over time (which, in the case of formate, are subsequently analyzed through ion chromatography). Using this combination of spectroelectrochical and analytic techniques, we found that the two catalysts exhibit significantly distinct behaviors, as illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, while for the C-supported Pd nanoparticles the stable pCD towards formate observed at -100 mV and -200mV vs. RHE is accompanied by a quick PdH x -formation (stabilizing at hydride stoichiometries of x ~ 0.6 vs. ~ 0.5, respectively), the unsupported Pd aerogel features a negligible formate- production capability at the same potentials, and the corresponding hydride phases only form gradually in the course of the potential holds and reach x-values of ~ 0.35 and x ~ 0.4, respectively. Moreover, the fact that for the C-supported Pd nanoparticles the higher pCD towards formate observed at -200 mV vs RHE corresponds to a hydride phase with a lower H-content compared that at -100 mV vs RHE indicates an indirect correlation between the formate- production rate and the nanoparticles H-content. In conclusion, these results provide valuable new insights into the important role of the time-dependent formation of PdH x on these materials’ CO 2 -to-formate selectivity.

For decades, global warming has posed a significant environmental challenge worldwide, CO 2 generated by human activities is considered to be a major cause of its escalation. Among the methods to convert CO 2 into high value-added chemicals, like carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) and ethanol(C 2 H 5 OH), electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) at a low temperature has gained considerable attention. Nevertheless, given the high reaction barrier, sluggish kinetics, and diverse pathways involved in CO 2 RR, well-designed electrocatalysts are crucial for facilitating reactions and adjusting selectivity for specific products. Copper (Cu) has garnered the most attention in recent years due to its ability to generate hydrocarbons beyond CO owing to its moderate *CO adsorption energy. However, Cu exhibits a low selectivity for specific products with wide range of hydrocarbons and undergoes the hydrogen evolution reaction which competes with CO 2 RR. Incorporation of Cu-based bimetallic alloys can enhance selectivity by regulating the intrinsic active sites of the material to control the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates. Among many secondary metals, post-transition metals such as tin (Sn), indium (In), and bismuth (Bi) have been proven to be active in CO 2 RR alone, and studies have reported that combining them with Cu selectively produces CO and HCOO - . While antimony (Sb) possessed similar properties, it went unnoticed due to its lack of CO 2 RR activity alone. However, recent studies have revealed that the addition of a small amount of Sb to Cu results in high CO activity. Electrocatalytic assessments are typically performed using a standard three-electrode H-type cell. Due to the limited accessibility of CO 2 by the catalyst, constrained by the solubility of CO 2 (approximately ~34 mM at ambient conditions), the highest achievable operating current density is capped at around ~20 mA cm −2 . In a gas diffusion electrode system, gaseous CO 2 is fed directly to the catalyst, enabling rapid mass transport of CO 2 . Among these methods, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer offers enhanced efficiencies owing to the reduced ohmic resistance inherent in their zero-gap design. In a MEA electrolyzer, the membrane is sandwiched between the cathode and anode catalyst layers on each side. During operation, the cathodic side receives humidified CO 2 but no flowing electrolyte. The anode is typically fed an alkaline electrolyte and commonly consists of a carbon gas diffusion layer with deposited IrO x nanoparticles to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction. Here in, a series of bimetallic Cu X Sb 10-X (X = 0, 2, 5, 8, 10) catalysts with adjustable compositions for CO 2 RR was prepared. Cu X Sb 10-X catalysts were synthesized via direct co-electrodeposition onto a gas diffusion layer (MPL/CP) under the room temperature. Characterization reveals that Cu X Sb 10-X catalysts have a typical morphology consisting of nano-sized particles with well-dispersed Cu and Sb. CO 2 RR tests were performed in a gas flow MEA single cell using humidified gaseous CO 2 and anion exchange membrane (AEM). Unlike Pristine Cu, Cu 5 Sb 5 and Cu 8 Sb 2 , which have major composition of Cu, show CO (72.4%) as a main product at 3.0 V cell . Meanwhile, Cu 2 Sb 8 exhibits enhanced selectivity for CH 4 (49.7%) with a partial current density of 152.1 mA cm -2 , at 3.6 V cell despite pristine Sb having an inability to produce any CO 2 RR product. We assume that Cu serves as the main active site in this catalyst. At the same time, the CO 2 RR selectivity shifts towards CH 4 when the site of Cu decreases and becomes isolated near Sb. Later, in situ Raman spectroscopy will be used to reason that the Cu-Sb interface in Cu weakens the binding energy of *CO. Also, Sb surrounding isolated Cu in Cu 2 Sb 8 promotes the CO 2 RR to CH 4 through enhancing the binding energy of *CHO which is key intermediate of CH 4 reaction pathway.

1. Introduction To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, significant attention has been paid to the development of CO 2 capture and utilization (CCU) technologies in addition to CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Here, electrochemical CO 2 conversion technology in molten salt is considered one of the promising candidates for CCU because it can reduce CO 2 to elemental carbon [1,2]. In recent years, we have been working on the conversion of CO 2 into a variety of valuable carbon materials. For example, we reported the electrochemical synthesis of diamond from molten LiCl-KCl-K 2 CO 3 -KOH [3]. In the present study, we report recent results on the electrochemical synthesis of various carbon allotropes, including diamond, in molten chlorides. 2.Experimental As a typical molten salt among the chloride systems, we used eutectic LiCl-KCl. Cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic electrolysis were performed after adding K 2 CO 3 to the molten salt. For diamond synthesis, KOH was also added to the molten salt. The working electrode was a Ni flag (Φ 3 × 0.1 mm) or Ni plate (5 mm × 10 mm × 0.1 mm), the counter electrode was a glass-like carbon rod, and the reference electrode was an Ag + /Ag electrode. The potential was calibrated with Li + /Li potential. After electrochemical measurements were performed, samples were prepared by potentiostatic electrolysis using the Ni plate electrodes. In the case where CO 2 was used as a raw material, molten LiCl-KCl containing Li 2 O was prepared, and CO 2 and H 2 O were bubbled into it in predetermined amounts, respectively. After electrochemical measurements, potentiostatic electrolysis was performed to prepare samples. The obtained samples were analyzed by SEM, EDX, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. In addition to the LiCl-KCl, we used several other chloride-based molten salts for use at higher temperatures. 3. Results and Discussion For diamond synthesis, CO 2 and H 2 O were introduced into molten LiCl-KCl-Li 2 O at 973 K. Then, CO 2 was converted into CO 3 2− and H 2 O into OH − . Samples were prepared by potentiostatic electrolysis using Ni plate electrodes at 1.0 to 1.2 V (vs. Li + /Li). The charge density was unified to 10 C cm −2 . As an example, optical images of the sample obtained at 1.2 V is shown in Fig. 1. The electrode surfaces were covered with black deposits, but most of the deposits, except for the edges, were detached during the water rinsing. Raman spectra were measured at the points indicated by the crosses in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 2, sharp peaks were observed at 1332 cm −1 , overlapping the spectra characteristic of amorphous carbon. The results indicate that the majority of the product was amorphous carbon, but a small amount of diamond was synthesized electrochemically. On the day of the meeting, we will also present the results obtained in other chloride-based molten salts. Acknowledgment A part of this work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 21K19024.

Among representative examples of semiconducting materials for the selective reduction of carbon dioxide to desired small organic molecules (fuels, utility chemicals), there are transition metal oxides (p-type semiconductors), in particular Cu-based oxides, such as Cu 2 O, CuFeO 2 , CuBi 2 O 4 , CuNb 2 O 6 , CuO and Cu 2 O) that are capable of generating electrons with use of solar visible light. Selectivity of the catalytic systems largely depends on the activing adsorptive (CO 2 ) phenomena and the affinity of catalytic centers to the adsorbed carbon monoxide intermediates leading to their protonation or hydrogenation. Here application of aqueous or water-containing electrolytes is generally preferred. Furthermore, a compromise must be reached between the activity of a catalyst toward hydrogen evolution (water splitting), its ability to promote reductive adsorption of CO 2 and to generate moderate coverages of H atoms capable of stabilizing subsequent reduced intermediates. Our interest concentrates on copper(I) oxides but their practical use requires means of stabilization without poisoning or deactivation. To improve stability against photocorrosion, to assure the sufficient electron-hole pair separation, as well as to increase population of electrons in the conduction band, mixed oxide systems combining the p-type semiconductor (e.g. Cu 2 O) with n-type semiconductors such as TiO 2 , SrTiO 3 or KTaO 3 have been proposed. To meet requirements for practical Cu 2 O-based photocathodes, not only the ability to absorb efficiently visible light and to assure fast interfacial electron transfers but also the stability issues need to be addressed. Contrary to the poor performance of the pristine (bare) copper(I) oxide photocathode, the visible-light-illuminated photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide has been successfully performed using the p-type Cu 2 O-semiconductor (deposited onto the transparent fluorine-doped conducting glass electrode) over-coated with the ultra-thin films of various polymer (poly(4-vinyl pyridine, oligoaniline) or polynuclear type materials (titanium, zirconium and tungsten oxides).. In this respect, ultra-thin films of functionalized carbon nanostructures, supramolecular complexes (with nitrogen containing ligands and certain transition metal sites) or robust bacterial biofilms could also be advantageous. For example, A biofilm formed by a strain of Yersinia enterocolitica ( Y. enterocolitica ) is characterized by high physicochemical stability over a wide pH range (4-10) and temperatures (0-40°C).Also oligoaniline or tungsten oxide over-layers could be fabricated on copper(I) oxide surfaces. Under such conditions, the copper(I) oxide photoelectrode does not change the oxidation state during photoelectrochemical diagnostic experiments. Thus certain robust (not necessarily thin) over-layers could exhibit the effect of stabilization of Cu 2 O against photocorrosion. Among important issues is the ability of CO 2 to undergo adsorption (and activation toward reduction to CO) at both bare and modified surfaces of Cu 2 O. The proposed bi-layered photocathode has been demonstrated to produce such simple organic fuels as alcohols. Introduction of co-catalytic centers, e.g. palladium in a form of supramolecular complexes could also be advantageous.

Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the most prevailing issues that has to be dealt with its main role in global climate change. In order to curtail this issue there are two forms of options to deal with CO 2 emissions currently and that is CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) and CCS(Carbon Capture and Sequestration). CCS operations focus on mitigation through storing the CO 2 underground in reservoirs, but this comes with inherent cost which makes it costly especially at an industrial scale. CCU operations although offer not only CO 2 mitigation but also a marketable product which can then mitigate the cost of operating the conversion process. These CCU operations can work in a variety of ways, but we will focus on the electrochemical pathway which has shown promise as a low carbon emission and low cost pathway when coupled with green electricity. Through this pathway important petrochemicals can be made such as ethylene through use of an AEM. Currently this procedure has been to be prohibitively expensive due in part to a variety of factors from stability, efficiency, Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) design, and even the current price of electricity. In response to this research has been done in order to lower the cost of the MEA, increase its stability, and design a system that maximize production without requiring external ingredients. That is the purpose of the integrated system designed here it allows for the production of ethylene with only the use of water, CO 2 from industrial sources, and Air in order to operate. From this the AEM can then produce ethylene at an industrial scale with only ingredients available on site. The next step is to figure out the required operational parameters for this proposed system in order to achieve current market prices to compete with current petrochemical methods. This is done through the modeling of the reactor system consisting of three reactors while optimizing the reactor design, the operational current density, the ASR (Area Specific Resistance), Faradaic Efficiency, and the price of electricity in order to find the absolute minimums in order to meet the current price (~$1200/metric ton). This is then used to complete an economic assessment in order to find the price of the produced product as a function of the parameters listed above. This will be key in figuring out the key areas of research in order to make this technology a practical industrial process instead of just persisting as a lab scale processes which is the main importance in completing Techno Economic Assessments (TEA).

Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) into multi-carbon products such as ethylene and ethanol offers a promising avenue for both mitigating CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and producing valuable chemicals. Techno-economic assessments indicate that achieving a current density of 300 mA/cm 2 in CO 2 RR to C 2+ products is crucial. Recently, we have made strides in enhancing both current density and selectivity through the utilization of flow systems and the implementation of spatial confinement strategies. Our approach involves synthesizing copper nanoparticles within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to mitigate overpotential and enhance the selectivity of multi-carbon product formation. The confined environment within the CNTs serves to concentrate CO 2 RR intermediates, thereby promoting the activity and selectivity of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. As a result, our composite catalyst demonstrates a Faradaic efficiency of 73.96% and a current density of 591.68 mA/cm 2 for C 2 products at 800 mA/cm 2 . Further enhancing the activity of copper species, we design a tubular metal-organic-framework (MOF)-derived copper catalyst that generates copper nanoclusters within its structure, leveraging the spatial confinement effect to boost the activity and selectivity of CO 2 RR. This catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 71% and a current density of 710 mA/cm 2 for C 2 products at 1000 mA/cm 2 . Analysis of operando Raman spectra, reveals crucial intermediates generated during CO 2 RR, shedding light on mechanisms underlying overall catalytic activity improvements. Through these spatial confinement strategies, we aim to significantly reduce carbon dioxide, advance towards achieving net-zero emissions, and pave the way for the industrialization of CO 2 RR.

ECO 2 RR (Electrochemical carbon-dioxide reduction reaction) is a widespread and most promising strategy for controlling CO 2 emission, global warming, etc. We have developed binder-free copper oxide nanowires (CuO NWs) to address this issue using a conventional synthesis process. The prepared electrocatalyst was confirmed through powder-XRD, high-resolution XPS, and FE-SEM analysis. The EDAX elemental mapping confirmed the presence of Cu and O elements. The CuO NWs showed exceptional activity in the CO 2(g) purged electrolyte system. Moreover, the CuO NWs achieved the maximum current density of in the CO 2(g) medium (56.5 mA cm -2 ), whereas in the N 2(g) medium, it was 33.8 mA cm -2 . In addition, predominant catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability properties are observed; further post-mortem analysis demonstrates the choice of material importance. The present work describes an impressive approach to develop highly active electrocatalysts for selective ECO 2 RR applications.

There is a growing interest in developing high-performance catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to address the increasingly serious impacts of global climate change. In this talk, we report on the design of Cu-based and Co-based bimetallic nanomaterials for the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . The morphology, composition and structure of the synthesized nanomaterials were characterized with various imaging and spectroscopic techniques, including FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, EDX and XPS. The effects of an applied potential on the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 were investigated using various electrochemical methods. The products generated from the CO 2 electrochemical reduction were identified by gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was also employed to monitor the activity of the catalysts and the CO 2 reduction products. The kinetics of the CO 2 reduction reaction at the nanomaterials was further studied using in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The critical roles of nanostructured surfaces in the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 are discussed.

Due to the escalating crisis of global warming, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion has garnered significant attention as a pivotal technology for sustainable energy and chemical processes. However, the challenge lies in its nature as a strong endothermic reaction with substantial activation energy, thus requiring extensive energy input. Therefore, integration with renewable energy sources becomes imperative. In this regard, Photo- and electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) presents promising avenues for converting CO 2 with water (H 2 O) using electricity derived from renewable sources, thereby producing various chemicals and fuels. However, the abundance of H 2 O in the catalytic microenvironment promotes the competing evolution of hydrogen (H 2 ), leading to diminished energy efficiency and selectivity toward CO 2 R products. Additionally, another challenge is to selectively produce valuable multicarbon products (C 2+ products), including C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 5 OH, and C 3 H 7 OH, which hold higher market value and greater market volume compared to single-carbon products (C 1 products) like HCOOH, CO, and CH 4 . Among various CO 2 R catalysts, Copper (Cu)-based materials have emerged as prominent candidates due to their capability to yield C 2+ products with considerable activity and selectivity. Recent studies suggest that catalytic microenvironments significantly influence C 2+ production on Cu-based catalysts. Hence, this presentation aims to elucidate the impact of these microenvironments near Cu catalysts and explore how this knowledge can be effectively applied to design a photocathode for the photo-electrochemical reduction of CO 2 , thereby enhancing the production of C 2+ products.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has the potential to play a key role in addressing major energy and environmental challenges via clean conversion of the atmospheric CO 2 from combusting of fossil fuels into value-added products such as fuels and chemicals. The products generated by CO 2 RR vary depending on the electrocatalyst used at the CO 2 electrolyzer cathode, 1 which calls for the development of more active, stable, and selective CO 2 RR electrocatalysts. Atomically dispersed Ni-N-C catalysts have attracted attention due to their superior selectivity for CO generation. 2 Their activity and selectivity towards CO 2 RR are influenced by the metal center and its local coordination environment in Ni-N-C catalysts. 3 Ni-N-C catalysts derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have multiple advantages including a high specific surface area, customizable pore structures, and controllable morphologies, even after the carbonization treatment at high temperatures. In this presentation, we will focus on ZIF-derived Ni-N-C catalysts using a ligand exchange strategy during ZIF synthesis. These ligand-exchanged ZIFs are synthesized by partially replacing 2-methylimidazole (used in ZIF-8 synthesis) with different imidazole-like ligands for the purpose of obtaining structures with increased porosity. The effects of several parameters, including ligand exchange percentage and pyrolysis temperature for synthesizing Ni-N-C catalysts will be evaluated. We will show how the physicochemical characteristics of the Ni-N-C catalyst, i.e., porosity, hydrophobicity, and density of active sites, can be tuned by varying the synthesis parameters. We will focus in particular on the optimization of porosity and accessibility of CO 2 to the catalyst’ active sites to maximize CO 2 RR rate.

Recent rise in the consumption of fossil fuels have raised the levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere causing global warming 1 . Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) to value-added chemicals at low temperature and ambient pressure using green renewable energy sources has emerged as a propitious technology to realize carbon neutrality and mitigate global warming 2 . Supramolecular assembly of noble metal nanoclusters (NMNC) is one of the alluring areas of modern material science. Nanocluster assemblies formed by integrating NMNC using a crosslinking ligand, are reported to be applied in various applications such as nanodevices and as luminescent sensor materials 3 . Silver nanocluster assemblies (Ag-CAM) are composed of regularly crosslinked silver nanoclusters 4 and were evaluated as cathodic electrocatalysts for CO2RR. In this study, we evaluated the reaction selectivity and structural stability of an Ag-CAM ([Ag 12 (StBu) 6 (CF3COO) 6 (2EB) 3 ] n ; Ag 12 -2EB) crosslinked by linker with triple bonds 5 when used as a cathode electrocatalyst (Figure 1). Synthesized Ag-CAMs were supported onto the surface of commercially available gas diffusion electrode (GDE) by spray coating method (Figure 2). The catalyst-loaded electrodes were attached to a self-fabricated GDE flow cell, and electrocatalytic properties were evaluated. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and Pt mesh was taken as the counter electrode for the electrochemical reactions. Single crystal-XRD and powder-XRD were measured to determine the exact crystal structure, while SEM-EDS was used to characterize the electrode surface to determine the structural stability. We used gas chromatography (GC) and 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to calculate the reaction selectivity and quantify the product concentration. The CO2RR products in outlet gas streams from the gas chamber and electrolytes from the catholyte room were analyzed using GC and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. For silver nanocluster assembly cross-linked with 4,4`-bipyridine ([Ag 12 (StBu) 8 (CF3COO) 4 (BPY) 4 ] n ; Ag 12 -BPY) most of the constituent elements of the aggregate (S, N, F, etc.) were eluted out after performing the electrochemical (EC) reactions up to a voltage of 3.2V. The catalyst structure underwent significant transformations and was confirmed by SEM-EDS analysis with samples before and after EC analysis. However, in EC experiments using Ag 12 -2EB as the cathode electrocatalyst, the structural decompositions were suppressed and the electrocatalyst could withstand long-term use. Figure 3 shows the Faraday selectivity (%) of CO2RR products against the applied potential for Ag 12 -2EB/GDE in 0.1M KHCO3. Carbon monoxide (CO) was the main product obtained from electrochemical CO 2 RR of Ag 12 -2EB and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) could be suppressed when the applied potential was shifted to the negative side. Additionally, regarding the reaction selectivity, it was found that the selectivity was approximately the same regardless of the structure of the crosslinking agent. Knowledge obtained from this study will help to bridge the gap for utilizing Ag-CAMs as novel cathode catalyst materials for electrochemical CO 2 RR experiments. References (1) Liu, Y. Y., Huang, J.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to highly value‐added C2+ fuels or chemicals is a promising pathway to address environment issues and energy crisis. In the periodic table, Cu as only the candidate can convert CO2 to C2+ products such as C2H4 and C2H5OH due to the suitable absorption energy to reaction intermediate. Application of Cu is limited for its low activity and poor selectivity. The tandem catalytic strategy can effectively solve the problems caused by single copper catalyst. In tandem catalysis, how to promote the formation, transport, adsorption and coupling of the important intermediate CO is the key issue to improve the selectivity of C2+ products. Regulating structure of Cu‐based bimetallic can effectively promote processes to Electrochemical CO2RR on account of its synergistic effect, electronic effect. In this review, we systematically summarized the relationship between structure of Cu‐based bimetallic catalysts with performance of electrochemical CO2RR. More importantly, we reveal that different Cu‐based bimetallic structures enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts by regulating the processes such as the transport and adsorption of reaction intermediate CO. We proposed well‐effective strategies to rationally design Cu‐based metallic catalysts. We put forward some challenges and opportunities that Cu‐based bimetallic catalysts in future.

We report on the growth and photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization of single crystal, epitaxial zinc telluride (ZnTe) thin film photocathodes. ZnTe is a II-VI semiconductor that has promising photocathode characteristics, including its suitable band gap alignments to CO 2 reduction potentials, chemical stability, strong p-type character, and is theorized to have surface sites suitable for CO 2 reduction. To gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental charge transport of the reactivity mechanism for ZnTe, we utilized molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow single crystal thin film photocathodes. This work focuses largely on the synthesis and characterization of degenerately-doped ZnTe films on three different gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate orientations: (100), (110), and (111)A. ZnTe thin films with a thickness of 300 nm, grown in the temperature range of 340–360ºC, were doped with nitrogen via an in situ RF plasma source and characterized by RHEED, XRD, AFM, and Hall effect measurements. The epitaxial films exhibited p-type characteristics with doping concentrations of 10 18 to 10 20 cm -3 . Photoelectrochemical stability and catalytic selectivity of the ZnTe photocathodes were investigated in a three-electrode compression cell in a CO 2 -saturated electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO 3 ). Utilizing degenerately doped (100) ZnTe, we have demonstrated high (60%) selectivity for CO 2 reduction to CO in the absence of cocatalysts. Overall, we showed the correlation between the CO 2 R selectivity and ZnTe orientation and this work can be leveraged for developing catalyst-free tandem ZnTe-based photocathodes for carbon dioxide reduction.

The electrochemical co-reduction of nitrate (NO 3 - ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) for the synthesis of urea has drawn much research focus recently because it creates value-added products from environmentally hazardous pollutants. Urea is the major ingredient of fertilizer, that is currently produced through the Bosch-Meiser process starting from ammonia (NH 3 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), in which ammonia is produced through the Haber-Bosch process, leading to significantly high energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. Urea electrosynthesis is a complex 16e - , 12H + transfer reaction with multiple possible by-products such as H 2 , CO, HCOOH, NO 2 - , NH 3 , etc., making the electrocatalyst design toward urea selectivity a big challenge. To reliably quantify the urea produced, we present an updated method for urea quantification using the diacetylmonoxime-thiosemicarbazide (DAMO-TSC) method while excluding the interference of NO 2 - by-product. We believe this method can guide the electrocatalysis community to establish an updated protocol and avoid false positive/overestimating results. We will then present a catalyst designed for urea electrosynthesis consisting of Pd nanoparticles in nanoscale proximity to atomically dispersed Fe-N x sites on a carbon matrix (FeNC). Our group has previously presented Pd nanoparticles and FeNC materials as efficient catalysts for CO 2 and NO 3 - reduction respectively. Their association at the nanoscale demonstrates over 20% urea faradaic efficiency at -0.5 V (vs RHE) with 100% N-selectivity (All by-products contain nitrogen). These very promising results provide us with the baseline to elucidate the role of individual active sites on the C-N coupling mechanism. To this effect, reaction intermediates of CO 2 and NO 3 - co-reduction are investigated by in-situ vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, infrared). This study validates the approach of tuning electrocatalysts through mechanistic studies realizing CO 2 / NO 3 - co-reduction.

CO 2 reduction is an important step in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The utilization of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) realizes high current density CO 2 reduction. However, most of the developed CO 2 reduction catalysts suffer from low Faradaic efficiency when using a proton exchange membrane MEA, due to low local pH surrounding catalysts. Alternatively, with an anion exchange membrane MEA, CO 2 reduction suffers from low conversion efficiency due to carbonate-bicarbonate crossover through the membrane to the anode. For continuously-running CO 2 electrolyzers, the crossover of acids and cations results in low reduction efficiency and flooding of the GDE. We have designed and characterized an asymmetric membrane that prohibits carbonate-bicarbonate crossover, yet can maintain a high local pH surrounding the catalyst. The resulting MEA can achieve high Faradaic efficiency toward CO 2 reduction using developed catalysts with near-zero CO 2 crossover. When using oxygen evolution in the anode, we further developed an ion-blockage strategy to diminish the crossover of acids or cations during long-term operation, maintaining a relatively stable and suitable environment for CO 2 reduction on GDE. The crossover management of carbonate, bicarbonate, protons and cations can lead to a long lifetime high-efficiency CO 2 electrolyzer.

Introduction In recent years, non-metallic catalysts with high efficiency for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction have been reported and have attracted much attention. We have synthesized Ketjenblack ® catalysts co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur by hydrothermal treatment of Ketjenblack and demonstrated their capability for the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. In this study, sulfur mono-doped Ketjenblack (S-KB) catalyst and nitrogen mono-doped Ketjenblack (N-KB) catalysts were synthesized and the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction activity for the catalysts was evaluated using a fuel cell-type electrolytic cell. The S-KB catalyst was obtained by the hydrothermal treatment of Ketjenblack with ammonium sulfide, while the N-KB catalyst was prepared by heat treatment of Ketjenblack in a tube furnace under an ammonia atmosphere. Experimental Catalyst synthesis: 300 mg of Ketjenblack ® (ECP600JD, LION) (KB) was mixed with 10 mL of 0.01 M sodium hydroxide solution, 10 mL of 2-propanol, 10 mL of ammonium sulfide solution (5.0~6.0 wt% as S) and 15 mL of Milli-Q ® water. The mixture was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave vessel (TAF-SR300-SV, Taiatsu Techno Corp.) at 170°C. The product was ground in an agate mortar for about 3 min to obtain the S-doped catalyst (abbreviated as S-KB_processed time). Ketjenblack was heat-treated in a tube furnace under ammonia atmosphere for 60 min, quenched, and ground in an agate mortar for 3 min to obtain N-doped catalyst (abbreviated as N-KB_processed Temp. (℃)). Characterization was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PHI X Tool, ULVAC-PHI). Evaluation of CO 2 reduction: To prepare catalyst inks, each prepared catalyst was mixed with 2-propanol, a 5 wt% Nafion ® 2-propanol solution, Milli-Q water and zirconia balls, followed by shaking. The ink was then sprayed onto hydrophobic-treated carbon paper (TGP-H-060, Toray) at 1 mg cm −2 . For the counter electrode, 38.1 wt% Pt/C (ISHIFUKU Metal Co., Ltd.) was sprayed onto carbon paper (without hydrophobic treatment) with 7 mm diameter holes (9.5 holes cm −2 ) at 1 mg cm −2 . The carbon paper was hot-pressed onto a Nafion ® membrane (NR-212, Dupont) at 135°C to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The MEA was integrated into a fuel cell-type electrolysis cell, as shown in Fig. 1(a), with the working electrode side filled with 1 atm CO 2 , while the counter electrode side compartment was filled with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6). A tube-type RHE was used as a reference electrode (1). The electrolysis was performed at a constant potential of -1.0 V vs. RHE, and the qualitative determination of the products was performed by gas chromatographs (GC-8A, SHIMADZU) equipped with TCD and FID detectors. Results and discussion Heat treatment in a tubular furnace under ammonia flow resulted in the highest percentage of pyrrole-type nitrogen in N-KB_600 and pyridine-type nitrogen in N-KB_700. In S-KB_8h, sulfide-type was the most abundant. The carbon monoxide production rates of both sulfur-doped and nitrogen-doped catalysts were faster than those of pristine KB, suggesting their enhanced carbon dioxide reduction ability (Fig. 1(b)).

In this chapter, photocatalytic systems for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using metal complexes are discussed. To construct efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems, two functions, i.e., redox photosensitizer and catalyst, are required. Metal complexes displaying visible-light absorption and long lifetimes in the excited states might be suitable for redox photosensitizers and redox-active metal complexes having a labile ligand forming a vacant site to activate CO2 can possibly be used as catalysts. Simple mixed systems of them photocatalyze the reduction of CO2. In addition, supramolecular photocatalysts in which they are linked via covalent bonds are also introduced.

This study is dedicated to the development of a two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive designed to optimize the metal joining process to achieve environmental goals, simplify operational steps, and reduce manufacturing costs. Conventional metal joining methods, such as soldering and chemical plating, are not only cumbersome and energy-consuming in terms of steps, but also cause serious environmental problems, including high carbon emissions and the generation of hazardous plating wastewater, which is costly to treat. The two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive proposed in this study is intended to replace these conventional techniques and solve the above problems through a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective bonding method. This innovative bonding technology not only reduces the environmental impact, reduces the process flow of metal joining, and lowers the production cost. First, the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive used in this experiment was cured by room temperature curing. Adhesive refers to the substance that can realize the connecting effect of materials, also known as adhesive or bonding agent. After the adhesive is applied to the surface of the substrate, a certain curing process is required to achieve the bonding of the substrate. This process involves a chemical reaction that hardens the adhesive and forms a strong bond between the two surfaces. In this study, we performed cure time and thickness measurements using a two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive. two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive was able to cure in 45 minutes at 40°C. We measured the thickness of the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive and the results showed an average thickness of 25 µm. This data provides an important reference for this experiment. In Figure 1, a tensile test of a metal sheet is shown. The results show that the metal sheet coated with the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive had a tension of 208 N in the tensile test. This demonstrates the excellent torsional properties of the adhesive in bonding technology., including significant shear strength. Next, a thermal conductivity test was conducted. After keeping the heating plate at 100°C, the metal sheet shown in Figure 2, coated with a two-component copper-metal adhesive, was placed in a 100°C temperature environment for 5 minutes. The test results showed that the temperature of the sheet metal remained at 32°C. This may be due to the adhesive being applied to the metal sheet. This may be due to the excellent thermal conductivity of the adhesive, which can quickly transfer heat from the surface of the sheet metal to the surrounding environment so that the temperature of the surface of the sheet metal is consistent with that of the surrounding environment. In addition, the two-liquid copper-metal adhesive for heat transfer coefficient has been verified by a third party (TECHMAX TECHNICAL CO., LTD) with a thermal conductivity of 87W/mK. This result further confirms the excellent performance of the adhesive in terms of thermal conductivity. This result further validates the excellent performance of the adhesive in terms of thermal conductivity. Finally, the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive was applied to the AI server for adhesion testing. First, the hot plate was heated to 100°C and then the server was left to stand for 10 minutes. During this period, the temperature of the server shown in Figure 3 increased from the initial 33°C to 38°C and remained stable for the next 10 minutes. This process demonstrated the excellent thermal conductivity of the two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive used. Eliminates the need to heat the process to cure the adhesive and significantly reduces carbon emissions. The two-liquid spherical copper-based adhesive used in this experiment formed a strong bond after natural curing on the bonded surface, and at the same time had excellent heat resistance, high viscosity, and abrasion resistance. Excellent heat dissipation characteristics can be utilized in high power consumption component-to-component adhesives. This type of adhesive is not only excellent in terms of bond strength but also plays an important role in various industrial applications. Figure 1

The direct CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) from simulated flue gas of various CO2 concentrations could minimize extra energy for pre‐concentration processes to highly concentrated CO2 as a feed­stock. We investigate the challenges for CO2RR caused by low CO2 concentrations and provide strategies concerning the impact of the chosen electrocatalyst material and the selection of the electrolyte to attain high CO selectivity. We continuously feed CO2 mixed with N2 (the typical dilutant in flue gas) in various ratios to gas diffusion electrodes in a model flow‐through electrolyzer. Operating the CO2RR at lower CO2 concentrations results in an overpotential shift to more cathodic values. We show that higher active catalysts can maintain high CO selectivity down to 5% CO2 by using Ag‐ and NiCu‐based catalysts. NiCu reached its limit when the CO2 concentration was lowered to 2%, due to low CO2 availability and competition of carbonate formation. Employing near‐neutral electrolytes with buffering capacity, we maintained high Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials and higher CO2 utilization at low CO2 concentration.

The proceeding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires the formation of active hydrogen species for CO2 protonation, while traditional catalysts fail to balance the rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. Herein, we propose a “hydrogen on demand” mechanism, in which the polarity of the adsorbed CO2 is enhanced to allow the capture of hydrogen from water without forming free hydrogen species, realizing the matching rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. As a proof of concept, we construct Zn–N sites modified by Se atoms, allowing the proceeding of CO2RR under the “hydrogen on demand” mechanism with superior efficiency. The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of −539.7 mA cm−2, faradaic efficiencies of CO > 90% over a broad window from −0.5 to −1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6 × 104 h−1 in flow cell. In‐situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO2− with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.

Since the Industrial Revolution, massive amounts of generated from human industrial activities have been causing ongoing climate change and environmental impacts on Earth. Hence, there is a substantial body of research aimed at mitigating CO 2 emissions to address climate change. Research on CO 2 reduction has been actively conducted, focusing on electrochemical-based CO 2 conversion capable of operating under high current and long-term conditions. Under high current and prolonged operation, catalyst are influenced by the concentration of CO 2 within the catalytic layer. To investigate the impact of CO 2 concentration, we fabricated reaction zones of flow plates used in zero-gap MEA electrolyzers in both flat and sunken shapes. The two flow plates feature an inlet with a channel to guide the incoming gas to the reaction zone and a channel within the reaction zone to distribute the gas effectively. Both the flat and sunken type feature. Both the flat and sunken shapes contain a reaction zone channel where the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is positioned at the top. However, In the sunken flow plate, gas introduced from the inlet can penetrate towards the GDL side, facilitating enhanced delivery of CO 2 to the catalytic layer compared to flat flow plates. This leads to increased CO 2 activity within the catalytic layer and, simultaneously, offers the advantage of easier water management, a major cause of equipment performance degradation. In this study, we confirm through simulation that the sunken shape in flow plates with serpentine channels in the reaction zone offers advantages in CO 2 activity. Experimentally, we obtained partial current densities of 861 mA/cm 2 and 1 A/cm 2 for silver catalyst and NiNC catalyst, respectively, in the sunken serpentine structure. To analyze the reasons for the increase in these values, which are 34.5% and 18.3% higher respectively compared to the flat serpentine structure, we conducted device water discharge experiments and real-time CT imaging. Through this, we confirmed that water management is more efficient in the sunken serpentine structure. The insights and methods presented in this research are crucial for developing design principles suitable for large-scale industrial electrochemical CO 2 electrolysis. Figure 1

With the extensive use of fossil fuels and CO2 emission, the development of effective electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into high‐value‐added chemical products has become an important issue in academia community. Single‐atom alloys (SAA) integrate the advantages of single‐atoms catalysts and alloys, which can improve the activity and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) by adjusting the electronic and geometric structure of the host and guest metals simultaneously. This article provides a comprehensive review on the research advances of SAA catalysts used for CO2RR, including the synthesis and characterizations, computational design, experimental performances, and electronic structure effects of different SAA. Specifically, the correlations between experimental results and theoretical studies have been highlighted and discussed clearly in this review, which provide unique fundamental insights on the CO2RR performances of SAA catalysts. Based on these understanding, we finally propose a workflow combining both computational and experimental methods to rationally design the SAA, which can help the further development of CO2RR catalysts in the future.

Operando analysis is crucial for understanding the selectivity and stability of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Existing operando techniques normally adapt single-compartment cells operating at low currents. However, high current densities on the order of 100 mA cm-2 are required for practical applications, and under these conditions, selectivity and reaction pathways can differ. Here, we developed an inline operando NMR method compatible with high-current reaction conditions. Demonstrating on a copper-catalyzed eCO2RR at a current of 100 mA cm-2, our NMR study revealed a fast decrease of Faradaic efficiency for formate and ethanol within the first few hours of reaction, accompanied by a pH decrease from 14 to 8 within the first hour and a continuous concentration increase of bicarbonate. At 200 mA cm-2, the bicarbonate concentration reached the saturation point of 3.34 M within five hours. Water crossover was simultaneously observed and quantified via a deuteration technique and showed a strong current dependency. Our NMR observations revealed a highly dynamic environment of copper-catalyzed eCO2RR at high currents and will further aid the design and optimization of this reaction. Using on a common flow cell and a benchtop NMR system, the new operando approach is accessible by non-NMR experts and readily applicable to a wide range of catalysts, electrolyte compositions and reactor designs for eCO2RR.

The catalytic efficiency of M‐H2tpda pincer complexes (M = Mn(I), Fe(II), Co(III)) in CO2 hydrogenation, emphasizing the role of transition metal center variability have been discussed. The DFT analysis demonstrates that complexes with low αR values form weaker M—H bonds, enhancing catalyst reactivity with the elongation of M—H bond. The analysis further displays excellent catalytic performance for Mn‐H2tpda (ΔE = 20.3 kcal/mol), Fe‐H2tpda (ΔE = 21.0 kcal/mol) and Co‐H2tpda (ΔE = 23.6 kcal/mol) for CO2 to formic acid formation. The Co‐H2tpda (ΔE = 16.7 kcal/mol) is comparatively better than Mn‐H2tpda (ΔE = 20.7 kcal/mol) and Fe‐H2tpda (ΔE = 19.6 kcal/mol) in formaldehyde formation. All three catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the conversion of formaldehyde to methanol. The condensed Fukui function calculations of these catalyst complexes establish direct relationship between the ΔE for the rate limiting catalytic cycle and the electrophilicity of the metal centers. The TOF calculations further helped to understand the catalytic performance of the catalysts at various temperatures.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect, and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by about 50% since the Industrial Revolution. The signs of global warming are everywhere, and solving this problem requires analyzing the trend of CO2 concentration and its impact on global temperature. This report will establish mathematical models to verify the accuracy of CO2 concentration and analyze the feasibility of new models. At the same time, two models will be constructed to explore the relationship between global temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration and predict future trends. The results showed that the trend of carbon dioxide concentration is constantly increasing, whereas the trend of land-ocean temperature appears to be periodic. Pearson correlation analysis found that carbon dioxide was linearly correlated with temperature height, and linear regression further visualized this relationship. The forecast data show that carbon reduction needs to be taken seriously, or the consequences are serious, and both individuals and governments should take measures.

Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential across all sectors, including the maritime transport industry. Speed reduction is a key short-term operational measure for lowering GHG emissions from ships, and its implementation has already begun. While speed reduction offers significant benefits, particularly in terms of GHG emissions reduction potential, there are concerns about its application, including increased voyage times, an increase in the number of ships required, and the fact that ships may operate in conditions quite different from those for which they were designed and optimized. This study investigates the impact of speed reduction on ship performance in calm water, using a post-Panamax container ship as an example. Numerical simulations of resistance, open-water, and self-propulsion tests were conducted for a full-scale ship and propeller, and the results were validated against extrapolated towing tank data. Hydrodynamic characteristics, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions at various speeds were then estimated. The results indicated that when constant transport work was maintained, yearly CO2 emissions decreased by −16.89% with a 10% speed reduction, −21.97% with a 20% speed reduction, and −25.74% with a 30% speed reduction. This study demonstrates that the classical cubic law for fuel oil consumption and speed dependence is not valid, as the speed exponent is lower than 3. The potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing slow steaming are discussed. Finally, this research contributes to the existing literature by evaluating the CO2 emissions reduction potential of slow steaming.

An advanced photochemical reduction system involving the UV/Fe(III)–oxalate system was developed for the reduction of nitrate (NO3−) to harmless N-gaseous species, primarily nitrogen (N2), by carbon dioxide radical (·CO2−) generated in the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses confirmed the presence of both ·CO2− and ·OH radicals. Systematic investigations were conducted on various operational parameters, such as the initial Fe(III) concentration, oxalate concentration, and pH levels, to assess their impacts on the efficiency and products of NO3− reduction. Notably, solution pH played a significant role in influencing the NO3− reduction efficiency and the final products. At pH 2, approximately 75% of NO3− was converted into N2 with an 80% selectivity. In the pH range of 3 to 5, a remarkable NO3− removal rate of about 90% was achieved. Furthermore, higher concentrations of Fe(III) (2 mM) and oxalate (10 mM) were found to enhance NO3− removal to 91.95% and 88.71%, respectively. The presence of DO increased the oxidative potential in the reaction system, subsequently enhancing the selectivity conversion of NO3− to N2. In summary, the UV/Fe(III)–oxalate system exhibits significant potential for effective removal of NO3− while achieving high selectivity for the production of N2 in water remediation applications.

Commencing nearly a decade ago, the scientific literature has shown that changes in the concentration of water vapor, a greenhouse gas with a heating power 400 times greater than carbon dioxide, CO2, closely match changes in the average global temperature. The foregoing notwithstanding, while there is no correlation between changes in the average global temperature and changes in the concentration of CO2; still a large community of interests including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), academia, agencies of government, various research institutions and enterprises, tens of thousands of scientists, public officials and policy makers which have worked for over three decades without proof, continue to assert that it is the increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2 that drives global warming. Thus, the myopic focus of this de-carbon community remains reducing carbon emissions. This is a major problem, because, while the data and the physics have clearly shown that when the global concentration of water vapor is reduced, the result is global cooling and reductions in catastrophic weather. and these relationships have not been discussed in the preeminent scientific literature. As a direct consequence, no steps to drive increased precipitation to reduce the concentration of water vapor have been undertaken. As each year passes, the size of the reduction sufficient to reverse global warming grows, thus, increasing the time necessary to effect this, whichmay take decades as annual devastation from catastrophic weather increases at a rate of $45 bn US every decade. To fight climate change, the policy must change to focus on encouraging the development of effective, efficient and sufficient means of increasing precipitation.

Despite global initiatives to address climate change, the year 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded in history. The need for technologies to lower carbon emissions and to remove already emitted greenhouse gases is immense. There have been massive efforts to electrochemically drive CO 2 conversion to value-added chemicals such as ethylene, ethanol, and acetone using renewable energy.( 1 ) Copper (Cu) is notable for its ability to form high-value C-C bond compounds; however, selectivity and activity challenges remain. Efforts to tackle these issues have focused on catalyst, system and micro-environment developments,( 2 , 3 ) and among the critical factors, temperature plays an important role. Of reports that study temperature effects on CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R), usually the entire system is controlled at the same temperature, including the working electrode, electrolyte, and reference electrode. Further, the range of accessible temperatures is usually limited to a range of 10 – 70°C due to the aqueous electrolyte freezing or evaporating.( 4 , 5 ) This study focuses on the development and demonstration of an electrochemical system for decoupling the temperatures of the CO 2 R cathode and the electrolyte. This allows independent optimization of thermodynamic, mass transport, and kinetic, to improve both activity and selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The temperatures are separately controlled from 0 – 140 °C for the working electrode, and from 0 – 70°C for the electrolyte. These temperature gradients result in clearly different activity/selectivity trends compared to when a single temperature controls the entire system. While maintaining electrolyte temperature and current density, a lower cathode temperature favored methane formation, whereas a higher cathode temperature favored CO formation. The Faradaic efficiency of ethylene was maintained at 20% despite the changes in the temperature of the cathode. Furthermore, reducing the working electrode temperature effectively restricted H 2 formation down to 15%. We attributed this selectivity and activity change to the control of adsorption and desorption energies, thermal and chemical processes of CO 2 conversion, and changopanoles in the CO 2 solubility in the electrolyte through density function theory and computational fluid dynamics simulations.( 6 , 7 ) The system and method developed in this study can be translated to understanding the effects of mass transport and kinetics in other emerging electrochemical conversions for accelerating clean energy generation and achieving global sustainability goals References K.

This work presents a novel framework for numerically simulating the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing carbon dioxide (CO2). The framework focuses on efficient solution strategies for the coupled system of fluid flow equations and thermodynamic constraints. A key contribution lies in proposing a new set of equations for phase equilibrium calculations which simplifies the traditional vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations for two-phase CO2 mixtures. The first major novelty resides in the reduction of the conventional four-equation VLE system to a single equation, enabling efficient solution using a non-linear solver. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a second novelty is introduced by deriving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) directly from the UV-Flash equation. This ODE can be integrated alongside the governing fluid flow equations, offering a computationally efficient approach for simulating depressurization processes.

Human activities have caused a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, leading to greater absorption of CO2 by oceans and causing ocean acidification. This phenomenon, marked by a reduction in pH, represents substantial risks to marine ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. Seagrasses are vital elements of coastal ecosystems, performing important functions in carbon storage, stabilizing shorelines, and preserving biodiversity; however, reactions to ocean acidification are not well understood, especially in terms of molecular.This research study examined alterations in gene expression within seagrass meadows, namely the species Cymodocea nodosa, in reaction to simulated ocean acidification conditions. Climate chamber system to adjust CO2 levels to simulate future projections of ocean acidification, specifically following the RCP 8.5 scenario. Gene expression dynamics were assessed by collecting samples at different time intervals across a 36-hour period.Research has demonstrated that genes related to photosynthesis are suppressed quickly after being exposed to increased amounts of CO2. Gene expression levels were found to change often over time, which is crucial for adaptation and acclimatization. However, antioxidant genes have varied responses to ocean acidification, with CAT and SOD being downregulated in distinct ways.Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of seagrass responses to ocean acidification. It highlights the significance of examining short-term responses when evaluating the susceptibility of coastal ecosystems to climate change.

The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) using renewable energies is widely recognized as a promising approach to establishing a sustainable closed carbon cycle economy. To date, the focus of this field has primarily been on the electrolysis of ambient pressure CO 2 , where the critical factors include the limited solubility of CO 2 in many electrolytes and its hindered mass transport to the electrodes. However, industrial CO 2 is typically pressurized during capture, transport, and storage, often existing in dissolved form. Herein, we shift our focus to the potential applications of supercritical CO 2 (SCO 2 ) obtained from industrial storage. By using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations integrated with the slow-growth sampling (SG-AIMD) method, we conducted a systematic investigation into the supercritical CO 2 reduction reaction (SCO 2 RR) on various Cu surfaces. Our findings reveal that Cu(111) favors CO* generation, while Cu(100) promotes formic acid production under the reaction conditions of SCO 2 R. In the meantime, we present a comprehensive free energy diagram incorporating both kinetics and thermodynamics of SCO 2 and Cu atom migration, which illustrates the critical role of Cu sites with high coordination numbers induced by intermediate adsorption in the overall performance of CO 2 electroreduction into formic acid. This study would lay the foundation for potential applications of supercritical CO2 and the designing of effective catalysts in the future.

An attractive concept in the chemical manufacturing industry is the adoption of a circular carbon economy, which can include continuous capture and conversion of CO 2 into industrially relevant chemical feedstocks. This has driven considerable research interest in electrochemical CO 2 reduction. 1 Despite this popularity, major challenges remain even for the most advanced CO 2 reduction reactors, including low conversion rates and energy efficiencies; moreover, in many cases, multiple carbon-containing products are generated, which add to costs for downstream separation. 2 By contrast, thermochemical CO 2 hydrogenation is well established and typically demonstrates higher energy efficiency and selectivity compared to electrochemical CO 2 reduction. 3,4 This notable contrast drives our interest in better understanding the physics that governs differences in reactivity between thermocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactors. To address these questions, we are pursuing a unique approach that involves feeding humidified CO 2 and H 2 , respectively, to the cathode and anode of an electrochemical membrane-electrode assembly (MEA). This presentation will cover initial work we have undertaken to design and validate this reactor for the study CO 2 electro-reduction. The overall design of our reactor resembles a hydrogen fuel cell fed with humidified H 2 and CO 2 . Thus, it was initially benchmarked through operation as an electrochemical hydrogen pump, wherein humidified Ar was fed to the cathode and humidified H 2 was fed to the anode with Pt/C as the catalyst on each side of the membrane. Under these conditions, a cation exchange membrane (CEM) readily generated current densities in excess of 1 A/cm 2 with monotonic decreases in polarization with increased temperature at fixed current. We then undertook analogous hydrogen pumping experiments using anion exchange membranes (AEM) that had been ion-exchanged with hydroxide, carbonate, and bicarbonate anions. We observed net proton transport between the anode and cathode chambers in each case, albeit with higher ionic resistance for AEMs in the bicarbonate form. We then undertook further studies to demonstrate the ability to reduce CO 2 using H 2 fed to the anode. This operating mode eliminates the need for a liquid anode feed, which dramatically reduces the driving force for CO 2 crossover via bicarbonate formation. Moreover, the Pt/C anode catalyst is expected to oxidize hydrogen with minimal polarization, allowing the total cell polarization to be interpreted simply as the cathode potential on the RHE scale. CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out using commercial Cu/C catalyst with online gas chromatography and NMR for product analysis of volatile and condensable products, respectively. Operation with a CEM yielded only H 2 (g) at the cathode, but initial experiments with an AEM in the carbonate/bicarbonate form gave high selectivity to ethanol at 70 o C.

Global warming is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). A metric used to quantify the change in CO2 emissions is the marginal emission factor, defined as the marginal change in CO2 emissions resulting from a marginal change in electricity demand over a specified period. This paper aims to present two methodologies to estimate the marginal emission factor in a decarbonized electricity system with high temporal resolution. First, we present an energy systems model that incrementally calculates the marginal emission factors. Second, we examine a Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model, a statistical model designed to estimate marginal emission factors faster and use an incremental marginal emission factor as a benchmark to assess its precision. For the German electricity market, we estimate the marginal emissions factor time series historically (2019, 2020) using Agora Energiewende and for the future (2025, 2030, and 2040) using estimated energy system data. The results indicate that the Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model is more accurate in estimating marginal emission factors than the Dynamic Linear Regression models, which are frequently used in the literature. Hence, the Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model is a simpler alternative to the computationally intensive incremental marginal emissions factor, especially when short-term marginal emissions factor estimation is needed. The results of the marginal emission factor estimation are applied to an exemplary low-emission vehicle charging scenario to estimate CO2 savings by shifting the charge hours to those corresponding to the lower marginal emissions factor. By implementing this emission-minimized charging approach, an average reduction of 31% in the marginal emission factor was achieved over the 5 years.

Structural transformations in OECD countries significantly influence carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, affecting economic and social dimensions. These transformations encompass changes in industrial composition, technological progress, energy consumption patterns, and policy frameworks. This research investigates the impact of such structural shifts on CO2 emissions across a panel of 38 OECD countries between 2000 and 2021, using panel cointegration techniques to ensure robust analysis. The study confirms the presence of cross-sectional dependence among countries and establishes long-run cointegration relationships. Results from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) models indicate that renewable energy, advancements in information and communication technology, and structural changes significantly reduce CO2 emissions. In contrast, economic growth, reliance on non-renewable energy, and institutional quality are linked to higher emissions. However, estimates derived from Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) and Mean Group Panel (MGP) methods differ from those of FMOLS and DOLS, underscoring potential methodological variances in evaluating these relationships. This study highlights the pivotal role of structural changes in emission reduction strategies, while also emphasizing the importance of methodological choices in policy analysis. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align economic growth with environmental sustainability within OECD countries. Moreover, the research stresses the necessity of incorporating structural changes into long-term climate strategies to ensure their effectiveness. Future studies could expand the analysis by integrating more recent data and exploring non-linear relationships to refine policy recommendations further.

Carbon dioxide is emitted in several industrial processes and contributes to global warming. One of the industries that is considered a significant emitter is metallurgy. Therefore, it is necessary to search for and implement methods to reduce its emissions from metallurgical processes. An alternative option to the use of conventional coke, which is produced solely from fossil coal, is the utilization of bio-coke. The production of bio-coke involves the use of coking coal and the incorporation of biomass-derived substances such as biochar (charcoal). The article presents the results of the research on the influence of the biochar addition on the structural, textural, and technological properties of produced bio-coke. Research on the production and analysis of the properties of the obtained bio-coke aimed at assessing the potential possibilities of applying it in the process of a carbothermal reduction of manganese ore in order to smelt ferroalloys. Studies have shown that biochar addition to the coking blend in an amount of up to 20% allows a bio-coke characterized by properties enabling the mentioned use to be obtained. Bio-coke was characterized by higher CO2 reactivity index (CRI), lower post-reaction strength (CSR), and higher reactivity to synthetic manganese ore than regular metallurgical coke. In the context of industrial applications of bio-coke, it is necessary to verify its production and use on a pilot and industrial scale.

Summary Fluid chemistry in the vadose zone absent of organic life is governed by the interactions between rock mineral surfaces, water, and atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO2] since carbon and its aquatic species control the system pH. Even though the effects of high carbon concentrations in the pore fluids of rocks and soils can be controlled ex-situ, their non-invasive monitoring and control still face difficulty, due to the inaccessibility of pore spaces. We propose monitoring the effect of carbon-rich solutions via their influence on the electrical relaxation behaviour, using the spectral induced polarisation (SIP) method. Generally, the SIP response is determined by the rock’s texture and the chemical composition of the electrical double layer (EDL) forming at the mineral-water interface. The understanding of how the relaxation behaviour of rocks and soils is controlled by pore water salinity and pH and how fast the EDL adapts to changes in pore fluid chemistry, however, is still limited. In this study, we conducted a series of controlled experiments where the diffusion of sodium hydrogencarbonate solution into quartz-rich sandstones was monitored with SIP at high temporal resolution. To identify the underlying relaxation processes, we analyzed the obtained complex conductivity spectra by performing a Debye decomposition, yielding the system’s relaxation-time distribution. Our results show that increasing pH leads to increased imaginary conductivities and systematic shifts in the peak relaxation time of the system. The observed temporal dynamics of the peak relaxation time can be described with a diffusion-type equation. We find that the dynamics are not governed by the permeability or porosity of the rock. In one experiment, salinities high enough to diminish the polarization of the system were reached. This reduction in polarization at peak frequency cannot be explained through simple Stern layer polarization models alone, suggesting that diffusive layer polarization plays an important role with increasing pH. While polarization magnitude reduces significantly, peak spectral position shifts towards larger relaxation times suggesting a reduction in the mobilities of the surface ions. Due to the increased salinity, the double layer thickness decreases, in turn decreasing the relaxation length scale, and lowering the diffuse layers screening effect. This study shows that the SIP method can capture the dynamic changes at the mineral-water interfaces in rocks in response to changing pH over a broad range of salinities, making SIP a promising method for the monitoring of subsurface processes associated with changes in the inorganic carbon concentration of the pore fluid.

A reduction in emissions in transportation is paramount to achieve full compliance with the European Union’s 2050 targets. In this framework, a great boost to the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of internal combustion engines fueled by petroleum-derived fuels can be obtained through the adoption of biomass-derived fuels that can be employed in conventional series production engine vehicles. This paper presents the results of an experimental activity on a two-cylinder turbocharged common rail diesel engine, whose main application is for urban mobility, fueled with renewable fuels: Neste MY Renewable Diesel and Eni HVOlution. Aimed at analyzing the potential employment of renewable fuels as drop-in alternative fuels, the engine performance and emissions were investigated under fixed settings of the injection parameters, in the complete range of the engine speed, at the full pedal position. The comparison with the data from tests in which the engine was fueled with fossil diesel highlighted minimal differences in the performance outcomes, while significant differences were observed in the emissions results. In more detail, there were reduced carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (HVO produced using Ecofining™ technology retained better behavior in relation to HVO produced using the NEXBTL™ technology), advantages in hydrocarbon (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (HVO from NESTE Oil performed better than HVO from ENI), a decrease in the particle mass and number emissions (HVO from Ecofining™ technology was characterized by a lower particle number and court mean diameter in relation to HVO from the NEXBTL™ technology). The results highlight that an optimization of the engine settings based on the specific properties of each fuel could allow us to take full advantage of these fuels in reducing the environmental impact of cars.

Along with mitigation, the effective utilization of waste CO and CO 2 from point sources in combination with renewable electrons has the potential to address climate challenges and change the manufacturing paradigm. Numerous funding offices and governments have set device level goals and reduction targets for CO 2 emissions putting momentum behind and a focus on electrochemical CO/CO 2 reduction. To enable this vision, the identification of limiting phenomena,[1] scalable integration and fabrication methods, and corresponding critical breakthroughs to improve stability (constant operation) and/or durability (dynamic operation), combined with selective and energy efficient operation are necessary. The implementation of gas diffusion electrodes over the last several years has enabled higher current densities and lower cell voltages for electrochemical CO/CO 2 reduction.[2,3] Here, we pull from our experience in the fuel cell space,[4] aiming to serve as a node for the development of cell and electrode architectures that would help the community integrate novel materials (electrocatalysts, membranes, and ionomers) and test devices at scales commensurate with the standards in the fuel cell and electrolysis community (>25 cm 2 ). To this end, we will present limiting phenomena for CO 2 to formate, CO 2 to CO, and CO to various products, focusing on the effects of cathode composition, ionomer binder chemistry[5] and content, electrode fabrication processes[6], device configuration[7], and reactant concentrations.

Between 2013 and 2018, commercial aviation saw a 70% increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, significantly outpacing United Nations projections. This alarming trend is anticipated to continue, with emissions potentially tripling by 2050, driven by economic expansion and an increasing dependence on fossil fuels. In 2022, the aviation industry’s energy consumption reached 12.1 MJ/RTK, with projections forecasting a 2.8 to 3.9-fold increase by 2040. Without a strategic shift towards sustainable alternatives, aviation emissions are expected to reach 2,000 megatons by mid-century, posing a severe threat to global climate stability. This study emphasizes the urgent need for the aviation sector to adopt high-energy, reliable alternative fuels that can mitigate its environmental impact. A comprehensive evaluation and comparison of potential alternative fuels are presented, focusing on their energy densities, production processes, and environmental footprints. The research highlights the potential of these alternatives to meet the industry’s energy demands while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Technological advancements in fuel production and aircraft propulsion are also explored, underscoring their role in achieving meaningful emissions reductions. The study argues that integrating sustainable practices and fostering innovation within the aviation sector are critical for ensuring its long-term sustainability and resilience. By transitioning to alternative fuels and embracing new technologies, the aviation industry can not only address its environmental challenges but also lead the way in global efforts to combat climate change and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) using renewable electricity sources could provide a sustainable solution for generating valuable chemicals, such as formate salt or formic acid. However, an efficient, stable, and scalable electrode generating formate at industrially viable current densities (>100 mA cm–2) is yet to be developed. Sn or In-based catalysts in gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) can efficiently produce formate. However, their long-term durability is limited owing to catalyst deactivation, carbonate deposition, and electrode flooding. Herein, a systematic study of 20 cm2 GDEs with SnO2 and In2O3 catalyst layers is presented in conjunction with various electrode operation strategies (i.e., flow-by vs flow through, dry vs humidified CO2, continuous vs reverse polarity pulse electrolysis). It is demonstrated that the incorporation of CeO2 nanoparticles as a promoter in either SnO2 or In2O3 catalyst layers coupled with intermittent reverse polarity pulse operation dramatically improves the GDE stability during 12 h of tests at 500 mA cm–2 with over 90% formate Faradaic efficiency. Due to its strong oxidizing capacity, CeO2 helps Sn and In regain their valence state of + IV and + III, respectively, which are in situ reduced during CO2RR, as shown by the surface characterization of the electrodes. The effect of the initial particle size of SnO2 and reverse polarity pulse on the catalytic activity, durability, and carbonate salt precipitation in the GDE have also been addressed. Regarding two-phase flow dynamics, the quasi-convective gas flow through the GDE was more beneficial than the gas flow-by mode for enabling stable operation at high current densities (up to 500 mA cm–2). The synergistic approach of catalyst layer engineering coupled with diverse GDE operation modes explored here is promising for the scale-up of efficient and durable reactors for the CO2RR to formate and CO2 redox flow batteries.

Electrocatalysts for several reactions and processes are actively developed and under development by multiple research groups around the globe. These materials include catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction [1], carbon dioxide reduction [2], hydrogen oxidation [3], oxygen evolution [4] and many other classes. While there is a significant interest to these materials both from scientific and industrial point of view a serious question of their scalability and manufacturability had arisen. In this work aspects of materials scale-up through careful design of reactors, mixing conditions, reaction conditions monitoring and CFD modelling will be reported. A case study on the model system of unsupported silver nanoparticles will be discussed. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized on scale with variation of reagents concentration, different types of impellers and RPM. Materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and BET and the data were correlated to the scaleup variables. A CFD model was developed to model nanoparticles formation and was used to guid experimental scaleup effort. Acknowledgements and Statements.

To drive the further development of electrochemical CO 2 reduction technologies, there is an urgent need for highly active catalysts that minimize unwanted side reactions and that also possess a large specific surface area. While nanostructured catalysts typically fulfill the latter requirement, they often use porous carbon supports that improve the nanoparticles’ dispersion but can shift the product selectivity towards undesirable H 2 formation. [1] This challenge could be solved by using unsupported aerogels consisting of interconnected nanodomain networks of highly porous materials such as nano-wires or -particles, which provide a large surface area while minimizing unwanted side reactions. [2] So far, precious metals such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag) have shown remarkable activity and selectivity as CO 2 -reduction catalysts for CO production. [3] However, due to the high cost of such noble metals, improving their mass-specific activity is essential. One strategy to attain this, especially for Au, is to reduce the adsorption energy of the catalyst’s surface towards CO by changing the electronic structure of the d-band through alloying with other metals. In this context, ordered AuCu structures have proven to be promising candidates for improving the CO 2 -to-CO activity and selectivity. [4] With the motivation to combine both of the above approaches (i.e., Au-alloying with Cu and the absence of a C-support), in this study we present an AuCu aerogel with an average domain size of ≈ 7 nm that exhibits an exceptionally high faradaic efficiency of 87 % for CO at -0.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This corresponds to a ≈ 2-fold higher Au-mass-specific partial current density for CO when compared to an equivalent, monometallic Au aerogel. Notably, this enhanced activity and selectivity are achieved by performing a potential cycling procedure prior to the CO 2 reduction potential hold that involves cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 0.1 and 1.7 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV/s until a stable voltammogram is achieved. To investigate the changes in the electronic and structural properties which have happened to the catalyst during this potential cycling, we performed an in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements in the course of these CVs. Chiefly, these spectroelectrochemcial tests were carried out in the same cell used for the assessment of the CO 2 reduction performance, ensuring for the first time that the mass-transport conditions encountered by the catalyst during these XAS measurements are identical to those in the CO 2 -reduction activity and selectivity tests. Figure 1 illustrates the changes observed throughout the potential cycling procedure in the Cu K- and Au L3-absorption edges, whereby the acquired spectra were submitted to a multivariate curve resolution (MCR) analysis. For the Cu K spectra, a total of three components were identified to describe the whole dataset, and it becomes evident that as the number of cycles increases, the copper oxide phase (component 1 in Figs. 1b and 1c) diminishes while a metallic phase (component 2, identified as an AuCu alloy through EXAFS fitting) becomes more prominent. In the case of the Au L3 data, only two components were discerned to describe the dataset, and both of them were identified as distinct AuCu alloy phases through EXAFS fitting. With an increasing number of cycles, component 2 (featuring a higher oxide content than component 1) becomes dominant at positive potentials, suggesting an increasing Au content on the aerogel’s surface as the potential cycling procedure progresses. In summary, in this contribution we present an AuCu aerogel catalyst exhibiting a high activity and selectivity for CO production that is achieved by cyclic voltammetry treatment prior to holding CO 2 reduction potential. The results derived from the in situ XAS measurements on this material indicate that this process effectively removes the copper oxide domains initially present in the catalyst, forming a novel AuCu alloy phase while simultaneously enriching the aerogel’s surface with Au.

Combining spectroscopy with electrochemistry enables the monitoring of changes in bonding, molecular orientation, and chemical composition during electrochemical processes at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) allows a direct in situ monitoring of electrochemical processes occurring at the electrode interface due plasmonic enhancement by surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). 1 Electrochemical ATR-SEIRAS has been used extensively for investigating electrocatalysis 2,3 , characterizing adsorbed species 4 , and detecting reaction intermediates 5 . However, SEIRAS literature has focused on plasmonic metals while the small number of SEIRAS studies reported on graphene surfaces are incompatible with electrochemical experimentation or not considered. Nonetheless, carbon electrodes are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis, sensing, and energy storage 6 , thus probing their surface chemistries are of particular interest. Thus, there is still a need for a convenient substrate for probing graphitic interfaces using electrochemical SEIRAS. In our first study 1 , we expanded the scope of SEIRAS by introducing a robust hybrid graphene on gold (graphene-gold) substrate where we monitored electrografting processes occurring on the graphene/electrolyte interface. The graphene-gold substrate successfully monitored the electrografting of 2,2,6,6-tetremethyl-1-pipperridine N-oxyl (4-amino-TEMPO) and 4-nitrobenzene diazonium (4-NBD) in real-time using SEIRAS and cyclic voltammetry. The graphene-gold substrate is proficient at resolving the spectral responses of the electrografting and redox transformations of the grafted moieties occurring at the graphene interface spectroscopically and electrochemically. We clearly demonstrate highly sensitive SEIRAS in real-time at a graphene interface. This substrate opens a plethora of possibilities for real-time electrochemical ATR-SEIRAS investigations on graphitic interfaces such as catalysis, battery research, and CO 2 capture and conversion, the latter of which our laboratory is exploring using modified electrodes. Electrochemical carbon capture and concentration (eCCC) methods have emerged as a prosing alternative to the current state-of-the-art temperature-pressure swing systems. 7 Redox-active organic (RAO) molecules such as quinones have been reported to reversibly capture and release CO 2. 7 However, they suffer from low solubility in solution. New approaches have explored immobilizing these molecules on electrode interfaces for increased CO 2 adsorption capacities. 11 Our graphene-gold allows a unique opportunity for an in situ mechanistic investigation of the immobilization and carbonization of RAOs. Our current work investigating immobilized aminoanthraquinone and a riboflavin derivative will be presented.

Our research interests aim at establishing structure/property relations leading to rational designs of functionalized materials for efficient electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy conversion and storage. There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To optimize the hydrogenation-type electrocatalytic approach, we have proposed to utilize nanostructured metallic centers (e.g. Pd, Pt or Ru) in a form of highly dispersed and reactive nanoparticles generated within supramolecular network of distinct nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen-coordination complexes. Among important issues are the mutual completion between hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction and specific interactions between coordinating centers and metallic sites. We have also explored the ability of biofilms to form hydro-gel-type aggregates of microorganisms attached to various surfaces including those of carbon electrode materials. Upon incorporation of various noble metal nanostructures and/or conducting polymer ultra-thin films, highly reactive and selective systems toward CO 2 -reduction have been obtained. Another possibility to enhance electroreduction of carbon dioxide is to explore direct transformation of solar energy to chemical energy using transition metal oxide semiconductor materials. We show here that, by intentional and controlled combination of metal oxide semiconductors (titanium (IV) oxide and copper (I) oxide), we have been able to drive effectively photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide mostly to methanol. Application of metal oxides as active matrices in electrocatalysis is particular importance. The hydrous behavior, which favors proton mobility and affects overall reactivity, reflects not only the oxide’s chemical properties but its texture and morphology as well. For example, the mixed WO 3 /ZrO 2 systems are characterized by fast charge (electron, proton) propagation during the system’s redox transitions. By dispersing metallic Cu electrocatalytic nanoparticles over such active WO 3 /ZrO 2 supports, the electrocatalytic activities of the respective systems toward the reduction of carbon dioxide have been enhanced even at decreased loadings in acid media. The fact that WO 3 /ZrO 2 nanostructures are in immediate contact with the metallic catalytic sites leads to the specific interactions (via the surface hydroxyl groups) with the reaction intermediates (e.g. CO adsorbates). Formation of ammonia is one of the most important chemical synthetic processes. Under industrial conditions, ammonia is primarily been synthesized from nitrogen and hydrogen via the Haber-Bosch process which requires pressurizing and heating, despite utilization of catalysts. Consequently, development of low-temperature synthetic methodology is tempting both from the practical and fundamental reasons. An ultimate goal for electrochemistry is to generate NH 3 from N 2 at temperatures lower than 100ºC, atmospheric pressure, and with use of new generation of catalysts. Currently, most of electrochemical approaches to drive N 2 -fixation suffer from slow kinetics due to the difficulty of achieving the appropriate adsorption and activation of dinitrogen molecule leading to cleavage of the strong triple N≡N bond. Our recent studies, clearly demonstrate that coordinatively stabilized iron catalytic sites, e.g. iron-centered heme-type porphyrins or iron phosphide, FeP and Fe 2 P phases, have been found to act as efficient catalysts for the formation of NH 3 in alkaline and semi-neutral media.

In order to close the carbon cycle, the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reaction (CO2RR) using copper as a electrochemical catalyst is gaining much more attention. When considering the social implementation of the technology, the gaseous CO 2 used for the CO2RR should be collected from the atmosphere. However, the gas inevitably contains a number of impurities such as oxygen, NO x and SO x . Among them, the possibility of oxygen contamination is high, and the reactivity of oxygen is higher than that of CO 2 . Therefore, the oxygen would affect the reaction selectivity of CO2RR. To demonstrate the effect of oxygen on the CO2RR, oxygen-contaminated CO 2 gas was used as the feed gas for the system in previous reports. 1,2 For the positive effect of oxygen, the twenty percent of oxygen in the CO 2 gas decreased the overpotential for the CO2RR, thus increasing the reactivity of the reaction. On the other hand, for the negative effect of oxygen, the selectivity for CO2RR was largely decreased with only four percent of oxygen in the gas under high pressure conditions. The discrepancies in the reported results are due to various factors at different scales, such as current density, type of electrode, concentrations of reactants, surface pH, surface orientation of the catalyst, and oxidation number of the surface metal atoms. Among these factors, those related to the surface reactivity of the catalyst have the greatest effect on the reactivity and selectivity for CO2RR. The presence of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, such as O* and OH*, has been demonstrated during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) using Raman spectroscopy. 1 In the present work, 3 we perform first-principles calculations for the CO2RR in the presence of oxygen species (O* or OH*) on the Cu(100) surface to focus on the effect of the adsorption of ORR intermediates (Figure 1a) while excluding macroscale differences, such as surface pH, local concentration of reactants, and other factors. In the results of the calculation, we identified the most stable structure of the Cu(100) surface on which zero to five of one kind of oxygen reduction intermediates were adsorbed. Using the obtained surface, the activation energy for CHO* formation by CO hydrogenation was calculated. In the results, the activation energy was 0.74 eV on the clean Cu(100) surface, increased on the OH*/Cu(100) surface (Figure 1b), and decreased to a maximum of 0.15 eV on the O*/Cu(100) surface (Figure 1c). This is because the initial state of CO hydrogenation was activated by the oxygen atoms adsorbed onto the Cu(100) surface. References (1) He, M.; Li, C.; Zhang, H.; Chang, X.; Chen, J.

There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change, and its conversion into useful carbon-based fuels or chemicals. Numerous homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been proposed to induce the CO 2 reduction and, depending on the reaction conditions various products that include carbon monoxide, oxalate, formate, carboxylic acids, formaldehyde, acetone or methanol, in addition to various hydrocarbons at different ratios. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To produce highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts, the transition-metal-based molecular materials are often considered. It is believed that, during electroreduction, the rate limiting step is the protonation of the adsorbed CO product to form the CHO adsorbate. Because reduction of CO 2 can effectively occur by hydrogenation, to optimize the conventional copper-based electrocatalytic approach, we explore such a model catalytic matrix as nanostructured tungsten oxide nanowires which are capable to undergo partial reduction to hydrogen-rich nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide bronzes. We demonstrate here that following the ntercalation of copper into tungsten(VI)-oxide-nanowires, the resulting electrocatalytic systems exhibits synergistic properties toward electroreduction of carbon dioxide, in addition to other inert inorganic reactants, such as oxygen, nitrates(V), nitrates(III) or bromates(V). In particular, evidence has been provided that hierarchically deposited films (on glassy carbon) of copper(I) oxide decorated with tungsten(VI) oxide nanowires and, subsequently, subjected to electroreduction and voltammetric conditioning to generate hybrid Cu/WO 3 catalyst can be successfully utilized to drive reduction of carbon dioxide (saturated solution, concentration, ca. 0.033 mol dm -3 )in a fairly strong acid medium of 0.5 mol dm -3 H 2 SO 4 . Here formation of the partially reduced tungsten oxides (H x WO 3 and WO 3-y ) is accompanied by consumption of protons and sorption of hydrogen, and it tends to inhibit hydrogen evolution by shifting the proton discharge toward more negative potentials. Our observations are consistent with the view that copper is irreversibly trapped (i.e., it cannot be reoxidized) within the network of WO 3 nanowires. The dispersed metallic copper sites seem to facilitate electron transfers and charge distribution in the catalytic layers. Among important issues are the capacity of copper-containing partially reduced tungsten oxides to induce reductions of nitrates, bromates and oxygen in acid medium. On mechanistic grounds, the existence of hydrogen-rich partially-reduced tungsten oxides, H x WO 3 , which contain large population of delocalized electrons and monoatomic H, or coexisting protons and electrons, H + + e - , is likely to induce hydrogenation of carbon oxo species, followed by protonation, in the vicinity of Cu to form oxo-hydrocarbon-type products. The hybrid Cu/WO 3 system, is also characterized by improved durability, relative to pristine Cu 2 O-dervied copper, as evident from electroreductions under chronoamperometric conditions. Our research aiming at optimization the material’s activity and selectivity have also concentrated on application of mixed oxides, e.g. WO 3 -ZrO 2 . Finally, the present study demonstrates the usefulness of certain diagnostic electroanalytical approaches, such as ultramicroelectrode-based sensing,chronocoulometric probing of the diffusional-type charge propagation dynamics , or voltammetric stripping and monitoring of small organic or inorganic molecules as electroreduction products.

Background Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects a significant portion of the female population, negatively impacting quality of life. New therapeutic approaches, such as the combination of laser therapy and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), are being explored as potential treatments to enhance sexual function in affected women. Methods This original study involved 23 women aged 37 to 72, all diagnosed with varying degrees of FSD (mild, moderate, severe). The participants underwent a pre-treatment evaluation using a custom-designed Likert scale (Female Sexual Health Questionnaire) designed by the authors to evaluate the symptoms of the patients. The treatment involved a single session combining hybrid carbon dioxide 10600 nm and 1540 nm laser therapy with PRP applied to the genital area. One month post-treatment, participants were reassessed using the same questionnaire. Results Of the 23 patients studied, 65.2% (15 patients) exhibited hypoactive sexual desire, and 73.33% of them (11 out of 15) demonstrated improvement post-treatment (P = 0.00048). Overall sexual satisfaction increased by 28.2% (P = 0.0032), and lubrication improved in 54.5% of patients (P = 0.0027). Significant reductions in dyspareunia were observed, with 80% of patients experiencing pain relief (P = 0.0035). Patients with moderate dysfunction showed the highest response, with 100% (6 out of 6) demonstrating improvement across domains (P = 0.0009). Postmenopausal women experienced a 30.9% improvement in sexual function (P = 0.007), while premenopausal women exhibited a 7.5% improvement (P = 0.04). Statistically significant changes were also noted in the frequency of orgasm (P = 0.0058) and genital sensitivity in patients with moderate dysfunction. Conclusion Our data indicated significant improvements in FSD, particularly in moderate to severe dysfunction, with positive changes in key aspects of sexual function such as lubrication, desire, and ease of orgasm. However, the limited number of participants and short follow-up in this pilot study highlight the need for further investigation into hybrid CO2/1540 nm laser therapy combined with PRP as a therapeutic option for female sexual dysfunction.

National carbon peak track and optimized provincial carbon allocations are crucial for mitigating regional inequality within the commercial building sector during China's transition to carbon neutrality. This study proposes a top-down model to evaluate carbon trajectories in operational commercial buildings up to 2060. Through Monte Carlo simulation, scenario analysis is conducted to assess carbon peak values and the corresponding peaking year, thereby optimizing carbon allocation schemes both nationwide and provincially. The results reveal that (1) the nationwide carbon peak for commercial building operations is projected to reach 890 (+- 50) megatons of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) by 2028 (+- 3.7 years) in the case of the business-as-usual scenario, with a 7.87% probability of achieving the carbon peak under the decarbonization scenario. (2) Significant disparities will exist among provinces, with Shandong's carbon peak projected at 69.6 (+- 4.0) MtCO2 by 2029, approximately 11 times higher than Ningxia's peak of 6.0 (+- 0.3) MtCO2 by 2027. (3) Guided by the principle of maximizing the emission reduction potential, the optimal provincial allocation scheme reveals the top three provinces requiring the most significant reductions in the commercial sector: Xinjiang (5.6 MtCO2), Shandong (4.8 MtCO2), and Henan (4.7 MtCO2). Overall, this study offers optimized provincial carbon allocation strategies within the commercial building sector in China via dynamic scenario simulations, with the goal of hitting the carbon peak target and progressing toward a low-carbon future for the building sector.

The objective of this study is to investigate the temporal variation of forest cover and carbon stock change within the Middle Awash River Basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the years 1995, 2010, and 2023. The study utilized multi-temporal Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine cloud API platform and employed the Random Forest Algorithm for LULC classification. The above-ground carbon stock in the present study was computed from total forest cover of the basin. The results indicate a significant decline in forest cover within the Basin, which decreased from 1,521.88 km&sup2; in 1995 to 1,174.10 km&sup2; in 2010 and further to 825.20 km&sup2; by 2023. Alongside this reduction, total wood volume and dry matter biomass also experienced declines, with wood volume falling from 876.28 m&sup3; to 676.03 m&sup3;, and then to 475.14 m&sup3;, while dry matter biomass decreased from 376.80 tons to 290.69 tons, and finally to 204.31 tons. These trends highlight a troubling reduction in carbon stock and an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Overall, the gradual decline in carbon stocks and the loss of forest cover within the basin highlight the urgent need to implement effective conservation strategies aimed at restoring and safeguarding the remaining forest ecosystems.

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction is one of the most promising processes for a sustainable closure of the artificial carbon cycle. A severe limitation for wide-scale industrial applicability has been the absence of an efficient and selective electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO 2 to higher-reduced valuable chemicals and fuels. Cu is the only catalyst found to produce considerable amount of multicarbon products, albeit at high overpotentials. The mechanism of the conversion process is unclear, with different active sites and rate-determining steps being proposed. In addition, the mass transport of CO 2 has been suggested to have a significant impact on the product selectivity 1,2 . Gas-diffusion-layer(GDL)-based electrolyzers have become a state-of-the-art solution to provide a high concentration of CO 2 to the active sites to circumvent these mass transport limitations. In this work, we present a new multi-scale model based on first-principles kinetics 3 , and a modification of a recently reported gas diffusion electrode model 4 . We use this to generate a digital twin of experimental electrode systems and show that even in GDL systems, mass transport is the limiting factor governing all experimentally observed trends in product selectivity, irrespective of reaction mechanism or product pathway. We further find indications of C 2 products being predominantly formed in wider, accessible pores, while C 1 products are generated in deeper and thinner pores with less access to CO 2 . This work provides strong evidence for the importance of mass transport in designing CO 2 electrolyzers. References: Watkins, N. B. et al.

As the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly visible, carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) is gaining popularity to convert waste carbon dioxide to value-added products. As carbon monoxide (CO) is a key intermediate for valuable products such as methane and ethylene, CORR is studied to bypass CO 2 activation. Most of the work on CO2RR and CORR has focused on using water as a proton source as water’s hydrogen bonding supports key intermediates and acts as a proton source for hydrogenated products. Using nonaqueous solvents instead of water decreases the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water breakdown. Additionally mixed aqueous-nonaqueous systems allow for fundamental understanding of water’s role in electrochemical transformations when it is only available in limited quantities as a proton source. Here, we experimentally control water speciation and activity using aprotic solvent media during CORR. Remarkably, we show that aprotic solvents that support microheterogeneous water-water clusters leads to significant amounts of CORR products (methane and ethylene) with a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 22% in acetonitrile (χ H2O = 0.2); the first report of CORR to C2+ products using water in an aprotic solvent. In contrast, microhomogeneous systems – where water integrates into the solvents’ intermolecular binding network at all length scales and has lower water activity – primarily support undesired HER. Insights gained expand our understanding of water activity and nonaqueous electrolyte design for other important transformations reactions beyond CO reduction such as CO2RR and HER.

Abstract Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by skeletal muscle hypermetabolism following exposure to halogenated anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine. The sustained muscle contraction produces a depletion of adenosine triphosphate, dramatically increasing oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and heat. We present the rare case report of MH diagnosed intraoperatively posted for an open reduction and internal fixation surgery of the right mid-shaft of femur fracture. Unfortunately, the patient developed MH and succumbed. In every hospital set-up where MH-triggering anesthetics are administered, an adequate stock of dantrolene and other medications and rescue equipment must be available to treat the MH crisis.

CCUS (Carbon dioxide Capture, Utilization and Storage), is attracting attention as an effective method for reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions toward carbon neutrality by 2050. Currently, chemical absorption followed by thermal desorption using liquid amine is employed as the CO 2 capture and concentration technology. However, low energy efficiency and high cost of the thermal swing process remain to be addressed. CO 2 capture driven by renewable electricity represents a promising alternative approach to mitigate CO 2 emissions and address climate change. Electrochemically mediated carbon capture can be achieved by developing redox-active CO 2 adsorbents, such as quinones. In aprotic electrolytes, reduced quinone species can selectively uptake CO 2 from a dilute feed upon electro-reduction via a nucleophilic addition reaction and release a concentrated CO 2 upon electrochemical oxidation. However, the low solubility of quinones in nonaqueous solvents limits their total CO 2 carrying capacity in the system. We synthesized a salt of imidazolium modified anthraquinone with ionic liquid-like structure to address the solubility issue. The synthesized cationic quinone derivatives showed more than 100 times higher solubility and high ionic conductivity as well as electrochemically reversible CO 2 adsorption-desorption. In addition, we synthesized anionic quinone derivatives, anthraquinone with sulfonate (SO 3 − ) moiety, by one-step salt metathesis reaction, and confirmed that the negatively charged quinones is also applicable to the electrochemical CO 2 capture. We report the electrochemical CO 2 capture-release behaviors of the ionic quinones and its monitoring using in situ spectroscopic analysis with the aid of density functional theory calculations.

Because of the climate crisis caused by increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration, developing technologies for reducing them has become imperative. Among various tries, electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECRR) is one of the promising solutions for carbon dioxide recycling as it can be used for the production of more valuable industrial chemicals(e.g. syngas, CO, formic acid...) in a clean way. Ethylene, one of the products, has a high market price of 1.30 dollars/kg. It has various uses for polyethylene production and ethylbenzene synthesis. Ethanol is 1.00 dollars/kg and can be used as fuel. In addition, formic acid has a high value of 0.74 dollars/kg and is used in preservatives and anti-bacterial agents. Carbon monoxide can be easily converted into other hydrocarbon forms through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis For electrolysis, gas diffusion layer(GDL) based electrolyzers have been used. This is because carbon dioxide has a solubility limit of 33 mM, so humidified carbon dioxide in the form of a gas is used to overcome this up to 41 mM. The hybrid flow cell is an electrolytic bath in which a gas diffusion layer and a cathode liquid layer are separated from the anode by a polymer membrane. It is easy to collect liquid products generated from the cathode side, but it has resistance by the liquid layer. The MEA electrolyzer is an AEMWE-based electrolytic bath in which the cathode liquid layer has been removed. Since the electrode and the membrane are in direct contact and contain a small amount of liquid, a three-phase interface is formed, resulting in an electrolytic reaction. Focusing on the catalyst, Cu is the only mono-metal that shows decent selectivity for multi-carbon products(e.g. ethylene, ethanol, acetate, propanol...). For decades, various researches have been conducted on the development of Cu catalysts through bi-metal composition, oxidation state control and about grain boundaries, crystal facet, single-atom. However, it still has challenges about low partial current density and insufficient stability to commercialize. Herein, copper sulfide catalysts were fabricated on gas diffusible carbon paper with microporous layer(MPL/CP). First, Cu nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited on the MPL/CP. Subsequent immersing it into Na 2 S solution enables ionic exchange of surface oxygens with S ions. Because the copper sulfide state has low solubility product constant, so is thermodynamically more stable. As reported, sulfur can change the distance between metal molecules, their oxidation state and their morphologies. By adjusting the exchange condition, the catalyst morphology and surface composition can be easily controlled. The fabricated electrodes were employed as cathodes for CO 2 RR electrolyzer and its faradaic efficiency(FE) was computed. It was revealed that the CO 2 RR performance was highly affected by S coverage on Cu surface. At some point the existence of Sulfur changed selectivity by enhancing the FE of ethylene and oppressing FE of methane.

Climate change caused by global warming has led to disasters in many countries around the world. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for "taking specific measures against climate change." The time has come for humanity to think concretely about ways to suppress the increase in greenhouse gases, which ate thought to be the cause of global warming, and to actually implement them. Among the known greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) accounts for about 75% and is recognized as an important target. Various efforts have already been made to reduce CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, in order to reduce the amount of CO 2 emitted into the atmosphere, technologies for geological storage and conversion of CO 2 are indispensable. CO 2 becomes a resource if it can be converted into useful industrial resources such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, or hydrocarbons in processes that utilize surplus or renewable energy. Many electrochemical reduction techniques have been studied for CO 2 conversion, and Dr. Yoshio Hori has conducted a comprehensive study of electrochemical reduction of CO 2 using metal electrocatalysts1). It has been clarified that the products are different depending on the metal species, and studies are underway to change the surface morphology and crystal planes of metal electrodes and to combine multiple metals in metal electrocatalysts. These previous studies were to reveal that the adsorption strength of CO 2 and electrodes is based on the metal type of the electrode, and that changing the electrode metal changes the path, efficiency, and products of the electrochemical reduction reaction. The object of this research is to take a bird's-eye view of the characteristics of CO 2 electrochemical reduction using copper-based alloy plating electrodes, which we have been development. Among metal electrodes, copper, which can produce hydrocarbons, has been the most widely studied for CO 2 electrochemical reduction. When a copper-cobalt electrode is prepared by alloy plating, the ratio of the hydrocarbons, methane and ethylene, changes depending on the mixing ratio of cobalt. In this copper-cobalt electrode, cobalt exists as a substituted solid solution in the copper crystal structure, and it is considered that the generation efficiency of ethylene is reduced and that of methane is increased due to the inhibition of C-C bonding. When copper-tin electrodes are prepared by alloy plating, unlike cobalt, a solid solution or an intermetallic compound may be formed depending on the ratio of copper and tin. Since the atomic radii of tin atoms are quite different from those of copper atoms, tin atoms do not exist only in substituted solid solution as in the case of cobalt, but their crystal structure changes. The reduction properties of CO 2 electrochemical reduction at a copper-tin electrode were changed. Copper produces hydrocarbons and tin produces formic acid as the main products of CO 2 electrochemical reduction, while carbon monoxide is produced as the main product at a copper/tin ratio of 87:13. Computational chemistry studies predict that the formation of hydrocarbons by copper is via the two-electron reduction product carbon monoxide. The presence of tin near the copper atoms is considered to weaken the adsorption between copper and carbon monoxide. The modeling of the adsorption and the attempt to elucidate the cause by computational science revealed that the tin atoms are weakly bonded to the reaction intermediates and act only as the active sites for the formation of formic acid. It was found that the copper atom weakens the bond with carbon monoxide due to the presence of the tin atom next to the copper atom, and that it decreases the amount of adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. It is reported that the amount of carbon monoxide adsorbed on copper atoms is important for the formation of hydrocarbons, which is stabilized by the formation of hydrogen bonds with CHO*, the reaction intermediate to hydrocarbons. These results suggest that the adsorbed carbon monoxide is destabilized, and carbon monoxide is desorbed from the copper atom, resulting in an increase in carbon monoxide as a product.

Introduction In recent years, there has been growing interest in converting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a greenhouse gas, into a valuable resource. The electrolytic reduction method, which uses only water and electricity, offers a particularly clean approach to CO 2 conversion. Its high conversion efficiency at ambient temperature and pressure, facilitated by gas diffusion electrodes (GDE), makes it a promising option for widespread adoption. Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction using GDE selectively yields carbon monoxide, ethylene, and formic acid with Ag, Cu, or Sn catalysts, respectively 1) . These catalysts are often supported on conductive carbon black (CB), valued for its high electrical conductivity and porosity. However, CB-based catalysts encounter challenges like redox-induced degradation and high CO 2 overvoltage. So, we turned to plasma in liquid as a new method for making electrocatalysts. Plasma in liquid is generated by subjecting a metal in solution to high-frequency, high-voltage conditions. This process enables the sputtering of metal onto powder samples dispersed in solution, with the metal surface instantly heated to high temperatures. This process can improve electrochemical properties like oxygen deficiency 2) . Consequently, plasma treatment in liquid presents an opportunity to utilize highly durable and chemically resistant metal oxides as catalyst base materials. The objective of this study was to synthesize a new catalyst for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction using titanium dioxide as the catalyst base via in-liquid plasma. Titanium dioxide offers advantages of affordability, durability, and chemical resistance. Moreover, oxygen-deficient TiO 2 with enhanced conductivity finds application as a base material for batteries. Experimental In the experiments, high-frequency high voltage (4 kV, 100 kHz, 0.5 µs-Pulse Width) was applied under the same conditions to various metal electrodes in a 5.0 wt%-NH 4 solution (200 mL) containing dispersed TiO 2 (P25: 0.5 g) to generate plasma in the liquid. Common plasma electrodes included tungsten (W), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu). Each gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was prepared by washing the powder after in-liquid plasma treatment with pure water, followed by spray coating on a gas diffusion layer with Nafion dispersion as a binder. Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction was evaluated in a conventional three-chamber gas diffusion cell at 500 mA/cm 2 for 10 minutes. The CO 2 supplied to the gas chamber was collected in a Tedlar bag, and the CO 2 reduction products were analyzed by gas chromatography. Results and Discussion Figure shows the CO 2 reduction products and Faraday efficiency of P25 treated with various liquid plasma electrodes. In pristine P25, small amounts of CO and CH 4 were detected due to the redox cycle of Ti 4+ and Ti 3+ . The use of tungsten (W), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu) as in-liquid plasma electrodes increased the production of H 2 , CO, and CH 4 , respectively. The difference in conversion can be attributed to the fact that the amount of etched Cu is less than that of Ag. Additionally, black nanoparticles were dispersed in the filtered solution when Ag was used, while the solution turned a clear blue color with Cu, suggesting the formation of a complex with ammonia. Generally, oxidized metal nanoparticles are synthesized when plasma is generated in solution. In this study, since an alkaline solution was used, it can be considered that the oxidized Ag nanoparticle surfaces were reduced, resulting in highly dispersed reduced Ag nanoparticles being deposited. In contrast, the generated Cu nanoparticles impregnated TiO 2 by dissolving in ammonia and exhibited catalytic activity. CH 4 significantly affects Faraday efficiency relative to the amount produced because CO and H are two-electron reactions, while CH 4 is an eight-electron reaction, requiring four times as many electrons. Although C 2 H 4 is produced by Cu nanoparticles at sufficient current density, the present results show increased CH 4 production. This may be due to TiO 2 promoting the hydrogenation of CO 2 before Cu forms the C-C bond. Further investigation is required. Conclusions In this study, TiO 2 underwent treatment with various in-liquid plasma electrodes for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction. As a result, changing the electrode allowed for successful support of metal nanoparticles on TiO 2 , resulting in selectivity of CO 2 reduction products. During the presentation, we will discuss the comparison with conductive carbon black (CB) and the changes in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction characteristics under different plasma conditions in liquid. Compared to pristine P25, the production of CO increased by 9.5-fold from 40 to 380 μmol, and CH 4 increased by 2.0-fold from 20 to 40 μmol. Reference 1) Sassenburg et al., ACS Appl.

Research on CO 2 conversion into valuable materials has attracted much attention, aiming to realize carbon neutrality and carbon-negative emission technology. It has been reported that the unique physicochemical properties of high-temperature molten salt, such as high conductivity and wide electrochemical window, make it possible to obtain solid carbon directly from CO 2 and metal carbides. In this study, we focused on the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 in high-temperature chloride melt. CaC 2 is the raw material for acetylene, the starting material for various chemical products. This study demonstrated the selective formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 by an electrochemical process in NaCl-KCl-CaCl 2 -CaO melt at 823 K to produce C 2 H 2 with high current efficiency. When the inert material for oxygen evolution in the high-temperature melts was used as the anode, the formation of acetylene and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water can be realized as the total reaction. 2CO 2 + H 2 O → C 2 H 2 + 5/2O 2 On the metal cathode, the CaC 2 was formed through two reactions: the carbon electrodeposition from CO 2 -derived CO 3 2− (Step 1) and the electrochemical reduction of Ca(II) ion on the carbon (Step 2). These two reactions could be controlled by conducting potentiostatic electrolysis under CO 2 and Ar atmospheres, resulting in acetylene synthesis with a maximum current efficiency of 92%. The electrolysis on carbon electrodes revealed that the higher the crystallinity of carbon, the more selectively CaC 2 was formed. The CaC 2 formation was induced by the reduction of Ca(II) ions on the basal plane of the graphite layer rather than the edge plane. The unique interfacial phenomenon between high-temperature melt and a carbon electrode surface will contribute to realizing a highly efficient CO 2 conversion process to acetylene. It was found that the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 tends to proceed at the basal plane of the graphite layer. This reaction mechanism is entirely different from the interlayer reactions that tend to occur in LIBs and is unique to this electrolytic system at the carbon/molten salt interface. The obtained data will provide a highly efficient process for CO 2 resource conversion and physicochemical insights into new carbon surface reactions.

Solar fuels produced by electrocatalysis have a great potential to reduce the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 and make the production of fuels and chemicals more sustainable. The composition of an electrocatalyst employed for the production of solar fuels is key, ideally the catalyst should be made of abundant elements that can be found anywhere in the world. In this sense, organic molecules composed of light elements such as C, H, O, N, P and S fulfill this requirement. In addition, the extensive advances in the field of organic synthesis make possible to study the active sites, tune them at molecular level, synthesize them and scale the process with ease. In recent years, a handful of nitrogenated heterocycles have been reported for water oxidation, hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction. Special interest exists in our group on the study of benzothiadiazole based electrocatalysts for reduction reactions due to their favorable redox properties and their affinity towards different chemical species (H + and CO 2 ) relevant for the production of solar fuels. In this talk we will present recent efforts of our group to employ benzothiadiazoles in reactions relevant for electrocatalytic production of fuels.

Observing key intermediates directly on the catalyst surface poses a significant challenge in various photo/electrocatalytic processes, including CO 2 reduction and O 2 reduction reactions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms, it is essential to conduct combined studies utilizing complementary tools such as electrochemical characterization, computational calculations, and operando spectroscopies. Among these, time-resolved attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) stands out as particularly suited for investigating electrochemical CO 2 RR due to its ability to observe interfacial processes in real-time with high surface sensitivity. Time-resolved analysis offered by ATR-SEIRAS allows for the exploration of the kinetic relevance of intermediates and their dynamics in relation to reactants and products during the reaction. Furthermore, integrating operando spectroscopic studies with material characterization enables the correlation of intermediate behavior with catalyst conditions. In this context, I will introduce in situ time-resolved FT-IR (or ATR mode) spectroscopic techniques to capture isotopically labeled products and key intermediates generated during the photoreduction of carbon dioxide.

Systems for direct conversion of captured CO2 into CO (i.e., CO2 capture and reduction: CCR) via bifunctional catalysts have attracted attention as technologies for achieving carbon neutrality. However, the reported systems require additional heating above 623 K, which is still an issue from an ecological perspective. The present work realized selective CO production through CCR under isothermal conditions at 423 K by the application of a direct current electric field and a Pt‐Na/TiO2 catalyst. The application of an electric field to the catalyst is needed for CO2 conversion at low temperature, and the loading of both Pt and Na is required for CO2 capture and its selective reduction to CO. The obtained results open the door for greener CCR technologies that effectively utilize waste heat from power plants and industry.

The electrocatalytic hydrogen cycle with nitrogen and carbon resources is of emerging interest for renewable energy and environment. Among nitrogen species, electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH 3 ) from N 2 or NO x and urea (CO(NH 2 ) 2 ) from N 2 or NO x together with CO 2 have attracted great attention with substantial progress in recent years as clean and energy-saving approach, to potentially replace the commercialized energy- & capital-intensive Haber-Bosch process. In order to accelerate the ammonia production rate, nitric oxide (NO) can be employed and converted to ammonia with high selectivity by capturing NO with FeII-EDTA. 1) However, low concentration and the low solubility of NO (~1.94 mM in water at 25°C) is expected to affect ammonia production rate from direct electrochemical NO reduction reaction (NORR) in aqueous electrolytes. In order further increase the ammonia production rate, we employed a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to circumvent the mass transport issue with a dilute NO gas. 2) In addition, urea was successfully synthesized using Cu with atomic-scale spacings between copper facets, which lowers the energy barrier for C-N coupling and enhances the reaction kinetics, therefore leading to improved urea formation from co-reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate in a flow-cell system. 3) 1) ACS Energy Lett., 2020, 5, 3647-3656. 2) ACS Energy Lett., 2022, 7, 958-965. 3) Energy Environ.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) holds promise for mitigating carbon emissions and reuse CO 2 for chemical synthesis and energy storage. Among various catalysts, copper-palladium (Cu-Pd) shows potential for converting CO 2 into valuable hydrocarbons (C 2+ products). However, the efficiency of Cu-Pd catalysts is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during CO 2 RR. To tackle this issue, we have developed and analyzed Cu-Pd bimetallic catalysts with varying ratios of copper to palladium to understand the mechanisms underlying HER and its impact on CO 2 electrolyzer performance. Utilizing in-situ Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, Ex-situ Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, and X-ray Photon Spectroscopy, we have identified three detrimental effects of HER during CO 2 reduction: (i) formation of carbonate salt precipitates causing cathode clogging, (ii) mechanical damage to the ion exchange membrane, and (iii) facilitation of anode catalyst crossover. The precipitation of salts on the cathode flow field and gas diffusion layer hinders CO 2 diffusion to the catalyst surface during electrolysis. Notably, we observe catalyst crossover from the anode to the cathode, potentially exacerbating HER during CO 2 RR. These processes adversely affect the long-term durability of CO 2 electrolyzers and necessitate a comprehensive understanding and strategies for mitigation. Figure 1

The growing concerns over the high energy consumption of buildings challenge design and construction parties to grow a deeper understanding of sustainable design practices and carbon footprint reduction in construction. With emerging technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and its associated tools, it is now possible to analyze various design models and decide on their implications on environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Although these tools are effective in estimating carbon emissions in the project’s design stages, working with several material alternatives throughout the project’s life cycle requires further comprehension of how CO 2 emissions can be diminished with sustainable design decisions. This study presents a comprehensive two-step analysis linking BIM and energy analysis software to compare the impact of conventional versus sustainable design parameters and their implications on CO 2 emissions. The proposed framework includes simulating the energy consumption of commercial building case studies. Using BIM and energy analysis software, design parameters are evaluated from an energy use intensity (EUI) perspective. The implications of using the conventional versus sustainable design are reflected in a range of CO 2 emissions. The second part of the methodology includes a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the real-world case studies with and without sustainable design implications. This methodology will help designers identify the intensity of their design decisions on energy use and carbon emissions throughout the building life cycle. The seamless and user-friendly application of this framework will help design parties expedite decisions during the first stages of their projects.

Global energy demand has increased significantly due to world population growth and the industrialization of developing economies. Energy production has been based mainly on fossil-fuel energy, which has increased global warming due to the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide. According to the Energy Institute, renewable power generation through wind, solar, and other renewable sources, represent only 40,86% of energy sources in 2022 [1]. An alternative energy source for fossil fuels is hydrogen, which can be produced through renewable resources that increase energy efficiency. However, the storage and transportation of hydrogen present a series of technical challenges, resulting in high costs and motivating the development of intermediate technologies. Recently, ammonia generated by renewable energy sources has gained significant attention as an energy carrier, a medium to store and transport chemical energy, and directly as fuel [2]. Ammonia is also a primary raw material for making inorganic fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, synthetic fibers, resins, and other applications, benefiting nearly half the world's population. Ammonia can be transported more efficiently and safely than hydrogen in tanker vessels or pipelines due to its relative ease of being liquefied at room temperature and moderate pressure, increasing energy density. Currently, ammonia is produced mainly from hydrogen and nitrogen by the Haber-Bosch process, which utilizes fossil fuel, thus resulting in carbon dioxide emissions. Ammonia production can also involve the non-spontaneous nitrogen reduction reaction by electrochemical techniques, which uses hydrogen that can be provided from the water, reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. However, the non-spontaneous nitrogen reduction reaction has low activity, and its voltage is close to that of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Plasma and electrothermal chemical cycle methods have been explored to improve the selectivity of non-spontaneous nitrogen reduction reactions. Several studies have proposed new catalysts to increase the active sites, modify the size and morphology of particles, and introduce defects, such as transition metal-based catalysts, carbon-based catalysts, phosphorus-based catalysts, etc. Nevertheless, traditional catalysts frequently degrade rapidly due to the harsh chemical environment and the inherent corrosiveness of the reactions involved. A highly active catalyst that degrades quickly due to corrosion offers limited practical value. Researchers are exploring novel materials like high-entropy alloys (HEAs) to address this challenge, which also have high corrosion resistance [3]. This study focuses on the potential of a HEA, FeCrMnNiCo, as a catalyst for the electrochemical conversion of nitrogen to ammonia via the electrochemical method, evaluating the influence of the microstructure on its mechanical properties, catalytic activity, and corrosion resistance. A ball burnishing deformation was applied to the HEA at different conditions. The X-ray diffraction revealed that the FeCrMnNiCo alloy presented a face-centered cubic crystalline structure, and scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the alloying elements were segregated in the deformed samples. The mechanical deformation determined both catalytic activity and corrosion resistance of the HEA. This study highlights the importance of considering corrosion resistance as a crucial factor in developing catalysts for green ammonia production.

Background: The treatment of glaucoma often requires numerous therapeutic modalities to achieve the desired reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). Cyclodestructive procedures or ciliary body destruction have been performed using techniques with considerable differences in efficacy and complication rates. Among these methods, cyclocryotherapy is non-invasive and simple for the management of uncontrolled glaucoma in dogs and cats. The objective of this case report is to describe the technique of carbon dioxide cyclocryotherapy to reduce intraocular pressure in dogs and cats with glaucoma.Cases: Nine canine patients and one cat with glaucoma were treated with cyclocryotherapy performed under general anaesthesia. Clinical signs patients included blepharospasm, ocular pain, episcleral congestion and ocular hypertension. The patients showed higher levels of IOP, higher than 30 mmHg. Surgical treatment with general anaesthesia was applied. The pre-anaesthesia protocol included acepromazine 0.05 mg/kg with methadone 0.2 mg/kg, followed by intravenous propofol and maintenance with isoflurane and oxygen. An ophthalmological cryocautery unit was used with carbon dioxide as the cryogenic agent and a retinal cryoprobe of 3.2 mm diameter tip for the procedure. The method used was a double cycle of freezing and thawing for 60 s in each site. The cryoprobe was centred approximately 5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus over the ciliary body. The temperature of each cyclocryotherapy spot was between -60°C and -80°C and each site was maintained in place for 60 s; 4 to 6 spots of the double freeze-thaw cycle were made. This technique did not have any serious complications during or after the application of cryotherapy, but chemosis and hyperaemia of the bulbar conjunctiva developed. Subconjunctival anti-inflammatory steroids were injected to minimise swelling and patient discomfort. Satisfactory results were observed; in all cases, the intraocular pressure decreased, with the usual result being a cosmetic and painless eye. Discussion: Even with recent surgical and medical advances, pain and blindness are still common occurrences in glaucoma in human and veterinary practice. The cyclodestructive procedures included cyclodialysis, cyclodiathermy, cyclocryotherapy, and cyclophotocoagulation. The cryosurgery in veterinary ophthalmology has many indications for the treatment of ocular diseases and is effective at decreasing intraocular pressure in patients with persistent uncontrolled glaucoma. Cyclocryotherapy has been shown to reduce intraocular pressure in dogs, cats, rabbits and humans with normotensive and glaucomatous eyes. The application of a cryoprobe over the ciliary processes results in ablating ciliary tissue so that aqueous humour inflow is reduced to acceptable levels. In the clinical cases evaluated, there was a reduction in intraocular pressure reaching acceptable levels, with the usual result being cosmetic and painless eye. Medical therapy remains the predominant method for treating glaucoma in veterinary patients; therefore, cyclocryotherapy is an effective, simple way to lower IOP and is a reasonable treatment option for glaucoma management. Cyclocryotherapy has shown good results, with a low learning curve and it can also be repeated if necessary.Keywords: eye, canine, feline, surgery.

Facing the critical challenges of climate change and the escalating need for sustainable carbon management, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 emerges as a pivotal strategy for carbon recycling and the production of renewable energy. This approach addresses the imperative to mitigate CO2 emissions while harnessing the potential of electrochemical processes to transform CO2 into ethanol, a valuable renewable fuel. Unlike conventional methods reliant on biomass, which are limited by significant land use and potential environmental repercussions, electrochemical CO2 reduction offers a sustainable and efficient alternative. It enables the direct conversion of CO2 from its most oxidized state into more energetically favorable products through a process that integrates water splitting and CO2 hydrogenation into a single electrochemical step. This not only simplifies the conversion process but also facilitates the synthesis of products difficult to achieve through thermal processes, operating at or near ambient conditions to minimize energy consumption and environmental impact. Central to our study is the experimental approach using flow cells and MEA cells, which are primarily utilized for the large-scale electrochemical conversion of CO2. Both systems enable high-current density reactions (large-scale processing) by continuously flowing electrolyte, thus achieving mass processing capabilities. The dilution of reaction products within the electrolyte presents a significant challenge. Additionally, in the case of an MEA cell, there's the issue of the produced products undergoing oxidation at the anode, causing problems in stability during operation. Therefore, an economical method is needed to separate the products within the electrolyte. To overcome this, our research innovatively integrates a pervaporation system employing zeolite-based membranes within a flow cell configuration. This setup allows for the effective concentration of ethanol produced in the electrochemical reduction process, addressing the significant challenge of product dilution in the electrolyte. In our efforts to generate ethanol electrochemically, we utilized a Cu-based catalyst, conducting experiments in both neutral and alkaline electrolyte environments. It was observed that ethanol forms in real-time through the electrochemical reactions at concentrations lower than 1wt%. Furthermore, we successfully implemented a pervaporation process using a hydrophobic all-silica zeolite membrane. The pervaporation process using a hydrophobic all-silica zeolite membrane can selectively separate low concentrations of ethanol from catholyte due to the high selectivity of the zeolite membrane. In this study, we fabricated an MFI type silicalite-1 membrane on a tubular support and investigated the selective removal of ethanol in a water/ethanol mixture. The silicalite-1 membrane has a high Si/Al ratio and exhibits high molecular-level ethanol selectivity. In addition, the membrane has high chemical stability, making it applicable to long-term operation under harsh conditions. As a results, we achieved an ethanol concentration in the permeate of over 50% under conditions where < 1 wt% ethanol was present in the feed. This not only addresses the challenge of separating ethanol from highly diluted streams but also significantly improves the sustainability and scalability of the overall process. Our research underscores the potential of integrating advanced separation technologies in carbon recycling, offering a promising route for the environmentally friendly utilization of CO2 and contributing to the advancement of renewable energy solutions Ref) CO2 Electrolyzers.

Biochemical networks use reaction cascades to selectively reduce CO2 using energy from sunlight, but can similar selectivity be achieved by applying a cascade approach to an engineered system? Here, we report the design and implementation of a two-step photoelectrochemical (PEC) cascade to a liquid solar fuel: reduction of CO2 to CO and subsequent reduction of CO to methanol. The potentials required to perform the reductions were generated using custom-made III–V-based three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNT) catalyzed both reactions. Multiphysics simulations of electrolyte flow and nonilluminated electrochemical measurements were used to narrow the operating parameters for the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes. The champion integrated photocathode produced methanol with 3.8 ± 0.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE), with tested photocathodes having 0.7–3.8% methanol FE. Products were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The current output of the tested photocathodes was highly stable, and methanol production continued over multiple experiments. The low methanol yield is attributed to insufficient CO flux to, and CO2 depletion at, the methanol-producing subcell when both contacts are active, which is supported by the observation that a control photoelectrode slightly outperformed the methanol production of the 3TT device. Methanol production ceased when the 3TT subcell driving CO reduction was deactivated, supporting the assignment of a cascade mechanism. The major factors resulting in low methanol FE by the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes are insufficient CO2 depletion at the methanol-producing contact and uncertainty in operating potential selection using the 3TT design. Although the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathode is not yet highly selective, this work develops the basic science principles underlying the PEC cascade, demonstrates the co-design of a 3TT-based photoelectrode to produce carbon-based fuels, and finally discusses routes for improving product yields with this concept, including CO2 supply optimization and alternative photoelectrode and catalyst materials.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO 2 R) holds great promise for producing valuable chemicals and fuels while mitigating carbon emissions. However, challenges arise from the need to enhance CO 2 transport and operate at higher current densities. Despite the development of gas diffusion electrodes, operating at higher current densities generates hydroxide ions at the cathode, promoting the formation of carbonate ions, which can cause salt precipitation and flooding, hindering CO 2 mass transport. To investigate the potential degradation of eCO 2 R of copper gas diffusion electrode (Cu GDE), we utilize X-ray tomography, a nondestructive method for visualizing morphological changes. Through in-line gas chromatography, we track salt precipitation and flooding in the GDE, correlating these changes with shifts in product distribution during eCO 2 R. Our findings reveal that the degradation of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cells is linked to the extent of precipitation and flooding. Furthermore, micro-CT imaging captures morphological changes, such as precipitation growth, dissolution, and regrowth from the Cu surface to the gas diffusion layer, during transient oscillatory voltage profiles and selectivity changes in Cu GDE. This study sheds light on the degradation mechanism of MEA cells and offers insights into strategies for enhancing device durability.

Metal‐Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of solid‐state materials comprising inorganic elements and organic molecules. These hybrid materials are widely recognized for their diverse properties, rendering them indispensable in the field of organic synthesis, material science and the pharmaceutical industry. Although the traditional batch methods for MOFs synthesis are well‐developed, they often struggle with reproducibility, scalability and environmental issues. However, the development of continuous flow techniques has emerged as a promising alternative, offering more efficient mass and heat transfer, precise reaction control, greater potential for automation, improved safety, and reduced environmental impact. This review primarily focuses on advanced continuous flow synthesis of MOFs incorporating techniques such as air flow, spray drying, microwave, micro‐droplets, supercritical carbon dioxide, and ultrasound. Additionally, the recent advancements in applying MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts for various organic transformations under continuous flow conditions are discussed, categorized by the type of bond formation, including C‐H bond formation (hydrogen reduction), C‐C bond formation, and C‐O bond formation.

Abstract The manufacturing of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) significantly contributes to global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, necessitating the exploration of alternative binders like alkali-activated materials (AAM). Despite its environmental benefits, AAM generally faces challenges such as drying shrinkage and efflorescence, limiting its industrial application. This study focuses on investigating the impact of steam curing on addressing these challenges in high strength slag-based AAM. The results indicates that high strength AAM can be developed by carefully optimizing the activator-to-binder and water-to-binder ratios, and incorporating steam curing. Specifically, a compressive strength of 112.4 MPa was achieved after one day of steam curing, compared to 100.8 MPa after 28 days of standard curing. This demonstrates the ability of steam curing to accelerate strength development of AAM. Furthermore, steam curing proved to be highly effective in reducing drying shrinkage, which was decreased from 17 351 microstrains to 1 440 microstrains. This reduction aligns the shrinkage levels of AAM with those of OPC, addressing a major limitation of AAM. This study also found that efflorescence was notably mitigated, with a significant reduction observed after a 24-hour steam curing period. These findings highlight steam curing as a cost- effective and practical-effective method in improving the performance of AAM. By addressing the key challenges, steam curing facilitates the broader adoption of AAM in sustainable construction practices.

As the greenhouse effect intensifies, China faces pressure to manage CO2 emissions. Coal-fired power plants are a major source of CO2 in China. Traditional CO2 emission accounting methods of power plants are deficient in computational efficiency and accuracy. To solve these problems, this study proposes a novel RF-RFE-DF-Optuna (random forest–recursive feature elimination–deep forest–Optuna) framework, enabling accurate CO2 emission prediction for coal-fired power plants. The framework begins with RF-RFE for feature selection, identifying and extracting the most important features for CO2 emissions from the power plant, reducing dimensionality from 46 to just 5 crucial features. Secondly, the study used the DF model to predict CO2 emissions, combined with the Optuna framework, to enhance prediction accuracy further. The results illustrated the enhancements in model performance and showed a significant improvement with a 0.12706 increase in R2 and reductions in MSE and MAE by 81.70% and 36.88%, respectively, compared to the best performance of the traditional model. This framework improves predictive accuracy and offers a computationally efficient real-time CO2 emission monitoring solution in coal-fired power plants.

Electrochemical processes are less energy intensive than thermal processes, especially for inner sphere reactions such as HER (H 2 evolution reaction), HOR (H 2 oxidation reaction), OER (O 2 evolution reaction), ORR (O 2 reduction reaction), CO2RR (CO 2 reduction reaction), and NH 3 generation. Energetic costs and environmental burdens are lowered electrochemically, provided an appropriate electrocatalyst can be identified. Often, electrocatalysts are identified through edisonian surveys. Here, a more fundamental approach to identifying catalysts is posed as magnetoelectrocatalysis. Magnetic gradients drive electron transfer reactions across the electrode solution interface. This increases rates and efficiency, to lower energetic and environmental taxes. Demonstrated magnetoelectrocatalysis is presented for HER [1,2], ORR [3-5], and single carbon species electrochemistry including CO2RR [6]. Fundamental approaches to identifying effective magnetoelectrocatalysts are presented.

Aiming at the challenges of rapid heat dissipation, limited swept efficiency, and a rapid water cut increase in steam huff and puff development in heavy oil reservoirs, an alternating steam and CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff method for IOR was proposed. In this work, the effect of CO2 on the physical properties of heavy oil was evaluated, and the optimal concentration of viscosity reducer for synergistic interaction between CO2 and the viscosity reducer was determined. Next, novel huff and puff simulation experiments by three sandpack models of different sizes in series were analyzed. Then, the IOR difference between the pure steam huff and puff experiments and the steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff were compared. Finally, the CO2 storage rate was obtained based on the principle of the conservation of matter. The results show that the optimal viscosity reducer concentration, 0.8 wt%, can achieve a 98.5% reduction after combining CO2. The steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff reached about 45 cm at 80 °C in the fifth cycle due to the CO2/viscosity reducer effects. CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff significantly reduces water cut during cold production, with an ultimate IOR 15.89% higher than pure steam huff and puff. The viscosity reducer alleviates heavy oil blockages, and CO2 decreases oil viscosity and enhances elastic repulsion energy. The highest CO2 storage rate of 76.8% occurs in the initial stage, declining to 15.2% by the sixth cycle, indicating carbon sequestration potential. These findings suggest that steam-alternating CO2/viscosity reducer huff and puff improves heavy oil reservoir development and provides theoretical guidance for optimizing steam huff and puff processes.

Development of highly active electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction has been intensively investigated for the efficient utilization of CO 2 and the lowering of electric energy consumption. Among various strategies, alloy nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted significant interest due to their tunable catalytic properties, which can be adjusted by altering their chemical composition and particle size. Recently, we reported novel preparation methods of metal nanoparticles through the sputter deposition of metals onto room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), a technique we termed “RTIL/metal sputtering technique”. This method enabled the formation of metal and alloy NPs, such as Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, AuAg, AuCu, AuPt and AuRh,(1-6) with sizes in the nanometer ranges, in the absence of additional stabilizing agents. Here we report the preparation of AuCu alloy NPs via RTIL/metal sputtering and evaluate their electrocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction as a function of the alloy composition. The simultaneous sputtering of Au and Cu onto RTILs produced AuCu alloy NPs with the size ranging from 3 to 4 nm. Subsequent loading of these sputter-deposited AuCu NPs in RTIL on carbon black powders (CB) not only increased the AuCu NP size to 3-7 nm but also facilitated alloying between Au and Cu. The chemical composition of AuCu NPs was controlled by changing the area fraction of Au plates in Au-Cu binary targets used for sputtering. The XRD analysis revealed that thus-obtained AuCu NPs had the fcc structure, in which each peak shifted to a lower angle with an increase in the Au fraction. The prepared AuCu/CB powers were immobilized on glassy carbon electrodes and used for the electrocatalyst for CO 2 reduction in a 0.5 M KHCO 3 aqueous solution. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that cathodic currents were observed at potentials more negative than -1.2 V, with the current intensity being higher under a CO 2 atmosphere compared to an N 2 atmosphere. This confirms the CO 2 reduction activity of AuCu nanoparticles. Constant potential electrolysis was carried out at -2 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a CO 2 atmosphere. As CO 2 reduction products, CO and HCOOH were formed. The selectivity of these products was remarkably influenced by the composition of AuCu alloy NPs: The HCOOH selectivity increased with a higher Cu ratio, while the CO selectivity showed a volcano-type relationship, reaching an optimum at the Au fraction in NPs of ca. 0.8. H 2 was also produced as a byproduct, with its selectivity being minimized at the Au fraction of 0.6-0.9. In conclusion we demonstrated the importance of alloy composition in optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of AuCu NPs for CO 2 reduction. References T. Torimoto, et al., Appl. Phys.

<p>Aviation, as a critical component of the global transportation infrastructure, has experienced substantial growth over the past few decades, facilitating the movement of people and goods. However, this sector is also a significant consumer of fossil fuels and contributor to global warming. In this study, we estimated the carbon dioxide (CO$ _2 $) emissions from global aviation for the period between 2019 to June 2024 using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We estimate that a yearly total of 42 million of flights were responsible for 895 Mt of CO$ _2 $ emissions in 2019. Flight disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have decreased emissions during the years 2020–2023, but the recovery has been quick: the number of domestic flights in 2023 surpassed its pre-Covid level while international flights were slightly lagging behind. This results in CO$ _2 $ emissions in 2023 that were still 9% below their pre-Covid levels. However, traffic and emissions levels calculated for 2024 indicate a return to pre-Covid levels. Our analysis indicates that North America, Europe, and Asia account for almost 75% of the aviation CO$ _2 $ emissions. Flights shorter than 2600 km are responsible for 50% of the aviation CO$ _2 $ emissions worldwide. Flights longer than this distance account for the other half of emissions, although they represent less than 15% of the total number of flights. The most recent generation of aircraft represented 20% of the fleet at the start of 2024, resulting in an 8% gain in efficiency, equivalent to 144 Mt CO$ _2 $ avoided over the whole period. However, the ongoing growth in traffic delays the fleet renewal and hinders the reduction in emissions. Aviation does not appear to be on track to reach a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030. Additionally, if sustainable aviation fuels are to be used, this will require a substantial increase in biomass or low-carbon electricity use.</p>

The urgent global challenge of climate change and the depletion of energy resources have spotlighted the technology of converting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable carbon-based products. The CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) via metal complex molecules is expected to improve and enhance the electronic/chemical environment of the catalytic active sites through control with freely modulable organic ligands. The selectivity for the formation of formic acid and carbon monoxide from CO 2 in organic solvents has been successfully controlled in some molecular catalysts by small structural differences in the ligands. For catalytic reactions in organic solvents, NMR and other common analytical methods can be used to follow structural changes and reaction intermediates during the reaction of unimolecular molecular catalysts. The study of detailed reaction processes has led to ligand design guidelines that contribute to higher reaction rates and improved selectivity. However, analytical methods still need to be developed for heterogeneous molecular catalysts used in water on electrodes. Catalysts capable of producing C 2 products, such as ethylene and ethanol, require methods to detect intermediates in multi-electron reduction processes involving C-C coupling reactions. Current C 2 producing molecular catalysts are known to decompose during reactions, turning into metals and not fully utilizing their precisely controlled active sites. Therefore, developing structurally stable molecular catalysts during reactions is critical to understanding these mechanisms. In this study, we have demonstrated a Br-bridged copper dinuclear molecular catalyst with high robustness for CO 2 /CO reduction reactions, producing C 3+ products including C 3 H 7 OH beyond C 2 products. Operando XAFS and various spectroscopic analyses show that the dinuclear molecular catalyst maintains a stable Cu(I) state during the reduction reaction, preventing decomposition. Operando spectroscopic analysis using localized surface plasmon resonance identifies key C 2 and C 3 coupling intermediates essential for C 3 production. Reaction intermediates obtained by 13 CO 2 -labeled operando analysis were also corroborated. DFT calculations propose a mechanism where the reaction proceeds at room temperature to form C 3 coupling species. The transition state structures resulting from this mechanistic analysis suggest that the progression of C-C coupling in the Cu dinuclear molecular metal complex is facilitated by the formation of a CO 2 /CO-reduced intermediate species that bridges the two Cu active sites. The bridging intermediate can adjust the Cu-Cu distance during the reaction, attracting reducing species to one Cu side and accepting substrate to the other Cu side. C 3 H 7 OH is formed through C-C coupling at the bridging site in flexible Cu binuclear structures. The discovery of a robust molecular catalyst for C 3+ production provides a molecular design guideline for developing next-generation catalysts for multicarbon CO 2 reduction products.

The development of new technologies for the sustainable transformation of CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals is a promising approach to meet global needs. This paper will cover research efforts to understand electrified interfaces for CO2 reduction. Fundamental studies of well-defined catalyst materials and electrolyte conditions uncover the role of the microenvironment in steering catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability. Studies of more applied platforms with greater complexity provide insights into the roles of mass transfer, flooding, and crystallization. Translating knowledge from model systems to applied platforms is key to enabling high-performance technologies in this space.

It is widely recognized that hydrogen is an appropriate fuel for the sustainable energy system because it can be utilized as an energy storage material of intermittent renewable energy sources, and it generate no environmentally harmful products after combustion. However, in region where green hydrogen production cannot follow the need, import is necessary. In this case, transportation and storage of pure hydrogen can be a problem because of the high cost of maintaining liquefied state and low amount of hydrogen in compressed gas. In this regard, ammonia has received much attention as a hydrogen carrier with advantageous properties of relatively mild condition for liquefaction, high volumetric density of hydrogen, and no carbon content. Electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) to extract the hydrogen has been researched as much less energy is required for electrolysis when replacing oxygen evolution reaction to the AOR in aqueous alkaline condition. But high overpotential even when the most active electrocatalyst, platinum, is used and rapid poisoning by strongly adsorbed N species inhibit the practical application. To deal with these problems, there are a lot of on-going researches with various methods and perspectives. In this study, we investigated the effect of alkali metal cations on electrochemical AOR on polycrystalline platinum electrode. With same concentration but different alkali metal cations, measured the activity of platinum was different for the AOR peak (K + > Na + > Li + ≈ Cs + ). The reaction kinetics were also affected, supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel slope. Also, we checked that the alkali metal cation promotes the AOR by comparing the cyclic voltammetry results with and without the cation in ammonia solution. These kinds of cation effects are also demonstrated in other electrochemical reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Mainly, there are two explanations i) the degree of interaction between cations and water structure and reaction intermediates at the interface, ii) the local electric field between electrode and hydrated cation in electric double layer. We will present and discuss the effect of alkali metal cations on the AOR in this point of view and competitive adsorption of water, proton, hydroxide and ammonia on the platinum surface in aqueous alkaline electrolyte.

CO2 removal, especially the one applied to reduce the emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere (carbon capture, utilization, and storage), is one of the main research topics nowadays because of its great contribution to the reduction in climate change and to making many industrial processes sustainable. In this regard, alternative solvents to the traditional ones are under study with the aim of employing a more sustainable solvent for the environment, health, and society, in comparison with the traditional amine aqueous solutions that are toxic and corrosive. The CO2-binding organic liquids (CO2-BOLs) are a class of components of interest. In this work, the vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for two newly selected binary mixtures based on CO2-BOLs, 1,3-Propanediol+DBU and DBU+Sulfolane, have been experimentally determined at the Process Thermodynamics laboratory (PT lab) of Politecnico di Milano to evaluate the suitability of these mixtures for being a solvent for CO2 removal. All the experiments have been carried out by using the Fischer® Labodest® VLLE 602 unit at a constant pressure of 30 kPa. The densities of the mixtures for all the considered compositions have been determined at atmospheric pressure with a density meter (Mettler Toledo Densito Density2Go). No data on the VLE of these mixtures can be found in the literature. This is the first work focusing on mixtures of these components that could be employed as solvents for CO2 removal as alternative solvents to the monoethanolamine (MEA) aqueous solution in the process of chemical absorption. The collected experimental data have then been used for the definition of the thermodynamic model by considering different possible theories (NRTL, Wilson, and UNIQUAC) that could be employed for the representation of the two systems.

Electroreduction of CO2 to CO represents a highly promising way for artificial carbon cycling, but obtaining high selectivity over a wide potential window remains a challenge due to the sluggish CO generation and diffusion kinetics. Here we report an integration of long‐range P modified asymmetrical bismuth atomic site on an ordered macroporous carbon skeleton with mesoporous “wall” (MW‐BiN3‐POMC) for efficient electroreduction of CO2. In‐depth in‐situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the incorporation of long‐range P atom is able to strengthen the orbital interaction between the C 2p of CO2 and Bi 6p, thereby establishing an electronic transport bridge for the activation of CO2 molecule. Additionally, the ordered macropore with mesoporous wall effectively facilitates the diffusion of CO. As a result, MW‐BiN3‐POMC exhibits an ultrawide potential window of 1000 mV for high CO selectivity (>90%) and a maximal CO partial current density of 414 mA cm‐2. Moreover, MW‐BiN3‐POMC can also be employed as the cathode to integrate the solar‐driven electrolytic cell (anode of Co3O4‐OMC) toward CO2 reduction coupled with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation to simultaneously yield CO and 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid.

Due to the significance of carbon utilization and storage, CO2 huff and puff is increasingly receiving attention. However, the mechanisms and effects of CO2 huff and puff extraction in medium to deep saturated heavy oil reservoirs remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, by targeting the medium to deep saturated heavy oil reservoirs in the block Xia of the Xinjiang oil field, measurements of physical properties were conducted through PVT analysis and viscosity measurement to explore the dissolution and diffusion characteristics of CO2-degassed and CO2-saturated oil systems. Multiple sets of physical simulation of CO2 huff and puff in medium to deep saturated heavy oil reservoirs were conducted using a one-dimensional core holder to evaluate the EOR mechanism of CO2 huff and puff. The results demonstrate that the solubility of CO2 in degassed crude oil is linearly correlated with pressure. Higher pressure effectively increases the solubility of CO2, reaching 49.1 m3/m3 at a saturation pressure of 10.0 MPa, thus facilitating oil expansion and viscosity reduction. Meanwhile, crude oil saturated with CH4 still retains the capacity to further dissolve additional CO2, reaching 24.5 m3/m3 of incremental CO2 solubilization at 10.0 MPa, and the hybrid effect of CO2 and CH4 reduces oil viscosity to 1161 mPa·s, which is slightly lower than the pure CO2 dissolution case. Temperature increases suppress solubility but promote molecular diffusion, allowing CH4 and CO2 to maintain a certain solubility at high temperatures. In terms of dynamic dissolution and diffusion, the initial CO2 dissolution rate is high, reaching 0.009 m3/(m3·min), the mid-term dissolution rate stabilizes at approximately 0.002 m3/(m3·min), and the dissolution capability significantly decreases later on. CO2 exhibits high molecular diffusion capability in gas-saturated crude oil, with a diffusion coefficient of 8.62 × 10−7 m2/s. For CO2 huff and puff, oil production is positively correlated with the CO2 injection rate and the cycle injection volume; it initially increases with the extension of the soak time but eventually decreases. Therefore, the optimal injection speed, injection volume, and soak time should be determined in conjunction with reservoir characteristics. During the huff and puff process, the bottom hole pressure should be higher than the bubble point pressure of the crude oil to prevent gas escape. Moreover, as the huff and puff cycles increase, the content of saturates in the oil rises, while those of aromatic, resin, and asphaltene decrease, leading to a gradual deterioration of the huff and puff effect. This study provides a comprehensive reference method and conclusions for studying the fluid property changes and enhanced recovery mechanisms in medium to deep heavy oil reservoirs with CO2 huff and puff.

Abstract Photovoltaic‐driven electrochemical (PV‐EC) carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 R) coupled with sulfide oxidation (SOR) can efficiently convert the solar energy into chemical energy, expanding its applications. However, developing low‐cost electrocatalysts that exhibit high selectivity and efficiency for both CO 2 R and SOR remains a challenge. Herein, a bifunctional copper selenide catalyst is developed with copper vacancies (v‐CuSe 2 ) for the CO 2 R‐SOR. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 62.4% for methane at −200 mA cm −2 is achieved in the cathodic CO 2 R. In a two‐electrode CO 2 R‐SOR system with 16 h of long‐term operation at a current density of 200 mA cm −2 , an average Faradaic efficiency of 57.2% for methane and 97.7% for sulfur powder generation is achieved at cathode and anode, respectively. Compared to the coupling of CO 2 R with oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the energy efficiency (EE) of the CO 2 R‐SOR system can be increased to 22.9%. The mechanism study has found that the synergistic effect of copper vacancies and introduced Se significantly enhances the selectivity toward methane. Driven by silicon solar cells, a solar‐to‐methane conversion efficiency of 2% is achieved.

The reaction pathways of CO 2 electrochemical reduction reaction have been barely understood due to lack of direct molecular level information. In this study, we use the surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy with the attenuated total reflection configuration to directly monitor the reaction intermediates of CO2 reductions on both model and nanocatalysts. Reaction mechanisms according to the spectroscopic and theoretical calculation results will be proposed. Rational design of electrocatalysts for these reactions will be presented.

This study explores the environmental and economic impacts of aviation emissions, focusing on the changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using real flight data from Batman Airport, the research examines aircraft emissions, global warming potential (GWP), specific environmental impacts (SEI), and specific eco-cost (SEC) from 2018 to 2023. The analysis reveals significant reductions in total emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2, HC, CO, NOx) during 2020, while per-passenger emissions increased. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, total CO2 emissions in 2020 decreased by 31.45%, while emissions per passenger rose by 9.7%. Similar patterns were observed for HC, CO, and NOx. The pandemic-induced reduction in aviation activity led to a 32.1% decrease in GWP and a 31.7% reduction in SEC for the same period. However, the rapid recovery in 2021 saw emissions and environmental costs return to near pre-pandemic levels by 2023. This research provides valuable insights into the long-term environmental effects of reduced air travel during COVID-19 and highlights strategies to mitigate aviation-related emissions, such as reducing taxi times to loer pollutants and their associated environmental costs.

The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction provides a convenient approach to convert CO2 to CO, which facilitates to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Herein, the Cu/CeO2 catalyst prepared by a co‐precipitation method using a mixture of Na2CO3 and NaOH at pH of 10 (sample Cu/CeO2‐10) achieved an intrinsic reaction rate of 428.4 mmol•gcat‐1•h‐1 with 100% CO selectivity at 400 °C and CO2/H2 ratio of 1:4, which is much higher than Cu/CeO2 prepared by impregnation and other methods. Various characterizations showed the highest fraction of CuCeO2 solid solution in the calcined Cu/CeO2‐10, and formed highly dispersed Cu clusters (~2.5 nm) on partially reduced CuCeO2 solid solution with abundant of oxygen vacancies upon reduction. The Cu and oxygen vacancies facilitates the activation of H2 and CO2, respectively, resulting in lowered H2 and CO2 reaction orders. As a result, the synergy between the two components enhanced the overall RWGS activity with lowered activation energy. Moreover, the optimal catalyst is very stable in 24h stability test without detectable agglomeration of Cu clusters.

We propose a hybrid electrocatalytic‐bioelectrocatalytic reaction cascade integrated on a gas diffusion electrode for CO2 reduction under selective formation of methanol. Ag‐Bi2O3 selectively reduces gaseous CO2 to formate at neutral pH conditions. A subsequent enzymatic cascade comprising formaldehyde dehydro­genase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)‐dependent, further reduce formate sequentially to formaldehyde and methanol. The enzymatically oxi­dized redox cofactor NAD+ is regenerated through the enzyme diaphorase which is electrochemically coupled to the electrode by embedding it into a cobaltocene‐based low‐potential redox polymer. Methanol formation is confirmed using a highly selective biosensor based on alcohol oxidase in combination with horseradish peroxidase integrated into a specifically adapted redox polymer. The proposed hybrid electrocatalytic‐bioelectrocatalytic cascade is an example for a general strategy for enhancing the selectivity of electrocatalytic reac­tions and/or to replace bioelectrochemically challenging steps such as the synthesis of formate from CO2 using the highly oxygen‐sensitive formate dehydrogenase by more robust inorganic electrocatalysts.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">The (commercial) aviation sector (passenger and freight), which is strongly engaged with the world efforts to mitigate the carbon emissions and their inherent climate change effects, has accounted in 2018 for 2.4 % of global carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions (pre-pandemic levels). Despite the reductions in air travel demand during the 2020 pandemic, with a reduction of up to 80% in passenger travel during the peak pandemic period, the air travel demand has already recovered to around 80% of the pre-pandemic level, with aviation emissions in 2022 reaching around 800 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>, accounting for 2% of the global energy related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Moreover, the demand for air travel is expected to double by 2040, growing at an annual average rate of 3.4%, which means that. despite the efficiency improvement trend (average 2%/year), will almost double the aviation’s greenhouse (GHG) emissions, with a significant increase in its relative GHG share, compared to the other transport modes.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">Meanwhile the aviation sector is one of the hardest to decarbonize, with few and costly pathways available. Zero emissions technologies, such hydrogen fuel and electric batteries are currently far from commercially ready for aviation use in the short to medium term, due to the technical challenges, such as aircraft onboard liquid hydrogen storage difficulties, as well as battery weight and volume, and are unlikely ever to be able to power large or long-haul flights.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">In this scenario, the so called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a drop-in fuel concept, already available in modest amounts on a commercial scale, are seen as a promising short to medium term alternative to tackle aviation emissions, by using existing aircraft designs and infrastructure. As a drop-in fuel, the SAF enables the replacement for the fossil jet fuel by using the existing fuel delivery and storage infrastructure and existing aircraft engines, with lifespan that still ranges from 20 to 30 years. From a chemical perspective, the SAF is the liquid aviation fuel derived from non fossil carbon resources, such as biomass or organic derived waste feedstocks, as well as synthetic fuels produced from carbon capture and renewable energy sources. They might be currently used in blends with fossil jet fuel, with current blending limits ranging from 5% to 50%, depending on the feedstock and production pathway. It is estimated from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that to reach the net zero emission commitment, by 2050, around 65% of emission reductions should be reached by replacing conventional jet fuel with SAF.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">Despite its important role in the aviation decarbonization, the SAF share currently makes up only 0.1% of aviation fuel demand, which requires a huge increase in the production capacity, which might face challenges, such as feedstock availability, fuel sustainability and cost competitiveness.</div><div class="htmlview paragraph">This work presents a review of the SAF technology, with a focus on the production pathways and their environmental footprint, their use on current aircraft engines and the associated required blends, as well as the challenges associated with SAF production increase and cost reductions, still required to make it a realistic aviation decarbonization tool.</div></div>

Electrochemical C–N coupling between CO2 and N-containing small molecules is a promising strategy to close both the carbon and nitrogen loops to support the establishment of a net-zero carbon economy. However, the intricate reaction network and the contentious C–N coupling mechanism hinder the development of efficient electrocatalysts for industrial applications. Herein, we develop a graph-based approach to enable autonomous analysis of the C–N coupling mechanism for coreduction of CO2 and NO3– on single-atom catalysts (SACs). 1400 potential intermediates and 2490 C–N coupling modes are investigated based on the Cu-N4-C prototypical catalyst. We demonstrate that N-containing species with a higher reduction degree are more likely to undergo C–N coupling and the initial coupling of the C–N bond tends to occur on CO2. It is revealed that the hydrogenation energies of *NH2 and CO2, as well as their coupling energies, can serve as key indicators for catalyst recommendation. Using this approach, SACs with Mo, W, or Sb metal centers are identified as promising electrocatalysts for C–N coupling. This work presents a paradigm for automatically exploring the mechanisms of complex electrocatalytic reactions and offers a strategy for predicting highly active and selective SACs.

This study evaluates the impact of building orientation, typology, and envelope characteristics on energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in urban dwellings in subtropical climate, with a focus on Cartagena, Colombia. North-facing dwellings consistently demonstrate superior energy performance, achieving an average efficiency increase of 4.27 ± 1.77% compared to south-facing counterparts. This trend is less pronounced near the equator due to the sun’s high zenith angle. Semi-detached homes exhibit 23.17 ± 9.83% greater energy efficiency than corner houses, attributed to reduced exterior wall exposure, which lowers energy demand and CO2 emissions by 2.16 ± 0.74 kg CO2/m2 annually. Significant disparities in emissions are observed across socioeconomic strata; homes in strata 3 and 4 show the lowest emissions (6.69 ± 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), while strata 5 and 6 have the highest (10.48 ± 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), due to differences in construction quality and glazing ratios. Roofing materials also play a key role, with thermoacoustic (TAC) roofs reducing emissions by up to 5.80% in lower strata compared to asbestos–cement roofs. Furthermore, sandwich panels demonstrate substantial potential, achieving CO2 emissions reductions of up to 51.6% in strata 1 and 2 south-facing median homes and a minimum saving of 9.4% in strata 5 and 6. These findings underscore the importance of integrating energy performance criteria into public housing policies, promoting construction practices that enhance sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving occupant comfort and property value.

The increase in CO2 emissions, recognized as a global problem, is significantly influenced by energy consumption. Türkiye, which is among the developing countries, is a country dependent on foreign sources to meet its energy needs. Nevertheless, it satisfies its energy requirements through both renewable and non-renewable sources. The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the impact of consumption from renewable and non-renewable energy sources in Türkiye between 1990 and 2020 on CO2 emissions and investigate the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. We apply the traditional and structural break unit root tests to check whether the variables are stationary. We employed the newly accepted Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method to estimate the long-run relationship between variables. According to the findings, there is a U-shaped relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions. It means that the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is not applicable in Türkiye. Moreover, it concluded that non-renewable energy consumption plays a role in emission increase, while renewable energy consumption is effective in emission reduction.

Abstract Renewable hydrogen (H 2 ) will play a pivotal role in the decarbonization of the energy and industrial sectors. However, during the transition to a clean energy system, the production of H 2 with electrolysis runs the risk of increasing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions if the electricity system is still partly based on fossil fuels. The European Union has set ambitious targets for the production of H 2 and defined strict rules in delegated acts to the Renewable Energy Directive, when H 2 produced with public grid electricity can be counted as renewable. This paper analyzes two grid criteria central to these rules, renewable energy share and CO 2 emission intensity, in several future scenarios of the European energy system. By uniquely focusing on the impact of H _2 production from the perspective of EU grid criteria, this study offers a novel assessment of how these regulations interact with the evolving energy landscape. Fulfillment of the renewable H 2 grid criteria strongly depends on the future build-out of renewable energy resources, electricity demand, and amount of domestically produced H 2 . In a scenario with ambitious renewable build-out until 2030, represented by current drafts of national energy and climate plans, many countries will meet the stated criteria. However, adding a high amount of domestically produced H 2 partly cancels out this effect. In a scenario with reduced renewable build-outs, comparable to historically achieved renewable resource additions, many fewer countries achieve the grid criteria. Finally, net CO 2 emission reductions are analyzed by comparing power sector emission changes with the opportunity emissions that result from fossil fuels replacements with H 2 . The results indicate that using H 2 in CO 2 intensive use cases can lead to emission reductions, even if grid criteria are below the thresholds defined in the delegated acts. However, reduced renewable energy expansion poses the risk of not achieving any emission reductions at all with the produced H 2 .

Efficiently harnessing excess atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is crucial for closing the carbon cycle effectively. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECR) holds significant promise for producing valuable products and environmentally friendly chemicals. Carbon monoxide (CO) stands out as one of the most economically viable products of ECR.[1,2] While noble metals commonly catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion, alternative non-noble catalysts are essential for cost reduction. Molecular catalysts like cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) offer high ECR activity but limited stability (< 10 h).[3–5] Moreover, the production cost of porous transport layers (PTLs) significantly impacts ECR electrolyzer costs, with commercial carbon-PTLs adding a 20% increase.[6–8] Our work focuses on developing low-cost, non-woven cellulose-based porous PTLs for electrochemical CO 2 -to-CO conversion. By depositing a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) catalyst layer over our PTLs, we fabricated ECR-functioning gas-diffusion-electrodes (GDEs) for both flow-cell and zero-gap electrolyzers. Under optimal conditions, the Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE CO ) reached 92 % at a high current density of 200 mA cm −2 . Furthering the architecture of the GDEs, CoPc was incorporated into the initial PTL slurry, forming ECR-active PTLs without the need for an additional catalyst layer. The new GDE architecture favored the CoPc-distribution by enhancing the contact and interactions with the carbon substrate and demonstrated a stable electrolysis process for over 50 h in a zero-gap electrolyzer at 200 mA cm −2 with a FE CO of 80 %.[9] This study marks a substantial breakthrough in developing for the first time, paper-based functionalized PTLs for the ECR. Marking a significant contribution to the progression of the ECR into practical implications. [1] M. Jouny, W. Luc, F. Jiao, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 57 (2018) 2165–2177. [2] G.O. Larrazábal, A.J.

The rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) holds promise as an energy storage system for the next generation due to its high theoretical energy density, safe aqueous electrolyte, environmental friendliness, and cost-effectiveness of zinc. However, the efficiency of ZABs is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Noble metals such as platinum (Pt), iridium dioxide (IrO 2 ), and ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) are commonly used as advanced electrocatalyst materials. Nonetheless, their scarcity, high cost, unstable catalytic properties, and susceptibility to carbon monoxide poisoning limit the large-scale applications of ZABs. Therefore, exploring non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs is crucial, with transition metals being viable alternatives. Recently, bimetallic transition metal layered double hydroxide (LDH) has emerged as a promising candidate for OER catalysts due to its high specific surface area, abundant active sites, and synergistic effects between two transition metals. However, LDH still faces challenges such as poor electrical conductivity and self-aggregation during fabrication. In this work, we developed a three-dimensional core-shell structure, enabling the growth of LDH on nitrogen-doped porous carbon framework (N-C) materials to address these challenges. The N-C material, derived from zeolitic-imidazole framework (ZIF) material after pyrolysis, shows promise as an ORR catalyst. ZIF, a subclass of metal-organic framework (MOF), boasts high nitrogen content and inherits MOF advantages such as a high surface area, abundant active sites, and chemical stability. Furthermore, utilizing mesoporous silica as a hard template allows us to maintain the dodecahedral structure of ZIF and create mesoporous structures after annealing. The core-shell structure developed in this study demonstrates superior OER and ORR catalytic activity, offering a promising direction for the design of bifunctional catalysts for high-performance ZABs.

The brain is highly innervated by sympathetic nerve fibres; however, their physiological purpose is poorly understood. We hypothesized that unilateral cerebral norepinephrine (NE) spillover, an index of cerebral sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), would be elevated when engaging the baroreflex [via lower-body negative pressure (LBNP; -20 and -40 Torr)] and respiratory chemoreflexes [via carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) administration (+8 Torr)], independently, and in combination. Twelve young and healthy participants (5 females) underwent simultaneous blood sampling from the right radial artery and internal jugular vein. Tritiated NE was infused through the participants' right forearm vein. Right internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery blood flow were measured using Duplex ultrasound. Unilateral cerebral NE spillover remained unchanged when only LBNP was applied (P=0.29), but increased with hypercapnia (P=0.035), and -40 Torr LBNP + CO 2 (P<0.01). There were no changes in total NE spillover during the LBNP and LBNP+CO 2 trials (both P=0.66), nor during CO 2 alone (P=0.13). No correlations were present between the increase in unilateral cerebral NE spillover during -40 Torr LBNP+CO 2 and reductions in internal carotid artery blood flow (P=0.56). These results indicate that baroreflex and respiratory chemoreflex stressors elevate cerebral SNA; however, the observed cerebral sympathetic activation has no impact on blood flow regulation in the internal carotid artery.

Electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is known to proceed at lower overpotentials with the presence of ionic liquids (ILs) in the electrolyte. However, the role of ILs in modulating CO 2 RR, even for the most studied 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF 4 ]) remains unclear. In this study, the electric field and the hydrogen bonding effects induced by [EMIM][BF 4 ] and hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), including water and a series of alcohols, in acetonitrile were examined on Ag. By employing voltammetry, in-situ enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that the initial electron transfer to CO 2 occurs at reduced overpotentials when it is confined between the [EMIM] + ring planes and the electrode surface. This confinement of CO 2 stabilizes it at the interface and enables its conversion to CO, accompanied by the generation of carbene and water as by-products. Furthermore, our findings suggest water (< 0.5 M) acts as the hydrogen bond donor as opposed to serving as the primary source of free protons. Based on this finding, we further show how the extend of hydrogen bonding as varied by various alcohols alter the microenvironment in synergy with [EMIM] + at the electrode-electrolyte interface for fine tuning of the thermodynamics of CO 2 RR. The clarified role of the imidazolium based ILs and hydrogen bond donors, and the demonstrated enhancement in CO 2 RR will advance non-aqueous electrolyte development and inform future kinetic studies.

Manganese dioxide has garnered significant attention as a promising catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media due to its excellent catalytic activity, low cost, durability, and scalability. Despite its promising catalytic activity, MnO 2 suffers from limitations such as low conductivity, particle dissolution, and diminished mass transport properties, particularly in high-throughput environments. Researchers typically couple MnO 2 with high conductivity and high surface area materials such as conductive carbon black to overcome these challenges. However, this method still presents challenges, such as diminished catalyst-carbon interactions and the loss of catalytic active sites by the surrounding of larger carbon particles. In this study, we present a two-step synthesis method, initially proposed for the application of MnO 2 as supercapacitor materials 1 , for the improvement of MnO 2 catalytic activity towards the ORR. This synthesis method was achieved using diazonium chemistry, which involves the direct chemical attachment of KJB carbon black with MnO 2 via a phenyl group linkage site. This process was done so that the mass ratio of MnO2 and KJB was 50:50. The synthesized materials were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm varying morphologies, particle sizes, and material compositions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were utilized to analyze the phases and crystallinities of the materials. Each characterization step was done before and after the chemical attachment process to ensure the modifications were performed. The electrochemical activity of the materials was investigated using three-electrode cells to study the ORR activities and stabilities of the synthesized materials. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) data were employed to analyze kinetic current densities, the number of electrons transferred, and the hydrogen peroxide production rates. Furthermore, the catalyst materials were implemented into aluminum-air battery configurations where polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and multistep chronoamperometry experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the modified MnO 2 catalyst materials. Overall, implementing this process led to substantial increases in the catalytic activities morphologically dependent MnO 2 particles towards the ORR and highlighted the significance of this research in advancing the understanding and application of MnO 2 catalysts in energy conversion and storage technologies.

Abstract Dynamic resistance exercise (RE) produces sinusoidal fluctuations in blood pressure, with hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion commonly observed immediately following RE. Whether the cerebral vasculature adapts to these regular blood pressure challenges is unclear. This study examined the cerebrovascular response to post‐dynamic RE orthostasis. RE‐trained ( n = 15, female = 4) and healthy untrained individuals ( n = 15, female = 12) completed five stands: one after seated rest, with each of the subsequent four stands occurring immediately following a set of 10 repetitions of unilateral leg extension exercise at 60% of their one repetition maximum. Beat‐to‐beat blood pressure, mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv mean ) and end‐tidal carbon dioxide were measured throughout. During standing the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and MCAv mean nadirs were identified. There was no difference between groups for age (mean ± SD, 26 ± 7 RE‐trained vs. 25 ± 6 years untrained, P = 0.683) or weight (78 ± 15 vs. 71 ± 15 kg, P = 0.683). At MAP nadir during the post‐exercise stand, a greater reduction in MAP was observed in the RE‐trained group (e.g., set 4, −45 ± 11 vs. −36 ± 6 mmHg, training effect P = 0.026). However, post‐exercise stand MCAv mean at MCAv mean nadir was not different (e.g., set 4, −20 ± 7 vs. −17 ± 6 cm/s, interaction effect P = 0.478). Rate of regulation was higher in the RE‐trained group (set 1, 0.301 ± 0.170 vs. 0.167 ± 0.009, training effect P = 0.023). Despite RE‐trained individuals demonstrating greater absolute reductions in MAP during orthostasis following RE, there were no differences in MCAv mean , suggesting that habitual RE may mitigate post‐exercise cerebral hypoperfusion.

Conservation tillage practices within integrated systems offer a viable strategy for restoring degraded pastures on slopes. This study evaluated the short-term (2 years) impacts of soil tillage types and young silvopastoral systems on soil hydrophysical properties, CO2 emissions and erosion processes in a 38% sloping area following pasture renovation. Three management systems (full-sun pasture; and silvopastoral system with eucalyptus or with gliricidia) were evaluated alongside three soil tillage types (downhill ploughing with a disc plough; contour ploughing with a mouldboard plough; and no-tillage). The results revealed that soil tillage led to bulk density and penetration resistance reductions of up to 85% compared to no-tillage. The decrease in bulk density was associated with increased total porosity (particularly macroporosity), resulting in enhanced soil water infiltration rates (up to > 76.5%). However, disturbance induced significant environmental disadvantages, including nearly twofold increases in soil losses, water losses and increased CO2 emissions (> 43%). Young silvopastoral systems demonstrated a soil hydrophysical quality comparable to full-sun pasture and did not significantly affect CO2 emissions, soil water content or temperature. Notably, no-tillage resulted in lower CO2 emissions and soil temperatures but higher soil water content, particularly when integrated with tree species, effectively minimizing soil and water losses. These findings underscore the critical role of no-tillage practices within silvopastoral systems in enhancing soil conservation, especially on erosion-prone sloping lands.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 RR) holds promise for carbon capture and utilization (CCU), aiming to produce carbon-neutral fuels and valuable chemical intermediates. Copper (Cu) is recognized as the primary metallic catalyst facilitating C-C coupling reactions to yield multi-carbon compounds. Many researchers have been developing Cu catalysts, such as oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu), and tandem catalysts to increase the kinetics of C-C coupling. The investigation of tandem catalysts, especially those derived from oxides of copper (OD-Cu), has been conducted to improve selectivity towards multi-carbon compounds like ethylene and ethanol. Nonetheless, the effect of the loading structure of the CO-producing catalyst within the tandem catalyst on CO 2 RR performance has not been fully explored. In this study, we synthesized Au nanoparticles with different sizes and loading densities on Cu 2 O through the galvanic replacement reaction and examined their influence on CO 2 RR properties. Tandem catalysts containing smaller Au nanoparticles demonstrated heightened activity in the electrochemical CO 2 RR, leading to an anodic shift in potential. Additionally, tandem catalysts with smaller Au nanoparticles exhibited improved Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and partial current densities (PCDs) for C 2+ compounds. The tandem catalysts with larger Au nanoparticles also showed better CO 2 RR performance than the original OD-Cu; however, it was found that CO 2 RR results of the tandem catalysts with a small size of Au nanoparticles were superior to those with large size of Au nanoparticles. Interestingly, the FEs and PCDs of n-propanol, a C 3 product, increased as the coverage of Au nanoparticles increased. This behavior contrasts with the case of ethylene and ethanol. The maximum Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of these C 2 products from tandem catalysts did not exceed those from OD-Cu. The effectiveness of the tandem effect relies on the localized concentration of CO, heightened by the CO-producing catalyst situated on the confined OD-Cu surface. The improvement of the selectivity towards the C 3 product may come from the interface between the Au nanoparticles and OD-Cu, where the C 1 -C 2 coupling reaction is favorable. We utilized a Nickel single-atom catalyst (Ni-SAC) to create a high local concentration of CO within the catalyst layer. Despite this, we did not observe any tandem effect. This suggests that the proximity between CO active sites and C 2+ active sites plays a crucial role in triggering the CO spillover effect. Our results shed light on a strategy for constructing efficient tandem structures in CO 2 RR.

Abstract Electric vehicle (EV) deployment provides an opportunity to reduce emissions in Texas, which has the greatest transportation emissions in the United States. This study aims to evaluate the impact of light-duty EV (LDEV) adoption through a capacity expansion model of the Texas power grid (Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT). Particularly, this work investigates how various LDEV adoption rates and charging strategies (i.e., managed and unmanaged) affect the electricity generation capacity mix, hourly dispatch, transmission capacity, carbon emissions, and costs in ERCOT. Our findings show that unmanaged charging strategies can lead to 30%–70% cumulative tailpipe CO2 emission reductions in the power and transportation sectors by 2050, depending on whether the LDEV adoption is 50% or 100%, respectively. These CO2 reductions are associated with 2.5%–6.7% increases in total power system costs compared to a scenario with no EV adoption. Furthermore, we find that managed charging can lead to 10% less transmission capacity compared to unmanaged charging in the complete LDV electrification scenarios. These results indicate that policies incentivizing EV adoption and managed charging strategies can facilitate sustainable decarbonization in the transportation sector while minimally increasing costs relative to a scenario without increased EV adoption.

Transition metal single-atom catalysts supported on N-doped graphene (M-N-Cs) offer significant advantages in metal utilization and uniformity of active sites compared to traditional heterogeneous catalysts. They are particularly notable for their superior electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) performance. Various modifications have been explored, including different metal combinations, different first shell elements (N, C, S, B), and coordination numbers, to enhance electrocatalytic ORR activities. Another emerging focus is the link between their local structure and spin state. The Zhenan Bao and Jaramillo groups recently found that the catalytic activity of the NiN x moiety stems from its tetrahedrally distorted structure because it stabilizes the high-spin Ni state more than the low-spin state.[1] The local structure and its distortion can be modified by adjusting the carbon nanotube diameter,[2] pore size,[3] layering,[4] or by adding ligands at the first or second shell.[5] In this study, we have conducted a computational screening of M-N-Cs with 3d, 4d, and 5d metals and local structures including square planar, tetragonal pyramidal, and tetrahedral symmetries. Metals in their divalent states within the MN 4 units exhibited a V-shaped trend in formation energy correlated with increasing atomic numbers across each series. This pattern appears to be linked to the interaction between the two electrons of the N 4 ligand and the d electron count of the metals, and it also emerged in the *O/*OH adsorption energy plots. Additionally, the preferred spin state varied with the metal type and structural symmetry, influencing electron distribution and crystal field splitting. These factors collectively impacted the binding energies with adsorbents, subsequently altering oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Further, we explored the adsorption energies of various intermediates (*CO, *H, *Cl, and *N 2 H) relevant to carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), chlorine evolution reaction (ClER), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), respectively. Our primary objective was to identify optimal metal-structure combinations for enhanced catalytic performance. To achieve this, we considered several descriptors including partial Integrated Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (ICOHP), metal d-band center, Madelung energy, and metal ionization potential. Moving forward, we aim to extend these findings by incorporating distorted coordination environments and integrating experimental synthesis strategies to induce such distortions, potentially unlocking new pathways for catalytic efficiency enhancement.

Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2R) is a promising route to enable a circular economy for production of carbon-based materials using non-fossil-based feed stocks. Copper catalysts have been shown to be proficient at converting CO 2 to ethylene as a precursor to polymer-based material synthesis. Production of ethylene at high faradaic efficiency and low voltage is necessary for commercial-scale viability of eCO2R as a technology, but the current state of the art does not meet these key performance indicators. We have synthesized and characterized quaternary ammonia-based polyphenylene oxide (QPPO) ionomers as alternatives to commercially available ionomers, and the QPPO ionomers showed increased faradaic efficiency towards ethylene while also decreasing full cell voltage. In this presentation, we demonstrate how continuum modeling was used to identify that underlying cause for achieving higher ethylene faradaic efficiency and lower cell voltage was the prevention of flooding of the gas diffusion layer in a zero-gap CO 2 electrolyzer. We simulated two cell assemblies to elucidate the phenomena governing performance differences: one with a bare copper catalyst between the gas diffusion medium and membrane, and the other with an ionomer layer between the catalyst layer and the membrane. To validate our full cell model against experimental results for each cell assembly, we introduced a flooded region of the cathode diffusion media. By fitting the thickness of the flooded region, we were able to capture all trends for cell voltage and faradaic efficiency toward four products over three applied current densities. Voltage breakdown analysis showed that the ~150 mV lower cell voltage with the addition of the ionomer layer resulted from decreased charge and mass transfer overpotentials at the cathode due to the high aqueous CO 2 concentration in the cathode catalyst layer and decrease in CO 2 consumption to bicarbonate via the presence of liquid water in the gas diffusion layer. Overall, these results show the importance of incorporating liquid water into accurate modeling of CO 2 electrolyzers and water management in experimental work to achieve commercial-scale electrolyzer performance.

CO 2 emissions have become a series problem since the industrial revolution, the detrimental effect of CO 2 emissions raise people’s awareness in recent years. Scientists are eagerly searching the sustainable energy as the replacement of the petrochemical industry. The carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) can reduce the CO 2 amount in the atmosphere as well as generating the valuable carbon-based chemicals spontaneously, which is a strong potential way for the next generation green energy. In our work, we suggested a strategical design of the copper cathode in the zero-gap membrane electrolyte assembly (MEA) electrolyzer of CO 2 RR, the electrolyte-free cathodic environment caused the consequence of inefficient and ineffective activation. The magnesium oxide (MgO) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2 ) incorporated with the copper oxide (CuO) as the initial catalyst (CuO-MgO/Mg(OH) 2 ), with the manipulation of three gradually increasing potential range of cyclic voltammetry (CV) as the break-in process, the MgO/(OH) 2 totally dissolved when contacting the located CO 2 (g) and H 2 O (l) crossed from the anode which brought by the cation through the electric field attraction. The absent of the dissolved MgO/Mg(OH) 2 would provide the sufficient triple-phase boundary, with the accessible reactant CO 2 (g) and H 2 O (l) and proper local environment, the high surface area copper (HSA-Cu) eventually creating a proper condition for CO 2 RR. The high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) 276 μC/cm 2 and 11.3 mF/cm 2 had been proved in the monolayer copper oxidation redox detection and capacitance double layer (C dl ) measurement, respectively. The HSA-Cu had outstanding performance of the partial current density j C2H4 = 44.7 mA/cm 2 at 3.0 V and Faradaic efficiency FE C2H4 = 27.3 % at 2.8 V for C 2 H 4 product. A 4-fold j C2H4 and 2.5-fold FE C2H4 improvement compared with nano Cu, in equal voltage applied.

Purpose: The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality in Vietnam. Methodology: The research employed is the non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) approach, utilizing time-series data from 1986 to 2022. The strength of NARDL lies in its consideration of both increasing and decreasing trends in independent variables such as Economic Growth, Energy from Renewable Resources and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in a non-linear relationship with the dependent variable, CO2. Findings: The research findings indicate that overall economic growth is positively associated with an increase in CO2 emissions, aligning with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory in the first stage of the inverted U-shape. However, the EKC hypothesis is not supported in later stages, as environmental degradation persists despite economic growth. Renewable resources in primary energy have increased from 6% in 1986 to 16% in 2022, while FDI has risen from 0.03% of GDP in 1986 to 4.3% of GDP in 2021, resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions. In other words, the Pollution Haven Hypothesis does not hold in Vietnam. With a net-zero CO2 target by 2050, Vietnam necessitates rapid, short-term changes to neutralize carbon emissions effectively in the long term. Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: To simultaneously ensure economic growth while adhering to Vietnam's carbon neutrality objectives, followings solutions are recommended: (1) increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources and reducing fossil fuel dependency; (2) incorporating modern, environmentally friendly technologies in the industrial sector to diminish resource-intensive practices and reduce dependence on fossil fuels; (3) establishing a legal framework and conditions to attract FDI in technology-intensive sectors, thereby mitigating carbon emissions.

Stabilizing GHG emissions in the agri-food sector is crucial for climate change mitigation. Tea is one of the most consumed drinks worldwide and such high levels of consumption necessitate for the carbon footprint (CF) assessment of its entire life cycle encompassing all six stages such as cultivation, processing, packaging, transportation, consumption and disposal to understand the environmental impact of tea industry at large. In this context, this study is a maiden attempt to quantify and compare CF for the entire life cycle of all three types of tea such as black, green and white tea in a single research paper by employing the life cycle assessment (LCA) method in significant tea growing areas of Tamil Nadu, India. The findings revealed that the consumption stage contributed the highest CO2 emissions, accounting for 45%-56% to overall CF. Black tea consumption contributed 45% (5.8 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea) of the total CF, while green tea and white tea had higher CF (8.3 kg CO?-eq/kg of made tea), contributing 56% to the total CF. The processing stage was the second largest source, contributing 12-19% to overall CF, followed by packaging (15-17%) and cultivation (10-11%) stages. Overall, the total CF (cradle to grave) for black tea and white tea had a similar value of 12.9 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea, whereas green tea registered a higher value of 14.79 kg CO2-eq/kg of made tea. Furthermore, this assessment identified hotspots of GHG emissions. It enabled the recommendation of CF reduction measures to promote carbon neutrality in tea sector while being a part of global climate change mitigation efforts.

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has been widely acknowledged as a key component in the global transition from fossil energy to renewable energy powered society to combat climate change. Cu is the only metal capable of converting CO 2 to valuable multicarbon products with decent yields. Despite intense research efforts, mechanistic understanding of Cu-catalyzed CO 2 RR remains incomplete. A key point with impactions for catalyst design is whether the CO 2 -to-CO conversion and the further conversion of CO are independent steps in the reaction network of the CO 2 RR. In this talk, I will discuss our recent results showing that the presence of CO 2 enhances the Cu-catalyzed CORR to multicarbon products, and intriguingly, not by acting as an additional surface of carbon. Co-electrolysis studies show that there are at least two types of Cu sites with distinct activities, with one type favoring the CO 2 -to-CO conversion (Cu CO2 ), and the other more active in the CORR (Cu CO ). Analysis based a proposed two-site model shows that CO adsorbed on Cu CO is at least six times more active in the formation of multicarbon products than that on Cu CO2 . Experiments conducted on single crystal Cu facets suggest that Cu CO2 corresponds to Cu(111)-like sites and Cu CO is associated with undercoordinated Cu sites.

Cu-based materials are regarded as effective electrocatalysts for CO2RR; however, Cu+, the active site for C–C coupling, is unstable under reduction conditions. Herein, Mg2+ is doped into the Cu2O/CuO interface and generates high-activity Cu+–O-Mg2+ sites following electrochemical activation. The electron-withdrawing effect of Mg2+ in the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site stabilizes Cu+ and optimizes the reaction pathway for CO2RR. At a partial current density of 567.21 ± 5.18 mA cm–2, the Faraday efficiency (FE) for C2+ products can reach 81.03 ± 0.74%. In situ Raman and in situ infrared spectroscopy reveal that the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site significantly enhances the coverage and stability of *CO, which contributes to the ultrahigh selectivity of CO2 toward C2+ products. Density functional theory (DFT) studies indicate that *CO2 is readily adsorbed on the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site, facilitating the more effective generation of *CO, which subsequently promotes the electrochemical C–C coupling step and accelerates the production of C2+ products.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is attracting technology because it can convert CO 2 into a useful resource with zero emissions by using surplus electricity and renewable energy. For achieving efficient electrolysis of CO 2 , the development of a high performance electrocatalysts is required. Copper (Cu) is the only metal that is capable of electrochemically converting CO 2 to hydrocarbons, but the high overpotential of hydrocarbon formation and the low selectivity of the reduction products have been problems. One of the solutions to these problems is the hybridization of metal and organic materials, in which the metal serves as the CO 2 reduction reaction sites and the organic material stabilizes the intermediates [1]. In this study, we have electrodeposited Cu with five different types of amino acids which is expecting stabilization of CO 2 reductive intermediates and evaluated its catalytic activity of electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . The electrodeposited Cu with amino acids was obtained by a constant current electrolysis at -2.0 mA cm -2 for 1.0 C cm -2 from the aqueous solutions containing 10 mmol dm -3 CuSO 4 ･5H 2 O, 0.1 mol dm -3 Na 2 SO 4 , and 1.0 mmol dm -3 amino acids in a three-electrode cell with carbon paper (CP) as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The pH of electrolytic bath was fixed at 1.10 by adding H 2 SO 4 . The obtained electrodeposited Cu samples were characterized by Raman measurement, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 has been conducted by a constant potential electrolysis at -1.27 V vs. RHE of 0.5 mol dm -3 KHCO 3 aqueous solutions saturated with CO 2 . The amount of reductive gas products was quantified by gas chromatograph- mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and gas chromatograph thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD). The chronopotentiograms obtained during the electrodeposition of Cu, both in the presence and absence of 1.0 mmol dm −3 of the various amino acids showed different potential required to reach a current of −4.0 mA depending on the amino acids. However, considering the result of the open-circuit-potential measurement, the amino acids do not form complexes with Cu 2+ , suggesting that the electrolysis species remain consistent regardless of the amino acid present in the Cu electrodeposition bath. Therefore, the differences observed in the chronopotentiograms during Cu electrodeposition are attributed to the adsorption of amino acids on the electrodeposited Cu. The adsorption of amino acids on electrodeposited Cu was confirmed by Raman spectra and EDS spectra obtained from cross-sectional HAADF-STEM images. The peak of Raman spectra originating from amino acids was observed from electrodeposited Cu when Cu electrodeposition was conducted with amino acids, confirming the higher ratio of N and Cu on the surface compared to within the particle in the EDS spectra. Surface morphologies were observed by using SEM. CP has fiber-like structure but electrodeposited Cu without and with amino acids were deposited such coating CP fiber. The particle size of electrodeposited Cu with amino acids was more homogeneous, and the particles were more densely packed together than pure electrodeposited Cu. However, changing diffraction patterns and peak broadening due to loading amino acids in XRD were not observed. The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 on electrodeposited Cu samples was performed and the faradic efficiency (FE) of the CO 2 reduction gas products were calculated. All electrodeposited Cu with and without amino acids showed a higher FE for the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 compared to Cu foil (24.2%) and different values depending on amino acids. In particular, electrodeposited with L-histidine containing imidazole groups showed a high FE of 67.6%, effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. This finding highlights the important role of functional groups in amino acids, especially imidazole, in facilitating the electrochemical conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 . This study shows that certain functional groups in amino acids have a crucial influence on the catalytic efficiency of electrodeposited Cu in CO 2 reduction reaction applications. [1] S.

Reactive capture - the integration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and upgrade - bypasses the energy-intensive CO 2 regeneration step and thereby offers potential to reduce both capital and energy costs. Alkali hydroxide solutions are a common type of capture solution for reactive capture, wherein CO 2 is chemically absorbed in the form of carbonate and/or bicarbonate. The composition and pH of the post-capture solution depend on the CO 2 concentration of the CO 2 source used and the capture duration. Lower pH levels yield higher bicarbonate concentrations, facilitating greater CO 2 release during the reactive capture step and resulting in enhanced electrolysis performance. For example, direct electrochemical reduction of a pure carbonate solution (pH~12.2) has a theoretical carbon monoxide (CO) Faradaic efficiency (FE) cap at 50%, but no cap exists for a pure bicarbonate solution (pH~8.2), leading to better electrolysis performance and lower operating expenditures (OPEX) for the capture and conversion cycle. However, achieving a low pH post-capture solution with higher bicarbonate content slows the capture rate, necessitating either a bigger contactor or longer capture time, thereby increasing capital expenditures (CAPEX) for the capture step. Using a silver catalyst, we report here the electrolysis energy efficiency (EE) of CO 2 to CO using a 2M potassium hydroxide solution with a post-capture pH ranging from 13.5 (hydroxide and carbonate mix) to 8.2 (pure bicarbonate). We conducted a technical-economic analysis (TEA) to assess the CAPEX and OPEX of an industrial-scale reactive capture plant that captures both point source (10%) and atmospheric (420 ppm) CO 2 using 2M potassium hydroxide with different post-capture pH values. The TEA includes a sensitivity analysis to account for improvements in electrolysis performance and reduced costs due to technological advancement and economies of scale in the future. Our results demonstrate that there is an optimal post-capture pH for potassium hydroxide-based reactive capture that balances the capture cost and electrolysis performance. This study serves as a guideline for choosing an industrial relevant pH to work with for future hydroxide-based reactive capture research.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) opened new opportunities for rapid development of modern portable devices. LIBs use mainly the intercalation cathodes represented by transition metal oxides and phosphates as cathodes, which are incapable of fulfilling the requirements of electric vehicles and high energy storage systems due to their limited energy density (less than 400 W h kg -1 ). Moreover, intercalation type cathodes have several drawbacks associated with high cost of materials and safety issues which also limit their use in electric vehicles and large-scale power systems. Therefore, implementation of alternative systems with higher specific capacity, energy density and inexpensive sources is required to meet high demands. In this regard, lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy systems due to high theoretical specific capacity, which results in a theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg −1 [1]. Moreover, sulfur has low cost, considerably less environmentally impact and abundant resources [2]. However, the implementation of Li-S batteries is hindered due to several drawbacks such as low conductivity of sulfur, complicated redox reactions, shuttle of soluble intermediates (polysulfides, LiPS), dendrite growth on lithium anode and volumetric expansion of cathode upon reduction to Li2S2/Li2S which leads to structural degradation and lower the cycle life of batteries [3]. The shuttle effect can be suppressed via encapsulation of sulfur into carbon matrices, synthesis of conductive sulfur composites with polymers, etc. In our recent works we reported on carbon materials with metal -oxides, -sulfides and -nitrides as sulfur immobilizers exhibiting strong affinity to LiPSs. Despite such strong immobilization effect of metal compounds, the conversion of sulfur to the end products needs to be enhanced by introduction of electrocatalysts. In this work, the synergistic effect of heterostructures with double functions, titanium dioxide as LiPSs immobilizer with Ni nanoparticles as electrocatalysts were prepared and analyzed as an effective sulfur host material. The present study focuses on the implementation of composite compounds with dual effects on the performance enhancement of Li-S batteries.

In recent years, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) have attracted attention as an important technology for achieving carbon neutral society due to high energy efficiency without carbon dioxide emission during power generation. In order to cost reduction of PEMFC, the use of cheaper structural materials, such as stainless steels, that possess excellent processability, has been studied in substitution for titanium for bipolar plate (separator). The practical environment in PEMFC is severely corrosive: high temperature, acidic, and fluoride-containing solution. Many study has been conducted on the development of materials that have sufficient corrosion resistance and low contact resistance enabling long-term durability even in such severe environment. However, present evaluation method is insufficient for diagnosis the lifetime of bipolar plate. The new evaluation technique, that accurately simulates the environment inside PEMFC and appropriately accelerates the corrosion degradation reaction, make it easier to predict the lifetime of products and precisely evaluate the performance of newly developed materials. Therefore, the purpose of this study is development of novel corrosion evaluation method with high reproducibility, high and rapid diagnosis performance via applying various electrochemical measurements simulating PEMFC environment and for elucidation the corrosion behavior in practical environment. Firstly, several common corrosion resistance tests were performed in a specific solution (80 ℃, pH3, 10ppm Cl-, 3ppm F-) that simulated the internal environment of PEMFC. As a result, potentiostatic polarization (0.724 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 24 h) showed poor reproducibility because the corrosion behavior in later stage depends largely on the occurrence of localized corrosion initial stage of the test. In the case of potentiodynamic polarization(+1 mV/s sweep from open-circuit potential), risk of localized corrosion could be investigated, however, it was not suitable to predict long-term corrosion behavior. In the case of potentiodynamic cyclic polarization (cyclic voltammetry), it was found that the cathodic sweep, which never occur at in-sever PEMFC condition, inhibited the stable growth of the passivation film on the steel surface by reduction reaction, resulting in improperly accelerated excessive corrosion. Then, new testing method of the intermittent polarization, which was a combination of potentiostatic polarization and open-circuit condition, was performed. It has the advantage in flexibility of testing conditions such as polarization potential and duty cycle in accordance with to the degree the corrosion acceleration. In fact, it was found that the localized corrosion caused by initial stage of potentiostatic polarization step was repassivated during the following open circuit step. Therefore, the reproducibility was improved and the passive film growth was properly evaluated by intermittent polarization test, therefore. It was expected to be promising technique to diagnose the long-term durability of PEMFC bipolar plate. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the intermittent potentiostatic polarization method, a variety of type 304 stainless steel specimens with different corrosion resistance were used. The detailed results will be presented on the relevant session.

Photoelectrochemical biohybrids combine the advantages of light harvesting semiconductors and biocatalysts into a single compact device. However, limited device stability, the use of toxic elements and non-innocent external components (buffers, mediators or sacrificial reagents) makes a sustainable artificial photosynthetic reaction, where fuel production is coupled to water oxidation, difficult to achieve. Here, we introduce organic photoelectrodes connected to an inverse opal TiO2 matrix that hosts efficient hydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase, driving direct solar fuel synthesis. By co-immobilising carbonic anhydrase, supported by simulations and spectroscopic investigations, the PCE10:EH-IDTBR photobiocathodes generate unprecedented photocurrent densities of up to −8 mA cm−2 in a pH neutral bicarbonate solution, attaining stable H2 production or selective CO2-to-formate conversion over 10 h. Semi-artificial photosynthesis is achieved by assembling the photobiocathode with a BiVO4 photoanode in an artificial leaf device for unassisted CO2 reduction coupled to O2 evolution, attaining a faradaic yield of 87% over 24 h of operation.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of sunlight into a chemical energy of hydrogen (H 2 ) through water splitting has been studied extensively to achieve production of storable and transportable energy sources from sunlight. Reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) using water (H 2 O) as an electron source into a more reduced chemical species is also an important subject for utilization of solar energy because of its possible production of energy-rich carbonaceous compounds without the use of fossil resources. Among the various possible systems, a coupling of two different semiconductor electrodes termed a Z-scheme system has been studied as an attractive concept in recent years. For the photocathode side in the Z-scheme system, Cu-based selenides and sulfides and their mixed forms of selenosulfides crystallized in chalcopyrite and kesterite structures, which were originally used as photovoltaic materials, were shown to be effective upon modifications on their surfaces for inducing water reduction. A ternary chalcopyrite CuGaSe 2 is one of the attractive materials for this application because of its wide bandgap energy (1.67 eV) for achieving a positive onset potential for water reduction. However, compared to other narrow-gap chalcopyrite- and kesterite-based systems such as CIGS (Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 , a marked improvement of PEC performance over the CuGaSe 2 -based photocathode has not been achieved. In this study, PEC activity for water reduction (H 2 liberation) over a co-evaporated CuGaSe 2 compact thin film modified with a CdS layer and Pt deposits under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) radiation was evaluated, specifically focusing on the impact of a Cu-deficient layer (CDL) loaded on the top part of the CuGaSe 2 film. It was found that the intentional loading of the CDL with an appropriate thickness was effective for achieving a large current flow and relatively positive photocurrent onset. The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) reached 6.6% over the best photocathode used. Moreover, the highest photocurrent onset potential of more than 0.9 V vs. RHE was achieved over the photocathode based on the CuGaSe 2 film having an extremely thick CDL (200 nm) with a relatively thick CdS layer (90 nm) due to efficient spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, though the thick CDL was also detrimental for efficient photoabsorption of CuGaSe 2 , resulting in appreciable decrease in photocurrent densities when compared to those obtained over photocathodes based on CuGaSe 2 films covered with a relatively thin CDL. Furthermore, an appreciable increase in current density was observed by applying intentional doping of rubidium (Rb), leading to the best STH of 8%. Although further investigation is required, increase in porosity at the heterointerface induced by the Rh doping would contribute for the result. Therefore, regulation of properties at the p-n heterointerface should be important for designing chalcopyrite- photocathodes for further improvements of PEC parameters of water reduction. The concept would also be applicable for preparations of the other PEC devices aiming for water oxidation as well as CO 2 reduction.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 has the potential to convert CO 2 into carbon-based fuels by using renewable energy. For many years, copper based cathodes have been highlighted as the quintessential electrocatalytic surface for CO 2 reduction (exemplified by the work of Hori). While gas-diffusion electrodes have shown than industrially relevant reaction rates can be achieved using relatively simple cathode materials, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the behaviour of copper cathodes in aqueous solutions. In particular, a review of the literature reveals that a very wide range of product selectivities are found at seemingly similar conditions (Figure 1). Rather surprisingly this review shows that sometimes copper can have almost no activity for CO 2 reduction and instead evolve almost pure H 2 . Our own measurements confirm this unexpected behaviour, with replicate experiments revealing occasions where identically mechanically polished copper electrodes favour hydrogen evolution over CO 2 reduction. In this presentation, we will discuss the reproducibility of CO2 reduction and the steps taken to explain copper’s highly variable product selectivity.

Electrochemical reduction of CO 2 is a promising method for converting a greenhouse gas into value-added products, utilizing renewable energy. Novel catalysts, electrode assemblies, and cell configurations are all necessary to achieve economically appealing performance. In this talk, I am going to present a zero gap electrolyzer cell, which converts gas phase CO 2 to products without the need for any liquid catholyte. I will demonstrate how multiple cells are connected into a stack, thus scaling up the electrolysis process. I will show how proper cell components and operational conditions result in industrially relevant performance. I will demonstrate the role of each component of the membrane electrode assembly, such as the catalysts, the porous transport layers, the membrane, and the ionomers. In the second part of my talk, I will show that while precipitate formation in the cathode gas diffusion electrode is detrimental for the long-term stability, the presence of alkali metal cations at the cathode improves performance. To overcome this contradiction, I will present different approaches which help to extend the lifetime of the electrolyzer cell. I will also present a detailed electrolyte and water balance of the operational cell, to better understand the contributing factors to these phenomena. As an outlook, I will present a complex machine learning based approach, through which we aim to find the optimal operating conditions of such CO2 electrolyzer cells. Finally, I will share the most recent insights on our containerized prototype CO2 electrolyzer system, capable of processing 100 t CO2/year.

A major concern within modern society is the need to substitute the fossil fuels with more renewable sources of the energy. Chemical industry is one of major players in the field of the usage of the crude oil to produce more complex chemicals. Despite of being good source of carbon species, a dropping amount of the coal and oil is raising the questions for future solutions. Carbon dioxide can be promising and sustainable source of carbon, but its high C-O bond energy (806 kJmol -1 ) poses general problems in efficient utilization. The most common feedstock in chemical synthesis is the syngas, a mixture of H 2 and CO, which can be simply processed into more complex molecules like e.g., methanol, dimethyl ether, or methane. Highly inert CO 2 can be transformed into more valuable CO via, so called, Reverse Water-Gas Shift Reaction (RWGS). Even though there are couple proposed CO 2 activation mechanisms, and knowledge on the reaction is quite high, the common issue is still proper selection of the catalyst for the reaction. In the surface redox mechanism Cu metal is being oxidized by CO 2 to form Cu 2 O with the release of CO. After that, Cu + ions are getting reduced back to metallic copper using surrounding H 2 . Solid Oxide Cells can become good source of ‘green’ hydrogen and, at the same time, perform direct electrolysis or chemical reduction of CO 2 . High temperature, at which SOECs are working, is beneficial from the point of Faradaic efficiency and CO 2 conversion rate. Steam electrode of SOEC contains copious amount of nickel. It is also a well-known catalyst for many reactions, but in this case the electrodes are struggling under carbon-rich atmosphere. Therefore, an addition of different catalytic materials is needed. Commonly used are mixed catalytic heterogenous systems composed of Cu supported on oxide materials e.g., Fe x O y , MoO 3 , La 2 O 3 , and many more. In this study a series of catalysts for SOECs were fabricated based on the Cu-doped double perovskite structure able to exsolve intermixed Cu or Cu-Fe nanoparticles supported on the matrix lattice of La 0.3 Sr 1.7 Fe 1.5 Mo 0.5 O 6-σ denoted as LSFM. The usage of LSFM compound as a matrix for Cu exsolution was based on the idea that it already consists of the oxides, which are currently utilized as the catalysts in RWGS. On the other hand, quite high mixed ionic-electronic conductivity may lead to even more enhanced electrochemical activity of the compound. The samples with varying Cu dopant level (5-20 mol.%) were synthesized via modified Pechini method maintaining fixed Fe:Mo ratio. Selected powders were processed into inks and screenprinted onto Ni-YSZ electrode. During the startup procedure of the SOEC, the catalysts were activated and the exsolution of metallic nanoparticles occurred. The powders and catalytic layers were characterized using XRD, SEM, and XPS techniques in both oxidized and reduced states. Doped compounds were able to exsolve metallic nanoparticles with the coverage density and size depending on the initial Cu amount in the lattice and the temperature of the reduction. Additional Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation (TPR/TPO) tests were performed to better understand the formation mechanism of surficial nanoparticles. SOECs equipped with additional layer of LSFM-Cu on the fuel electrode were examined for the performance in coelectrolysis mode under flowing H 2 O-CO 2 with subsequent measurement of the outlet gases concentration using GC-MS. New layer altered the production of syngas concerning H 2 :CO ratio, yield, selectivity and conversion rates. The anchoring effect of the exsolution process causes higher integration of the nanoparticles compared to conventional catalysts produced via simple deposition and most likely limits the evaporation and surface diffusion of copper. LSFM-Cu can be promising material for increasing the efficiency of the SOECs.

Photoelectrocatalysis stands at the forefront of transformative advancements in the chemical industry, offering a path toward a more sustainable future. Harnessing abundant solar energy through semiconducting photoelectrodes, this approach drives redox reactions directly at the electrolyte interfaces, significantly reducing the required energy input and eliminating the need for toxic or costly homogeneous catalysts. Beyond water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, the applicabilities of photoelectrocatalysis have been expanded to biomass upgrading and synthetic chemistry over the last ten years. In this work, we focus on the selective conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in acetonitrile, excluding the formation of benzoic acid, employing indirect photoelectrocatalysis with bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) as a photoanode, achieving nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. Notably, our investigation reveals the emergence of surface states formed between BiVO 4 and the redox mediator, N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS), resulting in a gradual decline in photocurrent density over time. Small perturbation techniques, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, were utilized for probing into the carrier dynamics at the electrolyte interface. In addition to blocking charge transfer sites of BiVO 4 , adsorption of NHS radicals also facilitates charge recombination on the photoelectrode surface. In addressing this issue, we present evidence that the density of these surface states can be effectively suppressed through optimized photoelectrode deposition methods as well as dopant incorporation. The roles of electrolytes and trace water impurities were also systematically analyzed. Our findings underscore the critical importance of understanding the chemical and dynamic landscapes at the semiconductor-electrolyte junction for unlocking the full potential of photoelectrocatalysis. This work sheds light on the intricacies of the photoelectrocatalytic processes and offers valuable insights for advancing the field and directing energy flow toward target molecular transformations with unique product selectivity.

The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to C 2 products is believed to proceed via the formation of adsorbed CO as an intermediate. Although ethylene is frequently reported as the main product when using Cu electrocatalysts, recent studies have demonstrated that directly feeding CO can result in the selective formation of acetate. In this study, we investigate the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 and CO using Cu electrocatalysts prepared by a one-pot synthesis method employing hydrazine as a reducing agent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent in a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) cell configuration. We investigated the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 and CO using Cu electrocatalysts prepared by a one-pot synthesis method in a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) cell configuration. While CO2 reduction primarily yields ethylene (36.99%), followed by hydrogen, CO, and ethanol, feeding CO directly under the same potential increases the total C 2 product yield from 52% to 83%, with acetate becoming the dominant product at 63%. Employing a phosphate buffer to maintain an alkaline pH of 8 further enhances acetate selectivity, reaching 90% with KOH. We propose a mechanism involving a common acetyl intermediate for ethylene formation from CO 2 and a ketene intermediate for CO reduction to acetate. Our results highlight the significant impact of feed, electrolyte composition, and pH on product distribution, with direct CO reduction favoring C 2 products and alkaline pH promoting acetate selectivity. These findings offer insights for optimizing the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 and CO. Figure 1

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to alleviating global warming and emerging energy crises. Yet, the CO2RR efficiency is impeded by the need for electrocatalysts with good selectivity and efficiency. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention in electrocatalysis and are more efficient than traditional metal-based catalysts. In this study, we modeled a Cu single atom embedded on MoX2 (X = Se and Te) monolayer with a single chalcogen (X) vacancy as SAC. Employing the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) method, the electrocatalytic CO2RR activity of the Cu-MoX2 SACs is systematically investigated through significant descriptors, such as the Gibbs free energy change, charge density difference, and COHP analysis. The stability of SACs, CO2 adsorption configurations, and all possible reaction pathways for the formation of C1 products (HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, and CH4) were examined. All of the Cu-MoX2 SACs are stable and show high catalytic selectivity for the CO2RR by significantly suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We found that the catalytic activity is mainly due to the level of antibonding states filling between the Cu atom and *OCHOH intermediate. Among the C1 products, CH4 is selectively produced in all three SACs. Notably, there is a decrease in the limiting potential (UL) when X changes from S to Te in Cu-MoX2. Among these three SACs, Cu-MoTe2 SAC is the most promising catalyst for reducing CO2 to CH4, with as low as UL of −0.34 V vs RHE. Our results demonstrate that the local coordination environment in SACs has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of CO2RR.

Low-temperature proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are poised to undergo rapid expansion in the coming decades for clean hydrogen production. Hydrogen has been hailed as the ‘Swiss Army knife’ of decarbonization as it can help mitigate carbon dioxide emissions from ammonia production, metal refining, and heavy-duty vehicle transportation. Proliferation of clean hydrogen production necessitates large reductions in iridium loadings in the anode while also operating at higher current density values. The latter goal can be achieved by adopting thinner proton exchange membranes (PEMs), but the use of thinner membranes exacerbates hydrogen crossover – which leads to unacceptable levels of hydrogen in the anode effluent poising safety concerns (i.e., above the lower explosion limit of 4 vol% hydrogen in oxygen). Notably, the hydrogen content in the anode effluent is high when operating the PEMWE at low current density values (0.1 to 0.5 A cm -2 ). A PEMWE will sometimes throttle down and operate at low current density because of the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources which are used to power the electrolyzer. Recombination catalyst (RC) interlayers, located within the PEM, can consume hydrogen and mitigate the hydrogen concentration in the anode effluent. This Talk presents our continuum-level modeling approach for hydrogen crossover in PEMWEs with membranes containing RC interlayers. The model accurately captures the hydrogen content in the anode effluent as a function of the PEMWE current density, cathode back pressure, membrane thickness, anode backpressure, RC location, and RC loading. The modeling results, as well as experimental observations in the literature, suggest that RC interlayer effectiveness is limited by oxygen availability at the RC interlayer. The low oxygen concentration at the interlayer relative to hydrogen arises from the lower solubility of oxygen in hydrated PEMs and the lower diffusivity of oxygen in hydrated PEMs. The Talk concludes with future directions to improve the model as well as suggestions for future experiments to aid the accuracy of the model.

The electrification of the petrochemical industry will greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing of commodity chemicals; however, electrification on a global scale is only achievable using earth-abundant materials for electrocatalysis in place of state-of-the-art catalysts made from precious metals. A promising catalyst that has been used for industrial hydrodesulfurization and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, nitrate reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and oxygen evolution is Ni 2 P. Ni 2 P and other transition metal phosphides benefit from active site ensembles that moderate the binding of reaction intermediates, making them promising electrocatalysts for reactions beyond the ones listed, especially other hydrogenation reactions. However, Ni 2 P and other TMPs are susceptible to oxidation, which can lead to catalyst degradation and loss in certain conditions. Stability is an important part of catalysis; therefore, it is important to understand the degradation mechanism of Ni 2 P in order to mitigate corrosion, accurately predict surface reactivity, and prepare Ni 2 P for industrial electrocatalysis. Previous reports on Ni-P alloys found passivation regimes through anodic polarization but others saw complete dissolution at more oxidizing potentials. Bulk nickel phosphides have been shown to have a passivated surface, and characterization, often limited to ex-situ spectroscopy after the fact, has shown that the surface is composed of nickel hydroxides, phosphates, and oxyhydroxides. In the present work, operando Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and polarization are combined to understand the electrochemical degradation of Ni 2 P nanoparticles. Ni 2 P nanoparticles were synthesized by heating NiCl 2 and tris(diethylamino)phosphine in oleylamine and thermally annealed at 450 °C under 5% H 2 /95% N 2 . Transmission-mode Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy was conducted on benchtop spectrometers (easyXAFS) using a 3D-printed electrochemical cell designed for operando spectroscopy. Nanoparticles maximize surface to bulk atom ratio, which is beneficial both for electrocatalysis, less atoms are necessary to have the same number of active sites, and for X-ray absorption, spectra are more surface sensitive. The use of a benchtop spectrometer offers the flexibility to iterate on experiments on the fly and the power to acquire synchrotron quality data on a routine basis. Preliminary results in neutral phosphate buffered electrolyte indicate that Ni 2 P significantly oxidizes and dissolves at and beyond 0.8 V vs RHE which agrees with anodic polarization corrosion experiments. Ongoing work extends anodic polarization experiments to acidic and basic pH and probes the potentials at which oxidation is no longer reversible. We hypothesize that dissolution will be less severe with increased pH and reduction of oxidized species to Ni 2 P will no longer be possible after the onset of Ni dissolution.

Integrating garnet-type lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) solid electrolytes into all-solid-state or hybrid batteries presents numerous challenges. One significant obstacle is the spontaneous formation of lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ) when surfaces of LLZO are exposed to moisture and carbon dioxide, which can lead to high interfacial impedance with electrodes and deleterious effects on the mechanical, electrochemical, and safety performance of the materials. Current methods for removing Li 2 CO 3 include mechanical polishing and thermal treatment under inert gas, both of which are time-consuming and difficult to scale up or implement in practical applications. We report on the use of atmospheric pressure (open-air) blown arc discharge plasma to remove Li 2 CO 3 species from the surface of tantalum doped LLZO (LLZTO). Open-air plasma technology offers a unique opportunity for surface treatments and functionalization by driving reactions and changes to surfaces that are not possible with other plasma or modification approaches. The proccess can also be scaled and implemented in continuous, roll-to-roll processing. In this method, compressed N 2 gas at room temperature is passed through a high voltage zone (1 kV) at a controllable rate (20 liters per minute in this study), where it is ionized. The gas blows the plasma discharge out of a nozzle, and the LLZTO sample is placed at approximately ~1 mm away from the afterglow. The uniqueness of the open-air plasma system is the combination of energy sources which are generated: electrons and reactive species (radicals, metastables, and photons) are produced in combination with convective heat to rapidly transfer energy to enable ultrafast precursor conversion or post-treatment. The plasma treatment is carried out entirely in ambient conditions (RH ~40%) and is enabled by use of a custom-built metal shroud that is placed around the plasma nozzle to prevent moisture and carbon dioxide from reacting with the sample. After the plasma treatment, compressed gas is introduced through the shroud to mitigate reformation of the Li 2 CO 3 as the sample is cooling. The surface chemistry of the LLZTO is characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to quantify the rate at which Li 2 CO 3 forms in ambient on a fresh LLZTO surface, as well as to assess the effect of plasma process parameters on removal of the Li 2 CO 3 surface species. Specifically, we focus on 3 parameters: treatment time (5, 10, 20 or 40 minutes) and shroud gas chemistry (N 2 or O 2 ) used after treatment. The most substantial reduction in Li 2 CO 3 contamination on the LLZTO surface is achieved after 20 minutes of exposure to open-air plasma with a N 2 shroud gas. To examine the impacts of the plasma treatment on the interfacial resistance, we prepared symmetric cells comprising LLZTO pellets contacted with nonblocking electrodes made from lithium-tin alloy. We find that the open-air plasma treatment can significantly reduce the interface impedance to levels comparable with those measured when using mechanical polishing to remove the Li 2 CO 3 . Additionally, we find that the plasma treatment may also be used to modify the LLZTO structure and microstructure properties, and can also be used on other types of garnets. The results show that this platform demonstrates a path towards open-air processed solid-state batteries with improved interfacial and microstructural properties.

The process of conversion ethylene through carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) shows potential in catalysis by encouraging the formation of C-C bonds while reducing the occurrence of competing reactions(1). Despite their potential, a deeper understanding of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems is needed due to their low selectivity. The MEA configuration, which eliminates the need for a catholyte, delivers humidified CO 2 to the cathode, enhancing CO 2 solubility and minimizing overall ohmic resistance by maintaining a narrow electrode gap, thus boosting energy efficiency(2). However, in MEA, since protons and ions from the anolyte for reaction are supplied to the catalyst through a membrane, additional understanding of the electrolyte supply effect is needed to optimize the overall system(3). Ions and water of electrolytes are essential for CO 2 RR. Water serves as a proton source for CO 2 RR and facilitates ion transport. However, the delicate balance of water is crucial in CO 2 RR systems. While water is necessary for proton supply, an excess of water at the cathode can lead to complications, particularly in promoting the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)(4). HER can occur alongside CO 2 RR and consume protons and electrons, thereby reducing the selectivity of CO 2 conversion and diminishing overall efficiency. Balancing the concentrations of ions and water is crucial for optimizing cell voltage and overall performance, highlighting the necessity of effective water and ion management approaches. While much research on water management has focused on cathodes, electrolytes, and membranes, the properties of the anodes have been relatively neglected. This study proposes the hypothesis that modulation of the anode electrode can have a significant impact on CO 2 RR performance. When comparing Ti-mesh, which facilitates the passage of electrolyte, with carbon paper, which restricts electrolyte movement, localized pH changes and optimal ethylene production efficiency were observed. In particular, in situ/operando analysis shows that under conditions of insufficient water and ion supply, local pH effects are promoted and Cu valence increases during CO 2 RR, resulting in optimal ethylene production efficiency at low current densities. However, at high current densities, the reaction was not evenly distributed and catalytic activity decreased. On the other hand, when water and ions are supplied smoothly, the ethylene production efficiency increases as the current density increases, showing that the material is sufficiently transferred. In addition, it was confirmed through the backside image that water crossed over to the cathode at the same time. This shows that the anode can affect the catalytic activity of the cathode side. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of effective ion and water management in improving CO 2 RR efficiency in MEA and highlights the central role of the anode in this process.

Elucidating the atomic structures of electrochemical interfaces and interphases is pivotal in advancing our understanding of various electrochemical processes. Our research introduces advanced multiscale simulation methods and a hybrid algorithm for accurately simulating the electrolyte/electrode interface and electrochemical reactions under operando conditions.[1] These approaches have enabled us to elucidate the reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction on copper surfaces and to detail the atomic structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Lithium/Sodium metal batteries at the nanoscale.[2,3] Incorporating machine learning (ML) with physic models, we have significantly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of surface spectroscopy calculations,[4] offering new insights that accelerate material design and the development of next-generation electrochemical systems.

One of the solutions contributing to the development of energy independence is the utilization of biogas as an alternative fuel for agricultural tractors. Biogas is recognized as a renewable energy source, and its usage aids in the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale. The reuse of this material/waste exemplifies the concept of a circular economy. Several models of agricultural tractors designed explicitly for biogas utilization or adaptable for its use are available in the market. This study aimed to evaluate the energy-ecological parameters of the MP tractor (T6.180 Methane Power) powered by Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in comparison to its structurally identical counterpart fueled by Diesel (T6.180 Electro Command). Based on the Air–Fuel Ratio (AFR) coefficients for diesel and methane, as well as values of air excess ratios (λ) and the proportions of CO and CO2 emissions determined for various engine load states, the mass emission of selected exhaust components for the examined tractors was estimated. This research highlights that biogas-powered tractors hold the potential to contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture through the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in farm energy autonomy, and optimal resource utilization, closely aligned with the principles of a circular economy.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is of great importance to produce valuable chemicals. In conventional alkaline and "acid + salts"-based CO2RR, the aqueous electrolyte normally needs to be refreshed due to the gradually more neutral feature of pH during electrolysis operation. Therefore, both solutes and deionized (DI) water in electrolytes are required to be regenerated regularly. In this work, acidic seawater (pH < 2) was used as a low-cost but efficient electrolyte for CO2RR without salt addition. The Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and partial current densities of C2+ on typical copper in the "H2SO4 in raw seawater" electrolyte are comparable with those for conventional "KOH in DI water" and much higher than those for "H2SO4 + salts" systems. Moreover, single-pass carbon efficiencies (SPCEs) in acidic seawater are significantly higher than the values in alkaline DI water. Such an abnormal phenomenon was also demonstrated for CO and HCOOH generation on typical silver and tin catalysts, respectively. In situ Raman spectroscopy and controlled experiments revealed that metal (denoted as M) cations in seawater ensure a higher concentration of M·H2O species, which improve interactions with *CO2–, while Cl– anions enhance the adsorption strength of key CO2RR intermediates (namely, *CO on copper, *COO– on silver, and *OCHO on tin). Through these interactions with water molecules and CO2RR intermediates, such free but functional ions in seawater play a highly important role in promoting selectivity and activity for CO2RR, as well as SPCE in acidic seawater. Furthermore, using acidic seawater as an alternative CO2RR electrolyte has significant economic and ecological benefits compared with traditional alkaline DI water electrolytes.

Saturated fluorocarbons (SFCs: chemical form CnF(2n+2)) are chosen for their optical properties as Cherenkov radiators, with C4F10 and CF4 used in the COMPASS and LHCb Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors at CERN. Their non-conductivity, non-flammability and radiation resistance also make them ideal coolants, with C6F14 liquid used in all LHC experiments, and C3F8 used as an evaporative coolant in the ATLAS silicon tracker. While SFCs have high Global Warming Potentials (GWP typically > 5000*CO2), fluoro-ketones (FKs: of chemical form CnF2nO) can offer similar performance at very low, or zero-GWP. This paper considers use of heavy SFC and FK vapours in Cherenkov detectors. The blending of high-order (C > 4) SFC or FK vapours with a light carrier gas is explored to replicate the refractivities of CF4 and C4F10, to reduce or eliminate the GWP "load" (in equivalent tonnes of CO2) in large Cherenkov radiator volumes. Subject to optical testing, 3M NOVEC® 5110 (C5F10O) - blended with N2 and controlled in real time using sound velocity gas mixture analysis - could replace C4F10 and CF4 in RICH detectors. New, non-cyclic isomers of C4F8O could directly replace C4F10 and - blended with N2 - also replace CF4. Noting the impending EU restrictions on fluorinated compounds, and (2025) withdrawal of 3M Corp. from the PFAS (Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) market, radiator GWP load reduction through use of legacy stocks of C5F12 & C4F10 - blended with N2 to replicate the respective refractivities of C4F10 & CF4 - is also considered. The radiation tolerance and thermal performance of 3M NOVEC® 649 (C6F12O) liquid was sufficiently promising for to be considered to replace C6F14 in liquid cooling applications at CERN. Although not industrialized over the full CnF2nO range, lighter (C < 4) fluoro-ketone molecules - for example C2F4O isomers, with similar thermodynamics to C2F6, and subject to toxicity, materials compatibility and low-GWP verifications - might allow lower operating temperatures than possible with evaporative C3F8 or CO2 for the cooling of future silicon trackers operating in high luminosity environments.

This study investigates the effects of adding steam to the oxidizer on the combustion behavior of coke oven gas through numerical simulations. The analysis used the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Ansys Fluent. The results obtained for the case where dry air was used as the oxidizer were compared with experimental data. The k-Ɛ standard turbulence model was employed for turbulence modeling, while the PDF/Mixture Fraction combustion model and the P-1 radiation model were used for the three-dimensional numerical simulations. According to the simulation results, adding steam to the oxidizer slightly reduced the temperature of the COG. When assessing the emissions, it was observed that NOX emissions significantly decreased, while CO2 emissions showed a slight reduction. However, CO emissions were found to increase slightly. In conclusion, the study indicates that adding steam to the oxidizer significantly mitigates the high NOX emissions typically associated with using coke oven gas as an alternative fuel.

In the context of new power systems, the rapid development of distributed renewable energy and the drive of dual carbon targets have prompted community-level clean energy and energy storage configuration to become the key to improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Based on the regional autonomy balance and sharing mechanism, this paper establishes a community distributed energy and energy storage optimization configuration model. With the goal of minimizing the total operating cost of the community, the established model is linearized by using the Big-M method and the McCormick method and transformed into a mixed integer linear programming model that is easy to solve. In order to comprehensively evaluate the comprehensive benefits of the established optimization scheme, this paper introduces the indicators of clean energy self-consumption rate, load self-supply rate, static investment payback period, and static CO2 investment payback period from the aspects of energy utilization, the economy, and the environment. Finally, a calculation example analysis is conducted, and the results show that, compared with the scenario where energy storage is configured separately and distributed energy resources are not shared, the configuration strategy proposed in the article can reduce the energy storage configuration capacity by 46.6% and the distributed energy configuration capacity by 21.1%. Investment costs can be reduced by 15.6%. At the same time, 91.75% of distributed energy self-consumption and 96.80% of load self-supply are achieved, reducing grid interaction and promoting regional autonomy and balance. The static CO2 investment payback period is also significantly shortened, and the carbon emission reduction effect is significant, providing an important reference for community energy system optimization planning and green and low-carbon development.

The results indicate that the production of 1 L of pyrolysis oil from plastic waste generates about 0.032 kg CO2 eq and a water consumption of 0.031 m3, with other impact categories registering values of less than 0.1 kg/L or 0.01 m2a crop eq/L, reducing impacts in 17 out of 18 categories compared to fossil diesel. In addition, its chemical and physical properties, close to those of fossil diesel, suggest its suitability for internal combustion engines, although as a blend rather than a complete substitute. Chemical recycling also appears to be more environmentally favorable than incineration and landfilling in all 18 impact categories, achieving significant benefits, including a reduction in global warming of −3849 kg CO2 eq/ton, ionizing radiation of −22.4 kBq Co-60 eq/ton, and fossil resource consumption of −1807.5 kg oil eq/ton. These results, thus, highlight the potential dual role of chemical recycling of plastic waste, both in mitigating environmental impacts and in supporting circular economy goals by reducing demand for virgin plastics. However, although it appears to be a promising technology, challenges associated with high energy requirements, raw material variability, and scale infrastructure still need to be addressed to ensure industrial competitiveness and significant environmental benefits.

This paper explores innovative approaches to reducing energy consumption in building ventilation systems through the implementation of adaptive control strategies. Using a publicly available high-resolution dataset spanning a full year, the study integrates real-time data on occupancy, CO2 levels, temperature, window state, and external environmental conditions. Notably, occupancy data derived from computer vision-based detection using the YOLOv5 algorithm provides an unprecedented level of granularity. The study evaluates five energy-saving strategies: Demand-Controlled Ventilation (DCV), occupancy-based control, time-based off-peak reduction, window-open control, and temperature-based control. Among these, the occupancy-based strategy achieved the highest energy savings, reducing power consumption by 50%, while temperature-based control yielded a significant 37.27% reduction. This paper’s originality lies in its holistic analysis of multiple dynamic control strategies, integrating diverse environmental and operational variables rarely combined in prior research. The findings highlight the transformative potential of integrating real-time environmental data and advanced control algorithms to optimize HVAC performance. This study establishes a new benchmark for energy-efficient building management through offering practical recommendations and laying the groundwork for predictive models, renewable energy integration, and occupant-centric systems.

The role of hydrogen is emphasized in many countries' energy and climate strategies, yet the impacts of regional hydrogen-supporting policies remain underexplored. This study analyzes recently announced hydrogen-supporting policies across five provinces in northern China. Four scenarios – Current Policy (CP), Announced Policy (AP), Enhanced Policy (EP), and Net-Zero Emissions (NZE) – are developed and assessed using a dedicated hydrogen planning model, MESSAGEix-H2NC. With cumulative demand of end-use applications expanding 1.3 times compared to CP, the AP scenario's absence of carbon emission constraints leads to a reliance on non-clean hydrogen, resulting in higher carbon emissions than CP. Cost reductions under EP achieve lower emission intensity (11.9 kgCO2/kgH2 by 2030 and 3.6 kgCO2/kgH2 by 2060). Consequently, the investment gap for EP grows from $2.4 billion in 2025 to $89.7 billion in 2060, while the gap for more thorough net-zero emissions (NZE) expands from $10 billion in 2025 to $107 billion in 2060. The investment gap between EP and NZE relative to CP expands over time. Overall, the model results highlight potential deficiencies in current hydrogen development plans and incentive policies in northern China. These findings reveal a misalignment between current policies and CO2 reduction targets and underscore the need for accelerated technological advancements to improve cost competitiveness.

Electrochemistry has become a key player in establishing a global sustainable energy landscape. Unfortunately, most electrochemical processes are limited in their efficiency and selectivity which has prevented them from replacing carbon-intensive industrial processes. Computational simulations have the potential to conquer the vast chemical space and reveal so far unconsidered new electrocatalysts and boost the performance of these devices. This, however, requires the knowledge of computationally accessible activity and selectivity descriptors. In this work, and by the example of electrochemical CO2 reduction, it is shown that the conventionally considered adsorption energy descriptor is not enough to distinguish product selectivity among catalysts. Including specifically the electrochemical environment in the quantum chemical calculations, we find that a charge-transfer descriptor is separately re- quired, such as the work function or the potential of zero charge. With this, experimental trends in product selectivity can be well described, thus providing a new set of descriptors for high-throughput screening of electrocatalysts.

The aviation sector has a significant role to play in the reduction of carbon emissions, particularly in light of EU emissions targets. Within the EU, aviation emissions constitute 13.9 per cent of total transport emissions, where under the Green Deal a target of 90 per cent reduction in transport emissions by 2050 has been set. Several tax exemptions apply to the aviation sector due to its international nature, which have contributed to an increasing trend in emissions. Recent movements in EU policy under the ‘Fit for 55’ package, as well as public and political interest, have focused attention on changing the taxation struc-ture of the aviation industry in order to reduce CO2 emissions. This report focuses on several different potential policies and taxation structures which would attempt to decrease the emissions of the aviation sector: the removal of kerosene taxation exemption (in line with the recent EU proposal), removal of VAT exemption, introduction of a passenger tax, and abolition of free EU ETS allowances by 2026 (in line with the recent EU proposal). Each of these policies, as well a combination scenario, is assessed with respect to the impacts on the aviation industry, spillover effects, macro-economic and government revenue effects, and household effects, as well as the emissions impacts. This analysis applies the Ireland, Environment, Energy and Economy (I3E) model, which allows for the examination of spillover effects of the aviation industry to government, households and other industries. This methodology does not, however, allow for a detailed analysis of different passenger or airline types. In what follows, results are shown as cumulative percentage changes compared to no aviation taxation. Hence a decrease does not present an annual decrease but the build up of a cumulative decrease from 2022 to the given year.

Changes in an organism’s DNA can influence all aspects of its life. Mutations serve as raw material for genetic variability and its evolution. These are caused by high-energy radiation. Chemical substances present in the environment are other potential causative agents. They may also occur during DNA replication. Radiation damage has increased many folds after the advent of cellular telephony. Genes are DNA molecules. These molecules are distributed on the chromosomes of individuals or populations of a species. Some populations grow faster than others. Why? The chapter tries to find an answer to it. Population increase has been observed in some countries and for others, a decrease has been detected. It has been predicted that the human population will increase to 8.5 billion in 2030 from 7. 8 billion in 2020. The exploitation of natural resources would increase accordingly. World Economic Forum reports that research conducted at the Swiss Re Institute has pointed out that an 18 percent reduction in GDP is achievable by 2050 if the Global temperature rise is restricted to 3.20 C. About 16 to 29% reduction in CO2 emissions would lead to a less dangerous climate change provided population growth is slowed down. If factors contributing to Global warming are managed in such a way that the Global temperature rises by 1.50 C, Sustainable Development Goals are achievable. Net–zero emissions targeted to be achieved by 2050 are not feasible as international agreements are not honored.

Fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, are currently the primary energy source for the world’s needs. However, their depletion and role in the development of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming and climate change, necessitate the exploration of alternative green energy sources to promote a cleaner environment. Hydrogen, in particular, has emerged as a promising renewable energy fuel for the future. One promising method for producing hydrogen is urea-assisted water splitting, which has the potential to improve both hydrogen production productivity and energy conversion efficiency. However, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a complex six-electron transfer process with slow reaction kinetics and unclear mechanisms, which requires a high overpotential. This has led to the need to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. In general, the majority of research has been directed towards the synthesis of robust, efficient, and economically viable catalysts. In recent years, light irradiation has been introduced into an electrochemical system with the aim of enhancing the activities of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Insights into the mechanism demonstrate that external excitation effectively accelerates charge and mass transfer and thus improves the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. In contrast to previous catalyst modifications, the external field assistance approach allows for greater flexibility in engineering an electrochemical process with facile, continuous, reversible, dynamic, and universal control. However, the utilization of photothermal-assisted urea oxidation reaction has not been reported yet. In this research, we report a CuS/WO 3 composite electrocatalyst with a direct Z-scheme system for photothermally-assisted UOR. Upon irradiation with light, the CuS/WO 3 electrode exhibited a reduced overpotential of 308.2 mV, resulting in a UOR current density of 50 mA cm -2 . Additionally, the CuS/WO 3 electrode achieved a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE under irradiation. The catalytic activity of the CuS/WO 3 electrode was found to be significantly enhanced, exhibiting a 2.5- and 2.8-fold increase compared to that of CuS and WO 3 , respectively. This enhancement can be attributed to the enhanced redox abilities of charge carriers in the direct Z-scheme system. Our studies demonstrate the importance of direct Z-scheme formation in light utilization and the synergistic effect of photon and photothermal on UOR. Figure 1

The competences of the President of the Energy Regulatory Office include, inter alia, resolving disputes between parties of specific contractual relations in which at least one party is an energy enterprise. One of the categories of such disputes is refusal to connect a renewable energy installation. The analysis presented in this paper leads to a conclusion that due to the multidimensional goals laid down in energy law, technical and economic conditions should be examined while taking into account interests of all stakeholders. This article presents analyses the law in force, involving a case study of a Polish example and a comparative analysis. As a result, the author has come to the conclusion that resolving disputes by the President is a legal instrument that serves to ensure equal treatment and connection of market participants who request it, at the same time facilitating reduction of CO2 emissions and energy neutrality pursuant to the principles adopted by the European Union and the international community. The article draws on selected acts of ordinary law, the relevant literature, decisions made by courts and tribunals, as well as data published by the President and by industry entities.

CO₂ emissions are one form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to global warming. CO₂ contributed 175.62 million tons in 2021, impacting greenhouse gas levels. One strategy to reduce the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere is to convert CO₂ gas into useful chemicals. One example of this is the hydrogenation of CO₂ to produce methane, which can serve as an alternative to LPG. The aim of this research is to produce methane gas by developing a fixed bed reactor in a simple manner. The catalyst Ni/Al2O3 with 20 grams and five regenerations could produce CH₄ up to 49.73% compared to 39.06% for those with 10 grams. However, the H2 gas remaining is higher for those with 10 grams (1.454 ppm compared to 1.042 ppm). Also, The CO2 gas remaining is higher for those with 10 grams (58.18% compared to 47.92%). The results of this study can be the basis for developing energy policies, encouraging investment in clean energy technologies, and supporting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for energy sustainability and resilience.

The removal of barriers to the movement of goods, services and factors of production within an integration association leads to the emergence of spillover effects that have a significant impact on the welfare of the population in the integrating countries. Given the growing dynamics of trade turnover and accelerating economic growth in the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), as well as the lack of studies on the environmental situation in this region, the study of the impact of technology on the environment in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia is of particular relevance. The purpose of the study is to identify the impact of technological spillover on the state of the environment in five EAEU countries in the interval 2011-2022. Hypothesis of the study - the spread of technology in the EAEU space changes the quality of production (there is an increase in the share of renewable energy sources), and this reduces damage to the environment, through the reduction of CO2 emissions. The study investigated the stationarity of variables, determined the most appropriate model for each set of data, considered the possibility of using models with fixed or random effects. As a result of the study, the hypothesis stated in the paper was not confirmed by panel data for the EAEU countries in the interval 2011-2022.

Background/Objective: The relationship between food consumption and environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly evident. The aim of this study was to estimate the evolution of the environmental impact of food consumption in the Spanish population, assessed in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Methods: Data collected from the Household Budget Survey were included, from approximately 24,000 households for the period of 2006–2023. The environmental impact of diet, in terms of GHG emissions, was estimated from the EAT-Lancet Commission tables, and the adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) was calculated using the Dietary Score index. Results: The environmental impact of the Spanish diet, in terms of GHG, followed a downward trend over the years analysed, from 3978.1 g CO2-eq in 2006 to 3281.4 g CO2-eq in 2023, a decrease of 17.5%. The food groups with the largest decrease in consumption during this period were red meat (from 39.9 kg/year to 35.5 kg/year), fish (from 24.3 kg/year to 19.0 kg/year), and dairy products (from 113.4 kg/year to 99.7 kg/year). The level of adherence to the MedDiet increased slightly from 34 points in 2006 to 35 points in 2023 due to an increase in the amount of vegetables (42.7 kg/year vs. 44.3 kg/year) and grains consumed (53.1 kg/year vs. 72.6 kg/year) and a decrease in fish consumption (24.3 kg/year vs. 19.0 kg/year). Conclusions: In Spain, a reduction in GHG emissions associated with food consumption was observed due to a decrease in the consumption of red meat, fish, dairy products, and fats. National surveys are very useful tools to analyse the impact of food consumption on climate change and to assess the effect of the policies implemented to contain it.

Biochar, derived from waste biomass, is a potent material for carbon dioxide sequestration, owing to its stable, non-degradable aromatic structure [1]. Biochar is found to have advantageous characteristics, such as a unique pore structure, large specific surface area, complex surface-active functional groups, and stable chemical properties. These properties make biochar as a high potential biosorbent for removal of pollutants from water [2]. Meanwhile, the escalating use of pharmaceuticals has led to pervasive environmental residues, posing public health risks. Specifically, antibiotic contamination risks augmenting antibiotic resistance, underscoring the need for efficient wastewater treatment methods [3]. However, current wastewater treatment plant(WWTP) based on biological treatment was not effectively eliminate this types of waste in the water and it is necessary to investigate efficient method for removal of antibiotics from wastewater. This study explores the use of biochar for ciprofloxacin (CIP) removal from water and introduces a novel electrochemical biochar regeneration technique. We utilized sludge from chemical plants to produce biochar through standard and alkali-activated pyrolysis, yielding CB (normal pyrolysis) and CAB (alkali activated pyrolysis) types with distinct physicochemical properties. CAB, with an exceptionally high surface area (~2330 m²/g) and carbon purity (95.4%), demonstrated superior CIP adsorption capacity (~550 mg/g). We investigated the CIP adsorption isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamics to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, which appear dominated by π-π and electrostatic interactions facilitated by the high pyrolysis temperatures reducing oxygen-containing groups on the biochar. After the biochar became saturated with CIP, we regenerated it using joule heating in Ar atmosphere, employing the carbothermal shock method for rapid, short-duration temperature increases [4]. In contrast to traditional CTS which can sometimes lead to structural damage by directly heating the material on the carbon substrate [5], we used radiant heat from the CTS process to ensure controlled temperature elevation. This modified approach maintains the structural integrity of the biochar by avoiding direct contact between the biochar and the carbon substrate while facilitating the regeneration process. Additionally, this method facilitates the physical separation of the biochar from the carbon substrate, enhancing the recovery and reuse of biochar. Such an approach contributes to the efficient regeneration of biochar and environmentally friendly processing. We examined parameters such as distance from the substrate and duration to optimize the regeneration conditions. Ultimately, we assessed the efficacy of the CIP adsorption by the regenerated biochar. Traditional thermal treatments for biochar regeneration are energy-intensive and time-consuming. We propose an innovative approach using joule heating under a nitrogen atmosphere, employing carbothermal shock for rapid, efficient regeneration. By optimizing parameters such as voltage and duration, we identified ideal conditions for regenerating biochar, significantly enhancing its CIP adsorption efficacy. This study not only highlights the potential of biochar in environmental remediation but also introduces an energy-efficient regeneration method, contributing to sustainable pollution management solutions.

This study evaluates the performance of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (codh) embedded strains in bench-scale microbial electrochemical systems (MES) for CO₂ reduction to biofuels and biochemicals. CO2 fermentation efficiency was evaluated by comparing the wild-type Clostridium acetobutylicum (Wild), a negative control E. coli strain lacking the codh gene (NC-BL21), and engineered E. coli strain (Eng) alone and with IPTG induction (Eng+IPTG). Four electrochemical systems were used viz. Wild+E, NC-BL21+E, Eng+E, and Eng+IPTG+E, with a poised potential of 0.6 V applied to the working electrode. CO₂ and bicarbonate were supplemented to a total inorganic carbon (IC) concentration of 40 g/L, with a retention time of 60 h. The engineered strains demonstrated enhanced metabolic performance compared to the wild-type and negative control strains, yielding a maximum formic acid concentration of 2.1 g/L and acetic acid concentration of 7.8 g/L under the Eng+IPTG condition. Ethanol yield was highest at 3.9 g/L under the Eng+IPTG+E condition, substantially exceeding the 2.4 g/L acetic acid yield observed in the wild-type strain. The engineered strains showed superior cumulative yields (0.4075 g/g), improved codh charge flux stability (60 vs. 5 for Wild), and upregulated expression of genes in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Bioelectrochemical performance analysis demonstrated elevated reductive catalytic currents, enhanced CO₂ reduction, and optimal charge transfer kinetics. This study highlights the effectiveness of genetic and process engineering, particularly codh overexpression and IPTG induction, in optimizing microbial electrosynthesis for biofuel and biochemical production from C1 gases.

Introduction Ammonia has been used for diverse applications, and its worldwide demand is significantly high. Therefore, it is desirable to develop ammonia synthesis methods that do not emit carbon dioxide, unlike the Haber-Bosch process. In this context, lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (Li-NRR) has received much attention as an alternative method. Previous research 1) has shown that ethanol works as a good proton source for Li-NRR. However, there are some concerns about the use of ethanol, which is associated with its cost and sustainability. Alternatively, N 2 reduction would be paired with water oxidation in full-cell operation. Hence, Li-NRR with water as a proton source is ultimately desired. Recently, our group revealed that the addition of a certain amount of water improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) to ammonia in Li-NRR, mainly due to the modification of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) 2) . On the other hand, previous reports 3) show that other proton carriers could replace ethanol, and also proton carriers influence SEI composition and proton activity. Therefore, combining proton sources other than ethanol with water may tune the SEI composition and proton activity, making it suitable for operating in the presence of water. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Li-NRR in the presence of various amounts of water in electrolytes containing a variety of proton carriers. From this study, we aim to elucidate the factors that enable electrochemical ammonia synthesis in the presence of water, which is required to achieve Li-NRR using water as a proton source. Electrolytes were prepared by mixing (CF₃SO₂)₂NLi (LiTFSI) and tetrahydrofuran to make the 1 mol dm -3 electrolyte solution. Subsequently, various proton sources, such as ethanol, propanol, and phenol, as well as water were added to the electrolytes. The electrochemical measurements were conducted using electrolysis cells composed of a working electrode: Mo plate, counter electrode: Pt wire, and reference electrode: Li 1- x FePO 4 . During chronoamperometry (CA) at -4.5 V vs. Li 1- x FePO 4 , the applied charge was set at 10 C. After the electrolysis, the FE of ammonia formation was calculated using the quantification method reported elsewhere 4) . The FE obtained with water varied with the type of proton carrier used, indicating the importance of optimizing the proton source to enable the operation under the co-existence of water. In the presentation, we will show the results of Li-NRR with other proton carriers, and the correlation between FE and properties of proton source and/or SEI will be discussed.

The iron and steel industry is a sector with very high energy consumption and also causing high emissions. It is difficult to imagine the development of modern sectors of the economy such as construction, transport or the machinery industry without the use of steel, so forecasts indicate that the demand for steel will increase in the future. Meanwhile, environmental concerns and concerns about climate change are growing, so the iron and steel industry faces a serious challenge related to reducing its emissions in order to achieve the goal set in the Paris Agreement, and this is even more true for this industry in the European Union. Currently, the most popular technology for steel production is the blast furnace process – basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF). This technology requires the use of coal, which is a source of emissions, so a radical technological change is needed. Decarbonising the steel industry requires changing from coal-based metallurgy to hydrogen-based and electricity-based metallurgy. Changing from primary to secondary steel production (using scrap steel) improves the situation but is not a solution to meet growing demand. There are two main technology paths that can achieve significant CO2 reduction. The first is Smart Carbon Usage (SCU), which is based on the gradual reduction of coal consumption, including the use of by-product gases for further conversion into valuable products. The second emerging technology path is Carbon Direct Avoidance (CDA). These and other developing methods of low-emission or zero-emission metallurgy are discussed in the article. Unfortunately, some of these methods are not mature and their final commercialisation requires overcoming a number of problems.

Carbon black is one of the most ubiquitous reinforcing fine particles in use today for tyres and rubber goods, providing significantly enhanced performance, strength and lifetime. Without carbon black, tyres would have to be replaced at a significantly higher rate, and thus carbon black has proven to be one of the first, original sustainable materials providing a significant social contribution towards sustainable mobility and the benefits this concept brings to civilization. Additionally, carbon black is used for many specialty applications in plastics, inks, and coatings where its benefits as a colourant, conductive agent and UV-resistive material are realised, again providing higher performance and longer lasting materials with significant social benefit. In this chapter, the manufacturing processes for the various commercial carbon blacks produced today are reviewed, along with the fundamental properties of carbon black that play a key role in its performance in its numerous applications. Also discussed is the future of carbon black and the latest recycled and renewable materials that may compliment carbon black in the future, obviously with an eye toward future reductions in CO2 and the concept of sustainable carbon blacks.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties, but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active-learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results experimentally. To illustrate their catalytic implications, we examined the behavior of Rh single atoms on the reconstructed surfaces, focusing on CO2 activation, the rate-limiting step in the RWGS reaction. Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.

Abstract Due to multiple external shocks since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the world economy, SSA is facing acute debt distress and new highs in the cost of foreign capital at exactly the time it needs to mobilise a stepwise level of financing to invest in human, physical and natural capital to meet the region's development and climate goals for the 21st Century. This paper outlines the relative levels of sovereign external debt and service payments between now and 2030 for SSA countries. We calculate the fiscal space level left to meet climate and development financing needs during the same period. The region cannot meet those pressing needs without new forms of liquidity, concessional and grant finance to complement and bend down the cost of capital and comprehensive debt relief. We find that External debt in SSA has more than tripled since 2008, experiencing the largest increase in debt and the largest increase in debt-to fiscal revenue in the developing world—as capital costs have hit new highs.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and private bondholders represent 60% of the region's external debt, with roughly equal shares of 30%. China and the Paris Club are owed 12 and 5%.Sub-Saharan's external debt service is the equivalent to 93% of the average country's climate financing needs, and only ten countries in the region have the borrowing space to finance those needs.The region urgently needs new forms of liquidity, concessional and grant-based development finance that catalyses low-cost private finance; and for those countries in debt distress significant debt relief across all creditor classes that is aligned with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.MDBs will need to provide between $2.4 and $34.5 billion in relief in a manner that does not harm their preferred creditor status or crediting ratings, or the burden of reduction by the private sector and official creditors will be immense. Sub-Saharan Africa's debt distress is in large part a function of external shocks of which the region had no control—such as COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, climate shocks, the globalisation of inflation from advanced economies and advanced economy interest rate hikes. Moreover, the region is responsible for roughly one half of 1% of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and bares the highest level of the costs of climate change itself (IMF, 2017; Moss, 2020). Given the lack of voice and representation that the region has in the international economic architecture, advanced economies must lead. Further inaction will not only inflict material damage globally in the form of climate change and lost market opportunities, but also further erode the legitimacy of the architecture itself.

This study investigates the distributional impacts of carbon taxes, traditionally examined through simulation studies on the regressivity of hypothetical tax scenarios. However, the dy-namic influence of actually implemented carbon taxes on consumption/income poverty and inequality in a cross-country setting has been less scrutinised. This paper assesses the effect of carbon taxes introduced in the past three decades in 15 European countries on consumption shares of the lowest decile groups, poverty rates and inequality indices. The analysis shows that a $40/ton CO2 tax covering 30% of emissions leads to a consumption share increase of up to 4% for the bottom 20% and 40% of the population, a trend that persisted for five years post implementation, particularly in nations that efficiently redistribute carbon tax revenues. This resulted in a modest reduction in consumption inequality over three years. In contrast, the impact of carbon taxes on income poverty and inequality is not statistically significant. These findings suggest that concerns about poverty and inequality due to carbon taxes can be miti-gated by implementing a moderate tax combined with a strategically efficient revenue redis-tribution mechanism.

β-cyclocitric acid and its precursor β-cyclocitral are signaling apocarotenoids which trigger defense and detoxification mechanisms enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. From a transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis plants exposed to each apocarotenoid over several exposure times, we identified a gene (CYP81D11) encoding a cytochrome P450 that is strongly induced under all conditions and is under the control of the TGAII-SCL14 transcription regulator. Overexpressing the CYP81D11 gene in Arabidopsis led to a very tolerant phenotype to high light stress while a CYP81D11-deficient mutant was photosensitive. The transcriptomic profile of the CYP81D11 overexpressor revealed a selective upregulation of genes related to photosynthesis and the response to high light stress. Photosynthetic electron transport, CO2 fixation and biomass production were noticeably improved by high expression levels of CYP81D11. These effects occurred in high light, not in low light, and were associated with a noticeable reduction of singlet oxygen photoproduction. These findings indicate that CYP81D11 is a key component of β-cyclocitral-induced stress tolerance, acting through enhancement of the photosynthetic capacity of leaves. This gene could be a new target for improving photosynthesis, particularly in sunny environments.

Sustainable energy has been focused on by the whole world for the earth-friendly development toward the goal of net-zero. Vehicle electrification is one of the most efficient strategies. However, lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) which are the primary power source used in electric vehicles need to overcome the obstacles of current LiBs, especially their high cost and low energy density. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the energy of LIBs to make them a practical replacement for internal combustion engines. Commercial electrodes are typically fabricated via slurry casting process. This involves mixing the active material, conductive additives, and polymer binder in a solvent: water for the anode and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) for the cathode, to form a slurry. NMP as a solvent, which incurs carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and leads to increased manufacturing costs due to high-temperature drying and solvent recovery processes. Recently, dry-processed electrodes have attracted attention as next generation method due to its cost reduction, eco-friendliness, and ability to realize extremely high mass loading electrode. Thick electrode design approaches can substantially increase the active material loading by decreasing the inactive component ratio at the cell level, thereby leading to increased battery energy density as well as decreased cost. In the fabrication of thick electrode through wet process, solvent evaporation can cause binder migration due to unhomogeneous distribution of binder during the drying of high mass loading slurry. Additionally, Li-ion diffusivity and electrolyte permeability are compromised due to the clogging of the electrode surface caused by migrated binder. On the other hand, dry process does not need a solvent for manafaturing electorde, removes the drying process required for solvent evaporation, thus reducing carbon emissions and processing costs. Especially, the fabrication of thick electrodes via dry process ensures uniform dispersion of active materials. A simple change in the electrode manufacturing process effectively overcome the aforementioned challenges in the slurry process and could provide numerous advantages to the LIBs system. The typically employed binder in dry-process polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) which has sticky properties under high stress to form PTFE fibrils. The obtained fibrils can act as a net to support active materials and conductive additives. The dry process innovates the routes of electrode fabrication form the traditional "powder-slurry-film" route to the simple "powder-film" route. However, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PTFE has a high affinity for electrons , electrochemically unstable when used as binder for anodes. During the initial lithiation process, PTFE undergoes defluorination, resulting in the formation of lithium fluoride and amorphous carbon. This irreversible decomposition causes lower the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and diminishes the binding properties of PTFE, which significantly deteriorates long-term cycling performances. In this work, we examined fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an electrolyte additive to explore how an FEC-derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) influences the irreversibility of PTFE and the electrochemical stability of a dry-processed graphite. The FEC-derived SEI reduced the irreversible side reactions of the PTFE and improved the ICE. The SEI also preserved the structural robustness of the PTFE. The alleviated PTFE deterioration not only achieved high cycle stability and high-rate performance but also suppressed graphite volume changes during cycling. The FEC additive improved the ICE of full cells from 72.5% (without FEC) to 83.8% (with FEC) and improved capacity retention from 53.7% (without FEC) to 85.7% (with FEC) in the full cells after 100 cycles. Furthermore, the dry-processed anode under ultrahigh areal capacity (7.5 mAh cm −2 ) exhibited excellent cycling stability for up to 200 cycles in a full cell with LFP. This study presents a promising strategy to alleviate PTFE degradation, enabling the widespread application of PTFE binders for cost-effective and eco-friendly dry battery manufacturing.

The electrification of transport is increasingly recognized as a pivotal strategy in global efforts to mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and decrease dependency on fossil fuels. This paper investigates the key drivers behind the shift toward electric transportation, emphasizing environmental benefits, energy security, and technological advancements. Notable environmental advantages include significant reductions in CO2 emissions and air pollution, while energy security is enhanced by diminished reliance on oil and improved integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with renewable energy sources. Technological progress in battery systems, electric drivetrains, and smart grid infrastructure has accelerated the feasibility of widespread EV adoption. Despite these advances, the transition to electric transport faces several challenges, including the need for extensive charging infrastructure, sustainable sourcing of critical materials like lithium and cobalt, and the economic impacts on industries and labor markets. The paper explores strategies to overcome these challenges, such as advancements in recycling technologies, enhanced grid management, and supportive economic policies. By analyzing both the drivers and barriers, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape and future prospects for sustainable transport electrification.

Various electrocatalysts have undergone extensive examination regarding their capacity to selectively produce desired products via the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Nonetheless, the efficiency of a CO2RR electrocatalyst does not guarantee the effectiveness of a co-catalyst on the semiconductor surface for photoelectrochemical CO2RR. Herein, we synthesize Bi2S3 nanorods and electrochemically reduce them to Bi nanoplates that adhere to substrates for use in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical CO2RR applications. Compared with bare Bi, the Bi 2 S 3 -derived Bi (S-Bi) nanoplates on carbon paper exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for formate (HCOO - ) in the electrochemical CO 2 RR, achieving a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 93%, with minimal H 2 production over a wide potential range. This highly selective S-Bi catalyst is being employed on the Si photocathode to investigate the behavior of electrocatalysts during photoelectrochemical CO 2 RR. The strong adhesion of the S-Bi nanoplates to the Si nanowire substrate and their unique catalytic properties afford exceptional activity and selectivity for HCOO - under simulated solar irradiation. The selectivity observed in electrochemical CO 2 RR using the S-Bi catalyst correlates with that seen in the photoelectrochemical CO 2 RR system. Combined pulsed potential methods and theoretical analyses reveal stabilization of the OCHO* intermediate on the S-Bi catalyst under specific conditions, which is critical for developing efficient catalysts for CO 2 -to-HCOO - conversion. These results emphasize the potential of S-Bi as an effective catalyst for CO 2 reduction reactions and provide valuable insights into optimizing the reaction mechanisms and enhancing the product selectivity, especially in conjunction with co-catalysts for Si photocathodes.

Chemical weed control is a significant agricultural concern, and reliance on a limited range of herbicide action modes has increased resistant weed species, many of which use C4 metabolism. As a result, the identification of novel herbicidal agents with low toxicity targeting C4 plants becomes imperative. An assessment was conducted on the impact of 3-cyanobenzoic acid on the growth and photosynthetic processes of maize (Zea mays), a representative C4 plant, cultivated hydroponically over 14 days. The results showed a significant reduction in plant growth and notable disruptions in gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence due to the application of 3-cyanobenzoic acid, indicating compromised photosynthetic activity. Parameters such as the chlorophyll index, net assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), maximum effective photochemical efficiency (Fv′/Fm′), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (ϕPSII), and electron transport rate through PSII (ETR) all decreased. The A/PAR curve revealed reductions in the maximum net assimilation rate (Amax) and apparent quantum yield (ϕ), alongside an increased light compensation point (LCP). Moreover, 3-cyanobenzoic acid significantly decreased the carboxylation rates of RuBisCo (Vcmax) and PEPCase (Vpmax), electron transport rate (J), and mesophilic conductance (gm). Overall, 3-cyanobenzoic acid induced substantial changes in plant growth, carboxylative processes, and photochemical activities. The treated plants also exhibited heightened susceptibility to intense light conditions, indicating a significant and potentially adverse impact on their physiological functions. These findings suggest that 3-cyanobenzoic acid or its analogs could be promising for future research targeting photosynthesis.

There has been a growing interest in tandem electrocatalysts with unique interfaces and synergetic functions, which have been reported to exhibit outstanding performance in activity [1] , selectivity [2] , and stability [3] . Besides the development of monolithic tandem nanostructures, nanoparticle (NP) assembly provides a more desirable and controllable strategy to elaborately design novel nanocatalysts for various applications. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) and 3D tandem nanostructures, 1D tandem nanostructures have attracted more interest due to their high electrochemical surface areas, great atomic utilization, and outstanding structural stability, all of which are highly favored to achieve better electrocatalytic activity and stability. However, controllable 1D NP assembly is still challenging to achieve due to its relatively high surface energy and anisotropy, not to mention the creation of periodic 1D heterogeneous nanostructures with intimate interfaces and clean surfaces. In this work, we report a strategy to obtain periodic Pt-Au nanowires (NWs) by the assembly of Pt-Au Janus NPs with the assistance of peptide T7 (Ac-TLTTLTN-CONH 2 ). We further demonstrate that the Pt-Au NWs show highly improved catalytic performance in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), a 5.3 times higher specific activity and a 2.5 times higher mass activity than that of the current state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. The charge transfer at the interfaces of adjacent Pt and Au regions could weaken the binding energy between Pt and CO or CO-like intermediates, contributing to the enhancement of activities in MOR. More importantly, the periodic Pt-Au NWs exhibit outstanding stability in MOR, where the mass activity of Pt-Au NWs after 1000 cycles retains 93.9%, much higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (30.6%). We believe that this strategy to design and obtain periodic NWs by the assembly of Janus NPs is universal and transformative to diverse electrocatalytic reactions to achieve synergistic effects and intimate interfaces with high catalytic activity. [4][5] In conclusion, we have obtained periodic Pt-Au NWs by the assembly of Pt-Au Janus NPs with the assistance of peptides and demonstrated their outstanding activities and stability in MOR. This research presents a strategy to develop periodic heterogeneous nanowires with intimate interfaces and synergistic effects by the 1D assembly of Janus NPs, which offers an opportunity to design and program periodic 1D tandem catalysts.

The Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) is a research and development consortia funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, which has engaged partners from national laboratories, universities, and industry to conduct multidisciplinary research at the intersection of biofuels and combustion sciences. Since 2016, the Co-Optima team has examined high-quality bioblendstocks, and their properties, as design variables for increasing efficiency in modern engines while decarbonizing on-road light- and heavy-duty vehicles. The objective of this analysis is to combine and expand upon research into Co-Optima multi-mode bioblendstocks, which blend with petroleum gasoline to form high efficiency fuels for combustion in both spark ignition and advanced compression ignition engines. Consequently, the economic and environmental impacts of deploying 10 different multi-mode bioblendstocks derived from renewable and circular resources are quantified. Each bioblendstock is evaluated across several variables including (1) target blend levels of 10, 20, and 30 vol %, (2) years from 2030 to 2050, (3) crude oil benchmark prices, (4) vehicle lifetime miles, and (5) incremental vehicle costs. A Monte Carlo simulator is developed using a refinery optimization model and life-cycle analysis tool from prior Co-Optima research to sample marginal abatement costs of CO2, or cost of removing an additional unit of CO2, corresponding to each bioblendstock while considering input variable uncertainties. Results show that the combination of efficiency gains from advanced multi-mode fuel-engine technologies and the reoptimization of refinery operations results in several bioblendstocks demonstrating near-zero expected marginal abatement costs. Variable importances are also explored to highlight which aspects of the multi-mode technology are most influential in determining marginal abatement costs. Results suggest that Co-Optima multi-mode technology could provide economically viable decarbonization contributions to electrification-resistant light-duty vehicle sectors or near-term emission reductions, while Co-Optima fuels or alternatives decarbonize further to reach net-zero status.

This study examines calcium extraction from Bottom Ash (BA) and the use of Solid Residue (SR) as a substitute for White Lump Clay (WLC) in brick production. Experimental analyses identified calcium and silicon as the main elements in BA, with 50% of calcium carbonate recovered through leaching. SR was a viable alternative to WLC in ceramic bricks, as SEM-EDS and FTIR analyses revealed changes in composition and microstructure. This approach promotes circular economy principles by recovering resources and reducing waste. Calcium extraction from BA can produce 29,000 tons of CaCO3 annually for industrial use, while substituting SR for WLC in brick production could replace 30% of clay, saving 1500 tons of clay and producing millions of bricks annually. Less than 50% of incinerated Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) would require landfilling. The process supports sustainable construction by conserving natural resources, reducing landfill waste, and lowering CO2 emissions. It offers annual cost savings of 2,639,250 USD and preserves 74,812.5 tons of resources through waste and clay reduction. By demonstrating a scalable model for waste valorization, this research aligns with global goals for sustainable development, resource efficiency, and ecological balance.

Research on future energy is underway due to the problems caused by global warming and fossil fuel depletion. Of particular interest among these is hydrogen energy, which is garnering significant attention due to its high energy density per unit mass and its abundance in space. Additionally, it has the advantage of being eco-friendly since it can be produced by electrolyzing water and does not produce carbon dioxide as a by-product when used. The methods for electrolyzing water include alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE). In alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), achieving high current density is challenging due to significant ohmic losses arising from the considerable distance between the anode and cathode. For proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the electrodes are closely situated within the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) structure, allowing for high current density. However, it suffers from the drawback of requiring precious metals due to the harsh corrosion conditions. AEMWE combines the advantages of PEMWE's compact structure and AWE's utilization of transition metals as catalysts. However, further research is needed on AEMWE as it has not yet reached the performance level of PEMWE, which uses noble metal catalysts known for their high reactivity in electrolysis. In water electrolysis, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs at the cathode, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place at the anode. In the HER, two electrons are involved in the reaction, whereas in the OER, four electrons are involved, resulting in a slower reaction rate for OER. Therefore, since the overall reaction rate of water electrolysis is determined by OER, research on the OER catalyst is essential. Among transition metals, Ni is known to be a good catalyst for OER, and research is underway on Ni-based catalysts enhanced in activity and durability through synergy effects with other transition metals such as Fe, Co, and Mo. However, as the performance still falls short compared to precious metals, incorporating a small amount of precious metals alongside can enhance the catalyst's performance. Precious metals such as Ir and Ru are known for their good activity in the OER. Nonetheless, Ir is considerably more expensive than Ru, and since Ru exhibits slightly superior activity, we intend to use Ru. There are several methods for synthesizing catalysts, including chemical precipitation, chemical vapor deposition, hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel method, and electrodeposition. Among them, electrodeposition allows for the variation of catalyst composition, morphology, thickness by changing the composition of the solution, applied voltage, and time. Moreover, it occurs at room temperature and pressure and offers rapid fabrication times, making it advantageous for scaling up from lab scale to industrial scale in the future. Galvanic replacement is a spontaneous substitution reaction that occurs due to the standard reduction potential difference between two metals. The metal with a relatively higher (more negative) standard reduction potential undergoes oxidation to form ions, while the metal with a lower standard reduction potential is reduced from ions to metal. Through this reaction, a small amount of precious metals can be doped onto the surface in nanoparticle form. Since this reaction occurs spontaneously, no additional devices are required, and it can occur at room temperature and pressure, similar to electrodeposition, making it suitable for scaling up to industrial scale. Here in, we synthesized NiFe catalysts on SUS paper via the electrodeposition method. Moreover, we incorporated a small amount of Ru through galvanic replacement. We evaluated the performance of the catalysts under 1 M KOH conditions. In the half-cell test, NiFe/SUS exhibited an overpotential of 256 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 , which was reduced to 229 mV with Ru doping. In the single-cell test, Ru-NiFe/SUS showed excellent performance, achieving 8.3 A at 80°C and 2 V.

Background: The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is a measure of quantitative anesthetic potency and has become the standard index for the evaluation and comparison of volatile anesthetics, in addition to guiding dose administration. Black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) are primates present in the clinical and surgical routine of veterinary hospitals, as well as experimental models, especially in neuroscience. Few studies have evaluated the potency of the main volatile anesthetics in this species. This study aimed to determine the MAC of isoflurane and sevoflurane in C. penicillata using the up-and-down method and to evaluate the effects of these drugs on the quality of anesthetic induction, maintenance, and recovery. Materials, Methods & Results: Twenty-four animals of undetermined age were used. All marmosets were healthy according to hematological and physical evaluation. The animals were randomly divided into two groups: ISOMAC and SEVOMAC. Each animal was induced to general anesthesia in an anesthetic box with oxygen (5 L/min) and sevoflurane at 7% in the SEVOMAC group or isoflurane at 5% in the ISOMAC. Upon reaching lateral decubitus, orotracheal intubation was performed. General anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane or sevoflurane diluted in oxygen (0.8 L/min) using a non-rebreathing delivery system under spontaneous ventilation. As defined in the pilot study, the first animal from ISOMAC started the maintenance of anesthesia with 2.6% isoflurane, while the first animal in SEVOMAC received 4% sevoflurane. After finishing the instrumentation to assess heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, and rectal temperature, a 15-minute wait to reach anesthetic equilibrium was allowed, and then an electrical noxious stimulation (50 mA and 50 Hz) was performed on the lateral aspect of the thigh (a faradic current of 3 consecutive single stimuli, followed by 2 continuous stimuli). The animals' responses to the electrical stimulus were observed. The presence of a positive response (gross movement of the limbs, head, or vocalization) or a negative response (absence of gross movements) determined the increase or reduction, respectively, of the inhalation anesthetic concentration by 10% in the subsequent marmoset. The quality of anesthetic induction and recovery from anesthesia was evaluated using a scale that measured the intensity of agitation, coughing, nausea, and vomiting. Physiological variables were recorded before (M0) and after (M1) applying the nociceptive stimulus. Isoflurane and sevoflurane MAC values in C. penicillata were 2.29 ± 0.10% and 3.93 ± 0.61% respectively. Physiological parameters, quality of anesthetic induction and recovery did not differ significantly between groups. However, isoflurane caused irritation of the airway and ocular mucous membranes, more coughing episodes, and tearing at induction. There was no difference between groups for time to extubation and recovery time to regain sternal position. Discussion: Previous studies in primates found lower MAC values for both anesthetics, except for Lemur catta. Those findings may be explained by the use of different nociceptive stimuli and the MAC determination method employed, although no differences in MAC values have been described between bracketing or up-and-down methods in human primates and dogs. It is unlikely that the stimulus and technique alone are the determining factors for the high concentration of isoflurane and sevoflurane observed in the present study since MAC was high with both halogenates, indicating that dose extrapolation from other species can lead to the wrong anesthetic dosage.

Biochar’s benign effects on agricultural production have been demonstrated. Still, no consistent conclusions have been drawn on the impact of biochar-amended paddy fields on carbon sequestration, gas emission reduction, and efficiency enhancement in typical cropping areas in the middle Yangtze River. A field experiment using five dosages of biochar (CK, BC1.5, BC3, BC4.5, and BC6) at 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 kg·m−2 was conducted at the Hubei Irrigation Experiment Center Station, Jingmen City, Hubei Province, China, to investigate the effects of biochar on carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, and agricultural efficiency in paddy in the middle Yangtze River Region. This study showed that the optimal biochar dosage was 4.5 kg·m−2 (BC4.5). Biochar significantly improved soil properties, increased rice yield by 26.4–61.4%, and enhanced water use efficiency (WUE) and economic profit (EP) by 32.0–83.7% and −8.0–48.6%, respectively. Biochar increased soil carbon sequestration (SCS) and carbon pool management index (CPMI) by 23.0–198.3% and 22.9–71.5%, respectively. Biochar also reduced greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI), global warming potential (GWP), and emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that soil organic carbon (SOC), in addition to the “biochar” influence factor, was a key positive influence factor for SCS, CPMI, and EP. Another major positive factor for GWP was silt, and for WUE it was saturated hydraulic conductivity, while TN and SOC were the major negative variables for GHGI. In summary, biochar demonstrated outstanding carbon sequestration and emission reduction impacts while ensuring crop production growth and efficiency improvement. The results provide a research basis for safeguarding food security and mitigating climate warming in the middle Yangtze River region.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile class of materials that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. A growing number of studies aim to identify potential new SACs or to describe their structure and reactivity through ab initio quantum chemical simulations. While many computational studies primarily address reactions involving small molecules, such as water splitting or CO2 reduction, the application scope of SACs is rapidly broadening to include the production of fine chemicals and the conversion of biomass-derived platform molecules, processes that involve larger, more complex reactants. Using density-functional theory (DFT) simulations, we demonstrate that, while an approximate treatment of entropy is acceptable for molecules with up to three atoms, it introduces substantial errors in reactions involving more complex molecules. Our results reveal a linear correlation between the entropy of adsorbed molecules and that of the corresponding isolated species, mirroring trends observed on extended catalytic surfaces. For the largest systems investigated in this study, the entropy of the free molecule is reduced by approximately 10–20% upon adsorption; for small molecules, this reduction can range from 50 to 70%. This disparity arises because, on SACs, the translational entropy is effectively zero, the rotational entropy is minimal, and the vibrational entropy increases with the size of the molecule. Moreover, the entropy of adsorbates scales linearly with the number of atoms in the molecule, allowing for the prediction of entropic contributions of adsorbates on SACs without additional computational cost. Using propyne hydrogenation as a test, we demonstrate that the reaction energy profile computed with current approximate approaches for estimating the entropy of adsorbates differs significantly from the profile where entropy is explicitly included. These findings highlight the importance of considering adsorbate entropy for accurately predicting the catalytic activity of SACs, particularly for reactions involving complex molecules.

This paper presents a framework for optimisation and techno-economic analysis of various pressurisation pathways for CO2 pipeline transportation. The pressurisation pathways include a conventional compression only case from initial to final pressure, a sub-critical compression part followed by cooling, liquefaction and pumping and also a super-critical compression part followed by cooling and dense phase pumping. The presented framework is developed based on open-source components and information available in the public domain. The framework includes a high level of flexibility to study variations in intial and final pressures, inclusion of inter-stage pressure drop, inter-stage cooling temperature, liquefaction/pumping pressure, among others. The implemented methods i.e. the thermodynamic and economic models applied, are rigorously validated and bench-marked against literature data. Contrary to former studies that focus mainly on reduction of the work required for pressurisation, the presented method includes additional capabilities to assess CAPEX, OPEX and the levelised cost of CO$_2$ compression. The analysis shows that in some cases the minimum levelised cost does not coincide with the minimum work. It is also demonstrated that for some cases the super-critical compression/cooling/pumping case and the sub-critical compression/cooling/liquefaction/pumping pathways provide optimal levelised cost compared to a multi-stage compression only case.

Renewable raw materials, as regenerative biobased feedstock for chemicals, have an enormous potential for reducing feedstock-related greenhouse gas emissions. Dedicated to driving the growth of bioeconomy, we continuously explore and develop building blocks for turning the bioeconomy ambition into a reality. Bio-based products are already available in the market but are limited in growth due to lack of technologies and product development costs. Alternatively, scale-up and utilization of biobased feedstocks, leveraging existing infrastructure, requires utilization of different chain-of-custody models. That is how a growing need for bio-attributed products, which provide the same quality and performance of their conventional equivalent and a proven benefit determined by the reduction of the Product Carbon Footprint in cradle-to-gate assessments, can be fulfilled. Ranging from a discussion around collaboration to drive sustainability in the chemical industry, towards current and future policy asks, we discuss about the opportunities of using different types of feedstocks and how we can accelerate industry transformation strategies by using attribution models, model biogenic CO2-uptake in a meaningful, fair, and transparent way, based on accepted and harmonized standards, such as global ISO standards. We provide reference points and statistics and address the latest and the most important bioeconomy-related aspects of bio-attribution as science is evolving.

Cities encounter increasing risks and challenges under new development patterns, and digital economy (DE) can drive cities’ improved resilience to natural and social uncertainties. Based on data collected on the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2011 to 2021, the development situation of the regional DE and urban resilience (UR) was measured, and the impact mechanisms of the DE on UR were analysed theoretically and empirically using a benchmark regression model. The findings are as follows: The benchmark test revealed that the DE development contributed significantly to UR in the region. The mediating effect test revealed that the DE improved UR through two pathways: industrial structure upgradation and energy restructuring. The moderating effect test suggested that environmental pollutant emissions had a negative moderating effect between the impact mechanisms of the DE, industrial structure, and energy structure and between the effects of industrial structure, energy structure, and UR, whereas CO2 emissions had a positive moderating effect between the impact mechanisms of DE and industrial structure. Heterogeneity analysis indicated that the DE contributed positively to the UR except in the upstream region, where the coefficient of the DE was insignificant. Overall, this study highlights the crucial role of the DE in improving UR and elucidates the theoretical impact mechanisms of environmental pollution control and carbon reduction measures on UR.

Diet is one of the main factors shaping the human microbiome, yet our understanding of how specific dietary components influence microbial consortia assembly and subsequent stability in response to press disturbances – such as increasing resource availability (feeding rate) – is still incomplete. This study explores the reproducible re-assembly, metabolic interplay, and compositional stability within microbial consortia derived from pooled stool samples of three healthy infants. Using a single-step packed-bed reactor (PBR) system, we assessed the reassembly and metabolic output of consortia exposed to lactose, glucose, galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and humanized GOS (hGOS). Our findings reveal that complex carbohydrates, especially those containing low inclusion (~1.25 gL−1) components present in human milk, such as N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc), promote taxonomic, and metabolic stability under varying feeding rates, as shown by diversity metrics and network analysis. Targeted metabolomics highlighted distinct metabolic responses to different carbohydrates: GOS was linked to increased lactate, lactose to propionate, sucrose to butyrate, and CO2, and the introduction of bile salts with GOS or hGOS resulted in butyrate reduction and increased hydrogen production. This study validates the use of single-step PBRs for reliably studying microbial consortium stability and functionality in response to nutritional press disturbances, offering insights into the dietary modulation of microbial consortia and their ecological dynamics.

These compounds were differed by the isomerism of the meso-substituent of the porphyrin molecule and the nature of the counterion (Ts-, I-). The data of the redox-behavior and efficiency of the use of porphyrin compounds in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been obtained. The electrochemical behavior has been studied by using the cycling voltammetry method. It should be noted that two stages of the electroreduction process were observed in an argon medium for ligands. For the cobalt complexes additional processes was found. The process of the porphyrin macrocycle electroreduction in the potential region of -0.78 ... -1.36 V and the Co3+↔Co2+, oxidation (reduction) process localized on the metal atom at Еred/ox= 0.19 V were found. The N-substitution of the pyridyl fragment of porphyrins leads to a small increase in their reducing ability, in comparison with unsubstituted tetrapyridylporphyrins [H2(Py-4- and -3)4P]. The possibility of using water-soluble porphyrins in the ORR electrocatalysis has been considered. It has been shown that the nature of the metal cation has a significant effect on the electrocatalytic activity of compounds in the molecular oxygen ionization reaction of in an aqueous-alkaline media. The activity of Сo-complexes was increased by ~ 50-90 mV compared with ligands and a system without a catalyst at ~ 140-160 mV.

Energy efficiency in glass buildings is pivotal for achieving sustainable energy. Energy consumption is crucial in areas with diverse climatic conditions, including tropical and cold regions. In these environments, there is a notable demand for electricity due to the necessity of conditioning and heating systems to maintain resident comfort. Therefore, residents can address high energy consumption in buildings by regulating visible light and heat transmission through electrochromic windows. These windows modify their optical properties through adjustments in applied voltage. This work discussed the development of key components of electrochromic windows, including the electrochromic layer, ion-conductive layer, and electrolyte. The outstanding optical modulation of the electrochromic layer was achieved by coating a WO 3 film onto NiO film. The presentation covered the synthesis of an ion-conductive layer with a reduced band gap, a high level of oxygen vacancy, and a reduction of resistance achieved through optimization of preparation parameters, such as annealing temperature and percentage loading of Cu. The architectural configuration comprised a bi-layer film containing WO 3 coated on NiO as the electrochromic layer and a 5%Cu-doped NiO layer as the ion-conductive layer, with LiClO 4 as the electrolyte. This configuration achieved a quadlet dual-band functionality, providing clear, cool, dark, and warm modes for resident comfort. In the clear mode, with no bias voltage applied, the window transmitted visible (630nm) and near-infrared light (930nm) at approximately 79.03% and 79.33%, respectively. The cool mode, regulated by a bias voltage of -2.5V, reduced NIR transmission to 41% while maintaining visible light transmission at 74%. The dark mode, with a bias voltage of -3V, blocked visible and NIR light to 0.09% and 0.02%, respectively. These phenomena resulted from the change of optical properties in the electrochromic layer. Conversely, the ion-conductive layer enabled the warm mode with a 2V bias, reducing visible light transmission to 50.31% while maintaining overall window transparency at 69.86%. Furthermore, the electrochromic window demonstrated excellent cycle stability, sustaining functionality up to 30,000 cycles while maintaining an optical modulation of 95% compared with the first cycle. Additionally, abundant silk waste from textile industries was transformed into a green solid electrolyte used in assembling electrochromic windows. An optimal configuration was found with a 10-micron thickness and 14.5 wt% of LiClO 4 in the solid electrolyte, resulting in an excellent electrochromic window. In clear mode, the assembled window achieved a transmission of 74.67% in both visible and near-infrared regions. In the dark mode, the optical modulation difference (630 nm and 930 nm) between a solid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window and a liquid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window was less than 10%. Conversely, in cool mode, the solid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window exhibited optical modulations of 75% and 39% at wavelengths of 630 nm and 930 nm, respectively, compared to a liquid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window. Additionally, in warm mode, the optical modulation of the solid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window at 630 nm and 930 nm was 60% and 91%, respectively, compared to that of a liquid electrolyte-assembled electrochromic window. Implementing these electrochromic windows for residential comfort can cause a decrease in electricity demand, which is currently the main issue of carbon dioxide emission from the conventional combustion of fossil fuels.

For many decades, fossil fuels, including gas, oil, and coal, have acted as the primary contributors to electricity generation [1]. Nevertheless, the combustion of carbon-based fuels causes substantial emissions of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), thereby precipitating climate change and adversely affecting human well-being and the environment [2]. Consequently, there is an endeavour to innovate and develop efficient and environmentally acceptable energy sources. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a pivotal half-reaction within diverse renewable energy technologies. Despite its significance, the OER is intrinsically sluggish and energy-intensive, necessitating the advancement of electrocatalysts that are both efficient and stable to facilitate this reaction [3]. In recent years, layered double hydroxides (LDH) have emerged as potential candidates for OERs due to their cost-effectiveness, versatile composition, and favourable electrocatalytic properties [4]. Ni-based LDHs, particularly NiFe-LDH, have been extensively investigated and proven to be effective OER electrocatalysts in alkaline environments [5]. However, its limited electrical conductivity hinders further enhancement of its OER catalytic activity. Meanwhile, Co-based LDHs, such as NiCo-LDH and CoFe-LDH have been proven to have excellent electrocatalytic activity [6]. In contrast to binary LDHs, the ternary LDHs, incorporating diverse transition elements can exhibit higher capacitance and contain more abundant active sites [7]. However, the utilization of LDH electrode materials is limited by their low conductivity and tendency for agglomeration. Graphene serves as an excellent substrate for catalyst immobilisation in electrocatalysis, owing to its superior electrical conductivity, high surface areas, and impressive stability [8]. Therefore, the combination of ternary LDHs, characterised by reversible redox activity, and conductive graphene is expected to represent an efficient approach for fabricating hybrid materials with enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, facilitated by the advantageous interplay between LDHs and graphene. Accordingly, in this study, trimetallic CoNiFe-LDHs were designed and grown on graphene (G) through a one-step hydrothermal approach to obtain a structure that promotes efficient charge transfer, optimizing the OER kinetics. A 2-level full-factorial model was used to determine the effect of Co (1.5, 3 and 4.5 mmol) and graphene (10, 30 and 50 mg) concentrations on the OER onset potential, which was the chosen response parameter. The independent and dependent variables were fitted to the linear model equation, using ANOVA analysis. The F-values, the ratio of noise to response, confirmed that the model is significant (p<0.05). The p-values less than 0.05 indicate the model terms, such as cobalt and graphene concentrations and their interaction, are significant, implying that the OER onset potential is strongly correlated to these parameters. The polarization curves of CoNiFe-LDH/G composites for OER are shown in Figure 1. The OER was run in triplicate using the Co 3 Ni 3 Fe 3 -LDH/G 30 (central point) to estimate the variability (0.58%). The comparison study showed that a low onset potential (1.54 V) and overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 (1.58 V) was achieved for Co 1.5 Ni 3 Fe 3 -LDH/G 10 , demonstrating that a low concentration of cobalt and graphene could make for an ideal electrocatalyst in practical applications.

Photoelectrochemistry holds the promise of directly converting sunlight to valuable chemical products since its birth over 50 years ago. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods, however, lag behind their electrochemical (EC) counterparts (which can be powered by a solar photovoltaic (PV) power source) in terms of current density, by orders of magnitude. In this work, we demonstrate that by integrating the recent achievements of the PV and EC communities (in terms of using concentrated sunlight and gas diffusion electrodes, respectively), we can achieve current densities similar to EC methods, but with lower energy input. Specifically, in this proof-of-concept study, we combined the direct PEC oxidation of glycerol (on a NiOOH co-catalyst-coated n-Si photoanode) with the dark hydrogen evolution (HER) or CO2 reduction (CO2R) in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) separated continuous-flow PEC cell. We achieved over 110 mA cm–2 photocurrent density under 10 Sun irradiation, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than those typically reported in the literature, for any of these PEC half reactions. We demonstrated that the product distribution of glycerol oxidation is notably different in PEC and EC scenarios at the same current density, and the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be suppressed in the PEC case. This approach raises new opportunities to drive electrochemical reactions with complex reaction pathways in a more selective manner even at high current densities. In the second part of my talk I will demonstrate the effect of the co-catalyst properties in tailoring the product distribution.

Iron and steel production, comprising approximately 95% of the global metal output annually 1 , are integral to modern industrialization, with steel serving as a critical material across various sectors, including construction and automotive industries. However, the industry's significant environmental impact is evident in the escalating CO 2 emissions observed over the last decade. Due to this massive environmental burden, efforts to develop cleaner alternatives that benefit from advantages of electrochemistry have grown. Existing and emerging electrochemical processes ideally aim for emission-free operations by utilizing energy extracted from renewable sources. While processes operating at high temperatures (using molten oxides at 1600°C) show promise, they face some challenges related to complex materials choices 2 , resulting in increased production costs. Conversely, processes operating at low temperatures using aqueous electrolytes (60-100°C) suffer from significantly lower production rates and efficiency 3,4 . In this study, we present a novel approach—moderate temperature, chloride-based molten salt electrolysis (MSE) of iron—under development at CWRU. This method combines the advantages of both high and low-temperature electrolytic processes, offering a clean, cost-effective, and practical solution for sustainable iron metal production. During chloride MSE, iron is electrodeposited from a binary (NaCl+FeCl 3 ) or ternary (LiCl+KCl+FeCl 3 ) chloride mixture at moderate temperatures ranging from 300-500°C. Electrowinning in these molten salts capitalizes on their several attractive properties, including low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, high diffusivity, high solubility for electroactive species, electrochemical stability over a wide potential range, and fast electrochemical kinetics. 5 Figure 1 illustrates the overall process flow of iron production via chloride MSE, including the upstream non-carbothermic chlorination of ore to FeCl 3 resulting in the separation of ore impurities and the subsequent electrolytic deposition process. Initial findings indicate promising outcomes for sustainable iron electrowinning at lower operational costs, attributed to the moderate temperatures, high electrolyte conductivity (1-2 S/cm), and adequate FeCl 3 concentrations (>2 M), allowing for high current efficiencies (>85%) at high electrodeposition rates (approaching 1 A/cm 2 ). Furthermore, the chloride MSE process enables the incorporation of a proprietary dimensionally stable anode (DSA) to catalyze the chlorine evolution reaction at the anode. This innovation significantly reduces cell voltage, thereby enhancing the overall process energy efficiency. Figure 1.

"The preservation of meat has always presented a complex problem to man. The first means of preservation was probably rubbing salt onto the meat surface. This dried out the surface enough and produced a high enough salt concentration to inhibit the growth of spoilage organisms. It is believed that the salt used at first contained many impurities such as salt peter (sodium nitrate), which were also inhibitory to spoilage organisms. The meat would last longer than fresh unprotected meat, but the high salt concentration produced a rather unpalatable finished product. New means of preservation were provided with an increase in technology. A new method of preservation was developed by Nicholas Appert in the late 1700's. He found that foods heated in sealed containers lasted longer than foods that were unprotected as long as the container was not opened. This finding developed into the canning industry. Refrigeration was the most important technological advancement in meat preservation since canning. The reduction in temperature down to 0-5 [degrees] C decreased the rate of growth of spoilage organisms. Refrigeration greatly expanded the length of time meat could be stored. Meat could be transported further with increased shelf-life and storage time at home was increased. With the advent of refrigeration in the retail store, meat could be individually packaged and self-service meat cases evolved. The retail shelf-life was still limited to several days because the meat packaging material was oxygen permeable and provided an environment for bacterial growth. New types of packaging systems have been introduced that replace or remove oxygen and thus inhibit spoilage bacterial growth. Different gasses have been used to replace oxyqen to extend the storage life of meat. Carbon dioxide has been used successfully to replace oxygen and has caused significant increases in storage time (Baran et al., 1970; Huffman, 1974). Huffman, (1974) also reported using nitrogen to replace oxygen, but found no decrease in bacterial counts. In addition, Pierson et al., 1970, reported finding no difference between vacuum packaging and nitrogen gas packaging. Vacuum packaging excludes oxygen from the meat package thereby inhibiting aerobic spoilage organisms. Oxygen impermeable films have been developed to facilitate vacuum packaging. The use of vacuum packaging has become very popular in the distribution of beef wholesale cuts. Vacuum packaging of pork has not been utilized much in industry to date. Very little is known about the effects of vacuum packaging on pork. The objectives of this research were to determine: 1. The impact of (a) chill method and storage temperature and (b) meat quality on weight losses, tenderness, and oxygen saturation of the purge in vacuum packaged fresh boneless pork sirloin roasts. 2. The impact of leakers on (a) the subsequent microbial profile population and (b) fresh meat color after three days of retail display of vacuum packaged fresh boneless pork sirloin roasts."--Introduction.

Introduction In recent years, carbon dioxide emissions are rapidly increasing, and electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to play a significant role towards achieving a carbon-neutral society with most of them utilizing Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs). The negative electrode active material of LIB is typically made of graphite, and during initial charging, the electrolyte undergoes reductive decomposition at the graphite/electrolyte interface, forming a Solid-Electrolyte Interphase (SEI). SEI exhibits lithium-ion conductivity while being electronically insulating, facilitating highly efficient charging and discharging by suppressing further electrolyte decomposition. On the other hand, the formation of SEI consumes lithium ions, resulting in irreversible capacity loss [1] . Therefore, the nature of SEI has a significant impact on LIB performance. Regarding the composition of SEI, it is known to comprise clusters of inorganic compounds such as LiF, Li 2 CO 3 , Li 2 O and organic decomposition products like polyolefins. Each component has different properties such as LiF was reported to have lower lithium-ion diffusion barrier and higher chemical stability than other inorganic components [2] . However, many aspects of the individual electrochemical roles are still unclear, and forming an excellent SEI is an important issue. Objective In this work, we focused on LiF, which is considered to be a crucial component in SEI [3] , and modelized the LiF-coated graphite by employing atomic layer deposition (ALD) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). We investigated the influence of LiF on the lithium-ion transfer reaction behavior at the graphite/electrolyte interface. Experimental Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) served as the graphite negative electrode, and atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used for the LiF coating. Regarding ALD, LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and WF 6 were used as the Li and F sources, respectively. The deposition temperature was set at 300 °C, and HOPG was deposited at various numbers of cycles (10, 30, 60, and 90 times). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the electrode after the ALD coating. Regarding electrochemical measurements, the setup utilized a three-electrode cell with HOPG as the working electrode, lithium metal as the counter and the reference electrodes. 1.0 mol dm −3 LiClO 4 /EC+DEC (1:1 vol.%) was used as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s −1 and a scanning range of 0.005 – 3 V (vs Li + /Li). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at an applied AC voltage of 5 mV and a frequency range of 100 kHz – 10 mHz. EIS measurement was also performed at different temperature with a holding potential of 0.2 V to obtain activation energy. Results and discussion For the HOPG electrode coated with LiF, XPS analysis was performed and it was confirmed that the LiF coating layer was thickening as the number of coating cycle increased. In the CV measurement results, redox peaks were observed in the range of 0 – 0.6 V, confirming that the intercalation-deintercalation reaction of lithium ion was progressing. From the Nyquist plot obtained by EIS measurements, semicircles derived from SEI were observed in the high frequency region, and semicircles derived from charge transfer resistance were observed in the medium and low frequency regions. The activation energy of the charge transfer resistance was calculated by fitting the Nyquist plot (Figure 1) obtained from the temperature-dependent measurement of EIS, and revealed that the values were 54.8 kJ mol −1 for the uncoated HOPG electrode, 55.1 kJ mol −1 for 10 coatings, and 52.8 kJ mol −1 for 30 coatings, respectively, showing no significant change. On the other hand, the activation energy slightly decreased with increasing number of depositions, which was found to be 49.7 kJ mol −1 and 50.0 kJ mol −1 in the case of 60 and 90 coatings, respectively. This suggests that when the LiF coating layer reaches a certain thickness, lithium-ion charge transfer between the electrolyte and the electrode becomes easier. Details will be discussed in the conference. References [1] Y. Tateyama, J. Comput. Chem. Jpn. , 18 (2019) 18-28. [2] M. Chen, J. Zheng, Y. Liu, O. Sheng, Z. Ju, G. Lu, T. Liu, Y. Wang, J. Nai, Q.

The article presents the results of research on the impact of material and construction solutions on energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Field research was conducted in an existing free-standing greenhouse located in southern Poland. The research period covered the entire calendar year. The measurement data were used in the next step to validate the computational model using the numerical method of elementary balances. The data distribution was also analyzed in terms of basic statistics. The validated and verified model was used in the further part of the analysis to conduct computer simulations for three variants, differing in terms of material and construction solutions. The variants included: no foundation insulation, extruded polystyrene (XPS) insulation and the use of single-chamber polycarbonate panels with thermal insulation of the foundations. The obtained results showed a high agreement between theoretical and real data (85–89% for the coefficient of determination (R2) and 84–88% for the GOF method). In the case of variant 1, which in terms of material and construction solutions corresponded to the actual construction of the greenhouse, it was found that the annual energy demand for heating purposes amounted to 153,234 kWh/year. In variant 2, in which additional thermal insulation relative to the zero state was used, the energy demand for heating purposes was lower and amounted to 147,704 kWh/year. The lowest heat load was characteristic of variant 3, in which 116,294 kWh/year was required to cover heating needs. The variant with polycarbonate and foundation insulation brought energy savings of 24% and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 24%. In addition, replacing fuel from hard coal with natural gas brought significant benefits, reducing pollutant emissions by 51%. The paper is a new approach to the use of the mentioned numerical method for the assessment of gaseous pollutant emissions in this type of building based on numerical simulations of energy consumption.

Ammonia is a compound that has a wide range of uses, such as fertilizers, chemical raw materials, denitrification reducing agents, carbon-free fuels, and energy carriers, and is in high demand. All of its industrial production of ammonia relies on the Haber-Bosch process. Although the Haber-Bosch process is an excellent reaction process, it requires hydrogen (H 2 ) as a raw material, so there is a desire to develop new synthetic methods that are more flexible. Various ammonia synthesis methods have been studied, but they still require H 2 as a raw material. Currently, H 2 is mostly produced by decomposing fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. Not only will this involve emitting carbon dioxide during the H 2 production, but also it will prevent us from moving away from fossil fuels. Our research group has succeeded in developing the Plasma/Liquid (P/L) reaction, a method for synthesizing ammonia that doesn’t require H 2 , for the first time in the world. The P/L reaction is a reaction that proceeds at room temperature and pressure without a catalyst. The P/L reaction involves two steps: (1) activation of nitrogen (discharge or electromagnetic wave irradiation), and (2) self-reduction reaction due to hydrogen abstraction reaction from water molecules by activated (dissociated and excited) nitrogen. In this study, we demonstrated that dissociated nitrogen (atomic nitrogen; N atom ) promotes the ammonia synthesis reaction more efficiently and selectively than excited nitrogen molecules in P/L reaction. The activated nitrogen species can be roughly divided into three states: Natom, excited nitrogen molecules (N2*), and nitrogen molecular ions (N 2 + ). Of these, N 2 * and N 2 + are also called metastable nitrogen. On the other hand, N atom is highly reactive, so the P/L reaction will proceed quickly, abstracting hydrogen atoms from water molecules. To verify ammonia synthesis in the P/L reaction by Natom, we performed quantitative analysis of N atom . Focusing on the fact that Natom has an absorption maximum in vacuum ultraviolet light, we analyzed the relationship between discharge conditions and quantitative results of generated N atom by vacuum ultra violet (VUV) spectroscopy. It has become clear that N atom can be generated with high selectivity by using a barrier discharge device that we designed and constructed, in which the discharge space is filled with titania beads. By directly connecting this discharger to the reactor that performs the P/L reaction, we constructed a connected reactor that eliminates oxygen contamination. In the P/L reaction using this reactor, ammonia was synthesized with high selectivity in the water phase, and the production of nitrate ions, which are typical by-products of nitrogen fixation reactions, was suppressed. When a P/L reaction proceeds in which ammonia is produced with high selectivity, it is necessary to consider how the oxygen in the water molecule behaves. In our previous research, using electron spin resonance (ESR) demonstrated that activated nitrogen species abstracts hydrogen atoms from water molecules by forming hydroxyl radicals (·OH) after the P/L reaction. In this case, we also show that nitrates are formed by the reaction of ·OH with activated nitrogen species. However, when we performed ESR analysis on the P/L reaction which is dominated by Natom, we found that ·OH wasn’t present. This suggests that N atom abstracts two hydrogen atoms from the water molecule, leaving only the oxygen atom in the water phase. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the behavior of this oxygen atoms. Therefore, we collected gas after the P/L reaction and performed gas analysis. As a result, it was revealed that NO and H 2 were generated in the gas phase. Based on the above results, we considered that the following reactions proceed in the P/L reaction in which N atom production selectivity was improved by PbDBD. N atom + H 2 O → NH 2 + O 2N atom + H 2 O → 2NH + O N atom + O → NO N atom + O → NO + H 2 What is noteworthy is that H 2 gas can be generated in parallel with ammonia synthesis through the P/L reaction. The above results indicate that in the P/L reaction using PbDBD, ammonia can be synthesized with 100 % selectivity in the water phase, and H 2 and NO gas can be generated in addition to ammonia in the gas phase. As mentioned earlier, ammonia has a wide range of uses and is in high demand. NO gas can be reacted with water to synthesize nitric acid. H 2 can of course be used as energy. We successfully demonstrate that three useful compounds can be synthesized at once from nitrogen and water through the P/L reaction.

The article examines the impact of Industry 4.0 concept on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, particularly Goal № 9 «Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure». The theoretical foundations of Industry 4.0 concept are analyzed, with systematization and generalization of definitions by leading scientists, based on which the author's interpretation of the term is proposed. Key components of Industry 4.0 are identified, including cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, robotics, and additive manufacturing, which contribute to achieving sustainable development goals. The relationship between the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies and the realization of specific objectives of Goal №9 is investigated, including the development of quality infrastructure, modernization of industrial enterprises, stimulation of innovative activity, and ensuring equal access to digital technologies. A practical example of Industry 4.0 technology implementation is presented through the creation of a «smart» office model for IT enterprises in Ukraine using Cisco Packet Tracer tools. A conceptual model of such an office is developed, incorporating various Internet of Things devices to optimize energy consumption and improve operational efficiency. A detailed economic analysis of potential resources and cost savings from implementing the proposed technologies across Ukraine's entire IT sector is conducted. Calculations demonstrated the possibility of annual savings of approximately 50 million hryvnias and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 25,000 tons of CO2 equivalent when implementing smart office technologies in 2,500 IT companies nationwide. It is substantiated that Industry 4.0 also contributes to achieving other sustainable development goals, particularly in the areas of energy efficiency, environmental protection, and economic growth. Major challenges in ensuring equal access to Industry 4.0 technologies are identified, and solutions are proposed through expanded international support and the creation of a favorable political climate for domestic innovation development. Based on the conducted research, conclusions are formulated regarding the key role of Industry 4.0 in achieving sustainable development goals and the necessity of coordinated efforts at global and national levels to maximize its benefits.

With the growth of global energy demand and the reduction of fossil fuels, the search for clean energy has become particularly urgent. Hydrogen energy, due to its cleanliness and high efficiency, is regarded as an ideal alternative energy source. Methane catalytic cracking technology, as an effective way to produce hydrogen, has significant economic and environmental value.This study focuses on the application of vanadium-based catalysts in biogas cracking for hydrogen production. Vanadium-based catalysts have shown great potential in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons due to their cost-effectiveness, environmental compatibility, high catalytic activity, and stability. An innovative one-step method was used to prepare Ni-VC/TiO2 composite catalysts, and the impact of vanadium carbide (VC) content on the performance of the catalyst was studied. The addition of VC not only optimized the catalyst&#039;s active surface area but also enhanced its conductivity and electron transfer capability, thereby improving catalytic efficiency.Experimental results indicate that an increase in VC content leads to a decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalyst, but an increase in pore size, which is beneficial for the adsorption and diffusion of gas molecules. Moreover, the reaction temperature has a significant effect on the performance of the catalyst: at 500°C, the 10Ni-5VC/TiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest stability and hydrogen production rate. However, at higher temperatures, the methane conversion rate and hydrogen yield will drop sharply due to the increased graphitization of coke, which accelerates the deactivation of the catalyst.Through regeneration experiments, we found that using CO2 as an activator at 600°C can effectively restore the activity of the catalyst. However, as the number of regenerations increases, the performance of the catalyst gradually decreases, which is related to the increase in Ni grain size and the formation of surface amorphous coke. SEM and TEM analysis showed that coke mainly exists in the form of filamentous carbon, which affects the long-term stability of the catalyst.

A fuel cell is a generator that produces electric power by the hydrogen oxidation reaction at a fuel electrode and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at an air electrode. A fuel cell is a clean energy conversion system that produces only water without emission of carbon dioxide. However, Pt (an expensive precious metal) is used as a catalyst of a fuel cell. Reduction of Pt loading in the catalyst or development of alternative materials of Pt is important for the widespread of fuel cells as a primary energy source in the future. Finding out materials that have higher ORR activity is a major target of the development of fuel cells. TiO 2 , a more abundant resource compared to Pt, is one of the alternative materials of Pt. The ORR activity of TiO 2 can be enhanced by metal doping [1]. Theoretical calculation predicts that doping of Pd and Rh reduces the overpotential of the ORR to zero [2]. The ORR activity of Nb doped TiO 2 electrodes depends on the crystal orientation as follows: TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (111) < TiO 2 (110) [3]. However, the real surface structure and adsorbed species for enhancing the ORR activity have not been determined on TiO 2 single crystal electrodes in electrochemical environments. In this study, we have studied the adsorbates on the low index planes of TiO 2 single crystals in 0.1 M HClO 4 using nanoparticle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (NPSERS). We assigned adsorbed species using DFT calculation. 1%Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (100), TiO 2 (110) and TiO 2 (111) were annealed and chemically polished with a 30w% HF solution. Au nanoparticles of about 50 nm were dispersed on the single crystal surfaces. Raman spectra were measured by stepping the potential positively with the interval of 0.1 V. The electrolyte solution was 0.1 M HClO 4 . All the potentials were referred to RHE. NPSERS bands were found at 580 cm -1 and 360 cm -1 in Ar saturated HClO 4 . The onset potentials of the bands were 0.4, 0.6, and 0.7 V(RHE) on TiO 2 (100), TiO 2 (110) and TiO 2 (111), respectively. The Au-O stretching vibration of Au nanoparticles appears from 1.4 V(RHE) at 590 cm -1 [4]. Thus the observed bands originate from surface adsorbates of TiO 2 . The band at 580 cm -1 was shifted 15 cm -1 to lower frequency in D 2 O solution, showing that the band is an adsorbed species containing hydrogen. On the other hand, the band at 360 cm -1 is an oxygen species such as Ti-O because no deuterium isotope effect was observed in D 2 O solution. DFT calculation showed that symmetrical stretching vibrations of Ti-OH-Ti (bridged OH) and Ti-OD-Ti locate at 577 and 564 cm -1 , respectively. Ti-O-H out-of-plane bending vibration and in-plane bending vibration also locate at 350 cm -1 and 680 cm -1 , respectively, which are close to the above-mentioned 577 cm -1 according to the DFT calculation using the bridged OH model. However, these two vibrations shift more than 100 cm -1 by the substitution with deuterium, which contradicts the experimental result. Other candidates of the adsorbed species containing hydrogen are OH and OOH on 5-coordinated titanium. However, TiO 2 (100), which has no 5-coordinated titanium, also gave the NPSERS band at 580 cm -1 . Therefore, the band at 580 cm -1 is assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of Ti-OH-Ti (bridged OH). The onset potential of 580 cm -1 band increases as TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (110) ≤ TiO 2 (111), whereas the order of the ORR activity is TiO 2 (100) < TiO 2 (111) < TiO 2 (110). No correlation is found between the onset potential and the ORR activity. This result suggests that adsorbed water, which cannot be observed with NPSERS, is involved in the ORR activity.

More efficient usage of shale gas reserves and natural gas resources will allow for higher olefin yields and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a direct pathway for converting methane to ethylene at temperatures >700 °C. OCM catalysts preferably avoid CO x products and limit coke formation on the catalyst. Often, catalysts are analyzed via computationally expensive DFT computations in combination with experimental results leading to long lead times for catalyst development. Perovskite oxide catalysts are useful for OCM due to their flexible bond networks and varied properties (conductivity, selectivity, surface area) based on synthesis/doping. This work aims to illustrate the utility of the bond-valence bond-length model (ionic model) 1 ,2 in conjunction with gas reduction experiments for rapid structure evaluation of the co-doped perovskite BaMg 0.33 Nb 0.67-x Fe x O 3-δ (BMNF, x=0.17,0.25,0.33). This perovskite catalyst has previously been adopted as a CO 2 sensing material 3 and an active/stable anode for the electrochemical oxidative coupling of methane 4 (E-OCM). Further evaluation of this perovskite by our group illustrated the unique stability of ionic Fe into the BMNF while performing the oxidative coupling of methane 5 . This work delves into the crystal structure of the BMNF material as well as its chemical stability validated using a much more facile computational methodology featuring the bond-valence bond-length method. XPS, XRD, and reduction/oxidation high temperature cycling are utilized in conjunction to illustrate the stabilizing mechanisms for cations within the BMNF perovskite when exposed to highly reducing environments.

The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) for chemical production using renewable electricity offers attractive “carbon-neutral” and “carbon-negative” mitigation strategies for greenhouse emission. CO 2 RR to C 2 + chemicals, the compounds containing two or more carbons, represent a particularly interesting topic from both fundamental research as well as practical application points of view. For example, ethanol, ethylene, propanol, etc. are among the most produced chemicals by the industry and are widely used for various applications. Distributive CO 2 RR by recycling locally emitted CO 2 to manufacture these chemicals for the local consumption could substantially reduce the cost of CO 2 storage and transport while producing economic income. Electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 involves a fundamental reaction step – proton couple electron transfer (PCET). CO 2 RR to CO or formic acid requires only two PCET steps, rendering them highly effective with fast kinetics. CO 2 RR to C 2 + chemicals are significantly more challenging due to the rapid escalation of required PCET steps (for example, 12 for ethanol and 18 for propanol), as well as the C-C bond coupling reaction. These increased PCET steps substantially complicate the electrochemical reaction coordinate, leading to a high probability of branching reactions, which lower the single product Faradaic efficiency (FE). [1] At Argonne, we developed an amalgamated lithium metal (ALM) synthesis method of preparing highly selective and active electrocatalysts through collaboration with Northern Illinois U. For example, we derived a Cu-based CO 2 RR catalyst that yielded > 90% FE for conversion of CO 2 to ethanol [2]. More recently, we expanded the approach to metal Sn and prepared a family of CO 2 RR catalysts with Sn size varying from single atom, ultra-small clusters to nano-crystallite. High single-product FE s and low onset potential of CO 2 conversion to acetate ( FE = 90 % @ -0.6 V), ethanol ( FE = 92% @ - 0.4 V), and formate ( FE = 91% @ -0.6 V) were achieved over the catalysts of different active site dimensions. [3] In this presentation, we will discuss in detail on the CO 2 conversion mechanism behind these highly selective, size-modulated p -block element (Sn) catalysts. We will elucidate the catalytic reaction path using first-principle computation, advanced material characterizations, together with kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study. To our surprise, we found that PCET reaction paths over these catalysts can be completely altered by switching from H 2 O to D 2 O in the electrolyte, an important experimental observation to support future theoretical exploration on the transition state theory of CO 2 RR.

<div class="section abstract"><div class="htmlview paragraph">The aim of this study is to compare possible approaches that support the goal of achieving a carbon-neutral society in the mobility sector, with a specific focus on the two-wheel segment of the mobility sector. One of the key considerations in the mobility sector is the transition from a fossil fuel-based energy mix to a more renewable one. While there are numerous options available for achieving a carbon-neutral society in the four-wheel scenario, the two-wheel sector presents a different challenge due to a smaller number of available options. This study introduces a new comparison between full electric, gasoline, and ethanol-powered two-wheeled vehicles. It suggests that ethanol is a feasible solution for reducing carbon emissions in the two-wheel sector. The study includes an analysis of CO2 emissions for two-wheel vehicles using a life cycle approach, focusing on the technologies of full electric motorcycles, motorcycles with flex-fuel internal combustion engines running on gasoline, and motorcycles with flex-fuel internal combustion engines running on ethanol. The energy mix of a country, which serves as a reference for this study, directly impacts emissions from the mobility sector. Therefore, the analysis focuses on Brazil, China, and India, which represent significant markets in the two-wheel segment and are crucial for decarbonization efforts. The findings of the analysis indicate that motorcycles powered by ethanol can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 56% compared to gasoline-powered motorcycles and by 52%, 48%, and 37% compared to electric motorcycles in countries with emission-intensive energy sources such as China, India, and the United States, respectively. However, in countries with more renewable electricity sources, such as Brazil and France, full electric motorcycles showed slight advantages. The study also suggests that, based on the Brazilian experience with flex-fuel two-wheeled vehicles, replacing 60% of the current gasoline-powered fleet with ethanol-powered vehicles could lead to a reduction of around 34% of all emissions associated with the two-wheeler sector in China and India. The conclusions drawn from this study provide valuable insights for comparative discussions on the decarbonization of the two- and four-wheel segments. These insights can be instrumental in making strategic decisions and promoting the development of alternative sectoral solutions.</div></div>

Millet is one of the oldest cereal grains, used for several centuries in Asia and Africa. Its ease of growth in adverse environmental conditions and with minimum agricultural inputs made it a popular choice before the advent of the green revolution. However, the green revolution's recent focus on nutritional insecurity has led to a renewed interest in calorie-rich cereal grains like millet. Millet is not only a nutritious grain providing macronutrients and micronutrients, but it also contains health-promoting components such as phenolic compounds, dietary fiber, and resistant starch, benefiting patients with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular ailments, and celiac disease. In recent years, the approach of biofortification has further guaranteed nutritional enhancement in food crops, including millets, by increasing the concentration of nutrients or reducing the level of anti-nutrients to improve bioavailability. Added to its short life cycle are other advantages, such as drought resistance, durability, insect resistance, and pest resistance. The cultivation of millet offers several environmental benefits, including efficient utilization of water reserves, reduced emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), CO2 reduction from the atmosphere, and maintenance of soil health and fertility. The Himalayan range in northern India, spanning from west to east across the states of Jammu & Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, is known for its traditional millet-based foods, utilizing pearl millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, sorghum, etc., for their food and beverage requirements. In fact, the influence of the Green Revolution in these areas has been minimal due to environmental restrictions on large-scale production of wheat and rice. These Himalayan communities continue to widely use the millet crop, well-adapted to these cold, semi-arid regions, as food, fodder, and beverage for their domestic, cultural, and religious practices. We present a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of millet as a nutritious resource in the rural communities of the Himalayan ranges in this review. This paper details the different types of millet-based foods and beverages and the traditional practices used for their production in these rural areas. Promotion of the cultivation and consumption of millet grains can help achieve sustainable development of these rural areas, eliminating hidden hunger, malnutrition, and poverty, and thus attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as established by the United Nations (UN). These high-altitude millet populations are part of natural biodiversity which have been subjected to environmental interaction over hundreds of years, and thus, hold potential for revealing new germplasm if explored. Overall, the rural communities of the Himalayan regions hold a traditional treasure in their millet-based foods, which also alleviates the present-day problem of nutritional insecurity.

Greenhouse gas emissions and following global climate change problems are the most important human-being facing issues. The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is one of the most promising processes to obtain value-added hydrocarbons from carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O), and the process is being actively investigated as an alternative way to conventional hydrocarbon production by fossil resources. Among the electrocatalysts for CO 2 RR, copper (Cu) species are unique and most studied material group because of their capability of producing C 2+ species, such as ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) and propanol, through forming C-C bonding. Especially C 2 H 4 is the most highly demanded and profitable product [1] . Porous structure of electrodes is reported to be advantageous to CO 2 RR because it enables enrichment of reactants, CO 2 molecules, and intermediates [2–5] . Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a hydrophobic polymer, has been reported to be beneficial to increase the FE towards C 2+ products [6] and suppressing competitive reaction, hydrogen production [7,8] . In this study, we prepared PTFE modified porous Cu electrodes and investigated the influence of each factor and their synergistic effect on CO 2 RR activity. As a result, the introduction of porous structure increased FE to C 2 H 4 (FE(C 2 H 4 )) and suppressed both carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) production. Further modification by PTFE enhanced FE(C 2 H 4 ) and improved durability significantly. Porous Cu electrode was prepared by de-alloying process [9] . First, Cu and Al metals were co-sputtered to form CuAl alloy on gas-diffusion layer (GDL, MFK-A, Mitsubishi Chemical) coated with micro porous layer (MPL). The samples were etched using 5 wt.% hydrochloric acid for approximately 20 minutes to remove Al from the alloy and obtained porous Cu electrodes. CO 2 RR test was carried out in flow cell with gas-diffusion electrode (GDE), the electrocatalyst coated GDL, as a cathode under applied current density of 300 mA cm -2 . Both gas phase products and liquidous products were quantified by gas chromatography (GC). Structural characterizations using scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed that porous Cu structure was successfully formed, and porous Cu electrodes exhibited higher FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 48%, and lower FE toward CO (FE(CO)) of 6% and FE toward CH 4 (FE(CH 4 )) of less than detection limit, while smooth Cu electrode showed FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 45%, FE(CO) of 12%, FE(CH 4 ) of 0.6%, respectively. However, FE(C 2 H 4 ) started to decrease 6 hours after the start of the reaction and decreased to 12% after 24 hours reaction. This could be caused by GDE soaking to electrolyte. To overcome these issues, we next investigated PTFE added porous Cu electrodes. PTFE was introduced into the porous Cu layer by electrostatic spray [10] .The introduction of PTFE further improved FE(C 2 H 4 ) from 48% to 55% and demonstrated over 80% of FE towards valuable C 2+ products at 300 mA cm -2 . PTFE introduction enhanced durability and resulted in FE(C 2 H 4 ) of 55% for over 24 hours. References [1] S. Nitopi, E. Bertheussen, S. B. Scott, X. Liu, A. K. Engstfeld, S. Horch, B. Seger, I. E.

We have developed a novel interdigitated flow field for polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers (proton exchange membrane water electrolysis cells) for ground and space applications1),2), which are supposed to work in a hybrid system with a low temperature Sabatier reactor for effective use of heat3),4). This design separates the oxygen and liquid water inside the anode of the cell. It dispenses with water circulators and external separators that use natural or centrifugal buoyancy. To date, we have developed a numerical model for optimizing cell structures. Finite element modeling (COMSOL Multiphysics) of water transport is three-dimensionally conducted for the anode porous transport layer coated with a hydrophobic microporous layer (MPL) (SIGRACET 29BC, SGL Carbon Inc.) assembled with the interdigitated flow field. The MPL can separate the evolved oxygen gas and pressurized liquid water owing to capillary pressure5). The electrochemical kinetic parameters for the model are determined using electrochemical impedance spectra. We model the current densities and the current ratio between the reactant liquid water and water vapor at the interface between the MPL and catalyst layer (CL)6). The model involves the fractional bubble coverage of the produced oxygen gas at the CL, as well as liquid water saturation and liquid water permeability in the MPL7). The vapor evaporating from the liquid water in the MPL is assumed to be mixed with the evolved oxygen for diffusive water transport. The volumetric evaporation rate was estimated from experimental data8).

To enable a future society based on sun and wind energy, the transformation of electricity into chemical energy in form of fuels is crucial. Electrolysis offers a promising solution, achieving this transformation by splitting water. At the anode, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) produces protons and electrons that are used at the cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to generate hydrogen fuel. While hydrogen is the desired product, oxygen has limited economic value. From a techno-economic standpoint, a more attractive approach is hybrid water electrolysis, which replaces the OER with value-added oxidation reactions of abundant organic feedstocks. However, significant challenges stand in the way of widespread adoption of hybrid water electrolysis for large-scale industrial applications. This work provides a critical analysis of these hurdles, delving deeper into each aspect: Higher Kinetic Overpotentials for Organic Oxidation Reactions: Compared to the well-established OER, organic oxidation reactions generally have a lower energy consumption, but generally necessitate greater overpotentials to overcome kinetic limitations. Addressing this challenge requires the development of novel electrocatalysts that can significantly reduce the activation energy for organic oxidation reactions, bringing their kinetic performance closer to that of the OER. Limited Availability and Product Demand of Feedstocks and Products: The organic feedstocks suitable for these reactions may be less abundant or have a lower market demand compared to hydrogen (or even CO2 reduction). This scarcity or limited economic value of the organic substrates and products can potentially hinder the overall economic viability of hybrid water electrolysis. Extensive research into utilizing readily available and sustainable organic feedstocks is crucial. Additionally, exploring and developing markets for the products generated from these oxidation reactions would be necessary for widespread adoption. Additional Purification Needs: The products formed during organic oxidation reactions might require further purification steps to meet the specifications required for downstream applications. These additional purification processes add complexity and increase the cost associated with hybrid water electrolysis. Developing selective electrocatalysts that generate the desired products in high purity could significantly alleviate this challenge. High Activity: The catalysts should possess a high intrinsic activity for the target organic oxidation reactions, ensuring fast reaction rates and maximizing product yield. Selectivity for the Desired Products: Indiscriminate oxidation of the organic feedstock can lead to the formation of undesired byproducts, reducing the efficiency and necessitating complex downstream separations. Therefore, catalysts with high selectivity for the targeted products are essential. Long-Term Stability: Electrocatalysts must maintain their activity and selectivity over extended periods under operating conditions. Degradation of the catalysts can occur due to various factors, including chemical and structural transformations during operation. Developing electrocatalysts with exceptional long-term stability is paramount for the practical application of hybrid water electrolysis. By outlining these challenges, we aim to stimulate discussion and guide research efforts within the academic community. Addressing these critical aspects is essential to pave the way for the successful implementation of hybrid water electrolysis at an industrial scale, ultimately enabling a sustainable energy future.

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) over copper gas diffusion electrode (Cu-GDE) has the potential to generate multi carbon products (C2+ such as ethylene and ethanol) with renewable electricity at a commercial scale [1-3]. To unlock the potential, selectivity towards a desired product with acceptable current densities are a must [1-3]. Efforts are being made to understand catalyst structure, activity and selectivity relationships by different techniques, including a few in situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies [3-7]. However, there is no consensus on the active and selective site/phase composition of copper for ethylene production. On the one hand, the occurrence of only metallic Cu during the reaction is reported [3-7] while on the other hand, some of these studies find no correlation between the metallic Cu and eCO 2 R products distribution [3,4]. Differently, the occurrence of Cu(OH) 2 and Cu 2 O (along with metallic Cu) during the reaction is also reported [5,6]. The discrepancies could be a result of varied experimental conditions and in situ / operando cell designs [3-7]. The latter could play a key role in obtaining reliable structure-activity data [8]. The observations emphasise the need for targeted and cell specific operando spectroscopic studies to unravel structure, activity and selectivity relationships [3]. In the present study we report a novel operando XAS GDE flow cell with a three-phase system (i.e., gaseous CO 2 , liquid electrolyte and solid catalyst) to conduct experiments in a transmission mode that probes the Cu-GDE from surface to bulk and provides information on the copper oxidation and coordination states during the reaction. It would, however, not be able to distinguish between the surface and bulk composition [3] and hence complementary surface sensitive quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed to probe copper dynamics on the Cu-GDE surface [9]. The data are then complemented by Raman spectroscopy that monitors not only the surface adsorbed species but also the evolution of copper speciation (even very amorphous species) during the reaction [10]. The dynamic behaviour of copper during the reaction is captured by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. Linear combination analyses (LCA) show that within the first 20 min of the reaction, copper is only in oxidised state (mainly CuO and minority Cu 2 O), which is corroborated by the quasi in situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS). The majority of CuO is reduced to Cu 2 O (44%) and metallic Cu (44%) at 30 min of the reaction. The metallic Cu content increased to 77% at 60 min of the reaction, however remarkably the remainder (23%) of the copper is in the Cu 2+ oxidation state. The latter is not detected by quasi in situ XPS that instead shows copper only in < 2+ oxidation state, potentially as metallic Cu. This implies that the bulk composition is different from the surface composition which is further confirmed by the quasi in situ Raman that shows the presence of copper oxides, Cu(OH) 2 and CO adsorbed metallic Cu at 60 min. Based on the complementary spectroscopic data, eCO 2 R data will be correlated with the catalyst structure dynamics and structure-activity relations will be discussed. References: S. Nitopi, E.

Purpose China is experiencing an economic revolution focused on reducing carbon emissions (CEs). Various technological research and development (R&D) frameworks also hasten the growth of the digital economy, which then fuels this economic revolution. Nevertheless, several correlation uncertainties in China have been observed between R&D investment and CE reduction with green economic transformation. This phenomenon is attributed to insufficient spatial impact considerations. Design/methodology/approach Therefore, this article explored the spatial impacts of the digital economy and R&D expenditures regarding environmental quality using Chinese-related panel data between 2012 and 2021. This study uses the Moran I index to test whether there is a spatial relevance between regional carbon emissions in China and assess the digital economic advancement level using the entropy weight approach. In addition, this article analyzes the direct and indirect impacts following the partial differentiation approach, and then creates an interaction term between the digital economy and R&D investment to assess the moderating effect for examining the influence of investing in R&D on reducing CO2 levels of the digital economy. Findings A positive spatial relevance between the digital economy and CEs was then highlighted from the empirical findings. The digital economy expansion also demonstrated higher local CEs while negatively impacting nearby regions. Notably, the digital economy concurrently lowered and increased local CEs in the Eastern and Central zones, respectively. Overall, a larger R&D investment directly impacted the capacity of the digital economy in decreasing the carbon emission intensity (CEI) at a regional level. An accelerated digital economy expansion and lower CEI were recorded in the Eastern zone owing to more significant R&D investments. Research limitations/implications China has gradually shifted its focus from reducing CEs to implementing “dual control of carbon” to achieve the “dual carbon” target. Future studies should then involve additional studies concerning the impact mechanism and path selection related to “dual carbon control.” Practical implications Investment in R&D plays a key role in reducing carbon emissions from the digital economy. By fostering innovation and technological advances, R&D investment activities can create more energy-efficient digital infrastructures, develop sustainable practices and optimize resource use. In addition, these R&D investments can facilitate the transition to renewable energy sources, enhance data management systems to minimize waste and promote the adoption of green technologies by businesses and consumers. As the digital economy continues to evolve, prioritizing R&D in this area is critical to achieving long-term sustainable development goals and addressing the pressing challenges of climate change. Stakeholders across industries must therefore recognize the importance of investment in research and development as a strategic approach that not only drives economic growth but also ensures environmental stewardship in an increasingly digital world. Social implications Investments in research and development not only foster innovation and technological progress, but also promote sustainable practices, which can have significant environmental benefits. In addition, they have the potential to create new jobs, improve public health through better air quality and drive economic growth in a manner consistent with climate goals. As society becomes increasingly dependent on digital solutions, it is critical to harness the power of the digital economy to achieve a more sustainable and inclusive society. Originality/value Research development investment is critical to all aspects of regulation. Research on R&D investment can provide direction to local governments in formulating digital economy policies and can be beneficial to local governments in considering regional differences in resource availability. The research and technical innovation strategies in the policies for developing the digital economy can substantially expedite carbon neutrality achievement by 2060.

Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, wreaking havoc on the national pharmaceutical and medical supply industries, which are largely concentrated on the island.1 The impact was profound, particularly on the supply of small bags of intravenous (IV) fluids. For months afterward, hospitals across the United States struggled to obtain basic IV fluids, forcing clinicians to rethink how and when they used these products. The crisis highlighted the vulnerability of our healthcare supply chain to environmental disasters and underscored the need for more judicious use of IV fluids in the inpatient setting. In the wake of Hurricane Helene in September 2024, we find ourselves grappling with similar supply chain disruptions. By mid-October, ~86% of US physicians and providers had experienced IV fluid shortages.2 Some hospitals delayed noncritical surgeries3 and many hospitals continue to ration IV fluids until supplies return to their pre-Helene levels.4 These events, which are associated with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters due to climate change, demand long-term solutions. Hospitals face numerous challenges from extreme weather across the clinical care continuum. In addition to critical supply shortages, climate change and extreme weather can affect disease patterns (e.g., heat-related illness, injury, and vector-borne illnesses), resulting in care interruptions, and delay in diagnosis and treatment. As health care providers, it is incumbent upon us to not just treat the patient in front of us, but also to do our part in resource utilization to reduce waste and decrease patient care related greenhouse gas contributions and environmental harms that spur these events. Rather than relying on reactive and temporary workarounds, such as rationing supplies or importing from less-affected regions, it is time to reassess our dependency on IV fluids. While they are a cornerstone of inpatient care, used for everything from volume resuscitation in shock to rapid medication delivery, more environmentally sustainable, evidence-based practices exist that prioritize patient safety while conserving resources. We must also address the lack of supply chain resiliency and support broader efforts to reduce healthcare's large, negative environmental impact. There is growing evidence that IV fluids are often administered unnecessarily or continued longer than clinically indicated. The proportion of hospitalized patients who can safely receive oral hydration instead of IV fluids is likely substantial, particularly in cases where oral intake is feasible and safe. For patients with infectious diarrhea, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends oral rehydration solutions as the first line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration.5 In patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing contrast-enhanced CT or cardiac catheterization, oral hydration was as effective as IV hydration in preventing contrast-associated acute kidney injury.6, 7 Oral rehydration for clinically stable patients with hypernatremia has demonstrated safety in pediatric populations, and could be implemented for adult inpatients.8 Avoiding low-value practices restricting oral intake can reduce the use of IV fluids. Examples include shortening pre-procedure fasting times9 and early resumption of enteral nutrition for acute pancreatitis.10 Even for patients with dysphagia, a study by Leder et al. demonstrated that 90.7% of hospitalized patients who passed a 3-ounce water swallow challenge could be advanced to oral diets without subsequent signs of aspiration.11 Many medications such as antibiotics can be administered through IV push (like cefazolin and meropenem)12 or orally (as in azithromycin or fluroquinolones) with equal efficacy.13 IV proton pump inhibitors in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleed can be administered as infusions or intermittently as twice a day IV pushes or oral therapy after the initial 80 mg bolus, according to American College of Gastroenterology guidelines.14 Wherever fluids can be minimized, doing so provides multiple benefits including improved resource utilization and ease of nursing medication administration. Overuse in these cases is not only wasteful but also increases the risk of complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and prolonged hospital stays in patients with heart failure and other conditions. Moreover, the unnecessary use of IV lines increases the risk of infections and thrombophlebitis, adding to patient morbidity. Despite the evidence, excess use of IV fluids and medications remains a default practice in many hospitals. The reasons are multifaceted. Orders may be part of standard protocols, sometimes with little thought given to whether they are truly necessary. Many clinicians view IV fluid administration as a simple, low-risk intervention to "do something" for patients, especially where the clinical picture is uncertain. The complex nature of insurance reimbursements also contributes to this confusion, as the use of IV fluids and medications can be perceived as the difference between inpatient and observation status. This mindset contributes to a cycle of overuse that is difficult to break. Using IV fluids and medications more judiciously and developing better decision-making frameworks for fluid management also includes work to reduce our overall dependency on IV medications. A report by the Department of Health & Human Services identified more than 25% of drug and device manufacturers are located in areas at high risk of natural hazards including flooding, tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes.15 The climate change-induced disruptions caused by Hurricanes Maria and Helene offer opportunities to reevaluate our use of IV fluids. These events have forced hospitals to implement multifaceted measures aimed at conserving supplies, such as encouraging oral hydration when possible, limiting the use of IV fluids to critically ill patients, changing medications to oral equivalents, and more carefully monitoring fluid balance. From a greenhouse gas emissions perspective, the production of 500 mL of IV fluids generates about 0.5 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).16 If we can reduce annual usage by 25%, this could save emissions equivalent to driving a passenger car nearly 800,000 miles, or 285 trips from California to Maine in the United States. This rough estimate and other high-value care practices highlight the broader environmental benefits of simultaneously improving healthcare sustainability and potential cost reductions.17 Conservation strategies should not be seen as temporary measures but as part of a broader shift toward more mindful and evidence-based fluid management practices. Hospitals should consider implementing stricter guidelines for IV fluid administration. This includes regular reassessment of fluid needs, limiting automatic inclusion of IV fluids in admission orders, or requirements to reorder continuous IV fluids after a prespecified amount of time. Clinical decision support tools can help guide fluid management based on the patient's condition. For example, ask clinicians to consider if oral equivalents or oral hydration with fluid intake goals would be an appropriate first-line approach for patients with active diet orders. The practice of "keeping veins open" with IV fluids may also not be required as studies in the pediatric population suggest no difference between saline lock and continuous infusion on IV patency.18 As hospitalists, many of us are involved in administrative roles including resource utilization and supply chain issues as a part of process improvement and providing higher value. By taking steps now to reassess our utilization, we can create more resilient and adaptable healthcare systems better equipped to face the challenges of the future. This latest IV fluid shortage is not a supply chain anomaly. The COVID-19 pandemic is a lingering reminder that even the most basic elements of medical care are not immune to the forces of nature.19 Aside from causing severe equipment shortages, it also catapulted telehealth, once considered an aspirational next step for medicine, to the forefront of ambulatory care. Natural disasters, pandemics, and future unknown threats provide opportunities for innovation, improvement, and adoption of more sustainable practices. Rigorous and systematic research into best practices and disaster preparedness should be undertaken to inform our institutional policies and priorities given the increasing likelihood of future supply disruptions. Changing practice patterns will require more than updated guidelines and decision support tools. A cultural shift is necessary to reduce the default reliance on IV fluids and medications in inpatient care and to move to more sustainable hospital practice in general. This starts with education. Physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers need to be trained in the risks associated with unnecessary IV fluid use and the benefits of alternative approaches. They should also be apprised of the downstream environmental harms of hospital waste and overuse and how this can adversely impact our communities and patients.20 Medical schools and residency programs should emphasize evidence-based fluid management, teaching future clinicians to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of IV fluid administration. Continuing education programs for practicing providers can also help to reinforce these principles, especially in the context of supply chain vulnerabilities and disaster preparedness. Medical societies also have a role in driving sustainable healthcare delivery through clinical practice guidelines. Members of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health have committed to addressing climate change and health issues through their organizations and collectively through policy action and educational offerings. The frequent disruptions in IV fluid supplies due to climate disasters such as Hurricanes Maria and Helene highlight an urgent need to reduce overreliance on these products in the inpatient setting. We must seize this moment to promote smarter, evidence-based practices that not only conserve valuable resources but also enhance patient safety and care outcomes. This shift will require systemic changes, from updating clinical guidelines to fostering a culture that questions the routine use of IV fluids. By doing so, we can create a more resilient, patient-centered healthcare system capable of withstanding the growing pressures of climate-related disruptions (Table 1). The authors declare no conflict of interest.
