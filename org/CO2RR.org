Compared with the large number of publications devoted to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysed by polyoxometalates (POMs), the electrocatalysis of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CDRR) by these molecular catalysts has been only marginally explored. At first glance, this may seem surprising in view of their remarkable electron transfer properties which can be finely tuned by molecular engineering to fit the different proton-assisted multielectron reduction potentials for CO 2 . The possible combination of CO 2 with POMs in the form of coordination complexes appears, however, to be a promising route to develop POM-based electrocatalytic assemblies able to selectively drive CDRR. In this chapter, we provide an up-to-date description of more or less promising examples dealing with CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs in homogeneous (POMs dissolved in the electrolyte solution) and supported (POMs-modified (photo)electrodes) phases. This shows that promoting CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs with excellent performance metrics (efficiency, selectivity and stability) represents a current challenge. As a representative example, a POM-modified electrode that delivers high electrocatalytic current density (>10 mA cm −2 ) and is highly selective for CDRR has yet to be discovered.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high‐value carbon‐based chemicals provides a sustainable approach to achieving an artificial carbon cycle. In the decade, metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), a kind of porous crystalline porous materials featuring well‐defined structures, large surface area, high porosity, diverse components, easy tailorability, and controllable morphology, have attracted considerable research attention, serving as electrocatalysts to drive CO2 reduction. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structure/component advantages of MOFs meeting the requirements of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are analyzed. After that, the representative progress for the precise fabrication of MOF‐based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation, are systemically summarized. Furthermore, the emerging applications and promising research for more practical scenarios related to electrochemical CO2 conversion are specifically proposed. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook of MOFs for electrochemical CO2 reduction are further discussed.

Abstract High‐entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit distinctive catalytic properties owing to their diverse elemental compositions, garnering considerable attention across various applications. However, the preparation of HEO nanoparticles with different spatial structures remains challenging due to their inherent structural instability. Herein, ultrasmall high‐entropy oxide nanoparticles (less than 5 nm) with different spatial structures are synthesized on carbon supports via the rapid thermal shock treatment. The low‐symmetry HEO, BiSbInCdSn‐O 4 , demonstrates exceptional performance for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reaction (eCO 2 RR), including a lower overpotential, high Faraday efficiency across a wide electrochemical range (−0.3 to −1.6 V), and sustained stability for over100 h. In the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, BiSbInCdSn‐O 4 achieves a current density of 350 mA cm −2 while maintaining good stability for 24 h. Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the electron donor–acceptor interactions between bismuth and indium sites in BiSbInCdSn‐O 4 enable the electron delocalization to facilitate the efficient adsorption of CO 2 and hydrogenation reactions. Thus, the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step is reduced to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability. This study elucidates that the spatial structure of metal sites in HEOs is able to regulate CO 2 adsorption status for eCO 2 RR, paving the way for the rational design of efficient HEO catalysts.

Given the increasing emphasis on carbon dioxide (CO2), diverse approaches have been developed and then used to address the issue. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown promise in catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Different types of MOFs have investigated, including Cu-MOFs, Ce-MOFs, and hybrid composites, in order to enhance the catalytic selectivity, activity, and stability of electrocatalysts. MOFs possess distinct structural characteristics such as a large surface area, adjustable pore architectures, and numerous active sites, which provide effective adsorption, activation, and subsequent electrochemical reduction of CO2. The inclusion of metal centres, such as copper, silver, and cobalt, in MOFs has shown a strong preference for valuable chemical products, such as ethylene, formate, methane, and acetic acid. Incorporating MOFs with carbon-based electrodes or photosensitizers has significantly improved the catalytic efficiency and the speed at which charge is transferred in CO2 electroreduction processes. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles to overcome, such as the need to optimize the composition of catalysts, manage particle size, and provide scalability for use in industrial applications. Further study is necessary to expand the range of electrochemical techniques and reaction conditions, enhance the longevity of catalysts, and explore the potential of utilizing these types of catalysts for the specific conversion of CO2 into other valuable liquid fuels.

Abstract This study builds upon the evolving landscape of sustainable construction practices, where optimizing ready-mix concrete for strength, cost-efficiency, and reduced CO2 emissions is crucial in aligning with global environmental sustainability targets. Through an extensive analysis of diverse input parameters, including water-cement ratio, aggregate characteristics, additives, and their interactions with critical output parameters, this research has unveiled a substantial dependence on concrete performance, cost-efficiency, and environmental impact on cement selection and proportioning. This research emphasizes the pivotal role of cement in determining both the cost and CO2 emissions of concrete production, highlighting a notable positive correlation between cement content and compressive strength (R2 = 0.4946), and an even more pronounced correlation with CO2 emissions (R2 = 0.9529). This underlines the importance of optimizing cement use for balanced performance. Furthermore, the study reveals that while admixtures play a limited role in enhancing compressive strength (R2 = 0.0426), their impact on other concrete properties like workability and durability is significant. The optimization of concrete components, including a strategic reduction in admixture use, can lead to considerable cost and CO2 emission reductions, exemplified by a 5% cost decrease and a 7% drop in emissions with a 20% admixture reduction. Overall, these findings highlight the transformative impact of AI in concrete mix design, paving the way for more sustainable construction methods and contributing to global efforts to reduce the infrastructure sector's carbon footprint.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction in non‐aqueous solvents is promising due to the increased CO2 solubility of organic‐based electrolytes compared to aqueous electrolytes. Here the effect of nine different salts in propylene carbonate (PC) on the CO2 reduction product distribution of polycrystalline Cu is investigated. Three different cations (tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetrabutylammonium (TBA), and tetrahexylammonium (THA)) and three different anions (chloride (Cl), tetrafluoroborate (BF4), and hexafluorophosphate (PF6)) were used. Chronoamperometry and in‐situ FTIR measurements show that the size of the cation has a crucial role in the selectivity. A more hydrophobic surface is obtained when employing a larger cation with a weaker hydration shell. This stabilizes the CO2‐· radical and promotes the formation of ethylene. CO2 reduction in 0.7 M THACl/PC shows the highest hydrocarbon formation. Lastly, we hypothesize that the hydrocarbon formation pathway is not through C‐C coupling, as the CO solubility in PC is very high, but through the dimerization of the COH intermediate.

Electrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction are important processes to produce hydrogen and low–carbon fuels as renewable energy sources. Here, nanostructured MnMoO4, prepared by the reflux precipitation method, was investigated as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions. Using a combination of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results, a direct band gap of 3.05 eV was obtained experimentally for the prepared MnMoO4. An overpotential of 0.36 V at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec-1 were obtained for the oxygen evolution reaction. At a current density of 3 mA cm-2, overpotentials of 0.39 V and 0.58 V were achieved in the absence and presence of CO2 bubbling into a 0.1 M KOH solution, respectively, emphasizing the poisoning effect of CO2 reduction intermediates for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Based on the obtained results, MnMoO4 could be a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions.

As an alternative for Korea’s climate change agreement and carbon neutrality, the NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) was announced in 2015 to suggest a 40% reduction in 2018 emissions by 2030 compared to 2021. CO2 is a representative source of greenhouse gases, and 269.6 million tons of CO2eq and 260.5 million tons of CO2eq were emitted from transition and industry in 2018, respectively, in 2030, the targets were set at 145.9 million tons of CO2eq and 230.7 million tons of CO2eq, which were reduced by 45.9% and 11.4%, respectively. CO2 is not classified as an air pollutant, but it is increasing the amount of greenhouse gas generated because the amount of CO2 generated every year is increasing in industries that have obtained an integrated environmental management license. Efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse gases through technology development such as CO2 capture devices. However, for CO2 reduction measures in the integrated environmental management system, it is necessary to present alternatives for greenhouse gas reduction by presenting emission impact analysis and permitted emission standards. Therefore, Since it is unclear to achieve the existing NDC goal through the spread of new and renewable energy, it is a way to achieve the goal. CO2 removal technologies are introduced as an optimal application technique for industry that have obtained integrated environmental management approval and permission, and institutional improvement is needed to reduce greenhouse gases as well as air pollutants.

Cu is the most promising metal catalyst for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to multi-carbon products, but the structure sensitivity of the reaction and the stability versus restructuring of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions are still controversial. Here, atomic scale simulations of surface energies and reaction pathway kinetics supported by experimental evidence unveil that CO2RR does not take place on perfect planar Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces but rather on steps or kinks defects, and that these planar surfaces tend to restructure in reaction conditions to the active stepped surfaces. By combining basin hopping global sampling and grand canonical density functional theory, we show that the extremely low CO coverage on (111) and (100) surfaces, originating from sluggish CO2 conversion and unfavorable CO binding, limits the ability of these surfaces to reduce CO2 to multi-carbon products. Steps and kinks at surfaces, despite the lack of decrease in C-C coupling barriers on these sites, exhibit a significant increase in activity arising from beneficial CO2 activation and higher CO coverage. Notably, the square motifs adjacent to defects, not the defects themselves, are the active sites for CO2RR via synergistic effect. In addition, the strong binding of CO on defective sites acts as a thermodynamic driving force for the restructuring of planar surfaces to active stepped terminations under reactive conditions. We evaluate these mechanisms against experiments of CO2RR on UHV-prepared ultraclean Cu surfaces. Overall, our findings highlight the structural sensitivity in steering CO2RR and elucidate the origin of in situ restructuring of Cu catalysts during the reaction. We furthermore feature that the active sites for CO2RR are created under reaction conditions.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high‐value carbon‐based chemicals provides a sustainable approach to achieving an artificial carbon cycle. In the decade, metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), a kind of porous crystalline porous materials featuring well‐defined structures, large surface area, high porosity, diverse components, easy tailorability, and controllable morphology, have attracted considerable research attention, serving as electrocatalysts to drive CO2 reduction. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structure/component advantages of MOFs meeting the requirements of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are analyzed. After that, the representative progress for the precise fabrication of MOF‐based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation, are systemically summarized. Furthermore, the emerging applications and promising research for more practical scenarios related to electrochemical CO2 conversion are specifically proposed. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook of MOFs for electrochemical CO2 reduction are further discussed.

Atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) exhibit significant potential as catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. However, the range of products achievable with these NCs has been somewhat constrained. This study introduces an innovative design strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of Cu NCs by engineering their active sites. We achieve this by creating defects on a cubic Cu58 NC through the partial dislocation of Cu atoms at its vertices, leading to the ligand vacancies that exposes multiple Cu sites. Additionally, the dislocation of Cu atoms finely tunes the inner cationic geometries through altered cuprophilic interactions, resulting in discernable changes in their edges and vertices. When tested, these unique arrangements of Cu(I) atoms within the cluster prove effective in determining product specificities during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations correlate the product selectivity toward CH3OH for [Cu58H20(SPr)36(PPh3)7]2+ (Pr = CH2CH2CH3) NC to the enhanced edge Cu reactivity in binding CO and CHO intermediates, compared to [Cu58H20(SPr)36(PPh3)8]2+ and [Cu58H20(SEt)36(PPh3)6]2+ (Et = CH2CH3) NCs. This work underscores the potential of tailored structural designs of atomically precise nanocatalysts in steering electrochemical CO2 reduction toward unconventional products.

Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT = 4‐tert‐butylphenylthiol) with a 26‐atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single‐crystal X‐ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face‐centered cubic‐structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5 nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibits higher catalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity is well interpreted using density functional theory calculations and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, highlighting the influence of GBs and point defects on the properties of metal nanoclusters.

Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT = 4‐tert‐butylphenylthiol) with a 26‐atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single‐crystal X‐ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face‐centered cubic‐structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5 nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibits higher catalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity is well interpreted using density functional theory calculations and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, highlighting the influence of GBs and point defects on the properties of metal nanoclusters.

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) capture, storage and its utilization can be used to decrease Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Hong 2022). Alteration of the wettability of oil reservoirs has the potential to improve the oil recovery (Sheng, 2010). Wettability is defined the tendency of a fluid to adhere to a solid surface in the presence of other immiscible fluids (Craig, 1971). In multiphase flow in oil reservoirs, wettability is important for phase distribution and flow properties. In fractured reservoirs, wettability alteration will improve the spontaneous imbibition of water and thereby improve the oil recovery (Sheng, 2010; Fjelde and Asen, 2009). In spontaneous imbibition experiments, carbonated water (CW, water saturated with CO2) at oil reservoir conditions has been found to improve the spontaneous imbibition of water in fractured chalk models and improve the oil production (Fjelde et al., 2011). Sandstone rocks can also contain carbonate minerals (e.g. Pan et al., 2016). In addition, clay minerals in sandstone rocks are often more oil-wet than the other non-carbonate minerals. The surface area of clay minerals can be high in sandstone rocks, and these surfaces are very important for the wettability on core scale and reservoir scale. The flow properties in oil reservoirs depends on the saturation functions (relative permeability and capillary pressure) (Dake, 1978). Mineral composition and mineral distribution will together with the fluid compositions and conditions (temperature, pressure) determine these functions. Alteration of wettability for non-fractured oil reservoirs to more water-wet has also the potential to accelerate the oil production due to improvement of the relative permeability of oil (Collins and Melrose, 1983; Clementz 1976; 1977; 1982; Lager et al., 2007). Alteration of the wettability to more water-wet may have the potential to reduce the mobility ratio and thereby improve the volumetric sweep of the reservoir. The water production will be less at more water-wet conditions, because the relative permeability of water is low and higher volumetric sweep efficiency will the delay the water breakthrough. Alteration of wettability to more water-wet will therefore reduce the water production. Increase in relative permeability for oil and decrease in the relative permeability for water will give a shorter production period. Shorter production period and less water production will also reduce the environmental impact. Surface Complexation Modeling (SCM) with the geochemistry solver, PHREEQC has been used to estimate the wettability preferences of the minerals and rocks (Mehdiyev et al. 2022). The wettability preferences were estimated by calculating Bond Products defined as the product of the mole fraction of oppositely charged oil and mineral surfaces. It was shown that the SCM technique can predict the tendency for wettability alteration of the individual minerals and reservoir rocks during injection of CW using the different rock, brine and Stock Tank Oil (STO) compositions.

Thermal insulation applications on the exterior facades of buildings have been the subject of numerous studies from the past to the present. Some of these studies focus on the cost reduction effect of insulation, while others emphasize its ecological benefits. In this study, multi-objective optimization, the objectives of which are minimum cost and minimum CO2 emission, has been carried out with the NSGA-II method. In emission calculations, in addition to fuel-related emissions, the carbon footprint of all materials comprising the wall has also been included. The multi-objective optimization study examined four design variables: wall thickness, wall material (light concrete, reinforced concrete, and brick), insulation material (expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, mineral wool, and polyurethane foam), and heating source (natural gas, electricity, fuel oil). Analyses have been carried out for four cities (Osmaniye, Bursa, Isparta, and Erzurum), which are located in different climatic regions, and considering solar radiation effects. An existing building has been taken as the base case scenario, and the study has determined the improvements in the total cost and the amount of CO2 released into the environment when the appropriate insulation material, insulation thickness, wall material, and heating source identified in the multi-objective optimization study have been used. At the cost-oriented optimum point in the study, the most suitable insulation material was found to be expanded polystyrene, the most suitable wall material was brick, and the most suitable heating source was natural gas. In the CO2-oriented optimum, in contrast to the cost-oriented approach, optimal results have been obtained when light concrete was selected as the wall material.

A three-compartment electrolyzer has been developed for the electro-reduction of CO2 to CO in an organic electrolyte, with NaOH and Cl2 produced as byproducts. In order to improve the performance of the electrolyzer, we have prepared an Au/Cu alloy electrode using a novel non-cyanide electroplating method with high porosity. By expanding the specific surface area of the cathode, and providing a large number of active sites for CO2 electro-reduction, the cathodic current density reaches to 92.7 mA·cm−2, and the Faradaic efficiency of CO formation remains stable at 94.0 %. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations analysis identified that alloying tune the electronic structure of the Au and Cu surface, resulting in promoting the activation of CO2.

Abstract Bioelectrochemical synthesis is emerging as an eco-friendly method for CO2 fixation. These systems typically rely on electrochemically regenerated NAD(P)H to provide the necessary reducing equivalents for formate dehydrogenase (FDH) to convert CO2 into formate. However, the efficiency of these systems is currently unsatisfactory due to the unfavorable dynamics of the CO2-to-formate conversion by FDH. In this study, we developed a one-pot cooperative bioelectrochemical system featuring a rhodium-based catalyst [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]2+ (RhIII-complex or [RhIII-H2O]2+) working cooperatively with enzymatic cascades of acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ACDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), formolase (FLS), and d-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase mutant FSAA129S to convert CO2 into several C2+ chemicals. The bifunctional RhIII-complex concurrently catalyzes the reduction of CO2 to formate at a rate of 15.8 mM/h and NADH regeneration at a rate of 0.24 mM/min. The formation of formate is 83.2 times faster than using one of the best aerobic FDH from Clostridium ljungdahlii (ClFDH), resulting in a 3.6 times enhanced methanol production rate of 0.43 mM/h in the bioelectroenzymatic system (RhIII-complex-ACS-ACDH-ADH) compared to that of 0.12 mM/h in tandem enzymatic system (ClFDH-ACS-ACDH-ADH). Bifunctional RhIII-complex also works cooperatively with tandem enzymatic cascades to produce dihydroxyacetone (C3) and L-erythrulose (C4) at the yield of 2.63 mM, and 1.93 mM, respectively. This study leveraged the synthetic capabilities of both electrochemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis, offering an alternative for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction to yield value-added compounds with enhanced productivity.

Developing a function-integrated catalyst from earth-abundant elements, capable of efficient light harvesting and electron transfer, is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of CO2 transformation, a critical step in environmental cleanup and advancing clean energy prospects. Traditional approaches relying on external photosensitizers, comprising of 4d/5d metal complexes, often face challenges in intermolecular electron transfer, and attachment of photosensitizing arms to the catalyst increases dependency on intramolecular electron transfer kinetics, underscoring the need for a more integrated solution. We report a new Cu(II) complex, K[CuNDPA] (1[K(18-crown-6)]), bearing a dipyrrin amide-based trianionic tetradentate ligand, NDPA (H3L), which is capable of harnessing light energy, despite having a paramagnetic Cu(II) center, without any external photosensitizer and photocatalytically reducing CO2 to CO in acetonitrile: water (19:1 v/v) with a TON as high as 1132, a TOF of 566 h-1 and a selectivity of 99%. This complex also shows hemilability in the presence of water, which not only plays a role in a proton relay mechanism but also helps stabilize a crucial Cu(I)-NDPA intermediate. The hemilability was justified by the formation of N3O (2) and N2O2 (3) coordinated congeners of the N4 bound complex 1. The overall mechanism was further investigated via spectroscopic techniques like EPR, UV-vis, and Spectroelectrochemistry, culminating in the justification of a single electron-reduced Cu(I)NDPA species as a proposed intermediate. In the next step, the binding of CO2 to Cu(I) complex and subsequent electron transfer to form Cu(II)-CO2•‾ was indirectly probed by a radical trapping experiment via the addition of p-methoxy-2,6-ditertbutylphenol that led to the formation of a phenoxyl radical. This work opens new strategies for designing earth-abundant robust molecular catalysts that can function as photocatalysts without the aid of any external photosensitizers.

To mitigate global warming to the most ambitious targets, it is necessary to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and reduce fossil fuels use. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4) as a basic chemical is a promising technology that meets both requirements; however, its life cycle CO2 emissions remain inconclusive because of varying assumptions in the performance indices. This study aimed to set benchmarks for the four most sensitive indices to achieve -0.5 t-CO2/t-C2H4 by calculating net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a prospective life cycle assessment of a model system including CO2 capture, CO2 enrichment, electrochemical conversion, CO2 recycling, and cryogenic separation. As a result, the electrochemical conversion process was the hotspot of life cycle emissions, and representative benchmarks were determined as follows: cell voltage, 3.5 V; C2H4 Faraday efficiency, 70%; conversion rate, 20%; and electrochemical CO2 recycling energy, 2.2 GJ/t-CO2. The gaps between the benchmarks and current top data of cell voltage and Faraday efficiency were <10%, and suppressing the performance degradation for up to one year was found to be a critical requirement. These results can direct research towards the development of a year-round stable system, rather than further improving the performance indices.

Thermal motor emissions have grown cold and colder over time thanks to the betterment of the yield of motors. This contributes to an inversion of behaviour of CO2, since photosynthesis is endothermic, absorbs heat together with it. New CO2 emissions are coldening the climate where thermal motor efficiency is good. This is confirmed with AI support and shown to explain the late snows this Spring in Europe, as well as the “La Niña” trend that has been announced. Global warming can be totally reduced and reversed with a consistent pattern of smart CO2 emissions, without the heat associated, thanks to new thermally efficient motors.

Background: Ventilatory strategies in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients aim to mitigate the risk of acute lung injury (ALI). However, prolonged utilization of these strategies may precipitate alveolar carbon dioxide elevation and pH reduction. This scoping review endeavors to present extant knowledge concerning hypercapnia effects in experimental models, with or without ALI, specifically focusing on delineating the immunologically mediated pulmonary tissue damage; Methods: A systematic exploration encompassing PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Reviews, and Scielo databases was undertaken. Articles published between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2022, were screened for their elucidation of hypercapnia&#039;s immunological impact on lung tissue, utilizing experimental or biological models, irrespective of ALI presence; Results: Following duplicate removal and predefined criteria filtering, 30 pertinent articles scrutinizing hypercapnia&#039;s influence on pulmonary epithelium were identified. It was observed that hypercapnia induces perturbations in innate immune response gene transcription, mediated via Nuclear Factor-kappa B attenuation. Furthermore, a compromised innate immune response against injurious agents was noted. Concurrently, disruption and subsequent resealing of alveolar epithelial cells were evidenced, primarily through Na/K-ATPase endocytosis, impeding fluid reabsorption at the alveolar epithelium level; Conclusions: In experimental settings, with or without ALI, hypercapnia&#039;s immunomediated mechanisms exacerbate innate immune system impairment and disrupt the respiratory epithelium&#039;s repair and healing processes.

The spatial distribution characteristics of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of coal, crude oil and natural gas in China during 2019 were revealed through Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) method. Then spatial differences of the impacts of socio-economic factors on CO2 emissions were discussed by using geographical weighted regression (GWR) model. Furthermore, the relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions was explored by combing the center of gravity model with coupling coordination development degree model. The findings demonstrate that the high spatial agglomeration effect and risk areas of coal-based CO2 emissions are concentrated in the northern region (the maximum emissions up to 1005.09 Mt), and the same type of natural gas-based CO2 emissions are distributed in the central region, while the low spatial agglomeration effect and risk areas of crude oil-based CO2 emissions are mainly in the western region. Under the positive impact from energy intensity (average influence coefficient is 1.59), CO2 emissions show a good coupling trend with economic urbanization, but present a spatial differentiation of unbalanced western and coordinated eastern regions with population urbanization. This study enriches the content of energy-based carbon emissions from geographic and management disciplines, also gives scientific foundation for differential formulation of carbon emission reduction policies.

This study introduces a novel multi-objective model that addresses emission costs, large-scale user operational expenses, and the efficiency of the electric storage system within an integrated energy hub encompassing heating, water, power, and gas sources. A key objective of this model is to maximize the performance of the electrical storage system. The study employs the epsilon-constraint method to construct the Pareto front, aiming to balance profitability and emission reduction from virtual power plant units. The final decision-making process utilizes a fuzzy decision-making technique. Additionally, demand response program (DRP) is incorporated to optimize peak-hour demand and align the load profile with defined objectives. The proposed approach is evaluated across various operational scenarios within a sample system, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential benefits in terms of cost reduction and environmental impact mitigation. Focusing on environmental impact, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are also lower under the DRP scenario, amounting to 10253.92 kg without DRP versus 10127.74 kg with DRP. This reduction in emissions aligns with sustainable energy management goals, showcasing DRP's capability to mitigate environmental impacts associated with energy generation and consumption. The percentage improvements in total costs and emissions further highlight the advantages of employing DRP. The reductions in total costs range from approximately 1.2%–1.4%, demonstrating cost savings across different cost categories. Similarly, the decrease in CO2 emissions by approximately 1.2% underscores DRP's role in promoting environmentally friendly energy practices.

Human activities led to elevation in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in atmosphere. While such increase per se may be beneficial for the growth of some crops, it comes with a caveat of affecting crop nutritional status. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of changes in concentration of essential (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Mo, Ni) and non-essential (Ba, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, and Sr) heavy metals in response to elevated CO2, drawing on a meta-analysis of 1216 paired observations. The major findings are as follows: (1) Elevated CO2 leads to reduced concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn in crops; (2) the extent of above reduction varies among plants species and is most pronounced in cereals and then in legumes and vegetables; (3) reduction in accumulation of non-essential (toxic) metals is less pronounced, potentially leading to an unfavorable essential/non-essential metal ratio in plants; (4) the above effects will come with significant implication to human health, exacerbating effects of the "hidden hunger" caused by the lack of Fe and Zn in the human diets. The paper also analyses the mechanistic basis of nutrient acquisition (both at physiological and molecular levels) and calls for the changes in the governmental policies to increase efforts of plant breeders to create genotypes with improved nutrient use efficiency for essential micronutrients while uncoupling their transport from non-essential (toxic) heavy metals.

The notable reduction in forest coverage and usage of nonrenewable energy resources have resulted in accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thus contributing to the worsening of the phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. This research undertook an investigation into the efficacy of a distinct absorbent in eliminating CO2 from the air within a spouted bed reactor. By utilizing the Taguchi methodology, the study examined the capacity of sodium carbonate to eradicate CO2 from the atmosphere across a wide range of concentrations (600–1850 ppm), temperatures (55–90 °C), and molar ratios of Na to C in the absorbent (ranging from 1 to 3). The results indicated that this absorbent effectively eliminated 86% of the initial CO2 at a reaction temperature of 55 °C, a molar Na/C ratio of 1.4, and an initial concentration of 1280 ppm. Additionally, the examination of the solid composition postabsorption using X-ray diffraction revealed the formation of sodium bicarbonate during the absorption process. The novelty of this study resides in the introduction of a novel method for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. Moreover, the viability of regenerating sodium carbonate by liberating CO2 from bicarbonate was also evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) over Cu-based catalysts has emerged as a promising strategy for value-added artificial carbon cycling, addressing the current climate and energy challenges. However, the product selectivity and long-term stability of Cu-based catalysts are limited by their instability at constant potential. Recent advancements in pulsed techniques aim to overcome these limitations, enhancing the industrial feasibility of the CO2RR systems. This review critically examines recent research progress in pulsed CO2RR over Cu-based catalysts, offering a comprehensive synthesis of current findings. Key pulse parameters and characterization strategies are explored to uncover the mechanisms behind the enhanced CO2RR performance. The focus is on surface reconstruction, encompassing the regeneration and stabilization of the Cu oxidation states alongside morphological evolution, while also discussing microenvironment changes, including local CO2 concentration, local pH, and ionic arrangement. The intricate modulation mechanisms of pulse mode, potential, and duration on the CO2RR performance are elucidated, highlighting their interconnections. Finally, we identify the prevailing challenges and propose future directions for achieving environmentally friendly and economically viable artificial carbon cycling. By providing insightful perspectives on optimizing pulsed CO2RR, this review paves the way for developing more efficient and robust Cu-based catalytic systems.

(1) Efforts on harnessing excess emitted CO2 back to the carbon cycle via chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical pathways have seen steady development to produce value-added chemicals for energy storage. (1,2) Among them, an environmentally benign electroreduction approach is the most promising one for valorization of CO2 as fuels and chemicals, albeit the fact that sluggish kinetics and lack of selectivity require the design of suitable catalysts. (3,4) Molecular electrocatalysts have well-defined active sites and accurately tailorable structures that allow mechanism-based performance optimization. Among them, several are based on easily available first-row transition metals to catalyze CO2 reduction (CO2RR) via a 2e–/2H+ mechanism to form CO and HCOOH. (5) Nevertheless, examples of molecular catalysts capable of reducing CO2 beyond 2e–/2H+ (e.g., multielectron products) are scarce. A key reason for that is the difficulty in controlling the binding affinity of the catalyst-bound CO intermediate, which often plays a pivotal role in the generation of multielectron/multiproton products. (5,6) Along with this, the complexity of the multielectron/multiproton pathways involving multiple intermediates provides a limited understanding of the reaction mechanism. (5,7) Herein, we would like to highlight several recently reported strategies that show promising CO2RR activity and selectivity toward products beyond 2e–/2H+, such as (i) immobilization of functionalized molecular catalysts over conductive supports, (ii) incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding groups proximal to the active site, and (iii) the use of light illumination during electrochemical CO2RR in molecular catalysts incorporated within porous hybrid platforms.Initially, Wang et al. reported one of the first examples of a molecular electrocatalyst reducing CO2 to value-added multielectron hydrocarbons. They immobilized a cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst (CoPc, Figure 1a) over multiwalled carbon-nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNTs) and used it as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst that, in aqueous solution, undergoes 6e–/6H+ CO2RR to generate CH3OH. (5) They first compared the catalytic performance of CNT-immobilized iron, cobalt, and nickel phthalocyanine (FePc, CoPc, and NiPc, respectively), as metal-to-CO binding energy, EB(CO), varies with different M–N4, spanning over a range of 1.2 eV and found that cobalt provides moderate CO binding. Therefore, among all three catalysts, only CoPc produced MeOH with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 44% at −0.94 V vs RHE (CO and H2 being the major products for FePc and NiPc). Through scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis they have shown that CoPc has molecular level dispersion over the CNT, which is vital for MeOH formation. Otherwise, physical mixtures of CoPc and CNTs showed much less reactivity, despite having higher CoPc content. According to their observation, at lower overpotential, CO was the major CO2RR product, and thus, it was postulated that CO acts as a reactive intermediate toward MeOH formation. Indeed, when an electrocatalytic CO reduction reaction (CORR) using CoPc/MWCNT was performed, it produced MeOH with a FE of 28% at −0.77 V vs RHE. Overall, catalysis goes through a "domino" process where CO2 first reduces to CO, and then undergoes another 4e–/4H+ reduction to MeOH, and the potential-dependent steps of both CO2RR and CORR are very similar. Nonetheless, this catalytic system suffers from rather limited durability. Upon only 1 h of electrolysis, FECH3OH decreased by 18%, while after 4 h of electrolysis, MeOH formation became negligible. UV–visible spectra of the postelectrolysis CoPc molecule from the electrode revealed an undesired reduction of the Pc ligand, eventually leading to hydrogenation of the macrocycle. To avoid the reductive deactivation, Wang and co-workers introduced four electron-donating amino groups in the β position of the CoPc moiety (Figure 1b, CoPc-NH2), which successfully lowered the overpotential and could sustain activity for a longer time with a maximum FECH3OH of 32%.Figure 1Figure 1.

Copyright 2023 Authors.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideAt about the same time, Robert et al. also used the CoPc catalyst and MWCNT mixture with a Nafion binder over carbon paper for the conversion of CO2 to MeOH. (8) Under heterogeneous conditions in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution (pH = 7.2), they obtained only 0.3% FECH3OH at −0.88 V vs RHE, which increased to 2% when they used CO as substrate instead of CO2. However, at pH 13, when CO was used as a substrate, the same CoPc/MWCNT system exhibited 14.3% FECH3OH at −0.68 V vs RHE, i.e., a 50-fold increase in selectivity at a 170 mV lower overpotential, along with a 10-fold increase in catalytic rate. Subsequent HPLC experiments showed that during CORR at pH 13, formaldehyde (HCHO) is formed. At alkaline pH, there is a chance of Cannizzaro reaction, i.e., a disproportionation of HCHO (aldehyde without α hydrogens) to CH3OH and HCOO– causing an overestimation of CH3OH's FE determination. Knowing that, Robert and co-workers carefully evaluated these nonfaradaic CH3OH formations and concluded that their effect is negligible. In addition, a series of control experiments, along with Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the CoPc before and after electrolysis proved that the observed reactivity was not due to the decomposition of CoPc into metallic Co nanoparticles, thus signifying the molecular nature of the catalyst.Lately, McCrory et al. further investigated the catalytic properties of the CoPc/MWCNT system using a gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) flow-cell. Compared to a conventional H-cell configuration, performing the electrocatalytic reaction in a CO2-fed GDE setup showed appreciably suppressed activity toward MeOH formation. The key explanation for these results lies at the higher CO2 binding affinity of CoPc compared to its affinity to bind CO, as quantitatively measured in this study. (6) The authors varied the partial current density of MeOH (product of CORR) at −0.70 V vs RHE as a function of the partial pressure of CO (PCO), which ultimately reached a plateau at PCO = 1. Thereafter, using a microkinetic analysis, the binding constant of CO to CoPc (KCO) was determined to be 3.0 atm–1. On the contrary, in the case of a CO2RR reaction with CoPc (where the major product is CO), extracted KCO2 was 11.1 atm–1. The high binding constant ratio of KCO2/KCO = 3.7, provides a thermodynamic explanation for the inefficient MeOH formation on CoPc/MwCNTs during CO2RR, where catalyst-bound CO is preferentially displaced by CO2 molecules before it can be further reduced. Thus, the authors suggested that researchers should look forward in the direction of controlling the local concentration of CO2 by construction of catalyst–polymer composites, or via applying modifications to the coordination environments of CoPc. These strategies will strengthen the CO binding, especially when using GDE flow-cells.As opposed to CoPc, in case of metal porphyrins, up until recently, reports of CO2 reduction into multielectron compounds were only available when conducted under photochemical conditions. (10,11) Lately, however, Dey and co-workers designed a distal superstructure in the molecular framework of iron porphyrins, and were able to stop the dissociation of CO from the metal-bound intermediate and simultaneously activated it for further reduction. In this work, an iron porphyrin having a distal basic pyridine residue was synthesized (FeL2, Figure 1C) and used as homogeneous electrocatalyst for CO reduction to CH4, with 93% FE. (2) Spectro-electrochemistry coupled FTIR (FTIR-SEC) was employed to understand the mechanism of the reaction with in situ detection of the metal–carbonyl species, using 12/13CO isotope sensitive absorption. In CO-saturated CH3CN containing 3% H2O, they identified an FeII–CO species being reduced to FeI–CO at applied potential of −1.75 V vs Fc/Fc+, followed by the reduction of FeI–CO to Fe0-CO at −2.35 V vs Fc/Fc+. Interestingly, while holding the potential at −2.35 V for a long period, an FeII–CHO adduct was detected, which then could be further reduced to CH4. In this case, pyridine mediated hydrogen-bonding between water molecules (i.e., proton source) and FeI–CO intermediate allows its stabilization, and activation for further reduction to CH4 (as evidenced by DFT calculation).In another attempt to achieve multielectron CO2 reduction using porphyrins, our group adopted a different approach, based on a photoassisted electrocatalysis pathway for multiproton/multielectron CO2RR. To do so, we have utilized photoactive Co-porphyrin (CoTCPP)-based metal–organic framework (MOF) films (Co-MOF-525). Under 1-sun light illumination (100 mW/cm2), the MOF film can sustain large quantities of long-lived oxidized charged carriers during photocathodic operation and performed a 8e–/8H+ reduction of CO2 to CH4 (in 80/20 (%v/v) CH3CN–H2O with a LiClO4 electrolyte). (9) Subsequent, photoassisted chronoamperometric measurements revealed that in the potential window of −0.39 to −0.64 V, CH4 and CO were produced during CO2RR, with a maximum FECH4 being 14% at −0.49 V, while FECO was only 2%. Yet, in the absence of light illumination, both products were formed in a very negligible amount. At more cathodic potentials, a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) became more prominent and significantly suppressed CO2RR. Generally, CoITCPP is the CO2RR active state that binds CO2 and undergoes 2e–/2H+ reduction to CO. However, thin layer spectro-electrochemical measurements revealed a different mechanism that leads to the unexpected CH4 production. Under dark electrolysis conditions, spectro-electrochemistry analysis showed the formation of bands attributed to CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+, while measurements at more cathodic potentials showed the formation of a new band corresponding to CO2RR active species, [CoITCPP]−. Surprisingly, in photoassisted electrolysis conditions, the formation of a broad band at 460 nm was noticed, suggesting the existence of a higher oxidation form of the catalyst, namely, [CoIIITCPP]2+, which was the product of a porphyrin ring oxidation. Here, with an increase in the cathodic potential, the [CoIIITCPP]2+ band decreased in intensity, while the CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+ bands remained unchanged throughout the course of the reaction. In other words, in these conditions, MOF-525 maintains a high concentration of [CoIIITCPP]+ species (via photo-oxidative accumulation of holes), which is known to stabilize CO by preferentially binding with it, (12) a crucial step that allows its further reduction to CH4.To conclude, despite severe challenges posed in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multielectron products, successful reports of molecular catalysts capable of CO2RR beyond 2e–/2H+ have increased lately. The results highlighted herein could help pave the way toward (i) rational catalyst design, (ii) improved structure–function correlation studies, and (iii) identification of key mechanistic factors necessary to understand molecular catalyst operation both in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous configurations. Nevertheless, realizing the next-generation of molecular catalytic systems will have to involve new approaches for the stabilization of key reactive intermediates while developing means for their assembly onto porous functional supports that allows the incorporation of secondary-sphere interactions to stir the CO2RR path toward the desired products.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsArnab Ghatak - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3027-9359; Email: [email protected]Idan Hod - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4837-8793; Email: [email protected]Author ContributionsThe manuscript was written through contribution of all the authors.

Electricity is fundamental to modern societies and will become even more so as its use expands through different technologies and population growth. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions globally, but it is also the sector that is leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid rise of renewables. The impacts of COVID-19 on the electricity sector led to a reduction in the demand for electricity, while at the same time, the current global energy crisis has placed the security and affordability of electricity at the top of the political agenda in many countries. In this way, the decrease in the demand for electricity, as well as its gradual recovery, makes it necessary to carry out energy planning that considers the adverse effects caused by global events with a high socioeconomic impact. In this article, the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) 2020 software has been used to determine the distribution of energy sources to 2050 for Mexico. The variables that lead to the possible profiles for 2050 are social, economic, and technological. The results correspond to a possible future based on official data from the National Electric System (SEN) of Mexico. The forecast for 2050 indicates that the electricity sector will have almost double the current installed capacity; however, emissions do not correspond to twice as much: they are practically 50% higher.

Pulverized rock samples are widely used in laboratory experiments, e.g., to assess microbial or abiotic processes in batch incubation tests. However, it is unclear if ball-milled samples accurately reflect in-situ conditions and if observed processes are affected by by-products artificially generated during the sample preparation procedure. As such, this study examined the effects of dry ball milling on the release of gases, which include C1-C4 hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), and low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) from different sedimentary rocks. The experiments involved pulverization using a gas-tight zirconium oxide planetary ball mill followed by wet and dry batch incubation and thermal desorption up to 200 o C. During milling, all sedimentary rocks, except a low organic carbon sandstone sample, yielded methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), H2, CO2, and unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g., ethene (C2H4). Sandstones only yielded H2, CH4, and CO2. Stable carbon isotope signatures of these products are similar to thermogenic gases. The gases were also detected in subsequent wet incubation experiments (after gases from milling had been removed). Additionally, formate, acetate, and citrate, were detected in all samples except for sandstone. Pyruvate, malate, and succinate were also detected in some samples. Thermal desorption products of powdered limestone, shale, and pyrite concretion samples included organic acids, such as acetate and formate, which were higher in milled samples than in crushed particles (∼1 mm). The original geological thermal maturity of the studied sedimentary rock samples was low (below "oil window") and, thus, considerably below "gas window", suggesting that most of the detected gases were generated during ball milling. H2 generated during ball milling may be derived from the reduction of water from fluid inclusion or phyllosilicates, involving the formation of reactive mineral surfaces or radicals. Notably, the concentrations of gaseous hydrocarbons derived from milling are relatively high and comparable to "wet" gases. At the same time, these data indicate that substantial amounts of gases and LWMOAs might be artificially generated during laboratory batch experiments with milled samples. Hence, ball milled rock samples must be used with caution if assessing (bio-)geochemical processes for natural environments.

Carbon sequestration through forestry represents a promising approach to partially counteract anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. Tree growth naturally removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, storing it as biomass. Sustainably managed forests can effectively function as carbon sinks. However, determining optimal forestry policies involves balancing complex ecological dynamics with economic constraints. This study develops differential equation models quantitatively capturing forest growth, timber harvesting, and carbon sequestration dynamics. Logistic models are first adapted to simulate biomass accumulation of representative tree species. Lifecycle growth patterns spanning juvenile to mature phases are incorporated, along with climate effects. Biomass levels are proportionally related to carbon dioxide removal rates from the atmosphere. Deforestation impacts are analyzed by incorporating harvesting-induced biomass reductions. Sustainability constraints are implemented to ensure minimum viable tree densities across harvest rotations. Optimization techniques then identify management guidelines maximizing economic returns given ecological stability considerations. The goal is providing quantitative insights into rotation lengths, planting densities, and allowable cuts upholding both climate change mitigation and commercial demands. Findings can inform science-based forestry policies to leverage forests as sustainable natural carbon sinks.

"Closed Circuit Rebreathers (CCRs) are a type of Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) used predominantly by the diving community. CCR technologies have become prevalent within the commercial, military and technical diving communities over recent years. CCRs work by recycling breathing gas, by-passing the gas through a carbon dioxide (CO2)chemical scrubber and topping the resultant scrubbed gas up with pure oxygen to maintain the oxygen content at a level which supports life. One of the main dangers currently faced by divers using this equipment is the risk of CO2 poisoning if the scrubber fails. This failure occurs due to CO2 breakthrough - where breakthrough is defined as the time until the canister effluent passes through the chemical absorbent unscrubbed. There are a variety of reasons for CO2 breakthrough, and not all of the reasons can be identified by the operator. A better understanding of CO2 absorption within CCRs would lead to a reduction in failures. There are a variety of potential causes of CO2 breakthrough, where breakthrough is defined as the time until the canister effluent passes through the chemical absorbent unscrubbed. Not all of the causes can be compensated for by the operator. A transient computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model investigating the kinetics of flow and CO2 absorption focusing on the chemical reaction between the absorbent soda lime and CO2 is presented in the thesis. It presents the first reported mixture model theory simulation of the CCR scrubber using Ansys CFX 13.0. An extensive review of the design of CCRs, their applications and current modelling techniques identified a need to enhance the simulation of CCRs using the mixture model theory to simulate the chemical reactions occurring within the scrubber system of the CCR. The application of CFD techniques on CCRs allows the in depth analysis of the reaction between soda lime and CO2 using the graphical display provided by the simulated model. The simulation studies undertaken present a transient model with the ability to investigate seven key parameters affecting scrubber performance; geometry, wall temperature, inlet velocity, pressure, CO2 absorption, granule size and material selection. Analyses of the results demonstrate the sensitivity of the parameters to their behaviour on CO2 breakthrough. Due to the requirement of strong coupling between the phases of CO2 and soda lime, the mixture model is the best suited model for the liquid-particle mixture. Analysis of mesh size, mesh type and inflation are made to independently characterise the accuracy of the presented model by means of convergence before further comparisons with experimental data. The importance of mesh refinement is demonstrated as well as the contribution of inflation and grid independence to the accuracy of the model. A versatile model simulating chemical reactions within a CCR canister for different geometrical scrubber designs has been shown to be capable of analysing the design parameters of interest. A CCR scrubber model will bring new learning into the kinetics of CO2 absorption. It may also further the technology of monitoring scrubber duration in real time for a user. Data collected from a user may be fed into the system to allow a visual analysis of the scrubber. The first section of this thesis describes the operational requirements of the CCR system and in order to validate the CFD model, an experimental program was designed where an experimental test rig was manufactured to undertake experiments to study the impact of CO2 breakthrough of various parameters. The system incorporated CO2, O2, humidity and temperature sensors where the rig tested the scrubber’s capacity to absorb CO2 which is pumped in a controlled environment to benchmark the initial designs against existing literature. A review of the state of the art identified five feasible parameters important to scrubber kinetics; (i) geometry, (ii) material selection, (iii) inlet gas velocity, (iv) granule size and (v) packaging of the granules. These results gave an indication to the scrubber’s capacity to absorb CO2. CO2 absorption can be further inferred by placing thermocouples at various places within the canister and using relationship between the reaction and temperature to give an indication of absorption within the scrubber. As the chemical reaction occurs, the temperature rises and water vapour is produced. Through measuring both temperature and humidity, it was found that temperature gave the most consistent indication of CO2> absorption rather than humidity as the higher the humidity levels, the more erratic the humidity results became. The result of the experimental testing is a body of data benchmarked off current literature for validation which is used to compare with a transient CFD model to further the knowledge of CO2 absorption. The development of a CFD model for the CCR scrubber allows the simulation to assist in future designs of CCR system. It allows the simulation of alternative scrubber geometries which may be subjected to external parameters to assess their performance. The advantage to implementing a design through CFD allows the user to simulate alternative CCR scrubber designs before incorporating a manufacturing cost to assess the performance of a given design. This reduces cost, time and can assist the decision of manufacturing a given CCR scrubber. The results demonstrate that the CFD simulation using the mixture model theory is sufficiently reliable to simulate the reaction between CO and soda lime in CCR scrubbers."

In the context of global climate change, all industries have put forward the requirements for carbon emission reduction. The effective use of water resources is the key to achieving carbon emission reduction, so it is particularly important to review the carbon dioxide emission equivalents of water resource utilization behaviors (CEE-WRUBs) of water users. However, existing research on CEE-WRUBs across various water sectors remains inadequate. Therefore, this study integrates the enhanced CEEA method, LMDI decomposition model, and IOA method to analyze CEE-WRUBs across diverse water use terminals. Then seeks their main driving factors and their transfer pattern among different industries, which are crucial to the realization of the global carbon neutrality objective. The results showed that: (1) China's CEE-WRUBs show a significant downward trend. Industrial water use emerges as the primary source of CEE, but the CEE-WRUBs of most industrial water terminals show a fluctuating downward trend. Grains' water use behavior (WRUBs) absorbed the largest CEE, reaching 14,698 Mt in 2020. (2) the water efficiency effect emerges as the predominant driver behind the increase in CEE-WRUBs most of the time, and holding a prominent position. The carbon emission intensity effect primarily steers the reduction of CEE-WRUBs. (3) the largest net outflow sector of WRUBs embodied carbon in 2007-2020 was transformed from basic material heavy industry (-153.54 Mt in 2007) to agriculture (-128.26 Mt in 2020). Most of the WRUBs embodied carbon of agriculture flows into light industry, while most of the WRUBs embodied carbon of basic material heavy industry flows into finishing heavy industry and construction. The methods and results of this study provide a potential reference for investigating the regional water-carbon relationship and advancing the global carbon neutrality objective.

Using China's "dual-carbon" targets as a reference, this paper focuses on Zhejiang's manufacturing sector as the research object and constructs a STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology)-based model to analyze the factors influencing carbon emissions associated with manufacturing and predict the peak emission levels.Among these influencing factors, investmentscale expansion and economic growth contribute to increases in carbon emissions, while energystructure optimization and reduced carbon-emission intensity help restrain them.Notably, the economic level is identified as the predominant factor affecting carbon emissions.Among the nine proposed scenarios, scenario 6, characterized by "medium growth" and "high emission reduction", emerges as the most conducive to achieving high-quality and sustainable growth.Its carbon peak is projected for 2026, reaching 75.15 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, making it the optimal model for Zhejiang's manufacturing sector.Based on the findings, two policy directions are proposed: optimize the energy-consumption structure and accelerate the development and use of low-carbon technologies.This research offers insights into carbon emissions in Zhejiang's manufacturing sector, presenting a blueprint for achieving a carbon peak and sustainable economic growth.

To address the increasingly severe issue of carbon dioxide emissions, the Chinese government has set dual carbon goals: achieving peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Studying the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions is crucial for achieving these dual carbon goals and promoting sustainable development. Using balanced panel data from 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region from 2006 to 2019, this paper empirically analyzed the relationship and mechanisms of highway transportation infrastructure’s impact on carbon emissions using fixed effects models, mediating effects models, and threshold effects models. The empirical results indicate: (1) there is a nonlinear inverted-U-shaped relationship between highway transportation infrastructure and carbon emissions; (2) highway transportation infrastructure indirectly affects carbon emissions through foreign direct investment as a mediating variable; (3) the threshold effect model verifies that the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions exhibits threshold effects based on green technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. This study enriches the research content in related fields to some extent and provides specific policy recommendations for achieving carbon reduction goals and promoting sustainable development.

Изучено восстановление диоксида углерода молекулярным водородом в присутствии Fe, Cr-катализаторов, нанесенных на углеродный материал Сибунит, при 400 °С и давлениях) 0,1 и 8,5 МПа. Селективное образование монооксида углерода возможно при соотношении металлов Fe/Cr в катализаторе, равном 1-5. При уменьшении содержания хрома (образец 5Fe-0,25Cr/C) наряду с CO образуются углеводороды C-C с преобладанием метана. Методом просвечивающей электронной микроскопии показано, что основной фазой в катализаторе 5Fe-5Cr/C является хромит железа FeCrO (структурный тип шпинели), препятствующий восстановлению железа и образованию его карбидов, которые, в свою очередь, обеспечивают синтез углеводородов при взаимодействии СO и Н. The reduction of carbon dioxide with molecular hydrogen in the presence of Fe,Cr-containing catalysts supported on Sibunit carbon material at 400C and pressures of 0,1 and 8,5 MPa was studied. Selective formation of carbon monoxide is possible over the catalysts with the ratio Fe: Cr = 1-5. C-C hydrocarbons with a predominance of methane are formed along with CO at decreasing chromium content in the catalyst (5Fe-0,25Cr/C sample). It was shown by transmission electron microscopy that the main phase in 5Fe-5Cr/C catalyst is iron chromite FeCrO (spinel structural type), which prevents the reduction of iron and the formation of its carbides, which, in turn, provide the formation of hydrocarbons upon the interaction of CO and H.

Abstract We build a vehicle purchase and disposal model to analyze a policy that links a new electric vehicle (EV) purchase subsidy with a used gasoline vehicle scrappage requirement. We evaluate the policy based on changes in sales, scrappage, subsidy dollars spent, and emissions reductions. We find that linking a purchase subsidy with a scrappage requirement is expected to result in fewer new EV sales and carbon dioxide emissions reductions relative to a policy without linking. Our modeling reveals that these effects are due to trade‐in vehicle eligibility requirements and opportunity costs lowering additional participation in the linked policy. However, the linked policy significantly increases used vehicle scrappage and is more progressive than the unlinked policy. We find that emissions reductions due to additional scrappage are sensitive to how remaining miles of scrapped vehicles are replaced.

Abstract The use of green renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable chemicals and fuels through CO 2 electrolysis technology (also known as electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction, eCO 2 RR) is an advantageous technology, which could greatly aid the global carbon‐neutral goal. Although progress has been made in alkaline/neutral media, low carbon conversion efficiency to target products, carbonate/bicarbonate salt precipitation, and blockage of electrode holes caused by CO 2 are not conducive to industrial applications. Acidic media could address these issues; however, in these conditions, there are other challenges that need to be addressed, such as hydrogen evolution, poor tolerance of electrocatalysts, and electrolysers. This review discusses recent advances in industrial‐level acidic CO 2 electrolysis, including reaction mechanisms, electrocatalysts, and device design, aiming to promote its commercialization. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation strategy of an acidic eCO 2 RR system is proposed, and perspectives are provided based on related discussion.

Abstract Background Clostridium autoethanogenum is an acetogenic bacterium that autotrophically converts carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) gases into bioproducts and fuels via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP). To facilitate overall carbon capture efficiency, the reaction stoichiometry requires supplementation of hydrogen at an increased ratio of H 2 :CO to maximize CO 2 utilization; however, the molecular details and thus the ability to understand the mechanism of this supplementation are largely unknown. Results In order to elucidate the microbial physiology and fermentation where at least 75% of the carbon in ethanol comes from CO 2 , we established controlled chemostats that facilitated a novel and high (11:1) H 2 :CO uptake ratio. We compared and contrasted proteomic and metabolomics profiles to replicate continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) at the same growth rate from a lower (5:1) H 2 :CO condition where ~ 50% of the carbon in ethanol is derived from CO 2 . Our hypothesis was that major changes would be observed in the hydrogenases and/or redox-related proteins and the WLP to compensate for the elevated hydrogen feed gas. Our analyses did reveal protein abundance differences between the two conditions largely related to reduction–oxidation (redox) pathways and cofactor biosynthesis, but the changes were more minor than we would have expected. While the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway proteins remained consistent across the conditions, other post-translational regulatory processes, such as lysine-acetylation, were observed and appeared to be more important for fine-tuning this carbon metabolism pathway. Metabolomic analyses showed that the increase in H 2 :CO ratio drives the organism to higher carbon dioxide utilization resulting in lower carbon storages and accumulated fatty acid metabolite levels. Conclusions This research delves into the intricate dynamics of carbon fixation in C. autoethanogenum , examining the influence of highly elevated H 2 :CO ratios on metabolic processes and product outcomes. The study underscores the significance of optimizing gas feed composition for enhanced industrial efficiency, shedding light on potential mechanisms, such as post-translational modifications (PTMs), to fine-tune enzymatic activities and improve desired product yields.

Abstract. A growing body of evidence suggests that to achieve the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will likely be required in addition to massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions. Nature-based CDR, which includes a range of strategies to sequester carbon in natural reservoirs, could play an important role in efforts to limit climate warming to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels. Agricultural CDR could enhance soil carbon sequestration, though the climate efficacy of such methods remains uncertain. Here, we use an intermediate complexity climate model to perform simulations of agricultural CDR in the form of soil carbon sequestration at a range of possible rates for different costs under three future emissions scenarios. We found that plausible levels of agricultural CDR were able to reduce CO2 concentration by 5–19 ppm and global surface air temperature by 0.02–0.10 °C by the end of century. This temperature decrease was non-linear with respect to cumulative removals, as any carbon removed remained part of the active carbon cycle, lessening the climate benefit compared to if the removed carbon was permanently stored in geological reservoirs. CDR was found to be more effective at reducing surface air temperature in low emissions scenarios, but less effective at reducing atmospheric CO2, compared to high emissions scenarios. This was because the weaker CO2 sinks in a high CO2 world had a more muted response to removal, so a substantially higher proportion of carbon was removed from the atmosphere for a given amount of CDR in a higher emissions scenario. The enhanced temperature response to CDR in lower emissions scenarios was due to the logarithmic response of radiative effects to changes in CO2, where at low atmospheric CO2 concentrations, small changes in CO2 are more effective at changing the global radiative balance than at higher CO2 concentrations. CDR was substantially more effective when implemented at a higher rate, as CDR makes a proportionally larger difference in a climate with lower cumulative air fraction of CO2. Land and soil carbon responses were driven by the scenario-dependent balances between the impacts of CDR on primary productivity from CO2 fertilization, and the impacts on soil respiration from increased soil carbon availability and global temperatures.

Abstract With the peak of carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality, China is placing greater emphasis on energy expenditure. Office buildings occupy a prominent position in building energy consumption, which is one of the main energy consumption areas. Taking an administration building in Chengdu as an example, this article simulates the building energy consumption based on Design Builder software, examines the variables influencing energy consumption, and suggests energy-saving strategies combined with fresh ideas for sustainable architectural design. The results showed that the modeling building was a high-energy-consuming building, with an energy consumption of 724,857.59 kWh, and a unit area energy consumption of 288.17 kWh/m 2 in Chengdu. For energy conservation and emission reduction, this article proposes the following three energy-saving measures. The first is to apply heat recovery technology for air conditioning systems. The second is photovoltaic glass, which provides partial electricity demand for buildings and reduces dependence on traditional energy sources. The third is roof greening, which utilizes the plants to purify the air and beautify the environment. The results showed that the heat recovery technology in air conditioning systems reduced the total energy consumption of buildings from 642144.04 kWh/m 2 to 502937.83 kWh/m 2 , photovoltaic glass reduced 552243.87 kWh/m 2 , and roof greening reduced to 635947.35 kWh/m 2 . All of these have good energy-saving and emission reduction effects. The above three strategies not only help reduce building energy consumption, but also provide substantial support for China to achieve carbon neutrality.

Industrialization and urbanization are amongst the major sources of air pollution. Though high-performance nanomaterials offer compelling advances for air filtration and purification. In this work, several nanomaterials were tested for their ability to remove particulates (PM2.5 and PM10) and VOCs, while evaluating the wear and tear of each material. Pressure had no effect on PM2.5 capture efficiency which was 80% using activated carbon, while carbon nanotubes were more efficient in PM10 capture despite greater pressure drop. Graphene oxide was very effective in the abatement of volatile organic compounds, which was not the case for titanium dioxide which performed as good as activated carbon in the capture of PM2.5 particles but with a pressure drop of the same magnitude. Silver nanoparticles were the most effective in a percent capture of PM10 particles at low pressure drop. Yeoman’s zinc was effective in re-absorbing volatile organic compounds from the dust. The PEI-coated and electro spun nanofibers are capable of capturing PM2.5 and PM10 particles respectively, and at relatively low-pressure reductions. Results from durability studies demonstrated that TiO2 and silver nanoparticles exhibited superior efficiency retention throughout numerous cycles, but PEI-coated nanofibers saw substantial efficiency degradation

Synergistic control of the emissions of air pollutants and CO2 is critical to the dual challenges of air quality improvement and climate change in China. Based on the emission inventories of thermal power units in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, this study analyzes the CO2 and NOX emission characteristics of these units, and identifies and quantifies the synergistic drivers affecting these emission trends. The inventory data show that, between 2010 and 2020, NOX emissions were reduced by 86.1%, while CO2 emissions were reduced by only 29.8%. Although significant progress has been made in reducing NOX emissions through measures such as end-of-pipe treatment, controlling CO2 emissions remains a difficult task. The index decomposition analysis reveals that economic growth is the main driver of CO2 and NOX emission growth, energy intensity reduction is the main driver of CO2 emission reduction, and end-of-pipe treatment is the main driver of NOX emission reduction. Currently, coal occupies about 87% of the energy consumption of thermal power units in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, and remains the main type of energy for synergistic emissions, and the potential for emission reduction in the energy structure remains huge. For NOX emissions, it is expected that 90% of the reduction potential can be achieved through energy restructuring and end-of-pipe treatment. In conclusion, this high-precision unit-by-unit emission study confirms the effectiveness of the control policy for thermal power units in the region and provides some scientific reference for future policy formulation.

Abstract The urgent requirement of carbon reduction in the world provides wood products a historical opportunity to play a crucial role to fix carbon dioxide and reduce carbon emission. It is essential to reveal the in situ growth mechanism of copper nanoparticles on eucalyptus scrimber surface. Cu 4 (SO 4 )(OH) 6 nanoflowers are in situ synthesized successfully on the surface of eucalyptus scrimber via a simple hydrothermal process in this work. The detailed nucleation and in situ growth process of Cu 4 (OH) 6 SO 4 nanoparticles on the surface of eucalyptus scrimber, characterized by the trajectory of size evolution, are revealed first in this work. According to the classical nucleation theory, the nucleation stage of as prepared Cu 4 (SO 4 )(OH) 6 nanoflowers includes nucleus formation and nucleus growth. Although the same initial precursor reactant is obtained at the nucleation stage, there are two types of early nanoparticles, with morphology of fusiform and strip shape being self assembled to nanoflower structure during the growth stage. Further, the modified eucalyptus scrimber exhibits excellent superhydrophobicity, UV durability, mold and moisture resistance, as well as reversible property. Therefore, the proposed in situ growth kinetics related to Cu 4 (OH) 6 SO 4 nanoparticles on wood surface have potential to be a reference to develop multifunctional superhydrophobic wood‐based material for variable applications.

The objective of this study is to systematically investigate not only the influence of different additive types—beyond the much-considered case of aluminum-silicate-based additives—but also to carry out an additional comparison between primary and secondary emission mitigation measures during small-scale wood-chip combustion. Hence, combustion trials are realized within a 33-kW combustion plant. Pine wood chips additivated with 1.0 wt%a.r. of four additives have shown promising emission reduction effects in the past; namely kaolin (i.e., aluminum-silicate-based), anorthite (i.e., aluminum-silicate- and calcium-based), aluminum hydroxide (i.e., aluminum-based), and titanium dioxide (i.e., titanium-based). In addition to the primary mitigation measure (i.e., (fuel) additivation), an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) as a common secondary mitigation measure for total particulate matter (TPM) reduction is used for comparison. In addition to standard analyses (e.g., gravimetric determination of TPM emissions), an extended methodology (e.g., characterization of the elemental composition and ultrafine particle fraction of TPM emissions) is applied. The results show that the additivation of wood chips with kaolin and anorthite can lead to an operation of the combustion plant in compliance with the German legal TPM limit values by undercutting the absolute emission level achievable by the ESP. Additionally, kaolin and anorthite achieve significant reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, while kaolin simultaneously, and similarly to ESP, also leads to a shift in the particle size number distribution of PM emissions towards coarser particles. All additives show a significant reduction of potassium (K) emissions by the formation of high-temperature stable K compounds in the resulting ashes.

Methanol production through carbon capture and utilization technologies offers promising alternatives to traditional natural-gas-based methods, potentially mitigating climate change impacts and improving resource efficiency. This study evaluates four methanol production pathways: CO2 hydrogenation, tri-reforming of methane, electrochemical CO2 reduction, and co-electrolysis of CO2 and water. The analysis covers 19 scenarios, combining three electricity mixes (100% Thai grid mix, 50% Thai grid mix and 50% renewable energy, and 100% renewable energy) with two hydrogen production technologies (alkaline water electrolysis and grey hydrogen). Environmental life cycle assessment results showed that most pathways perform well when using the 100% renewable energy with co-electrolysis (CE-100%) showing the most substantial reductions across all impact categories as compared conventional methanol production. Electrochemical reduction demonstrated the poorest environmental performance for all scenarios. In Thailand, implementing the CE-100% pathway could potentially yield 12.4 million tonnes of methanol annually from the cement industry’s CO2 emissions, with an estimated value of approximately USD 5.4 billion, while reducing emissions from the industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector by 75%. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers, supporting Thailand’s transition towards sustainable methanol production and broader climate goals.

Abstract Background Acne vulgaris poses a significant dermatological challenge, necessitating alternative treatments due to limitations and side effects associated with current therapies. This pilot clinical trial investigated the feasibility and efficacy of precision cryotherapy for acne vulgaris. Methods A total of 20 volunteers underwent targeted precision cryotherapy using a carbon dioxide‐based device. Treatment outcomes were assessed using various parameters, including Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, acne lesion count, erythema index (EI), global evaluation score, and participant satisfaction. Safety monitoring included adverse event reporting and physical examination. Results Precision cryotherapy demonstrated a significant reduction (90.25%) in the acne lesion count by week 4, with clinical improvement indicated by IGA score reduction ( p < 0.001). The EI showed notable improvements at weeks 1, 2, and 4. The global evaluation score demonstrated a 75%–100% clinical improvement at Visit 4. Participants reported high satisfaction (6.75 ± 0.79) with the procedure. No adverse event or discomfort was reported. Conclusion Precision cryotherapy effectively improved acne lesions, which was safe and satisfactory for participants. These findings suggest its potential as an alternative therapeutic modality, especially for populations with limited treatment options. Further research is needed to validate the results and explore underlying mechanisms.

Abstract Carbon-doped silicon dioxide (SiCOH) film is currently regarded as one of the most promising low-k materials in the integrated circuits (ICs) industry for advanced technology nodes. However, there have been limited studies on the thermal properties of SiCOH compared to its electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, we investigate the thermal conductivity of SiCOH thin films through molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and experimental characterizations. Our findings indicate that the size effect on thermal conductivity at 300 K is negligible when the thickness of SiCOH film is less than 20 nm. Additionally, we observe a contrasting temperature dependence law for the thermal conductivity of SiCOH thin films compared to crystal SiO2 thin films. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing porosity in SiCOH films; specifically, an increase in porosity from 5.35% to 42.77% results in a 60% reduction in thermal conductivity. Moreover, we validate our simulation results by characterizing the thermal conductivity of SiCOH using 3ω method.&#xD;

Seed yield and vigor of hybrid maize determine the planting, yield, and quality of maize, and consequently affect food, nutrition, and livelihood security; however, the response of seed yield and vigor to climate change is still unclear. We established an optimization-simulation framework consisting of a water‑nitrogen crop production function, a seed vigor and a gridded process-based model to optimize irrigation and nitrogen fertilization management, and used it to evaluate seed yield and vigor in major seed production locations of China, the USA, and Mexico. This framework could reflect the influence of water and nitrogen inputs at different stages on seed yield and vigor considering the spatio-temporal variability of climate and soil properties. Projected seed yield and vigor decreased by 5.8–9.0 % without adaptation by the 2050s, due to the 1.3–5.8 % decrease in seed number and seed protein concentration. Seed yield was positively correlated with CO2 and negatively correlated with temperature, while seed vigor depended on the response of components of seed vigor to climatic factors. Under optimized management, the direct positive effects of temperature on seed protein concentration and CO2 on seed number were strengthened, and the direct negative effects of temperature on seed number and CO2 on seed protein concentration were weakened, which mitigated the reductions in both seed yield and vigor. Elevated CO2 was projected to exacerbate the 2.6 % seed vigor reduction and mitigate the 2.9 % seed yield loss without adaptation, while optimized management could increase seed yield by 4.1 % and mitigate the 2.2 % seed vigor reduction in the Hexi Corridor of China, and decrease the seed yield and vigor reduction by 2.4–5.8 % in the USA and Mexico. Optimized management can strengthen the positive and mitigate the negative effects of climate change on irrigated hybrid maize and inform high-yield and high-quality seed production globally.

Abstract The Hydrate-based CO2 Storage/Sequestration technique has the potential to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 by enabling efficient and safe storage of CO2. This paper explores the potential of CO2 storage through gas hydrate formation in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, an innovative approach to mitigating climate change by reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. The current applications and potentials of gas hydrates are examined, highlighting their role in energy production, CO2 reduction via oceanic injection, energy storage, and other uses. Geological considerations are analyzed, emphasizing the self-sealing potential of CO2 hydrates, the mechanisms of CO2 sequestration through hydrate formation, and the impact of hydrate presence on reservoir permeability. Simulation studies provide insights into the feasibility and efficiency of this method. Various approaches for CO2 hydrate sequestration are discussed, outlining the practical steps and technological requirements involved. The environmental implications and potential challenges of CO2 hydrate sequestration are evaluated, considering the ecological impacts and long-term sustainability. This comprehensive review suggests that while CO2 storage through gas hydrate formation in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs holds significant promise, it necessitates further research and technological advancements to address the identified challenges and fully realize its potential as a viable climate mitigation strategy.

The existing natural gas transportation pipelines can withstand a hydrogen content of 0 to 50%, but further research is still needed on the pathways of NO and CO production under moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion within this range of hydrogen blending. In this paper, we present a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of hydrogen-doped jet flame combustion in a jet in a hot coflow (JHC) burner. We conducted an in-depth study of the mechanisms by which NO and CO are produced at different locations within hydrogen-doped flames. Additionally, we established a chemical reaction network (CRN) model specifically for the JHC burner and calculated the detailed influence of hydrogen content on the mechanisms of NO and CO formation. The findings indicate that an increase in hydrogen content leads to an expansion of the main NO production region and a contraction of the main NO consumption region within the jet flame. This phenomenon is accompanied by a decline in the sub-reaction rates associated with both the prompt route and NO-reburning pathway via CHi=0–3 radicals, alongside an increase in N2O and thermal NO production rates. Consequently, this results in an overall enhancement of NO production and a reduction in NO consumption. In the context of MILD combustion, CO production primarily arises from the reduction of CO2 through the reaction CH2(S) + CO2 ⇔ CO + CH2O, the introduction of hydrogen into the system exerts an inhibitory effect on this reduction reaction while simultaneously enhancing the CO oxidation reaction, OH + CO ⇔ H + CO2, this dual influence ultimately results in a reduction of CO production.

Aim. To identify specific features of production and use of transportation biofuels in selected developing countries, as well as to assess the potential of bioethanol industry development in the Russian Federation (RF). Objectives . To generalize the experience of production and use of transport biofuels in Brazil, China and Indonesia; to determine the specifics of biofuel industry development in the mentioned developing countries. Methods. The methods of system analysis, comparative analysis, method of expert evaluations, mathematical, statistical methods were applied in the process of research. Results. The specificity of biofuel industry development in Brazil, China and Indonesia is shown. The production and use of transportation biofuels in these countries is carried out within the framework of a systemic state policy focused on diversification of energy consumption, promotion of renewable energy sources, reduction of pollutant emissions and stimulation of economic growth. Opportunities and risks for the development of production and use of transportation biofuels have been identified. The opportunities include, first of all, the formation of additional demand for agricultural products (including waste) and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector. At the same time, the production of first-generation transportation biofuels can negatively affect food security, reorienting agricultural producers from the production of “food” to the production of “raw materials for the energy sector”, and natural ecosystems, contributing to the involvement of new land plots in agricultural turnover. Conclusions. System analysis of the accumulated experience of production and use of transport biofuels in Brazil, China and Indonesia indicates the promising development of bioethanol industry in Russia. At the same time, the realization of this direction should not contribute to the strengthening of anthropogenic impact on the environment and adversely affect the availability of food.

Soil carbon (C) cycling under anoxic conditions is mechanistically linked to dissimilatory iron (Fe) reduction, which could be regulated by exogenous dissolved organic matter (DOM). However, the impact of complex exogenous DOM on soil microbial activity and C-Fe coupling in paddy soils remains underexplored. With a 100-day microcosm experiment, we determined that the molecular composition of DOM derived from organic fertilizers and biochar on paddy soil affects soil microbial community, Fe reduction, and C emissions. Our results indicated that biochar-DOM significantly promoted Fe reduction and accelerated CH4 and CO2 emissions, and organic manure-DOM increased soil CO2 emissions, which was closely related to the molecular composition of exogenous DOM. DOM molecules with high aromaticity (AImod) and high DBE, including lignins-vascular plant-derived polyphenols, lignins-polycyclic aromatics (PA), and condensed aromatics-PA, promoted soil Fe reduction and CH4 emissions by enriching soil Fe-reducing bacteria (FeRB), reducing methanotrophs, and facilitating r-strategists at the early stage of incubation. Conversely, DOMs with low AImod, low DBE and high H/C, such as lignins-highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and proteins-aliphatic compounds, enhanced CO2 emissions by facilitating recalcitrant C degradation and CH4 oxidation at the late stage of incubation. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the molecular composition of DOMs derived from organic amendments in regulating soil Fe reduction and C emissions. The findings offer novel insights into the effective utilization of agricultural resources and the mitigation of soil C emissions.

Abstract This paper presents the implementation of chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) on the offshore platform CB22F, detailing its impact over three years and proposing improvements for future deployments. It discusses the project's effects, such as increased oil production, reduced water cut, and lowered CO2 emissions, while sharing insights for optimizing future CEOR designs on two newly sanctioned platforms. The CEOR strategy on CB22F has shown significant outcomes, demonstrated by an increase in oil production, a reduction in water cut, and a decrease in CO2 emissions. Oil production increased by 663 of barrels per day (b/d), the water cut decreased from 90% to 80.5%, reducing the volumes of water handled. This decrease in water cut lowered energy consumption for water pumping and chemical treatment costs for produced water, leading to a reduction in cost and CO2 emissions to produce one barrel of oil. The test area began showing positive effects by June 2021, with a significant decrease in water content in produced fluids in 2022 and a rapid increase in oil output. By the end of March 2024, the water cut stabilized around 80.5%, and the cumulative oil increase from the 44 effective production wells reached 3,800,000 barrels, corresponding to a 4.27% increase in oil recovery. This cumulative increase translates to 28.9 tons of oil per ton of polymer injected, indicating the project's economic viability. Building on the success of CB22F, CEOR will be implemented on two newly sanctioned platforms with designs incorporating improvements learned from CB22F's experience. Bulk polymer delivery via pneumatic transfer will mitigate hoisting risks, improve occupational health, increase offshore storage capacity, and reduce delivery rotations, thus decreasing CO2 emissions associated with logistic operations. An integrated injection system will involve a centralized polymer injection system on the main platform, facilitating efficient distribution to both main and satellite platforms. The introduction of new Conical Pressure Reducer (CPR) skids, equipped with low shear valves, will regulate injection pressure, and adapt the polymer concentration for individual wells, minimizing polymer degradation and footprint compared to conventional methods. To address higher polymer/surfactant concentrations in produced fluids, concerns regarding emulsification are being managed through the development of new, high-efficiency water clarifiers. These improvements, guided by CB22F's experience, are expected to further optimize CEOR performance and efficiency on future platforms. This paper provides insights for engineers by demonstrating a successful CEOR implementation with concrete results and data, sharing practical improvements for future CEOR designs on offshore platforms, addressing potential challenges, and proposing viable solutions. Additionally, it contributes to knowledge on CO2 reduction strategies in oil and gas production, highlighting the environmental benefits alongside the financial gains. The reduction in CO2 emissions per barrel of oil produced underscores the broader impact of the project beyond immediate financial gains, contributing to the long-term sustainability of oil production operations.

The complexity of a sustainable economy is rooted in its socio-economic and environmental intricacies, particularly in formulating pathways for the harmonious integration of these parameters. This study introduces an extended input-output analysis and a multi-objective optimisation framework designed to discern trajectories for reducing CO2 emissions while simultaneously maximising GDP and employment. The economic alterations are evaluated through metrics facilitating the examination of both direct and indirect consequences stemming from perturbations within the economy. The focus of this research centres on the French economy, concentrating on pivotal sectors where reducing demand could yield the greatest reduction in CO2 emissions with minimal socio-economic ramifications. Additionally, a model is outlined for energy substitution, wherein fossil fuels in the French electricity mix are supplanted with clean energies. The ensuing effects of such a model on emission reduction pathways are scrutinised, followed by a comparison with the baseline case study.

CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) powered by renewable electricity is critical for transitioning to a carbon‐neutral society by transforming CO2 into essential commodities and fuels. The formation of multi‐carbon compounds through C‐C coupling reactions is crucial due to their high energy density and broad industrial uses. Traditionally, C‐C coupling was believed to occur through the reaction of *CO (surface‐bound CO) with *C1 intermediates (surface‐bound hydrocarbons with one carbon atom produced during CO2ER). In this study, we used DFT calculations combined with a constant electrode potential model to discover a preference for CO2 + *C1 over conventional *CO + *C1 coupling on three commonly observed copper surfaces including Cu(111), Cu(110), and Cu(100). This result demonstrates that CO2 is a more efficient carbon source than *CO for coupling with *C1. Among the nine *C1 species investigated, *CHO, *CHOH, *C, *CH, and *CH2 show greater reactivity towards CO2 + *C1 couplings on all the surfaces. Thus, enhancing CO2ER efficiency necessitates increasing the surface concentrations of these five *C1 intermediates, and several strategies have been proposed to accomplish this goal.

Abstract A broad consensus of neutralizing the carbon dioxide emissions facilitates the transition to the renewable energy power system. Meanwhile, the concerns about the volatility of renewable energies are growing as the rotational inertia of power system becomes inadequate. To maintain the frequency stability of power system, some studies for configuring inertia energy storage systems (ESSs) are carried out, mainly focusing on the allocation of virtual inertia from grid‐forming ESS. In contrast, the allocation of virtual inertia from grid‐following ESS has not been well elaborated and the differences in virtual inertia provided by these two modes are yet to be revealed. Based on ‐norm and Kron reduction, firstly, the state‐space model of post‐disturbance system is established, together with the transient performance evaluation. Then the inertia characteristics of both grid‐forming and grid‐following devices are formulated, followed by the unified gradient descent optimization method for allocating virtual inertia. A modified IEEE 39‐bus system and its time‐domain simulations help in the verification of the contribution of this paper. Through the comparative analysis of corresponding optimal results, the conclusions from two aspects are drawn: in terms of transient frequency support, the grid‐forming devices can provide no less than better inertia support; with the higher power capacity and similar energy capacity, the grid‐forming devices can relieve the response pressure of other generators by approximately .

The reaction of I with one equivalent of ammonia in THF gives adduct [(ArBIG-bian)Al(NH3)(μ-OC(H)O)2Li(Thf)2] (IV), in which ammonia is coordinated to the aluminum atom, while the key bonds in I have not undergone ammonolysis.

Abstract Carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme conserved across species, is pivotal in the interconversion of inorganic carbon (Ci; CO2 and HCO3–). Compared to the well-studied intracellular CA, the specific role of extracellular CA in photosynthetic organisms is still not well understood. In the green alga Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), carbonic anhydrase 1 (CAH1), located at the periplasmic space, is strongly induced under CO2-limiting conditions by the Myb transcription factor LCR1. While the lcr1 mutant shows decreased Ci-affinity, the detailed mechanisms behind this phenomenon are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to unravel the LCR1-dependent genes essential for maintaining high Ci-affinity. To achieve this, we identified a total of 12 LCR1-dependent inducible genes under CO2-limiting conditions, focusing specifically on the most prominent ones - CAH1, LCI1, LCI6, and Cre10.g426800. We then created mutants of these genes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, all from the same parental strain, and compared their Ci-affinity. Contrary to earlier findings that reported no reduction in Ci-affinity in the cah1 mutant, our cah1-1 mutant exhibited a decrease in Ci-affinity under high HCO3–/CO2-ratio conditions. Additionally, when we treated wild-type cells with a CA inhibitor with low membrane permeability, a similar reduction in Ci-affinity was observed. Moreover, the addition of exogenous CA to the cah1 mutant rescued the decreased Ci-affinity. These results, highlighting the crucial function of the periplasmic CAH1 in maintaining high Ci-affinity in Chlamydomonas cells, provide insights into the functions of periplasmic CA in algal carbon assimilation.

This study aimed to compare the effects of two extraction techniques (conventional n-hexane and supercritical CO2) on the oil extraction yields, fatty acids profile, anti-hyaluronidase activity, oxidative stability, and in vitro bioactivities of oils from Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis). Higher oil extraction yield (99 %) was achieved using the SC-CO2, although similar fatty acids profiles were depicted between both treatments (p < 0.05). The SC-CO2 oil presented higher anti-hyaluronidase (31 %) activity, but lower oxidative stability (5.05 h) compared to the solvent extraction (10 %, and 5.3 h, respectively). In vitro assays further revealed that the best human normal colon cells (FHC) cell viability (100 %), anti-inflammatory (50 % lower NO production), and antioxidant (20 % ROS reduction) activities were consistently observed in both extraction treatments at concentrations of 50 μg/mL and higher. These findings highlight the potential of supercritical CO2 extraction in yielding Sacha Inchi oil with enhanced bioactive properties without the disadvantages of the use of organic solvents extraction.

Abstract Microbial valorization of CO2-derived substrates has emerged as a promising approach to address climate change and resource scarcity. Formate, which can be efficiently produced from CO2, shows great potential as a sustainable feedstock for biotechnological production. However, the scope of formate assimilation pathways is restricted by the limited number of natural formate-assimilating enzymes. To overcome this limitation, several new-to-nature routes for formate assimilation based on its reduction to formaldehyde have been proposed, but they suffer from low catalytic efficiencies and cannot yet support bacterial growth. Here, we propose the Serine Shunt as a novel formate reduction route and demonstrate its activity in vivo. In this pathway, formate is attached to glycine to form serine, which is subsequently cleaved into formaldehyde and glycine, thereby effectively converting formate to formaldehyde. Unlike other formate reduction routes, the Serine Shunt mainly utilizes natural reactions with favorable enzyme kinetics, while requiring the same amount of ATP and NADPH as the most efficient new-to-nature route. We implemented the Serine Shunt in engineered Escherichia coli strains using a step-wise approach by dividing the pathway into metabolic modules. After validating the individual module activities, we demonstrated the in vivo activity of the complete Serine Shunt by measuring intracellular formaldehyde production with a GFP sensor and coupling its activity to cell growth. Our results indicate that the Serine Shunt could be applied as a novel formate reduction route in methylotrophic hosts relevant for biotechnology.

The increasing demand for energy, driven by technological advances, population growth, and economic expansion, has intensified the focus on efficient energy management. Tri-generation systems, such as Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) systems, are of particular interest due to their efficiency and sustainability. Integrating renewable energy sources like solar power with traditional fossil fuels further optimizes CCHP systems. This study presents a novel method for enhancing CCHP system efficiency by identifying optimal design parameters and assisting decision-makers in selecting the best geometric configurations. A mathematical programming model using the Harris Hawks optimizer was developed to maximize net power and exergy efficiency while minimizing CO2 emissions in a solar-assisted CCHP system. The optimization resulted in 100 Pareto optimal solutions, offering various choices for performance improvement. This method achieved higher net power output, satisfactory exergy efficiency, and lower CO2 emissions compared to similar studies. The study shows that maximum net power and exergy efficiency, with reduced CO2 emissions, can be achieved with a system having a low compression ratio and low combustion chamber inlet temperature. The proposed approach surpassed the response surface method, achieving at least a 4.2% reduction in CO2 emissions and improved exergy values.

Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a rapidly evolving technology that extracts CO2 directly from ambient air. This study presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of integrating DAC in HVAC systems, which can reduce indoor CO2 concentration and improve energy efficiency of HVAC systems. The DAC equipment is modeled in Modelica based on isotherm and thermodynamic equations, and pressure drop curves of the CO2 sorbent described in literature. The model is validated with data from the literature, and then integrated into a typical HVAC system available in Modelica Buildings library. The HVAC system is a Variable Air Volume (VAV) with reheater system for a one-floor office building with standard ASHRAE 2006 control sequences. Demand control ventilation strategies are designed to reduce the outdoor air flowrates when indoor CO2 concentrations are lower than the threshold, which is to maximize the benefits of integrating DAC. Four cases are proposed to assess the impacts of integrating DAC and DCV in HVAC systems in 8 different ASHRAE climate zones in the USA. The results show that by integrating DAC unit into the HVAC system, the average indoor CO2 concentration can be significantly reduced by over 45% against the baseline without a DAC unit. By integrating DCV, 0.39-21.66% of annual energy savings and 226-9539 kg carbon emissions reduction are observed across different climate zones. The highest energy savings are found to be achieved with cold climatic conditions while the lowest energy savings occur with favorable weather.

Field experiment was conducted at Punjab Agricultural University, Bathinda from 2017-18 to 2019-20 to evaluate the growth and yield of wheat under varying sowing dates (Nov. 15, Nov. 30 & Dec 15), irrigation regimes (IW: CP = 0.6, 0.8, & 1.0), and nitrogen levels 80% RDN, RDN & 120% RDN). Timely sowing (15 November) resulted in significantly highest grain yield (5090 kg ha-1) and delay in sowing caused reduction in yield by 2.83 % and 9.91 % in crop sown on 30 November and 15 December respectively. Yield and yield attributes were found to increase with increase in irrigation and nitrogen levels. The highest yield was achieved with 15 November sowing, IW: CPE ratio 1.0 and 120% RDN. The sensitivity of the validated CERES-wheat model to increase in temperature by 0.7, 1.2, 1.5 0C and CO2 concentration by 435, 460, 500 ppm, as projected for years 2030, 2040 and 2050 respectively, revealed reduction in the wheat yield. The combination of 15 November sown crop, irrigation at IW:CPE ratio 1.0, and recommended dose of nitrogen showed resilience against increasing CO2 concentration and temperature rise.

ConspectusCarbon dioxide (CO2) is recognized as a greenhouse gas and a common waste product. Simultaneously, it serves as an advantageous and commercially available C1 building block to generate valuable chemicals. Particularly, carboxylation with CO2 is considered a significant method for the direct and sustainable production of important carboxylic acids. However, the utilization of CO2 is challenging owing to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Recently, organic electrosynthesis has emerged as a promising approach that utilizes electrons or holes as environmentally friendly redox reagents to produce reactive intermediates in a controlled and selective manner. This technique holds great potential for the CO2 utilization.Since 2015, our group has been dedicated to exploring the utilization of CO2 in organic synthesis with a particular focus on electrochemical carboxylation. Despite the significant advancements made in this area, there are still many challenges, including the activation of inert substrates, regulation of selectivity, diversity in electrolysis modes, and activation strategies. Over the past 7 years, our team, with many great experts, has presented findings on electrochemical carboxylation with CO2 under mild conditions. In this context, we primarily highlight our contributions to selective electrocarboxylations, encompassing new reaction systems, selectivity control methods, and activation approaches.We commenced our research by establishing a Ni-catalyzed electrochemical carboxylation of unactivated aryl halides and alkyl bromides in conjunction with a useful paired anodic reaction. This approach eliminates the need for sacrificial anodes, rendering the carboxylation process sustainable. To further utilize the widely existing yet cost-effective alkyl chlorides, we have developed a deep electroreductive system to achieve carboxylation of unactivated alkyl chlorides and poly(vinyl chloride), allowing the direct modification and upgrading of waste polymers.Through precise adjustment of the electroreductive conditions, we successfully demonstrated the dicarboxylation of both strained carbocycles and acyclic polyarylethanes with CO2 via C–C bond cleavage. Furthermore, we have realized the dicarboxylative cyclization of unactivated skipped dienes to produce the valuable ring-tethered adipic acids through single-electron reduction of CO2 to the CO2 radical anion (CO2•–). In terms of the asymmetric carboxylation, Guo's and our groups have recently achieved the nickel-catalyzed enantioselective electroreductive carboxylation reaction using racemic propargylic carbonates and CO2, paving the way for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargylic carboxylic acids.In addition to the aforementioned advancements, Lin's and our groups have also developed new electrolysis modes to achieve regiodivergent C–H carboxylation of N-heteroarenes dictated by electrochemical reactors. The choice of reactors plays a crucial role in determining whether the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagents are formed anodically, consequently influencing the carboxylation pathways of N-heteroarene radical anions in the distinct electrolyzed environments.

Integrating CO2 capture and utilization by dry reforming methane (ICCU-DRM) technology is promising in concentrating and utilizing diluted CO2 from flue gas, which depends on developing Dual Functional Materials (DFMs) with adsorption and catalytic sites. Ni-Ca materials are widely applied in ICCU-DRM due to their excellent catalytic and CO2 adsorption properties. Nevertheless, the challenge remains that oxygen in the actual flue gas would oxidize the active Ni, leading to a delay in the DRM stage. In this work, Cu-promoted, ZrO2-stabilized Ni-Ca based DFMs were developed, which suppressed the delay and enhanced the performance of the DRM reaction. Attribute to the excellent reducing properties, Cu could be rapidly reduced in the CH4 atmosphere and further promote the reduction of NiO to the catalytically active Ni monomers by activating methane to generate reactive hydrogen (H*). What's more, attributed to the disappearance of delay times, it is accompanied by a satisfying yield distribution with a 0.11 decrease in H2/CO ratio and an improvement in conversion, especially CH4 conversion with an increase of more than 10%. In addition, the bifunctional material also exhibits favorable cycling stability due to the stabilizers.

Hydrogen mobility embodies a promising solution to address the challenges posed by traditional fossil-fuel-based vehicles. The use of hydrogen in small heavy duty road vehicles based on internal combustion engines (ICEs) may be appealing for two fundamental reasons: direct electrification seems less promising in heavy duty transport systems and fuel cell-based hydrogen vehicles implementation may not proceed at the expected pace due to higher investment costs compared to ICEs. On the other hand, hydrogen combustion is gaining attractiveness and relies on robust and cheap technologies, but it is not the only renewable solution. In this framework, this work presents a methodology to assess Weel-to-Whell primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions of small heavy-duty vehicles. The methodology is applied in a real case-study, namely a passenger coach travelling on a 100 km-mission in non-optimized conditions. Therefore, the suitability of hydrogen is compared with standard diesel and other alternative diesel-type fuels (biodiesel and synthetic diesel types). Hydrogen shows competitivity with standard diesel from the point of view of CO2 emission reduction (-29%) while it hides a higher primary energy consumption (+40%). Nonetheless, HVO brings the highest benefits both from the point of view of primary energy consumption and emission reduction, namely -35% and 464-634 kgCO2/100km avoided compared to hydrogen.

Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. High concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, but they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate‐based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode‐electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen–bond (H–bond) network, which is attributed to the H–bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9% for CO can be achieved at 250 mA cm–2, simultaneous with a high single‐pass carbon efficiency of 72.2% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode‐electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.

Ecosystems that experience elevated CO2 (eCO2) are crucial interfaces where intricate interactions between plants and microbes occur. This study addressed the impact of eCO2 and a N supply on faba bean (Vicia faba L.) growth and the soil microbial community in auto-controlled growth chambers. In doing so, two ambient CO2 concentrations (aCO2, daytime/nighttime = 410/460 ppm; eCO2, 550/610 ppm) and two N supplement levels (without a N supply—N0—and 100 mg N as urea per kg of soil—N100) were applied. The results indicated that eCO2 mitigated the inhibitory effects of a N deficiency on legume photosynthesis and affected the CO2 assimilation efficiency, in addition to causing reduced nodulation. While the N addition counteracted the reductions in the N concentrations across the faba beans’ aboveground and belowground plant tissues under eCO2, the CO2 concentrations did not significantly alter the soil NH4+-N or NO3−-N responses to a N supply. Notably, under both aCO2 and eCO2, a N supply significantly increased the relative abundance of Nitrososphaeraceae and Nitrosomonadaceae, while eCO2 specifically reduced the Rhizobiaceae abundance with no significant changes under aCO2. A redundancy analysis (RDA) highlighted that the soil pH (p < 0.01) had the most important influence on the soil microbial community. Co-occurrence networks indicated that the eCO2 conditions mitigated the impact of a N supply on the reduced structural complexity of the soil microbial communities. These findings suggest that a combination of eCO2 and a N supply to crops can provide potential benefits for managing future climate change impacts on crop production.

On November 21, 2016, the world was shaken by a catastrophic epidemic thunderstorm asthma event which overtook the Melbourne, a city of over 5 million people in south-eastern Australia. Following heavy early seasonal spring rains which allowed a lush growth of vegetation, a 10 day long hot dry spell in late spring was broken by a cool change and thunderstorms crossing over the city at 6 pm. A large proportion of the unsuspecting population was mainly outdoors, enjoying the beaches to cool off, or commuting on the way home from work. Within hours, hospital emergency departments were inundated as thousands of people presented with symptoms of respiratory distress and ambulances were overwhelmed with distress calls for help. The official figures of 3365 excess public hospital emergency department presentations with respiratory-related cases and 476 excess asthma-related hospital admissions (a 7-fold and 10-fold increase above average respectively) underestimate the thousands of others who presented to general practitioners and community pharmacies seeking relief.1 This dramatic event brought into sharp relief the story of thunderstorm-related respiratory symptoms which have been described globally now for over 40 years. Initially reported in the United Kingdom in 1983, dozens of events have been reported in diverse geographical regions including Canada, USA, Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Northern China, Australia and New Zealand.2 The Melbourne 2016 event was the deadliest by far with 10 fatalities, with 5 fatalities reported subsequently in Kuwait in 2016, and previously reported events (in UK and Australia) with single fatalities (Table 1). What have we learnt and how can we be better prepared to prevent or mitigate the risk of future events? These thunderstorm respiratory events arise from a common complex interaction of environmental and individual susceptibility factors. Main environmental factors include high concentrations of an aeroallergen and the presence of thunderstorms. Allergens which have been described include various mould species (Didymella exitalis, Myxomycetes and Alternaria sp.), weed (Parietaria/Urticaceae sp. and Amaranthaceae sp.), mugwort (Artemisia sp.), olive tree (Olea europaea) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pollens.3 Thunderstorm characteristics include outflows with colder air associated with the down draft from the thunderstorm, sweeping up pollen grains and particles and then concentrating them in a shallow band of air bringing atmospheric aeroallergens to ground level. For ryegrass pollen triggered events, evidence suggests thunderstorm moisture and rainwater ruptures ryegrass pollen grains by osmotic shock, releasing fine (<2.5 μm) allergen-bearing starch-granules respirable to the lower airways. This allows bypass of the usual upper airway filter and trigger acute bronchospasm via a putative direct lower airway allergen challenge, even in those not previously known to be asthmatic. Individual risk factors include prior allergen sensitization and exposure, with the presence of rhinitis being both a marker of allergic sensitization as well as a risk factor for latent and undiagnosed asthma. In those with diagnosed current asthma, low adherence to preventive inhaled steroids increases thunderstorm asthma risk. Other factors more recently identified include Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score >1.5, ryegrass pollen specific IgE > 10.1 kU/L, raised eosinophil counts, and raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level.4 The effect of climate change on allergenic pollen and weather patterns and their impact on health and healthcare services is a burgeoning area of concern. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and temperatures have important effects on plants, their pollen production, and the consequent burden of atmospheric allergens.5 Seasonal variations and increases in temperature affect the timing of the pollen season for some plants, including starting pollen release earlier and lasting longer. In addition, significant increases in pollen allergenicity have been reported as associated with increasing CO2 and temperature. Climate change can also increase the likelihood of extreme weather events, such as thunderstorms and unseasonal rainfall promoting luxuriant plant growth, alternating with hot dry spells promoting pollen release.5 Air pollution that is also influenced by climate change significantly exacerbates the risk and severity of thunderstorm asthma by interacting with pollen, enhancing respiratory sensitivity, and contributing to a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs.2 Understanding this relationship is crucial for preventing and managing thunderstorm asthma, particularly in urban areas where pollution levels are high. Improved understanding of these risk factors for thunderstorm asthma leads to consideration of the following preventive strategies at the individual, public health and environmental level. For individuals with asthma, access and adherence to an inhaled steroid/fast onset long-acting bronchodilator (ICS/LABA) medication (such as a budesonide and formoterol combination inhaler) during the pollen season should be promoted. Those with allergic rhinitis need to be treated with preventive therapy such as intranasal steroids, with consideration of, and access to ICS/LABA inhalers especially if there are any respiratory symptoms suggestive of latent or undiagnosed asthma. Allergen specific immunotherapy (if available) can also be considered as primary or secondary preventive risk reduction strategies.6 At the public health level, pollen monitoring can facilitate pollen forecasting and warning systems, to allow pollen sensitive individuals to stay indoors and avoid exposure to harmful pollen levels. In the Australian state of Victoria, following the Melbourne 2016 event, a thunderstorm asthma forecasting system during the pollen season has been implemented which combines meteorological and grass pollen forecasts to produce daily forecasts of low, moderate, or high thunderstorm asthma risk. During high-risk days with high airborne pollen concentrations (>50 pollen grains/m3) and severe thunderstorms with strong winds, public health messages are promoted through public and social media to stay indoors, and for those at risk with asthma and allergic rhinitis to have available and take their inhaled/intranasal medication. Health services are also put on alert for thunderstorm asthma outbreak response preparedness. These strategies need to be tailored for particular geographical regions' health system resources and thunderstorm asthma risk profile (Figure 1). Lastly, climate change is a global health concern at multiple levels. There is an urgent need to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change on human health. Emissions reduction and air quality improvement (through reducing fossil fuel use and increasing environmental biodiversity and green spaces) and promoting sustainable agricultural practices will help to reduce the impact of climate change.7 The paradigm and catastrophic potential of epidemic thunderstorm asthma emphasises the need to take urgent action in order to write a new ending to an old story.

Inspired by recent advances in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) under acidic conditions, herein we leverage in situ spectroscopy to inform the optimization of CO2R at low pH. Using attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and fluorescent confocal laser scanning microscopy, we investigate the role that alkali cations (M+) play on electrochemical CO2R. This study hence provides important information related to the local electrode surface pH under bulk acidic conditions for CO2R, both in the presence and absence of an organic film layer, at variable [M+]. We show that in an acidic electrolyte, an appropriate current density can enable CO2R in the absence of metal cations. In situ local pH measurements suggest the local [H+] must be sufficiently depleted to promote H2O reduction as the competing reaction with CO2R. Incrementally incorporating [K+] leads to increases in the local pH that promotes CO2R but only at proton consumption rates sufficient to drive the pH up dramatically. Stark tuning measurements and analysis of surface water structure reveal no change in the electric field with [M+] and a desorption of interfacial water, indicating that improved CO2R performance is driven by suppression of H+ mass transport and modification of the interfacial solvation structure. In situ pH measurements confirm increasing local pH, and therefore decreased local [CO2], with [M+], motivating alternate means of modulating proton transport. We show that an organic film formed via in situ electrodeposition of an organic additive provides a means to achieve selective CO2R (FECO2R ∼ 65%) over hydrogen evolution reaction in the presence of strong acid (pH 1) and low cation concentrations (≤0.1 M) at both low and high current densities.

There are environmental impacts associated with the construction of necessary infrastructures. Concrete is the most used construction material. To reduce the environmental impact of construction, we can use alternatives to Portland cement and recycled aggregates in concrete production. This study used non-reactive electric arc furnace slag (EAFS) and alkali-activated concrete (AASC). The goal was to reduce CO2 emissions while maintaining desired mechanical and durability properties. Tests showed that the mix designs had excellent properties. Full substitution of aggregates resulted in compressive strength of 47 MPa at 28 days, but a 6% reduction compared to AASC with natural aggregates. This pattern is repeated for other mechanical properties. Substituting all aggregates led to a 30% reduction in water absorption performance compared to AASC with natural aggregates. Choosing sustainable and eco-friendly concrete types can reduce a structure's environmental impact and carbon footprint. This is crucial for a more sustainable future.

Abstract: Biodiesel has been defined as an alternative fuel that has the potential to be used instead of diesel fuel for years. In case of complete combustion reaction in engines, the products released do not directly threaten human health. Compared to diesel fuel, biodiesel has worse combustion performance due to some fuel properties. Therefore, incomplete combustion products such as hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), smoke emission and complete combustion products such as CO2 are thrown into the atmosphere. In this study, the changes in exhaust emissions of 50 ppm and 75 ppm Ag2O NPs were experimentally examined to improve the adverse combustion performance and emission characteristics of cottonseed oil methyl ester. In experiments, nano additive improved the thermal conductivity, mass dissipation and heat transfer of the test fuels, and resulted in reducing of CO emissions as it provided a higher oxidation rate of hydrocarbon molecules. Due to the improvement in the combustion reaction, CO2 emission increased with product of complete combustion. The increase in CO2 emissions was 3.17% and 3.97% for CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels, respectively, when compared to C0 fuel at 40 Nm load. The NPs additive increased the lower calorific value of the fuel and cylinder temperature. This situation caused increase of NOx emissions by 3.69% and 7.47% CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels 40 Nm load. Adding of NPs in base fuel reduced to viscosity and density provided better atomization. So a reduction in smoke emission was obtained with NPs addition by 35.09% and 47.32% in CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels, respectively, compared to C0 fuel at 10 Nm load, while 7.45% and 19.43% at 40 Nm load.

In the pursuit of sustainable mobility and the decarbonization of transport systems, public authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the impact of travel speed on emissions within both low-speed and high-speed environments. This study critically examines the evidence concerning emission impacts associated with speed limit changes in different traffic environments by conducting a systematic review of the literature in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 25 studies that met the eligibility criteria were assessed. The results reveal mixed evidence for reducing emissions through speed limit reductions in low-speed areas. However, emerging evidence suggests that reduced urban speeds may abate emissions through enhanced traffic flow and a shift in modal preferences away from personal vehicle use. Additionally, in urban areas, minor observed emission reduction per vehicle can add up to large overall reductions due to the high number of vehicles. In high-speed contexts, the evidence is much clearer, showing that reduced speed limits correlate with significant reductions in NOx, CO2, and particulate matter emissions. The extent of these reductions is highly variable and contingent upon the specific speed limits or limit reductions, the local context, the vehicle type, and the baseline types and levels of pollutants. Notably, there is a lack of research on the effects of speed on emissions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), highlighting a critical area for future investigation. The findings of this study underscore the potential environmental benefits of speed management policies and advocate for the promotion of smoother and less aggressive driving behavior to mitigate emissions and enhance sustainable mobility in both low-speed and high-speed settings.

This study explores the impact of technological change and renewable energy adoption on Mexico's economy using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. As global concerns about climate change intensify, reducing carbon emissions has become a priority, but traditional CGE models often predict significant economic costs associated with fossil fuel restrictions. In this analysis, we modify the conventional CGE framework to incorporate increasing returns to scale and endogenously modeled technological change, reflecting the real-world diffusion of renewable energy technologies in developing countries like Mexico. By accounting for these factors, our model demonstrates that a combined policy of carbon taxation and renewable energy subsidies can achieve significant CO2 reductions without negatively impacting economic welfare. However, while the environmental benefits—such as reduced emissions of particulates, SO2, and NOx—are substantial, the overall welfare gains remain modest, and the policy's success depends on effective government implementation and potential trade impacts. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers in Mexico and other developing nations seeking to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability through strategic carbon emission reduction policies.

Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) is a widely prevalent geological resource underground, and its utilization offer significant energy conservation and emission reduction benefits, contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals. Assessing the development potential of regional SGE can ensure sustainable development of these resources and prevent adverse effects induced by overexploitation. Jiangsu Province, a developed region in the eastern coastal area of China, has a strong demand for cooling and heating in urban buildings. The primary form of utilizing SGE in this area is through vertical ground source heat pumps (VGSHP). Based on the analysis of the impact of regional geological conditions on the development of SGE, this study specifically evaluated the suitability of developing SGE through VGSHP. After excluding areas unsuitable for development, the heat exchange capacity, heating or cooling area per unit area, and energy conservation and emission reduction benefits of VGSHP were calculated. The results indicate that the area suitable and moderately suitable for developing SGE through VGSHP in Jiangsu Province amounts to 76,453 km2. The total heat exchange capacity for summer is 1.21 × 109 kW, which can provide cooling for an area of 1.21 × 1010 m2. The total heat exchange capacity for winter is 8.70 × 108 kW, which can provide heating for an area of 1.09 × 1010 m2. The annual available resource amount is 2.68 × 1012 kWh, equivalent to 3.30 × 108 tons of standard coal, and a CO2 reduction of 7.86 × 108 tons.

The development of novel materials based on renewable materials with beneficial properties that assist with energy efficiency and conservation has been encouraged by increasing consciousness of environmental issues. This research intends to use sustainable cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) obtained from oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) as reinforcement to enhance the properties of rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF). RPUF reinforcement with varied CNC concentrations (0.25–1 wt%) was examined by foaming behavior, surface morphology, mechanical properties, thermal insulation properties, dimensional stability, efficiency energy study, and CO2 reduction through their thermal conductivity values. The results achieved an optimal improvement of mechanical properties of the RPUF composite by around 23.53% compared to RPUF control, at the addition of 0.5 wt% of CNC concentration while maintaining the density of 37–39 kg/m3. Further, incorporating CNC improved thermal insulating performance by 9.95%, as reflected by decreased thermal conductivity from 0.0292 W/mK to 0.0269 W/mK and decreased cell size by 28.12%. Finally, based on the energy and cost efficiency studies, RPUF-CNC composites offer up to 0.78 kWh/m2 and 0.031 kWh/m2 compared to conventional wall materials made of concrete and wood, respectively. Furthermore, it contributed to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 110 and 7.2 kg CO2/year compared to concrete and wood, respectively. This work demonstrates the promising use of eco-friendly building insulation materials to mitigate the energy and environmental crisis.

To enhance sustainability in the construction sector and reduce CO2 emissions, low-binder concretes arise as an alternative. In this scenario, the use of limestone filler as cement replacement, which is available in a large scale, becomes a suitable alternative. This study evaluates the impact of replacing 30% and 60% of Portland cement by limestone filler on compressive strength, chlorides transport and corrosion propagation in concrete mixtures. The findings reveal that the concretes with low binder contents meet the minimum compressive strength for concrete structures recommended by Brazilian standard. Nevertheless, the reduction in Portland cement content promoted a lower concrete pH and decreased C3A content. This led to higher diffusion coefficients but did not mean a higher content of chlorides accumulated into concrete for C250, which means that, chloride diffusion coefficient needs to be analysed together with other variables and that the performance of low-binder content concretes can be equivalent or even superior in some properties.

The aim of this experiment is to explore the effect of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on methane reduction in the rumen, and its impact on anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME). Using mixed rumen fluid from four Angus cattle fistulas, this study conducted an in vitro fermentation. Adding Na2SO4 to the fermentation substrate resulted in sulfur concentrations in the substrate of 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1.0%, 1.2%, 1.4%, 1.6%, 1.8%, 2.0%, 2.2%, and 2.4%. The gas production rate and methane yield were measured using an in vitro gas production method. Subsequently, the fermentation fluid was collected to determine the fermentation parameters. The presence of ANME in the fermentation broth, as well as the relationship between the number of bacteria, archaea, sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), ANME, and the amount of Na2SO4 added to the substrate, were measured using qPCR. The results showed that: (1) the addition of Na2SO4 could significantly reduce CH4 production and was negatively correlated with CO2 production; (2) ANME-1 and ANME-2c did exist in the fermentation broth; (3) the total number of archaea, SRB, ANME-1, and ANME-2c increased with the elevation of Na2SO4. The above results indicated that Na2SO4 could mitigate methane production via sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (S-DAMO) in the rumen. In the future management of beef cattle, including sodium sulfate in their diet can stimulate S-DAMO activity, thereby promoting a reduction in methane emissions.

The rising global demand for high-purity nickel (Ni) sulphate, primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, is largely met by processing Indonesian laterite ores via hydrometallurgy. However, this supply chain is associated with significant environmental challenges and lack of transparent industrial data. This study uses a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use associated with the production of mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) from low-grade Indonesian laterites via high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL), which is then refined in China for the production of battery-grade nickel sulphate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O, NSH). Fifteen impact categories are analyzed using established impact assessment and allocation (mass and economic) methods. The analysis reveals that feed preparation/HPAL and purification are the stages that contribute most to environmental impacts and in particular to global warming potential (GWP). Mass allocation results in higher environmental impacts, with 36.8 kg CO2-eq per 1 kg of Ni in NSH for GWP, compared to 33.8 kg CO2-eq per 1 kg of Ni in NSH when economic allocation is used. Sensitivity analysis shows a potential reduction (up to 13 %) in key impact categories if production of NSH is fully integrated in Indonesia or a greener electricity mix is used. Overall, our results indicate that the production of MHP in Indonesia and its refinement to NSH in China has a GWP about two times higher than the global average. Given the limited number of LCA studies for the production of battery-grade nickel, this study highlights major environmental concerns for the NSH production process from Indonesian laterites and identifies opportunities for improvement, towards a more sustainable global battery supply chain.

International shipping has extended its decarbonization strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond onboard CO2 emissions. Onboard carbon capture and storage systems are being investigated as a potential solution for fossil-fueled ships, however there is a lack of knowledge on the reduction of well-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions that could be enabled. Considering the ambitious emission reduction targets, this may lead to inaccurate estimations of the future fuel mix in the maritime sector and the market share of marine engines. This study defines nine ship propulsion scenarios based on combinations of fossil fuels and marine engines. To better understand the greenhouse gas emission reduction of onboard carbon capture, this study calculates the well-to-wake greenhouse gas intensity of each scenario with and without onboard carbon capture and storage from the ship's main engine(s). Deploying onboard carbon capture and storage systems notably reduces the tank-to-wake greenhouse gas intensity (54–68 % depending on the scenario). Contrary to onboard emissions, oil-fueled ships with onboard carbon capture and storage are found to be less greenhouse gas intensive and more cost-effective than LNG-fueled ships. The four-stroke oil-fueled engine achieves the lowest well-to-wake greenhouse gas intensity of 38.31 gCO2eq/MJ, while the four-stroke LNG-fueled engine has the highest intensity of 50.34 gCO2eq/MJ. The greenhouse gas emission levels enabled by onboard carbon capture from the main engine would allow fossil-fueled ships to comply with the FuelEU Maritime greenhouse gas intensity requirement until 2044. To be compliant in subsequent periods, onboard carbon capture and storage systems will need to consider carbon capture from the auxiliary boiler and generator and higher capture rate, as well as measures to reduce upstream emissions from fossil fuel production and transport.

This paper examines the impact of ten microeconomic factors on hotel business success. This research encompassed a sample of 115 small, family-operated hotels situated in rural regions of the Western Balkan countries (WBC). This research was based on the assumption that factors such as the size of the hotel, age, solvency, liquidity, labour productivity, capital productivity, CSR, and reduction of CO2 emissions exhibit a positive influence on business success, whereas leverage, indebtedness, and energy consumption have a negative effect on the business success of hotels. The findings revealed that business success from the previous period, size, liquidity, and CSR exhibit a positive influence on business success, whereas leverage, capital productivity, and indebtedness demonstrate a negative effect. Conversely, the age of the hotel and labour productivity were not found to significantly influence business success, as did energy consumption. In the context of sustainable development, a positive CSR impact means that tourists value this behaviour of the hotel, while a lack of a statistically significant impact of energy consumption implies either that hotels do not implement efficient measures of energy efficiency or that energy efficiency may not be a crucial factor in attracting guests or influencing their loyalty. The findings also show that labour productivity expressed conventionally does not have a statistically significant impact on hotel business success. However, when expressed in a way that respects the concept of sustainable development and CSR, workforce productivity is a significant factor in hotel business success. Due to the problem of multicollinearity, the influence of CO2 emissions was not examined. The findings suggest the following two groups of key measures: 1. Policymakers must work on ensuring more favourable conditions under which hotels can borrow, as well as on ensuring adequate infrastructure; 2. They must work on improving the strategy for maintaining liquidity to avoid the high costs of short-term loans and increasing size in order to further utilise economies of scale. These two microeconomic factors have the greatest impact on the business success of hotels.

The development of new building elements, such as concrete and mortar with sustainable materials, which produce a lower carbon footprint, is an achievable milestone in the short term. The need to reduce the environmental impact of the production of cement-based materials is of vital importance. This work focuses on the evaluation of the life-cycle assessment, production costs, mechanical performance, and durability of three mortars and three concrete mixtures in which mixed recycled aggregates (MRAs) and biomass bottom ash from olive waste (oBBA) were included to replace cement and aggregates. Powdered MRA and oBBA were also applied as complementary cementitious materials with a reduced environmental footprint. Chemical and physical tests were performed on the materials, and mechanical performance properties, life-cycle assessment, and life-cycle cost analysis were applied to demonstrate the technical and environmental benefits of using these materials in mortar and concrete mixtures. This research showed that the application of MRA and oBBA produced a small reduction in mechanical strength but a significant benefit in terms of life-cycle population and environmental costs. The results demonstrated that finding long-term mechanical strength decreases between 2.7% and 14% for mortar mixes and between 1.7% and 10.4% for concrete mixes. Although there were small reductions in mechanical performance, the savings in environmental and monetary terms make the feasibility of manufacturing these cement-based materials feasible and interesting for both society and the business world. CO2 emissions are reduced by 25% for mortar mixes and 12% for concrete mixes with recycled materials, and it is possible to reduce the cost per cubic meter of mortar production by 20%, and the savings in the cost of production of a cubic meter of concrete is 13.8%.

ABSTRACT Talinum fruticosum is a species confirmed to occur in the semi-arid region, considered an unconventional food plant with a high protein content and tolerant to temporary periods of water restriction. This study aimed to evaluate water deficit as a strategy for growing Talinum fruticosum, covering physiological and biochemical aspects. The experimental design adopted was entirely randomized, using six treatments and eight replications. The treatments were defined as water availability (WA) 0 (no water replenishment), 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%, conducted in a greenhouse, with water replenishment every 7 days. After 21 days, the centesimal composition, water relations, gas exchange, and biochemical aspects were evaluated. The energy value of the dry biomass of T. fruticosum leaves was directly influenced by the water content in the soil, and the water deficit led to an increase in protein. Water restriction compromised the species' water status and performance, mainly limiting gas exchange by reducing the water content in the soil, compromising CO2 gain. It also led to increased biomolecules, with the highest contents seen in the treatments without water replacement (0%) and for 20% WA. Therefore, reducing the WA to 40% could be a strategy adopted to increase the protein content in the leaves of T. fruticosum, promoting an increase in the centesimal composition of proteins, a reduction in gas exchange, and an increase in the content of biomolecules.

The multi‐carbon (C2+) alcohols produced by electrochemical CO2 reduction, such as ethanol and n‐propanol, are considered as indispensable liquid energy carriers. In most C–C coupling cases, however, the concomitant gaseous C2H4 product results in the low selectivity of C2+ alcohols. Here, we report rational construction of mesostructured CuO electrocatalysts, specifically mesoporous CuO (m‐CuO) and cylindrical CuO (c‐CuO), enables selective distribution of C2+ products. The m‐CuO and c‐CuO showed similar selectivity towards total C2+ products (≥76%), but the corresponding predominant products were C2+ alcohols (55%) and C2H4 (52%), respectively. The ordered mesostructure not only induced the surface hydrophobicity, but selectively tailored the adsorption configuration of *CO intermediate: m‐CuO preferred bridged adsorption, whereas c‐CuO favored top adsorption as revealed by in situ spectroscopies. Computational calculations unraveled that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo the favorable conventional C–C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.

Computational calculations unraveled that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo the favorable conventional C–C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.

ABSTRACT Arugula is a vegetable with considerable prominence in the commercial sector, so knowing the ideal dose of fertigation and the effects of soil salinity on its agronomic characteristics is essential for good production. The aim of the study was to evaluate the morphological and physiological aspects of arugula, cultivar Broadleaf, at different levels of soil salinity and doses of fertilization via fertigation. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during two consecutive growing cycles, from May to June and from July to August 2021. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, arranged in a 4 x 3 factorial scheme, with four replicates. Treatments consisted of four levels of electrical conductivity of the saturated extract (ECse = 0.57, 1.3, 2.3, and 3.3 dS m-1) and three doses of fertilization via fertigation (F1= 100%, F2= 50%, and F3= 25% of the recommended NPK doses). The variables analyzed were: plant height (cm), number of leaves, leaf area (m2 plant-1), shoot fresh mass and shoot dry mass (g plant-1), leaf water percentage, SPAD, and gas exchange (photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and internal CO2 concentration). There was a reduction in arugula growth in soil with ECse above 2.1 dS m-1. Fertigation using the full dose of fertilizer recommended for arugula cultivation proved to be an effective strategy for increasing both biomass production and physiological activity.

A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted for 36 days to study the effect of pigeon pea biochar (PPB) and wood biochar (WB) on carbon mineralization of native soil organic carbon (SOC) and municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) applied to soil. The MSWC addition enhanced soil respiration by 2-fold (231 mg C kg-1 soil) over the control (118 mg C kg-1 soil). The PPB addition significantly (P < 0.05) increased cumulative loss of carbon as CO2, whereas WB significantly decreased the cumulative loss of C over control. Addition of PPB at 5% and 10% levels increased SOC mineralization (positive priming) +22.9% and +31.2%, respectively; whereas reduction in SOC mineralization (negative priming) was noticed in WB (5% and 10%) treated soils by -3.1% and -21.7%, respectively. Similarly, WB induced strong negative priming effects (-21.9% and -29.5%), while PPB caused a weak positive priming effect (+3.0% and +11.6%) at 5% and 10% levels on mineralization of added labile carbon substrate (MSWC), respectively. Results indicate the hardwood (Prosopis juliflora) biochar exhibits refractory properties that inhibit mineralization of both native SOC and applied organic compost (MSWC), and thereby it can be used as an amendment to stabilize native and applied organic matter in soil, which may significantly contribute to soil carbon sequestration.

The linear nature of the current plastics economy and increasing demand for polymers poses a pressing global problem. In this work, we explore the environmental and economic performance of a circular alternative for polymer production through chemical plastic recycling following the waste-to-methanol-to-olefins (WMO) route. We assess the life-cycle environmental impacts and techno-economic feasibility of this novel circular production route (CPR) in 2020 and 2050, and compare them to the existing linear production route (LPR), deploying naphtha steam cracking for olefin production, and a mix of landfill and incineration as end-of-life treatment. Our results showcase that CPR could enable significant impact reductions, notably in 2050 assuming a low-carbon electricity mix based on renewables. However, the shift from linear to circular comes with burden-shifting, increasing the impacts relative to LPR on five environmental indicators in 2020 (i.e., terrestrial and freshwater eutrophication, particulate matter formation, acidification, and metal/mineral resources use). From the techno-economic viewpoint, we found that ethylene from waste polymers could become competitive with fossil ethylene when deployed at large scale. Moreover, it is significantly cheaper than its green analogs, which deploy methanol-to-olefins with green methanol from captured CO2 and electrolytic H2, showcasing the potential of implementing high-readiness level technologies to close the loop for polymers.

The fast fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment at every stage of the product life cycle. There is a lack of research in the literature on the impact of fast fashion on the environment through logistics and transport. In this area, the greatest environmental impact is caused by air emissions, which is very important from the point of view of climate change. Therefore, this article deals with the analysis of the carbon footprint resulting from the fast fashion logistics process. The identification and assessment of fast fashion companies&#039; sustainability efforts in the area of transport-related emissions and sustainable transformation strategies was conducted using a case study method for selected brands (H&amp;M Group; Inditex, Shein). The study uses secondary data available in non-financial reports from 2023. After analyzing the data and content in non-financial reports on transport-related emissions, sev-eral important conclusions emerge. As a dominant practice, companies emphasize their reliance on external frameworks and standards, in particular the Global Reporting Initiative and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Companies prioritize reducing emissions from significant factors, such as production processes. The data disclosed in the reports (scope 1, 2, 3) are not clearly formulated, but they can be used to calculate the level of CO2 emission reduction/increase. The ar-ticle contains recommendations for companies to improve their reporting by including additional indicators expressing the efficiency of transport-related emissions.

Importance Impaired exercise capacity is a cardinal manifestation of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Aficamten Compared to Placebo in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive HCM (SEQUOIA-HCM) is a pivotal study characterizing the treatment effect of aficamten, a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, on a comprehensive set of exercise performance and clinical measures. Objective To evaluate the effect of aficamten on exercise performance using cardiopulmonary exercise testing with a novel integrated measure of maximal and submaximal exercise performance and evaluate other exercise measures and clinical correlates. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a prespecified analysis from SEQUOIA-HCM, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Patients were recruited from 101 sites in 14 countries (North America, Europe, Israel, and China). Individuals with symptomatic obstructive HCM with objective exertional intolerance (peak oxygen uptake [pVO 2 ] ≤90% predicted) were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from January to March 2024. Interventions Randomized 1:1 to aficamten (5-20 mg daily) or matching placebo for 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 24 in integrated exercise performance, defined as the 2-component z score of pVO 2 and ventilatory efficiency throughout exercise (minute ventilation [VE]/carbon dioxide output [VCO 2 ] slope). Response rates for achieving clinically meaningful thresholds for change in pVO 2 and correlations with clinical measures of treatment effect (health status, echocardiographic/cardiac biomarkers) were also assessed. Results Among 282 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [12.9] years; 115 female [40.8%], 167 male [59.2%]), 263 (93.3%) had core laboratory–validated exercise testing at baseline and week 24. Integrated composite exercise performance improved in the aficamten group (mean [SD] z score, 0.17 [0.51]) from baseline to week 24, whereas the placebo group deteriorated (mean [SD] z score, −0.19 [0.45]), yielding a placebo-corrected improvement of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.25-0.46; P &amp;lt;.001). Further, aficamten treatment demonstrated significant improvements in total workload, circulatory power, exercise duration, heart rate reserve, peak heart rate, ventilatory efficiency, ventilatory power, and anaerobic threshold (all P &amp;lt;.001). In the aficamten group, large improvements (≥3.0 mL/kg per minute) in pVO 2 were more common than large reductions (32% and 2%, respectively) compared with placebo (16% and 11%, respectively). Improvements in both components of the primary outcome, pVO 2 and VE/VCO 2 slope throughout exercise, were significantly correlated with improvements in symptom burden and hemodynamics (all P &amp;lt;.05). Conclusions and Relevance This prespecified analysis of the SEQUOIA-HCM randomized clinical trial found that aficamten treatment improved a broad range of exercise performance measures. These findings offer valuable insight into the therapeutic effects of aficamten. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05186818

Most state-of-the-art electric space propulsion systems, such as gridded and Hall effect thrusters, use xenon as the propellant gas. However, xenon is very rare and expensive to produce, and it is used in a number of competing industrial applications. Iodine is emerging as an attractive alternative to xenon in several electric propulsion technologies. Its lower cost and larger availability, solid state at standard temperature and pressure, its low vapor pressure and its low ionization potential make it an attractive option. Attempts to implement an alternative to xenon propellants (Iodine, O2 , N2 , H2 , CO2 etc) in conventional propulsion systems have been met with measured success. However, the use of chemically reactive species, such as O2, H2, or iodine, requires the chosen propulsion platform to be chemically compatible with the propellant. Significant reductions in the operational lifetime of the thruster because of chemical incompatibility negates any potential increase in thruster performance or propellant availability. Thus, careful material selection for the electric propulsion system itself and for the components employed on the satellite is required in the light of a typical space mission duration of several years. Due to the more complex reaction processes and energy loss channels in iodine plasma´s however, as well as the historical lack of reliable collision cross-section data, the development of accurate theoretical and numerical models has been hindered. The development of techniques that can be applied to chemically dissimilar propellants, focusing on electromagnetic behaviour, would represent a significant improvement in the state of discharge characterization and thruster analysis. In this work, we conducted a comparative analysis of the existing modeling results for various types of electric propulsion using iodine as a propellant gas, as well as the results of experiments with iodine plasma with an emphasis on the thrust-to-power ratio.

Melatonin (MT) is a multifunctional hormone that enhances crop resilience against various abiotic stresses. However, its regulatory mechanism of osmotic tolerance in forage oats (Avena sativa) plants under water-limited scenarios is still unclear. This study aimed to delineate the impact of MT pretreatment on the morphological, physiological, and biochemical functions of oat seedlings under osmotic stress. Our findings demonstrated that exogenous treatment of MT noticeably elevated leaf area while decreasing the root/shoot ratio of oat seedlings subjected to osmotic stress. Osmotic-induced 38.22% or 48.37% decrease in relative water content could be significantly alleviated by MT pretreatment on day 7 or day 14, respectively. MT treatment also significantly mitigated osmotic-induced decreases in photosynthetic parameters including net photosynthetic rate, stomatic conductance, and intercellular CO2 concentration as well as various chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, which could contribute to enhanced accumulations of free proline and soluble sugars in seedlings after being subjected to a prolonged duration of osmotic stress. Furthermore, MT markedly improved antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase along with the accumulation of ascorbic acid contributing to a significant reduction in reactive oxygen species under osmotic stress. In addition, the MT application induced a 978.12%, 33.54%, or 30.59% increase in endogenous MT, indole acetic acid, or gibberellic acid content under osmotic stress but did not affect the accumulation of abscisic acid. These findings suggest that an optimal concentration of MT (100 μmol·L−1) could relieve osmotic stress via improvement in osmotic adjustment, the enzymatic antioxidant defense system, and endogenous hormonal balance, thereby contributing to enhanced photosynthetic functions and growth of oat seedlings under water-limited conditions.

Peatland drainage is a large source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. While conversion to agriculture is widely acknowledged to lead to "irrecoverable" carbon (C) losses, in contrast the C impacts of peatland forestry are poorly understood, especially in intensively managed plantations. Losses of C from peat oxidation are highly variable and can be compensated for by gains of C in trees, depending on the lifecycle of the timber and timescale considered. Here, we used ITRAX scanning to enable rapid detection of the Hekla 4 cryptotephra layer as a reliable chronological marker above which peat properties and C stocks could be compared between open and afforested blanket bog cores in the Flow Country of Northern Scotland. At one site, Bad a' Cheò, we combine replicated core pair comparisons (n = 19) with timber extraction data to derive net ecosystem C balance over the lifetime of the plantation. Here the reduction in peat C carbon storage above Hekla 4 in afforested samples (67 t C ha−1) is only partially compensated by tree C sequestration (47 t C ha−1), leading to a net ecosystem C balance indicating a loss of 20 t C ha−1 over the 50 years since the plantation was established. At that site, ~65 % of tree C rapidly returned to the atmosphere, as it was primarily used for heat and power generation. Across the wider Flow country region, a simplified paired sampling method was adopted at eight further sites, finding a either a loss or negligible change in peat C storage above Hekla 4 in afforested samples with a mean loss of 86 t C ha−1 and median loss of 50 t C ha−1. This study suggests that potentially substantial C losses have been an unintended consequence of non-native conifer afforestation over deep blanket bogs.

Oil and gas production from very low permeability shale reservoirs became a reality in the 1990s when Mitchel Energy developed novel fracking techniques, but the road ahead was very challenging until around 2008 when oil and gas production from low permeability shale reservoirs became a significant component of total oil and gas production in the US The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that in 2023, about 3.04 billion barrels (or about 8.32 million barrels per day) of crude oil were produced directly from tight-oil resources in the United States. This was equal to about 64% of total US crude oil production in 2023. Also, the current ultimate amount of oil production from such reservoirs is in the range of 3 to 8% of the in-place oil. Furthermore, the production rates from such reservoirs decline rapidly; thus, there is a compelling need for techniques to produce at least some of the enormous amounts of the remaining reservoir oil. The classical waterflooding or gas flooding used in conventional reservoirs is not plausible in unconventional shale reservoirs because the injection fluid displacement velocities are extremely small which prohibits oil displacement through any injection-production well pattern. Therefore, creative and imaginative approaches are needed to increase oil production without relying on injecting large quantities of water or gas to produce additional incremental oil. The current techniques include two vastly different cyclic injection-production methods—known as the huff-n-puff process. The first method involves injecting either CO2 or rich gas in a multi-stage, hydraulically fractured, production well and soaking for a few days, then producing the same well which generally would yield substantially increased oil flow rates. The second method involves injecting low concentrations of aqueous solutions containing surfactants or mutual solvents. This method is also applied as a huff-n-puff process similar to the gas injection huff-n-puff process. The gas injection huff-n-puff process requires expensive high-pressure injection compressors while solvent injection huff-n-puff requires simpler and less expensive water injection pumps. The mechanism of oil mobilisation by gas injection is generally due to mass transfer across gas-oil interface by molecular diffusion resulting in oil swelling, miscibility, viscosity reduction, and favourable shift in residual oil saturation in the oil relative permeability function. On the other hand oil mobilisation by surfactant solutions or mutual solvents includes reduction of the oil-water interfacial tension in the surfactant case, wettability alteration by surfactant and mutual solvents, and shift in residual oil saturation in the relative permeability function. Additionally, using a brine containing a mutual solvent or a surfactant results in substantial additional oil recovery first by cleaning the micro- and macro-fracture flow paths in the stimulated reservoir volume followed by changes in IFT, wettability, and irreducible oil solubilisation. In this paper we will present laboratory results, mathematical modelling concepts, and field results to illustrate each of the above processes.

The current study examines the efficiency and environmental impact of a diesel engine running on neem oil biodiesel mixed with nano additions, notably Manganese oxide (MnO) and Ferric chloride (FeCl3). The study seeks to tackle the urgent problem of pollutant emissions, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx), from internal combustion engines. Biodiesel, sourced from renewable substances such as neem oil, offers a possible substitute for traditional diesel fuel. Nevertheless, the general use of this technology is impeded by difficulties such as increased NOx emissions and fuel volatility. In order to address these difficulties, this study investigates the application of nano additives to improve the efficiency of combustion and decrease emissions. Various fuel blends, such as pure diesel, neem oil biodiesel (B25), and blends of B25 with MnO and FeCl3, were used in experimental experiments. An ultrasonic aspirator was used to include 100 parts per million (ppm) of each nano ingredient into the B20 blend. The performance metrics, including engine efficiency, power output, and emissions levels of NOx, CO, HC, CO2, and particulate matter, were assessed and compared to the standard diesel fuel. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of nano additives enhances the combustion properties, resulting in decreased emissions, specifically NOx. The Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) increased for the nano-blended test fuels compared to diesel, resulting in a reduction in Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC). The BTE (Brake Thermal Efficiency) level reaches its peak when the engine is operating at maximum load using the B25 + MnO and B25 + FeCl3 fuel blend. The emissions of gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), smoke, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in nano mixed fuels are significantly lower than those produced by diesel fuel operation. The B25 + FeCl3 fuel mix has a higher emission of hydrocarbon (HC) content compared to other nano-blended fuels, but it emits less HC content than diesel fuel. The diesel and biodiesel test fuels exhibit optimal performance under load conditions of up to 50%. Diesel, B25 mix, B25 + MnO, and B25 + FeCl3 had carbon monoxide (CO) emissions ranging from 0.045 to 0.050%, whilst the other two test fuels have emissions ranging from 0.029 to 0.035%. Under a load condition of 50%, the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions for the fuel blends B25 + MnO and B25 + FeCl3 vary between 0.001% and 0.011%. The cylinder pressure and heat release rates are marginally elevated compared to those of the diesel fuel. The findings indicated that neem oil biodiesel with nano additions has the potential to be a feasible and eco-friendly substitute fuel for diesel engines.

Background: Thirty years ago, the first attempt by Saliba and colleagues was made to reduce the negative effects (hypercarbia) of exogenous surfactant (ES) by slowing its administration. Sixteen years later, we observed the first less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) attempt by Kribs and colleagues. Many studies, since that time, have tried to minimize the invasiveness of ES and subsequent cerebral blood flow perturbations through studies using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We sought to address this medical challenge by identifying a less problematic modality of ES administration by delivering multiple aliquots of ES instead of a single one, as typically performed. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a different way of administering ES using more aliquots could be a safe alternative that should be assessed in further studies. Methods: Patients between 26 + 0 and 35 + 6 weeks of gestational age (GA) requiring ES administration were enrolled (April 2023–February 2024). Differently fractioned doses were delivered according to an arbitrary standard dosage (0.3 mL per aliquot in babies < 29 weeks; 0.6 mL in babies ≥ 29 weeks), while NIRS and transcutaneous CO2 (tCO2) monitoring were always performed. ES’s effectiveness was assessed based on the reduction in the Oxygen Saturation Index (OSI) after administration. Persistent desaturation, bradycardia, and airway obstruction were defined as adverse effects and used to evaluate safety during ES administration, as well as variability in NIRS-rSO2 values and tCO2. Results: Twenty-four patients were enrolled with a median GA of 29 weeks (IQR 4.5) and BW of 1223 ± 560 g. In addition, 50% of the cohort received fewer than three aliquots, whereas the other 50% received more than three. Monitoring was started before the procedure and continued 30′ after the last ES aliquot administration. The variability in NIRS-SpO2 values was significantly higher in the group (p = 0.007) with a lower number of aliquots administered. Similarly, increased NIRS-rSO2 values (p = 0.003) and increased tCO2 levels (p = 0.005) were observed in infants who underwent an ES split after the administration of a low number of aliquots. Conclusions: Our data obtained from the group with > 3 fractionated doses of ES seem to justify the preparation of a more robust study, as the combination of reduced NIRS variability and reduced tCO2 maximum levels is consistent with more stable cerebral blood flow during the challenging time of ES administration.
