This study focused on preparation of stable polymer films of NiII‐ and CoII‐tetraaminophthalocyanines, p‐NiTAPc and p‐CoTAPc, respectively, for highly efficient heterogeneous electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction in a flow electrolysis cell. Major development represented in this work was fabrication of p‐NiTAPc and p‐CoTAPc films via electropolymerization of their corresponding monomers on carbon‐based substrates without using binder or conducting additive materials to obtain efficient gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for scalable, productive and selective CO2‐to‐CO conversion. The target polymers were characterized by UV‐visible spectrophotometry, attenuated total reflection‐Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. According to controlled potential electrolysis and gas chromatography, p‐NiTAPc‐catalyzed CO2 reduction at –0.99V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) gave 953 mL of CO in a period of 16 hours with current density and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 109±1 mA·cm‐2 and 99±2%, respectively. A p‐CoTAPc‐modified GDE exhibited superior catalytic performance to the case of p‐NiTAPc in terms of catalyst stability and CO productivity by performing the continuous CO2 reduction at the potential of –1.10 V vs. RHE for up to 41 hours and affording almost 3 times higher amount of CO with the current density of 161±5 mA/cm2 and 95±2% FE.

The urgency to mitigate environmental impacts from anthropogenic CO2 emissions has propelled extensive research efforts on CO2 reduction. The current work reports a novel approach involving transforming CO2 and ethane into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using earth‐abundant metals (Fe, Co, Ni) at 750 °C. This route facilitates long‐term carbon storage via generating high‐value CNTs and produces valuable syngas with adjustable H2/CO ratios as byproducts. Without CO2, direct pyrolysis of ethane undergoes rapid deactivation. The participation of CO2 not only enhances the durability of the catalyst, but also contributes about 30% of the CNTs production, presenting a viable solution to CO2 challenges. The CNT morphology depends on the catalyst used. Co‐ and Ni‐based catalysts produce CNT with a 20 nm diameter and micrometer length, whereas Fe‐based catalysts yield bamboo‐like structures. This work represents a pioneering effort in utilizing CO2 and ethane for CNT production with potential environmental and economic benefits.

The growing worldwide dependence on fossil fuels and the subsequent release of CO2 emissions pose substantial environmental challenges. The purpose of this review is to examine the process of electrochemical carbon reduction (ECR) and specifically investigate the use of copper-based electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 into chemically valuable substances. The synthetic methods employed for these catalysts are analyzed, along with their impact on product selectivity and the potential advantages they present. The focus of our research lies in the exploration of alloy electrocatalysts, specifically those composed of Cu-Au, Cu-Pd, and CuNi combinations. These particular combinations have demonstrated improved efficiency and selectivity in the reduction of CO2. This paper aims to assist in the design of high-performance copper catalysts and the optimization of ECR processes by providing insights into the structure–function relationships and intermediate modulation.

Tuning the activity, selectivity, and stability of electrocata­lysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is of high interest. Among the multitude of possible eCO2RR products, formic acid/formate is not only of high industrial importance but even more importantly it can be obtained at nearly 100% Faradaic efficien­cy if suitable catalysts are employed for the eCO2RR. Recently, two distinct strategies to modulate the eCO2RR over Bi‐based catalysts, namely phase modulation and functionalization with organic ligands, have come to the fore. This concept paper aims to string them toge­ther to accelerate their exploitation to design sophisticated electro­catalysts for the eCO2RR.

Abstract Hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the adsorption of metal complexes on semiconductors via anchoring groups are among notable photocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction using abundant electron donors. However, their photocatalytic activities are limited by their low adsorption amounts and strength. In this study, we demonstrate the reductive polymerization of vinyl groups in metal complexes triggered by excited electrons on semiconductors as a new immobilization method. This approach significantly enhanced the adsorption amount and durability, thus increasing the photocatalytic performance.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) generated from the consumption of fossil fuels is one of the main factors contributing to the greenhouse effect. How to mitigate the greenhouse effect and reduce the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels has become an issue worthy of study. In recent years, a technology for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to fossil fuels and chemicals has attracted a great deal of attention by providing a new way to solve this problem. This paper reviews the basic principles of three fundamental catalytic CO2 reduction, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and thermocatalysis, and two advanced catalytic modes, thermocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, derived from these three modes, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the challenges that the catalytic reduction of CO2 is currently facing are also discussed. Although this technology has made significant progress over the decades, it is still in its preliminary stage with some shortcomings and there is a long way to go before it can be applied in reality.

The study of carbon dioxide (CO2) methanation mechanisms widely argues on the nature and formation of intermediates. How reactants dissociate is still poorly understood. To gain deeper knowledge on its mechanism, we focused on studying reactants dissociation. After H2 dissociation and diffusion, the spillover H atom was observed, as well as the confirmation of H cluster formation on metal through aggregation by simulation and experiment. This H cluster facilitated C-O bond scission to easily form H ligand cobonded to metal, and thus resulted in high CO2 methanation performance. Four driving forces could dissociate CO2, three of them came from supports and metals, and another one was atomic H on metal as the strongest force. This simple and convenient method has wide adaptability and can be developed as an effective standard method for studying CO2 dissociation. The facile dissociation study of reactants would be very helpful in understanding the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism.

Background and objective: Since people spend 70-80% of their time indoors, the quality of indoor air has become a crucial factor in overall health. Therefore, poor indoor air quality can have significant adverse effects on our well-being. Common indoor air pollutants are particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Plants can remove PM and CO2 through the photosynthesis process and leaf surfaces, and regulate the temperature and humidity of the air. By analyzing the PM and CO2 reduction of four broad-leaved evergreen plants, this study aims to provide data for air purification in indoor spaces.Methods: The four different plant species (Neolitsea sericea (Blume) Koidz., Coffea arabica L., Photinia glabra(Thunb.) Franch. and Sav., and Farfugium japonicum (L.) Kitam.) were selected for this study. Mosquito coils and a CO2 cylinder were the primary sources of PM and CO2. These pollutants were injected into a closed acrylic chamber with plants, and the air quality within the chamber was monitored for a duration of five hours. The plants' effectiveness in reducing carbon dioxide was evaluated through the clean air delivery rate (CADR), while their ability to reduce PM was assessed by analyzing the PM reduction rate. Photosynthetic rates and leaf area were also measured to determine the correlation between air pollution removal and these factors.Results: The ability to remove PM and CO2 varied among plants. Plants with higher rates of photosynthesis were more effective in reducing PM and CO2 than those with lower rates. Among the four plant species, C. arabica and P. glabra were more effective in removing PM and CO2 than the other species. The chamber containing plants exhibited higher humidity and lower temperatures compared to the chamber without plants.Conclusion: These findings suggest that plants can play a significant role in improving indoor air quality. Not only do they effectively reduce levels of PM and CO2, but they also contribute to the regulation of indoor temperature and humidity. The implications of these results highlight the potential of integrating plants into indoor spaces as a natural and multifaceted solution for creating healthier and more comfortable environments.

The consumption of fossil fuels releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, causing a serious greenhouse effect. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2 to chemical fuels is an effective way to alleviate the current energy and environmental crisis. However, it is still difficult to rationally design efficient PEC CO2 reduction photocathodes. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a promising photocathode material, but its surface is susceptible to the accumulation of photogenerated electrons leading to corrosion and activity reduction, and is accompanied by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), both of which lead to the overall low conversion efficiency of CO2 reduction by Cu2O. In this study, the PEC CO2 conversion efficiency was improved by the synergistic effect of the C electron transport layer to accelerate the electron transfer to alleviate the Cu2O corrosion problem and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hydrophobic layer to inhibit the HER. The test showed that the CO yield of Cu2O/C/PTFE at the optimum potential (‐0.7 V vs. RHE) was 54.6μmol cm‐2 h‐1, which was 3.2 times higher than that of pure Cu2O. This study provides a facile strategy for constructing an efficient photocathode with great potential for CO reduction.

During the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CO2 adsorption on the catalyst’s surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal‐CO2] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO2 nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]x@TiO2), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs’ charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cux[POM]@TiO2). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO2 core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs’ surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo‐harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of CuII/I and multi‐electron CO2 reduction potentials. Photochemical CO2 reduction with Cux[POM]@TiO2 results in 30 µmol gcat.‐1 CO (79%) and 8 µmol gcat‐1 of CH4 (21%). Quasi‐in‐situ Raman study provides evidence in support of CO2 adsorption on the Cux[POM]@TiO2 surface. 13C and D2O labeling studies validates the {Cu‐[CO2]‐} adduct formation. Despite the photo‐harvesting ability of Nax[POM]@TiO2 itself, the poor CO2 adsorption ability of sodium ions highlights the crucial role of copper ion CO2 photo‐reduction. Characterization of the {M‐[η2‐CO2]‐} species via surface tuning validates the CO2 activation and photochemical reduction pathway proposed earlier.

This study introduces an innovative approach to enhance cathodic CO2 reduction on the working side by focusing on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the counter side. Maintaining an inert atmosphere on the counter side led to a significant improvement in CO faradaic efficiency from 65% to 95%. BiVO4 on FTO proved to be resistant to oxygen poisoning when used as photoanode. Additionally, investigations into the stability of [AgSePh]∞ reveal insights into its behaviour under elevated potential and surrounding electrolyte, suggesting weakening Ag-Se bonds and the release of benzeneselenol upon charge accumulation within the first 2 hours before producing CO in a stable manner for 16 hours. Overall, this research significantly contributes to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, offering innovative pathways for catalyst development and optimization.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction will be a key player in net-zero technologies, yet its industrial implementation is limited. Improvements by fine-tuning the microenvironments, electrolyte environments around the catalytic sites, have been scarce due to the interplay between electrode kinetics and transport. Here, we couple atomistic insights with continuum transport via ab-initio multiscale modeling, explicitly including electrolyte effects at all scales. The model was validated on Ag planar electrodes in several liquid electrolytes and the current dependence with voltage aligns with experimental observations. We show that a balance between CO2 diffusion and cation accumulation needs be achieved to obtain optimal rates. In ionomers, this limitation can be overcome since organic cations-based microenvironments are present at a fixed concentration, but water management becomes critical. Our approach paves the way towards rational microenvironment design in electrochemical CO2 conversion.

The escalating levels of atmospheric CO2, primarily attributed to human activities, underscore the urgent need for innovative solutions to mitigate environmental challenges. This study delves into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 as a promising avenue for sustainable carbon capture and utilization. Focused on the formation of formate (HCOO−/HCOOH), a high-value product, the research explores the integration of nonthermal plasma (NTP) with electrochemical processes—an approach rarely studied in existing literature. A comprehensive investigation involves varying parameters such as plasma discharging voltage, carrier gas, discharging mode, electrolysis voltage, polarity, and plasma type. The electrochemical tests employ a 10 wt.% Pd/C catalyst, and formate production is quantitatively analyzed using NMR. Results reveal that NTP significantly enhances CO2 reduction, with key factors influencing formate yield elucidated. The study reveals the complexity of CO2 electrochemical reduction, providing novel insights into the synergistic effects of NTP. These findings contribute to advancing sustainable technologies for CO2 utilization, paving the way for more efficient and environmentally friendly processes in the pursuit of a carbon-neutral future.

Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are technologies sought to reduce the level of CO2 in the atmosphere. Industrial carbon capture is associated with energetic penalty, thus there is an opportunity to research alternatives. In this work, spectroelectrochemistry was used to analyze the electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) in CO2 saturated monoethanolamine (MEA)-based capture solutions, in a novel CCU process. The in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy experiments show that at the Bi catalyst, the active species involved in the eCO2R is the dissolved CO2 in solution, and not carbamate. In addition, the products of eCO2R were evaluated under flow, using commercial Bi2O3 NP as catalyst. Formate and acetate were detected, with normalized FE for acetate up to 14.5%, a remarkable result, considering the catalyst used. Acetate is formed either in the presence of cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactant or at higher current density (> -100 mA cm-2) and the results enabled the proposition of a pathway for its production. This work sheds light on the complex reaction environment of a capture medium electrolyte and is thus relevant for an improved understanding of the conversion of CO2 into value-added products and to evaluate the feasibility of a combined CCU approach.

With high atomic utilization and remarkable catalytic activity, Cu-N-C type catalysts display great potential for electro-catalysis in CO2 reduction. However, the relationship between the active moiety and catalytic activity of generating high-value C2 products is still unclear, and the explicit screening criteria is scarcity. Herein, based on the first-principle simulation, the structure-performance relationship on Cu-N-C type catalysts has been investigated by modulating the CO2 reduction process as the number of Cu atom (Cu1, Cu2, Cu3) and the ligand environment (B, C, N, O, P, S) changed. We find the adsorption strength of intermediate *CO strongly affect the possibility of C-C coupling, which can be determined by Bader charge on Cu atom, mainly depending on the number of loaded atomic Cu on Cu-N-C catalysts. Furthermore, the Bader charge can be refined by adjusting the coordination atom of Cu, thus optimizing catalytic activity for the CO2 to ethanol. The moderate Bader charge value, between +0.35 and +0.45, enables the catalyst to behave as a potentially excellent activity with low limiting potential for generating ethanol. More importantly, an intrinsic descriptor, composed of the radius, electronegativity, and number of valence electrons of coordination atoms (φ=∑χ∑r⁎∑np), was established to characterize the catalytic activity of Cu-N(X)-C catalysts for producing ethanol. Two excellent catalysts, Cu3-N2O2 (-0.51 V) and Cu3-N3S (-0.64 V), are screened out for the CO2RR to generate ethanol. This work discloses theoretical basis for catalytic selectivity of C2 products on Cu-N-C catalysts and provides a regulating and screening principle for high performance catalysts to ethanol.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2R) is a promising approach for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels using renewable energy sources. We investigated the mechanism of eCO2R for a small Cu8 cluster placed on SnO2 containing O vacancies using density functional theory and predicted current density and selectivity by microkinetics simulations within the computational hydrogen electrode model. Low and high H coverages were modeled by Cu8/SnO2-x and Cu8H6/SnO2-x models, using statistical methods to identify their most stable structures. Different CO2 adsorption modes on Cu8/SnO2-x and Cu8H6/SnO2-x surface models, all containing an O vacancy, resulted in distinct reaction pathways, leading to either HCOOH or CO. The preferred formation of HCOOH occurred upon CO2 adsorption on an O vacancy on the Cu8H6/SnO2-x surface, followed by sequential hydrogenation to HCOO and HCOOH. Adsorption of CO2 on Cu8/SnO2-x opened a facile pathway to CO. Electronic structure analysis revealed that differences in charge donation of Cu to the antibonding orbitals of CO2 can explain the predicted selectivity differences. The preferred adsorption mode of CO2 is bidentate at the Cu-SnO2-x interface. Our findings emphasize the role of H coverage on Cu on the selectivity of eCO2R for Cu/SnOx catalysts.

Abstract Advanced photocatalysts are highly desired to activate the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with low concentration. Herein, the NiSn(OH)6 with rich surface lattice hydroxyls was synthesized to boost the activity directly under the natural air. Results showed that terminal Ni-OH could serve as donors to feed protons and generate oxygen vacancies (VO), thus beneficial to convert the activated CO2 (HCO3-) mainly into CO (5.60 μmol/g) in the atmosphere. It was flexible and widely applicable for a stable CO2RR from high pure to air level free of additionally adding H2O reactant, and higher than the traditional gas-liquid-solid (1.58 μmol/g) and gas-solid (4.07 μmol/g) reaction system both using high pure CO2 and plenty of H2O. The strong hydrophilia by the rich surface hydroxyls allowed robust H2O molecule adsorption and dissociation at VO sites to achieve the Ni-OH regeneration, leading to a stable CO yield (11.61 μmol/g) with the enriched renewable VO regardless of the poor CO2 and H2O in air. This work opens up new possibilities for the practical application of natural photosynthesis.

The ATR-SEIRAS (attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy) activity of electrodeposited Cu nanoparticles on indium tin oxide (ITO)-modified Si internal reflection elements is reported. The solution in the cell is easily, and repeatedly, exchanged between a copper deposition bath and a solution containing 4-methoxypyridine through the use of a flow-through spectroelectrochemical cell. 4-methoxypyridine is a convenient SEIRAS probe molecule exhibiting potential dependent adsorption/desorption on the copper surface. Successive amounts of copper are deposited and then evaluated for electrochemical SEIRAS activity without the need to expose the Cu surface to ambient conditions. It is found that copper deposition charge densities of approximately 60 mC cm-2 exhibit the largest amplitude and most symmetric IR absorption peaks of the investigated electrodeposition conditions. SEM images of the different Cu charge density films are correlated with the SEIRAS results and establish that close-packed two-dimensional, percolated arrays of oblate, ellipsoidal Cu nanoparticles are responsible for ideal SEIRAS performance and three-dimensional aggregates of larger particles should be avoided. Textured films of Cu nanoparticles are used to determine the adsorbed species present on the copper surface during CO2 electroreduction at low overpotentials. Evidence of adsorbed CO and COH is found at lower overpotentials than those described in previous reports.

The introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) into photocatalysts has proven to be a successful tactic to boost CO2 reduction. However, the challenge lies in acquiring OV sites that are stable in the long term, highly dispersed, and tunable in concentration. Herein, an innovative configuration, referred to as N-Bi(3+x)+--OV, was developed for the model semiconductor Bi2O2CO3 via an in situ anion doping approach. The structure enables the synthetic photocatalyst to exhibit superb CO2 photoreduction performance, with approximately 100% CO selectivity and remarkable long-term stability. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that replacing O2- with N3- uniformly in the [Bi2O2]2+ structural unit increases the chemical valence of Bi, elongates nearby Bi─O bonds, releases lattice O, improves CO2 absorption, and decreases the energy barrier for the formation of the critical intermediate *COOH. This study offers new insights and potential opportunities for the development of reliable defect-type semiconductors and their catalytic applications.

Carbon dioxide-expanded liquids, organic solvents with high concentrations of soluble carbon dioxide (CO2) at mild pressures, have gained attention as green catalytic media due to their improved properties over traditional solvents. More recently, carbon dioxide-expanded electrolytes (CXEs) have demonstrated improved reaction rates in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, by increasing the rate of delivery of CO2 to the electrode while maintaining facile charge transport. However, recent studies indicate that the limiting behavior of CXEs at higher CO2 pressures is a decline in solution conductivity due to reduced polarity, leading to poorer charge screening and greater ion pairing. In this article, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the energetic driving forces behind the diffusive properties of an acetonitrile and tetrapropylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TPrAPF6) CXE with increasing CO2 concentration. Our results indicate that entropy drives solvent and electrolyte diffusion with increasing CO2 pressure. The activation energy of ion diffusion increases with higher concentrations of CO2, indicating that increasing the temperature may improve solution conductivity in these systems. This trend in the activation energies is traced to stronger cation–anion Coulombic interactions due to weaker solvent screening at high CO2 concentrations, suggesting that the choice of ion may provide a route to diminish this effect.

Coupling renewable electricity to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) electrochemically into carbon feedstocks offers a promising pathway to produce chemical fuels sustainably. While there has been success in developing materials and theory for CO2 reduction, the widespread deployment of CO2 electrolyzers has been hindered by challenges in the reactor design and operational stability due to CO2 crossover and (bi)carbonate salt precipitation. Herein, we design asymmetrical bipolar membranes assembled into a zero-gap CO2 electrolyzer fed with pure water, solving both challenges. By investigating and optimizing the anion-exchange-layer thickness, cathode differential pressure, and cell temperature, the forward-bias bipolar membrane CO2 electrolyzer achieves a CO faradic efficiency over 80% with a partial current density over 200 mA cm–2 at less than 3.0 V with negligible CO2 crossover. In addition, this electrolyzer achieves 0.61 and 2.1 mV h–1 decay rates at 150 and 300 mA cm–2 for 200 and 100 h, respectively. Postmortem analysis indicates that the deterioration of catalyst/polymer–electrolyte interfaces resulted from catalyst structural change, and ionomer degradation at reductive potential shows the decay mechanism. All these results point to the future research direction and show a promising pathway to deploy CO2 electrolyzers at scale for industrial applications.

This study aimed to investigate the supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) drying of cod (Gadus spp.) by developing and optimizing a general mathematical drying model. We applied a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) considering the time (180–360 min), temperature (35–45 °C), and CO2 flow rate (15–25 kg/h) as independent factors, aiming at the reduction of moisture and water activity (aw) of Gadus morhua. Time and flow rate (FR) were the main factors affecting the moisture and aw responses. The mathematical models developed were validated with the accuracy and bias factors and generalized using Gadus chalcogrammus samples, resulting in the acceptable range of 1.003–1.121. The optimal parameter values for drying performance were 312.38 min, 45.38 °C, and 27.4 kg/h (R2 = 0.999). Our results suggest a promising application of SC-CO2 as a fish drying technology, describing a generalist-validated and optimized SC-CO2 drying model for Gadus spp. The present study collaborates with understanding supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) as an innovative fish drying technology at a laboratory scale. The optimal variables that were effective in reducing cod fillets water content were 312.38 min, 45.38 °C, and 27.4 kg/h, in which 26.4% moisture and 0.815 aw were predicted. Therefore, SC-CO2 is suggested to be a promising non-thermal food drying technology applied to fish products.

The reduction of carbon dioxide to valuable chemical products is a promising solution to address carbon balance and energy issues. Herein, amorphous nitrided copper-iron oxides are prepared by gas-phase nitriding of CuFe-layered double hydroxide precursors with urea as nitrogen source. Amorphous materials are more likely to generate defect vacancies during the reaction process, and these vacancies can function as active sites for catalytic reactions. Therefore, the obtained materials show high activity for CO2 electroreduction to methane and formic acid, achieving a total Faraday efficiency of 74.7% at −0.7 V vs RHE and exhibiting a continuous 10 h durability in the H-cell. The uniformly distributed Cu+ sites act as active sites by losing electrons to activate CO2. During the CO2 electroreduction, CO2 is converted to *COOH via proton-electron coupling, *COOH combines directly with a proton in solution to produce the HCOOH product, and the other part of *COOH undergoes a protonated dehydration process to form the *CHO intermediate which dehydrates again to form CH4. This study provides a new approach for designing CO2 electroreduction catalysts.

Gas adsorption on the surface of nanoporous rocks is an important process that occurs in many applied scenarios such as shale gas production or CO2 enhanced gas recovery or storage. However, a systematic investigation of the impact of gas adsorption on gas flow and permeability is still lacking. In this paper, permeability of four adsorptive gases, i.e., nitrogen, argon, methane, and carbon dioxide, was measured, along with helium permeability, for two nanoporous rock samples that have high and low total organic carbon (TOC) content, respectively. The measurements were conducted at a range of pore pressures from 150-1500 psi. Gas adsorption isotherms were also measured at the same conditions. A mathematical model that considers adsorption with specific boundary conditions for the experimental setup was used for data analysis. The results show that gas adsorption causes larger drop in pressure decay and greater retardation in pressure equilibrium. However, the reduction of permeability relative to helium is similar for gases with different levels of adsorption, indicating the occurrence of single-layer adsorption for these gases. Comparison between the two samples further supports the concept of single-layer adsorption and signifies the impact of pore size on the permeability reduction due to adsorption. These findings deepen the understanding and provide important clarification on the effect of gas adsorption on gas flow and permeability in nanoporous rocks.

Gas hydrates represent an attractive opportunity for gas storage. These ice-like structures can be produced both for the final disposal of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the solid form and for the storage of energy gases, such as methane, propane, and others, with the possibility of reaching energy densities comparable with those of pressurised vessels, but at lower pressures. In addition, gas hydrates can be directly produced for their capability to act as phase change materials at temperatures higher than 0 °C. This research deals with cold energy storage via the production of gas hydrate into a lab-scale apparatus. Hydrates were produced with pure carbon dioxide and with CO2/N2 mixtures (70/30 and 50/50 vol%). For each mixture, the amount of energy spent for hydrates production and cold energy stored were calculated, and the results were compared among each other. The addition of nitrogen to the system allowed us to maximise the energy stored/energy spent ratio, which passed from 78.06% to 109.04%; however, due to its molecular size and the consequent impossibility to stabilise the occupied water cages, nitrogen caused a reduction in the total quantity of hydrates produced, which was obviously proportional to the energy stored. Therefore, the concentration of nitrogen in the mixtures need to be carefully determined in order to optimise the Estored/Espent ratio.

As the world's largest emitter of carbon, China is actively addressing climate change responsibly and aims to achieve the most significant reduction in carbon emission intensity globally within approximately 30 years. With the transition to a new low-carbon environment, Chinese enterprises must take a more proactive role in embracing carbon neutrality as a social responsibility. How to supplement the green transformation funds that have not yet been covered by green finance has become an important issue related to Chinese enterprises achieving sustainable development and promoting high-quality development. This study, leveraging hand-collected data on companies' carbon emissions from 2005 to 2022, using the fixed effects model,provides a systematic investigation of the role of trade credit embedded within the supply chain in propelling the green evolution of Chinese companies and diminishing their carbon dioxide emissions. It reveals that trade credit substantially reduces CO2 emissions for Chinese businesses while also amplifying their intention to greener practices, their investment capacity for green transformation, and the caliber of their green outputs. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the acquisition of trade credit exhibits more suppressive influences on carbon emissions for heavy-polluting enterprises, private enterprises, low-supplier concentration enterprises, and mature enterprises. Similarly, the supply of trade credit notably curtails the carbon emissions for non-heavy polluting enterprises, state-owned enterprises, low-medium customer concentration enterprises, and mature enterprises. The empirical findings of this study contribute to reconciling the substantial dilemma between corporate goals for energy conservation, emissions reduction, and production growth, which offers key insights to support businesses in achieving a gentle transition towards energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint in line with the overarching trend of sustainable and low-carbon economic progress.

The steel industry in Brazil is responsible for around 5% of total carbon dioxide emissions, releasing around 1.85 tons of CO2 for every ton of steel produced. The use of charcoal in self-reducing iron ore briquettes can be an alternative to reduce fossil fuel consumption and reduce carbon emissions in the primary steelmaking industry, however, the particle size can affect the reduction process. This study aims to analyze the reduction kinetics of charcoal briquettes in three particle size ranges. To this end, the charcoal was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis to determine the contents of fixed carbon, ash and volatiles, analysis of sulphur in the charcoal by combustion in a tube furnace, determination of particle size by laser granulometer, elemental chemical analysis of the charcoal ash by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The briquettes were reduced in a thermogravimetric balance to 1100 °C with heating rates between 10 and 40 °C/min. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction. Finally, a kinetic study was carried out using the Coats-Redfern method. In all the briquettes, the controlling mechanism was diffusion. In the mixture with fines, the activation energy ranged from 31.95 to 33.72 kJ/mol and 120.29 to 137.17 kJ/mol. For the mixture with medium grain size, the activation energy ranged from 58.1 to 89.42 kJ/mol and 107.83 to 153.50 kJ/mol. X-ray diffraction revealed phases of hematite and magnetite at 800 °C, while at 900 °C phases of wustite and faialite and metallic iron were identified.

This study comprehensively evaluates the efficacy of solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations taking into account key metrics such as annual EV charging capacity, monthly fluctuations in energy generation, investment costs, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions achievable. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13, this novel case work employs a comparative modeling approach to evaluate and optimize the performance of copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar panels based on performance ratio (PR), panel sizing and unused energy metrics across six diverse Indian cities. The result data revealed that the 8.1 kWp system for both CIGS and CdTe achieved peak PR while concurrently registering the least energy deficit due to wasted power across all investigated locations. On a monthly basis, CIGS panels produced an average of 1242.6 kWh during the summer months, surpassing the CdTe panels by a 1.50% relative increase in energy output. Annual analysis of energy production revealed that the CIGS modules in Kochi generated 13,163 kWh, surpassing CdTe by 2.7%. This translates to a potential charging capacity of 438 EVs for CIGS, highlighting the critical role of module selection in maximizing fleet electrification efficiency. As for carbon-footprint, about 8150 kg per year of CO2 emissions can be reduced on using CIGS modules. Economic evaluation of EV charging infrastructure revealed that the installation cost per kilometer for CIGS modules stands at ₹ 3.95, which is 3.8% and 7.7% lower per kilometer incurred with CdTe modules and traditional gasoline stations.

Achieving the objective of "peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality" in the new stage of development will require the synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction. In the new stage of development, achieving the goal of "peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality" will necessitate the synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction. This study assesses the degree to which pollution reduction and carbon reduction have a synergistic effect using the coupling coordination model, and uses the fixed effect model, the dynamic panel GMM model, the OLS model and the threshold effect model to examine how green process innovation affects pollutant reduction and carbon reduction synergistically, including direct, heterogeneous, and nonlinear effects. The results show that: firstly, green process innovation has a direct promoting effect on synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction; Secondly, due to the differences in the economic development of different regions in China, the impact of green process innovation on the synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction is heterogeneous in different regions, and presents a gradient distribution of "east > west > middle". Finally, there is a threshold effect in the impact of green process innovation on regional synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction. This paper provides some reference value for promoting green process innovation and enhancing the collaborative impact of mitigating pollution and decreasing carbon emissions.

The global need to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions prompted studies on sustainable alternatives to conventional concrete made with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) binders. Alkali-activated ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is a promising sustainable to OPC in terms of the impact on the environment and reduction of CO2 emissions. Concretes and mortars made with alkali-activated binders demonstrate promising fresh and mechanical properties. This article presents the findings of an experimental study investigating the fresh and mechanical properties of mortar using alkali-activated GGBS binder. The activators used were sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution with 6 M, 8 M, 10 M, and 12 M molarities. The study assessed their initial setting time, workability, and 28-day compressive strength. The study evaluated the effect of partial replacement of GGBS with 5 % silica fume. The compressive strength was determined after 28 days of curing in three different environments: 1) ambient air temperature, 2) water submersion, and 3) water immersion for 7 days followed by 21 air curing in ambient temperature. The results showed an increase in compressive strength with higher NaOH concentration but a corresponding decrease in initial setting time and flowability. Depending on the curing method, efflorescence, and blue-green pigmentation were seen during the physical assessment of the samples. The highest 28-day compressive strength was 67.5 MPa when the NaOH activator molarity was 10 mol/L which represents an optimum concentration for strength development. Replacing 5 % of the GGBS binder with silica fume resulted in a decrease in the 28-day compressive strength and workability without affecting the initial setting time.

Abstract This review paper explores the diverse applications of polylactide or polylactic acid (PLA) and its contributions to environmental sustainability. It delves into the synthesis, properties, and numerous applications of PLA, accompanied by illustrative examples demonstrating its ability to reduce carbon emissions. The environmentally friendly characteristics of PLA, coupled with its versatility, make it a vital player in the ongoing efforts to combat climate change. PLA generally requires lower extrusion temperatures than other 3D printing materials, such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene). Lower extrusion temperatures lead to reduced energy consumption during the printing process thus the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions during production. Plants, such as corn and sugarcane, play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during their growth cycle. When these plants are utilized to produce PLA, the captured CO 2 remains sequestered within the plastic material. This contributes to offsetting CO 2 emissions from other sources. In conclusion, the usage of PLA has demonstrated positive contributions to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions through its renewable sourcing, lower extrusion temperatures, lower dependence on fossil fuels, reduced greenhouse gas emissions during production, biodegradability, and participation in a closed carbon cycle.

The power industry is a major contributor to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission, which accounting for 40% of total domestic carbon emission. Based on the carbon emission accounting method, this paper conducts carbon emission accounting for a number of power generation enterprises, analyses and concludes that the carbon quota allocation is being tightened year by year, proposed countermeasures and emission reduction routes in terms of carbon asset management and carbon reduction technology research. According to the actual situation of a coal-fired power plant in Anhui province, different carbon reduction routes are developed, among which photovoltaic power generation project has the most impressive economic benefits, but carbon capture project has the largest carbon reduction benefits. Under the premise of similar initial investment between the two projects, the carbon reduction brought by the latter is 5 times that of the former. It is suggested to choose the “new energy power generation+carbon capture and utilization” coupling technical route, which can improve the flexible operation of thermal power units and the absorption rate of new energy, and achieve efficient decarbonization. It provides a sustainable development technical route with both economic and environmental benefits for the low-carbon process.

Abstract The European ammonia industry emits 36 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, primarily from steam methane reforming (SMR) hydrogen production. These emissions can be mitigated by producing hydrogen via water electrolysis using dedicated renewables with grid backup. This study investigates the impact of decarbonization targets for hydrogen synthesis on the economic viability and technical feasibility of retrofitting existing European ammonia plants for on-site, semi-islanded electrolytic hydrogen production. Results show that electrolytic hydrogen cuts emissions, on average, by 85% (36%-100% based on grid price and carbon intensity), even without enforcing emission limits. However, an optimal lifespan average well-to-gate emission cap of 1 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e)/kg H 2 leads to a 95% reduction (92%-100%) while maintaining cost-competitiveness with SMR in renewable-rich regions (mean levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 4.1 euro/kg H 2 ). Conversely, a 100% emissions reduction target dramatically increases costs (mean LCOH: 6.3 euro/kg H 2 ) and land area for renewables installations, likely hindering the transition to electrolytic hydrogen in regions with poor renewables and limited land. Increasing plant flexibility effectively reduces costs, particularly in off-grid plants (mean reduction: 32%). This work guides policymakers in defining cost-effective decarbonization targets and identifying region-based strategies to support an electrolytic hydrogen-fed ammonia industry.

Solar-generated electricity is considered the best substitute to increase the green energy share in the grid, in the Indian scenario. However, India is geographically diverse; there are different climatic zones, while the policy remains the same and reverse bidding for grid connected solar power is not climate specific. The degradation factor is considered universal, as per the manufacturer's set standard of between 0.6% and 0.8%, with 2% in the first year due to light-induced degradation (LID). The climate-specific defects of solar panels, their reasons, mitigation measures, and impact on operational cost are indicated. It is concluded that metallization is the most common defect in the composite region, while interlink breakage is the most common in hot and dry regions. It is found that fill factor (FF) reduction due to interlink breakages in hot climates contributes to the maximum power (Pmax) degradation in the hot and dry zone, while short circuit current (Isc) due to water ingress and temperature variations is the Pmax reduction contributor in the composite region. It is found that the cold and cloudy zone have the least degradation rates of 0.8% annually, while hot and dry regions have an average of 1.5% annually. An investigation is done to identify the impact on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), internal rate of return (IRR), carbon dioxide (CO2) saving, and eligibility for clean energy regulator (CER) certificate for different climatic zones. The LCOE and IRR are better for cold and cloudy regions, which have the least degradation levels, while irrespective of good radiation in the hot and dry regions the LCOE increases with increased degradation levels. Sensitivity analysis is done on a 1-MW solar ground-mounted plant with polycrystalline technology operating in hot and dry regions, by varying the capital cost, operational cost, escalation in operational cost, bid escalation percentage, and degradation levels with an objective to achieve the benchmark of INR 2.44/kWh, the lowest bid pricing in 2018 in India. At an annual degradation rate of 1.5%, the solar PV plant operating in the hot and dry zone with a capital cost of 400 lakhs INR, 5% operation maintenance (O&M) cost with 3.5% escalation, 2% debt interest rate in 70:30 debt-equity model, and 2% escalation on grid intake pricing will achieve an IRR of 3.85% and LCOE of 2.5 INR. The IRR and the LCOE can be bettered by reducing the annual degradation rates from 1.5%. The sensitivity analysis concludes that while O&M cost to mitigate the climate-specific defects and its annual escalation rates is the critical component in the LCOE and IRR, the same cannot be compromised since the higher degradation rates can affect the cost economics.

The high prevalence of hay fever in Europe has raised concerns about the implications of climate change-induced higher temperatures on pollen production. Our study focuses on downy birch pollen production across Europe by analyzing 456 catkins during 2019-2021 in 37 International Phenological Gardens (IPG) spanning a large geographic gradient. As IPGs rely on genetically identical plants, we were able to reduce the effects of genetic variability. We studied the potential association with masting behavior and three model specifications based on mean and quantile regression to assess the impact of meteorology (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and atmospheric gases (e.g., ozone (O3) and carbon-dioxide (CO2)) on pollen and catkin production, while controlling for tree age approximated by stem circumference. The results revealed a substantial geographic variability in mean pollen production, ranging from 1.9 to 2.5 million pollen grains per catkin. Regression analyses indicated that elevated average temperatures of the previous summer corresponded to increased pollen production, while higher O3 levels led to a reduction. Additionally, catkins number was positively influenced by preceding summer's temperature and precipitation but negatively by O3 levels. The investigation of quantile effects revealed that the impacts of mean temperature and O3 levels from the previous summer varied throughout the conditional response distribution. We found that temperature predominantly affected trees characterized by a high pollen production. We therefore suggest that birches modulate their physiological processes to optimize pollen production under varying temperature regimes. In turn, O3 levels negatively affected trees with pollen production levels exceeding the conditional median. We conclude that future temperature increase might exacerbate pollen production while other factors may modify (decrease in the case of O3 and amplify for precipitation) this effect. Our comprehensive study sheds light on potential impacts of climate change on downy birch pollen production, which is crucial for birch reproduction and human public health.

The IPANEMA project, funded under the ECCSEL-ERIC activity, aims at studying the natural emissions of carbon dioxide in the Mediterranean region via acoustic detection. In the framework of IPANEMA INFN-LNS has designed two underwater stations equipped with hydrophones and CO2 sensors: a shallow water (20 m depth) autonomous and retrievable observatory, deployed offshore the Island of Panarea (Aeolian Islands, Tyrrhenian Sea) and a cabled deep sea observatory, to be deployed in offshore the Coast of Catania at 2000 m depth (Sicily, Western Ionian Sea). Both detectors are capable to monitor the sea soundscape from a few Hz to just under 100 kHz. In this context, INFN is investigating the possibility to use Distributed Optical Fiber sensing (DOFS) to enable the measurement of biological and anthropogenic acoustic signals along the entire length of underwater electro-optical cables. Unlike conventional sensors that measure at specific points, DOFS systems provide distributed measurements along the fiber length with high spatial sampling, allowing for dense monitoring of large structures or environments in real time. In this work, we will focus on the application of DOFS in the monitoring of biological sounds emitted by fin whales, as demonstrated by recent researches in Isfjorden Sea, Norway. During a campaign of measurements between November 9th and 16th, 2023, IFREMER interrogated with an ASN OptoDAS two seafloor electro-optical cables of the INFN-LNS marine infrastructure in Eastern Sicily. The Distributed Acoustic Sensor (DAS) system was first connected to the LNS-INFN electro-optical cable, extending 25 km from the port of Catania to its end at approximately 2100 m water depth. Another set of measurements was carried out at the LNS-INFN Capo Passero site, using a cable extending 100 km to the shore, reaching depths of around 3500 m. In this area a research study conducted by INFN-LNS between 2012 and 2013, using hydrophones on seafloor showed the presence of fin whales. In this work we will present the analysis of DAS signals: custom codes for data reduction, noise filtering and search for the typical fin whale calls (20 Hz intermittent pulses) will be presented and results discussed.

Sustainable and green hydrogen (also known as GH2) is a form of hydrogen produced by a renewable energy source or a low-carbon power. The biomass pathway could generate hydrogen for India, which is both practical and effective. The National Green Hydrogen Mission has received government approval to advance the use of GH2 in India. By 2030, the Mission will probably provide the following results: Development of a GH2 production capability of at least 5 MMT (million metric tons) annually, along with an increase of 125 GW in the nation's renewable energy capacity; around Rs. 8 lakh crores have been invested overall, creating more than 6 lakh employment; decrease in fossil fuel imports of more than Rs. 1 trillion cumulatively; and reduction of yearly greenhouse gas emissions by around 50 MMT. India is not a pioneer in using biomass for power generation, while biomass for hydrogen production offers great promise. In today's chemical sector and refineries, hydrogen is a key intermediate. Since it emits no emissions and is made from renewable resources, hydrogen is regarded as a green fuel. Biomasa carbon-neutral feedstock can potentially be one of the promising methods to create this GH2. Because plants absorb the carbon dioxide produced during combustion through photosynthesis, biomass has the potential to be used as a raw material for producing biofuels that are considered to have a balanced carbon footprint, meaning they do not contribute to a net increase in carbon dioxide levels. Thermochemical, biological, and steam reformation of glycerol are three ways biomass can be converted to hydrogen. This chapter deals with the production of GH2 from biomass.

Abstract The design of high‐energy facets in electrocatalysts has attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance electrocatalytic activity. In this review, the significance of high‐energy facets in various electrochemical reactions are highlighted, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR). Their importance in various electrochemical reactions and present strategies for constructing high‐energy facets are discussed, including alloying, heterostructure formation, selective etching, capping agents, and coupling with substrates. These strategies enable control over crystallographic orientation and surface morphology, fine‐tuning electrocatalytic properties. This study also addresses future directions and challenges, emphasizing the need to better understand fundamental mechanisms. Overall, high‐energy facets offer exciting opportunities for advancing electrocatalysis.

This paper focuses on the impact that urban traffic has on the environment. The study characterizes the global effect of GHG emissions, including the ecologic evaluation and the characterization, normalization, and evaluation factor. The work makes a detailed survey of the different modes of driving and their influence on engine performance as one of the principal causes of gas emissions during the combustion process. The article analyzes six types of vehicles equipped with different engine configurations: diesel and gasoline, GLP and GNC, hybrid electric, and plug-in hybrid electric. Simulation of the driving mode under various operational conditions for every type of engine result in energy consumption, thus, in GHG emissions, carbon dioxide and monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and Sulphur dioxide. The study concludes that a reduction in vehicle speed, thus in the engine revolutions, has positive effects on engine combustion and gasses emissions, which is reduced by 27.5%. The study also concludes that the limitation in driving mode, avoiding sharp and sudden acceleration, may reduce up to 45% of GHG emissions. The changes applied in the driving mode improve the air quality in the urban environment, reducing the content of GHG from 39% to 61%.

Introduction. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is a complex of symptoms resulting from changes to the vulvovaginal region, urethra and bladder due to estrogen and other sex steroid deficiency. Vulvovaginal atrophy is one of its manifestations, and vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, burning and itching are the most common symptoms. Aim. To analyse 20 clinical cases of the use of innovative laser procedures combined with phytoestrogens in patients with vulvovaginal atrophy as a symptom of GSM vs the standard systemic protocol for menopausal hormone therapy. Materials and methods. A clinical case-control study was conducted among 20 postmenopausal women. The age of the subjects ranged from 50 to 65 years with amenorrhea for at least 1 year, a follicle-stimulating hormone level of >30 IU/L and various presentations of GSM. The women were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 10) received laser therapy combined with phytoestrogens, group 2 (n = 10) received systemic menopausal hormonal therapy. To evaluate the results, a survey with a specialized international vulvovaginal symptom questionnaire (VSQ) was carried out to determine the vaginal health index scores before and after treatment. Results. After treatment, both groups showed significant improvement in the form of the reduction or disappearance of symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy. The prescription of phytoestrogens provided an additional positive effect after 3 sessions of carbon dioxide laser treatment. Conclusion. The carbon dioxide laser exposure resulted in the reduction or disappearance of the local symptoms of climacteric syndrome in the form of GSM, and the use of phytoestrogens as part of Mense BAA supplemented the treatment of psychoemotional and neurovegetative changes, which allowed us to make a conclusion about the feasibility, high efficiency and safety of the complex treatment for women, who do not wish to take menopausal hormone therapy and (or) have absolute contraindications. However, further research on the laser technologies and other non-hormonal techniques to treat GSM is required to carry out a more complete and accurate assessment of the effectiveness and safety of these treatments.

Abstract The electrochemical C‐N coupling process, facilitating the production of organic nitrogen substances (such as urea, methylamine, formamide, and ethylamine) via the simultaneous reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and small nitrogen‐based substances, stands at the forefront of advancing carbon neutrality and the artificial nitrogen cycle. This method has garnered substantial interest due to its potential economic and environmental benefits. Although considerable progress has been achieved in this emerging field, it still faces challenges, including slow reactant adsorption, competing side reactions, and complex multi‐step pathways, resulting in low yields and selectivity. Strategically designing and developing low‐cost and exceptionally performant catalysts is crucial for cost‐effective and precise electrochemical C─N bonding. This article offers an in‐depth review of the electrosynthesis of valuable organic nitrogen compounds at ambient conditions from earth‐abundant resources/wastes, such as CO 2 and small nitrogenous molecules (nitrogen: N 2 , nitrite: NO 2 − , nitrate: NO 3 − , ammonia: NH 3 , etc.), via electrochemical C─N bond formation reactions, especially using carbon‐based catalysts. The relevant electrochemical C─N bond formation mechanisms, the design principles of advanced carbon‐based electrocatalysts, and the impact of different electrolyser designs are discussed, along with the present obstacles and upcoming prospects in this dynamic field.

One challenge confronting the Cu2O catalysts in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is the reduction of active Cu(I) species, resulting in low selectivity and quick deactivation. In this study, we for the first time introduce a bottom‐up growth of convex sphere with adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interfaces (Cux@Cu2O convex spheres). Interestingly, the interfaces are dynamically modulated by varying hydrothermal time, thus regulating the conversion of C1 and C2 products. In particular, the 4 h hydrothermal treatment applied to Cu0.25@Cu2O convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface results in the highest selectivity for C2 products (90.5%). In situ Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface lowers the energy barrier for the production of ethylene and ethanol while increasing the coverage of localized *CO adsorbate for increased dimerization. This work establishes a novel approach for transforming the state of valence‐sensitive electrocatalysts into high‐value energy‐related engineering products.

Abstract This paper examines the impact of climate policy uncertainty (CPU) on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions of 1007 listed firms over 2003–2021. As the urgency to combat climate change and implement effective policies may create uncertainty, it focuses on the Unites States, a significant emitter with a complex policy landscape. Using the two‐step system generalized method of moments estimation, the analysis reveals a negative CPU–CO 2 emissions relationship, indicating that increased CPU incentivizes firms to adopt sustainable practices, leading to emissions reductions. Capital expenditures have similar effects on emissions, accompanied by increased corporate sustainability engagement. However, no significant relationship is found between research and development (R&D) expenditure and CO 2 emissions, nor does CPU significantly moderate the R&D–CO 2 emissions nexus. Firms with substantial fixed assets exhibit higher CO 2 emissions, while heavy emitters demonstrate limited CPU responsiveness. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers encouraging corporate participation in emissions reduction efforts.

The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in water is an important key indicator of the quality of Ultra-pure water, which is useful in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, among others. Therefore, as a technology to measure TOC, a technology that measures the amount of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by electrical conductivity is being developed. This method uses ultraviolet light and an oxidizing agent to oxidize organic compounds to produce CO<sub>2</sub>, and measures the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> by measuring the electrical conductivity based on the permeable membrane of the gas, and then converts it to the concentration of TOC in the organic compound. In this study, we presented the design conditions of the alternating current control circuit applied between the two electrodes of the electrical conductivity cell, the microcurrent signal detection, voltage conversion circuit, and the amplification and noise reduction circuit for measuring the low concentration of TOC required for ultrapure water. Based on the optimal design conditions, we have fabricated a PCB for ultra-precise electrical conductivity measurement for low concentration TOC analysis using membrane conductivity, and have compared the results with a commercial product.

Abstract Acid fracturing in challenging gas wells imposes multiple areas for improvement. The objective is to implement effective acid fracturing treatment with combination of CO2 foam and the use of dissolvable plugs to maximize diversion across the net pay and to improve overall operations efficiency. The scope of the paper shows improved well production and operations efficiency using CO2 foamed acid fracturing and dissolvable frac plugs compared to conventional acid fracturing. The area of improvement for acid fracturing is to ensure effective fluid diversion across target pay. Effective stimulation is through shorter interval with multiple stages using temporary isolation rather than through single stage and longer interval. The choice of dissolvable frac plugs for temporary isolation is to eliminate coiled tubing milling operations. The use of CO2 foamed technique provides good acid retardation for effective diversion and extended reaction with formation. CO2 foamed acid fracturing treatment uses lower stimulation fluid volume compared to conventional treatment. Volume reduction and the energized foam accelerates flowback for effective well cleanup. The combination of CO2 foamed fracturing technique and the use of dissolvable frac plugs were applied in gas Well-A, having high temperature and low reservoir pressure. Well (A) was completed with two stages treatment with temporary isolation using a dissolvable plug to ensure good stimulation across the pay. CO2 foam lowers the formation temperature which reduces acid reactivity on sand face resulting in deeper etched fracture length. Foaming agents are included in the stimulation fluid to maximize CO2 entrainment producing stable foam for effective diversion and energizing the fluid to accelerate well flowback. Reduction of flowback time and enhanced clean-up can be attributed to the CO2 energize assist and significant fluid volume reduction, up to 50% reduction compared to conventional treatment. The use of dissolvable frac plugs coupled with CO2 stimulation, eliminates the need of coiled tubing milling and N2 lifting intervention as a result of reducing the wellbore hydrostatic column. The effectiveness of this technique can be proven from higher production in gas rate compared to other reference wells that were not treated similarly. Overall operations efficiency is improved due to reduced logistics, reduced fluid mixing, enhanced flowback rate and eliminating the need of Coiled Tubing intervention.

The pursuit of high efficacy C–C coupling during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction remains a tremendous challenge owing to the high energy barrier of CO2 activation and insufficient coverage of the desired intermediates on catalytic sites. Inspired by the concept of capture‐coupled CO2 activation, we fabricated quinone‐grafted carbon nanofibers via an in situ oxidative carbonylation strategy. The quinone functionality of carbon nanofibers promotes the capture of CO2 followed by activation. At a current density of 400 mA cm‐2, the Faradaic efficiency of ethylene reached 62.9%, and a partial current density of 295 mA cm‐2 was achieved on the quinone‐rich carbon nanofibers. The results of in situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicated that the remarkable selectivity enhancement in ethylene originates from the quinone structure, rather than the electronic properties of Cu particles. The interaction of quinone with CO2 increases the local *CO coverage and simultaneously hinders the co‐adsorption of *H on Cu sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier for C–C coupling and restrains subsequent *CO protonation. The modulation strategy involving specific oxygenated structure, as an independent degree of freedom, guides the design of functionalized carbon materials for tailoring the selectivity of desired products during the CO2 capture and reduction.

The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable sources in power generation at local and building-level poses growing issues in balancing generation and demand. To avoid imbalances, it is therefore necessary to ensure adequate levels of flexibility in the building energy system. This can be done both on the generation side, through the coupling of different energy carriers (cogeneration, power-to-heat solutions) and/or the integration of storage systems, and on the demand side, through smart “demand response” programs. This paper considers a tourist facility located in central Germany as a case study to evaluate the energy, economic and environmental benefits that can be obtained from the application of appropriate demand response strategies. The electrical demand data of the facility are monitored at both aggregate and individual load levels and made available by means of a cloud platform. The facility includes two stationary combined heat and power internal combustion engines powered by natural gas and a photovoltaic system. The results show how, thanks to appropriate load management, it is possible, on the one hand, to increase the self-consumption of PV-generated energy and, on the other hand, to keep more constant the load of the engines, which can therefore operate with better efficiencies. This results in both a reduction in energy expenses and a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions attributable to the building.

Abstract Background Global warming and the increasing risk of natural disasters force us all to act. As the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions has been proven effective but insufficient on its own, Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies emerged to fill the gap. Using CCU technologies, CO 2 is captured and further processed into valuable products instead of being emitted into the atmosphere. Method This study investigates the prevailing public perception of such CCU-based products by the example of clothing and cosmetics. We applied the method of conjoint measurement to experimentally examine context-related factors (= attributes) in different usage settings and explored the consumers’ decision profiles for or against the usage of CCU-based products (cosmetics and clothing). Conjoint measurements were realized as an online experiment, addressing acceptance patterns and preferences in four European countries (Germany, Norway, Spain, and Poland). In addition, we assessed general attitudes and affective assessments of the CCU products. A total of N = 828 participants took part in the study, and the international subsamples were comparable. Results Results revealed that health compatibility is the main adoption-driving factor in the decisions for or against the use of the products. Still, attributes like the environmental impact, product quality, and information flow play an important role as well, even though to a lesser extent. Participants from different countries significantly differ in their cognitive and affective evaluations of acceptance-related attributes. Conclusions The outcome provides insights into differences in Pan-European comparison and helps to understand the public motives and country-specific terms of use for CCU-based products, effectively establishing recommendations for policy and governance.

Addressing marine oil spills and industrial water pollution necessitates the development of eco-efficient oil-absorbing materials. With increasing concern for the environment, there is a consensus to decrease the use of petroleum-based polymers. Herein, lightweight poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blend foams with varying thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) content were fabricated via a solvent-free, eco-friendly supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) extrusion foaming technology. The incorporation of TPU significantly enhanced the crystallization rate of PLA, with the semi-crystallization time of PT30 and PT50 blends at 105 °C exhibiting a reduction of 77.2 % and 47.9 %, respectively, compared to neat PLA. The resulting foams exhibited an open-cell structure with excellent selective oil adsorption capabilities. Notably, the PT30 foam achieved a remarkable maximum expansion ratio of 36.0, while the PT50 foam attained the highest open-cell content of 96.2 %. The PT50 foam demonstrated an outstanding adsorption capacity, spanning from 4.7 to 18.8 g/g for diverse oils and solvents, with rapid adsorption kinetics, reaching 94.9 % of the equilibrium adsorption capacity for CCl4 within just 1 min. Furthermore, the PT50 foam retained 95.2 % of its adsorption capacity for CCl4 over 10 adsorption-desorption cycles. This study presents a scalable and sustainable approach for large-scale production of high-performance, bio-based foams, facilitating efficient oil-water separation.

Plastic waste disposal is mounting, with consequences for both environmental and human wellbeing. Addressing the plastic waste challenge through chemically upcycling waste to other products is gaining momentum but can have trade-offs. For example, the conversion of plastic waste into hydrogen rich gas can be achieved via catalytic steam, but this process can release large quantities of CO2 (∼12 kg CO2 per 1 kg H2 production). High-performance bifunctional catalysts, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), offer a potential solution, but suppressing CO2 emissions without compromising H2-rich gas yield remains challenging. Here, we synthesize a new CNTs-bridging nanocomposite by integrating Ni nanoparticles with HY zeolite. Employing this bifunctional CNTs-bridging nanocomposite in the catalytic steam reforming of polyethylene can achieve high-quality H2 yields of up to 2,340 mL/gplastic and a 77% reduction in CO2 emissions (1.68 g CO2 per 1 g H2 production). This work introduces an innovative CNTs-bridging strategy to valorize plastic waste into high-quality H2-rich syngas while suppressing CO2 emissions.

Anemia is a condition where there is a lack of healthy red blood cells. Anemia can be caused by various factors, including deficiencies of iron and vitamin C. The aim of this research is to explore the important role of iron and vitamin C in preventing and treating anemia. This research adopts a qualitative approach in its research methodology. The data collection technique used is literature study. After the data is collected, analysis is carried out in three stages, namely data reduction to identify important information, data presentation to organize relevant information, and conclusion drawing to summarize the findings and their implications. The results showed that iron, protein and vitamin C have important roles in the prevention and treatment of anemia. There is a close relationship between these three components in preventing and treating anemia. Iron deficiency is the root cause of anemia, while vitamin C and protein play a role in increasing iron absorption, thus playing an important role in preventing or treating anemia. Iron is an indispensable mineral for the body to form hemoglobin and myoglobin, which are major components in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Vitamin C as an antioxidan has a positive effect on immune function and also helps the body absorb iron more easily. So to reduce the risk of anemia, by fulfilling daily protein and then eating foods rich in vitamin C and combining them with iron sources.

The cathodic reduction of pressurized CO2 (PrCO2CR) at suitable cathodes can allow to produce various chemicals, such as formic acid/formate and carbon monoxide or synthesis gas, with high faradic efficiencies (FEs) and productivities. Here, we have performed the conversion of CO2 in an undivided pressurized electrochemical reactor using silver cathode in order to determine the optimal values of CO2 pressure and current density. It was found that the plot FE vs. pressure resulted in a curve with a maximum. Similarly, an optimal value of current density can be selected for the PrCO2CR. The competition between the production of carbon monoxide and formic acid/formate is strongly affected by both the pressure and the current density. Eventually the effect of pressure and current density on the economic figures of the process was evaluated.

This study investigated characteristics of alkali-activated slags incorporating magnesium oxide (MgO) subjected to CO2 curing. The samples were prepared by adding 2%, 5%, and 10% MgO to the total binder mass. The mixture was activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and cured in a CO2 incubator for 3 days. The compressive strength of the MgO-incorporated CO2-cured alkali-activated slag was higher than that of the conventional alkali-activated slag at all ages up to 28 days. No reduction in the strength was observed over time. The enhanced strength was independent of MgO content. Combined X-ray diffraction with thermogravimetric analysis showed MgO accelerated the alkali activation by dissolving more Ca and Al ions from the slag. CO2 curing supplied carbonate ions and produced calcium carbonate and hydrotalcite. The former aided in achieving a higher level of early age strength and gel pore refinement. Larger amount of the carbonates was formed under high MgO contents, which further enhanced the strength.

This study aims to analyze the determinants that influence the consumers’ disposition to invest in microgrid technology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This research offers valuable insights for policymakers on investors’ motivations to develop strategies to foster microgrid technology adoption through end-user investments leading to a reduction in microgrid high capital cost. The study employed descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses to analyze the responses of a sample of property owners to a quantitative survey. The study examines such variables as strategic alignment, profitability, digitization, renewable energy utilization, CO2 emission reduction, and disaster recovery readiness. The data collected reveal a moderate level of understanding and cost-awareness of microgrid technology among the respondents, with a mean of 2.46 out of 5. Notably, the data highlight the significant influence of strategic alignment with the UAE’s national energy goals on the respondents’ inclination to invest in microgrids, with a strong positive correlation of 0.942 at the 0.01 level (two-tailed). By comparison, profitability and disaster recovery have a comparatively weaker correlation. Furthermore, based on the data collected during this study, it has been determined that there is a strong value added by the microgrid initiatives considering the UAE’s strategic direction and the positive influence of reduced CO2. The regression models used were highly significant at F = 85.690. There is an acceptable level of multicollinearity with VIF values ranging from 1.087 to 2.155. UAE Strategy has low collinearity. UAE Strategy emerges as the only significant predictor of willingness to invest (p < 0.001) in the stepwise regression analysis. The analysis shows that villa and townhouse owners are willing to invest in community microgrid given that it is aligned with UAE strategy and leads to CO2 emissions reduction.

Replacing steam with solar for CO2 regeneration is an incredibly promising approach. However, the high temperature required for solvent regeneration and the less-than-optimal photothermal conversion efficiency that prevents reaching the necessary regeneration temperature are significant limitations to this approach. In this work, thermomorphic solvents containing dimethylcyclohexylamine, N-methylcyclohexylamine and photothermal nanoparticles were prepared for CO2 capture. Nano carbon black, multi-walled carbon nanotube and carboxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube were used as promoter for photothermal conversion. The experimental results exhibit the high CO2 absorption capacity of 0.1081 g/g solvent for the carboxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube based solvent, and it can be efficiently regenerated under solar irradiation at a low temperature of ∼ 323 K. It is noteworthy that the photothermal material not only raise the solution temperature(∼325 K) during solar irradiation but also boosts the CO2 absorption rate, and leads to a ∼ 20.8 % increase in CO2 absorption capacity during the absorption process. Furthermore, the utilisation of photothermal regeneration for thermomorphic solvents can achieve an efficiency of 78.6 %, with a regeneration heat of 2.35 GJ/t CO2, resulting in an energy consumption reduction of approximately 41.1 % in comparison to 30 wt% monoethanolamine. The photo triggered regeneration of the thermomorphic solvent investigated in this study shows promising potential as an energy-efficient carbon capture technology.

Understanding and predicting CO2 emissions from individual power plants is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study analyzes and forecasts CO2 emissions from an engine-based natural gas-fired power plant in Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ), Bangladesh. This study also presents a rich dataset and ELM-based prediction model for a natural gas-fired plant in Bangladesh. Utilizing a rich dataset of Electricity generation and Gas Consumption, CO2 emissions in tons are estimated based on the measured energy use, and the ELM models were trained on CO2 emissions data from January 2015 to December 2022 and used to forecast CO2 emissions until December 2026. This study aims to improve the understanding and prediction of CO2 emissions from natural gas-fired power plants. While the specific operational strategy of the studied plant is not available, the provided data can serve as a valuable baseline or benchmark for comparison with similar facilities and the development of future research on optimizing operations and CO2 mitigation strategies. The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) modeling method was employed due to its efficiency and accuracy in prediction. The ELM models achieved performance metrics Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), values respectively 3494.46 (<5000), 2013.42 (<2500), and 0.93 close to 1, which falls within the acceptable range. Although natural gas is a cleaner alternative, emission reduction remains essential. This data-driven approach using a Bangladeshi case study provides a replicable framework for optimizing plant operations and measuring and forecasting CO2 emissions from similar facilities, contributing to global climate change.

Air treatment in environmental air conditioning systems exposes the system to gases, contaminants, and often biological pollutants that cannot be solved by traditional mechanical filtration, motivating decision-makers to diagnose challenges and develop innovative strategies to mitigate the problem. More and more, in environments with high turnover of people (e.g., hospitals, hotels and shopping centers), fresh air ventilations are avoided and replaced by closed windows air purifier solutions to account for undesirable saturation of the atmosphere and the presence of pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, PM1.0, nitrogen, and carbon oxides. The consensus is that polluting gases render the most efficient traditional filters ineffective. The ANSI/ASHRAE 62.1 and EN13779 standards reveal the absence of air treatment technologies that use the wet route in air conditioning systems. This work discusses the liquid air multi-venturi centrifugation technology of hydrodynamic precipitator purifiers in association with the synchronized and continuous monitoring of parameters (PM10, PM2.5, PM1.0, CO 2 ) in the external urban environment and internal environments of a shopping center. It evaluates the performance of the wet route for the physical-chemical and biological treatment of air. Efficiency for retaining particulate matter in a single step without disposable filter reached levels above F9 (85-95% PM2.5), with a reduction of 82.4% for CO 2 . Wet route technology extends the air conditioner’s life, reducing external air flows and energy consumption by up to 13%, making IAQ a manageable and customizable variable. Among the conclusion of the investigation, the authors believe that the migration of industrial pollutant control technologies, such as liquid filtration promoted by gas scrubbers and hydrodynamic precipitators, should be considered as a first choice option due to the high efficiency achieved in the three types of pollutants to be controlled. That is micrometric particulate matter such as anthropogenic PM1.0 capable of reaching the lung alveoli, chemicals such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and biological assets such as viruses and bacteria that showed the vulnerability of HVAC-R systems during the COVID pandemic that rendered windowless corporate buildings unusable.

China's carbon emission trading policy plays a crucial role in achieving both its "3060" dual carbon objectives and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) on climate action. The policy's effectiveness in reducing pollution and mitigating carbon emissions holds significant importance. This paper investigated whether China's carbon emission trading policy affects pollution reduction (PM2.5 and SO2) and carbon mitigation (CO2) in pilot regions, using panel data from 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2005 to 2019 and employing a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model. Furthermore, it analyzed the heterogeneity of carbon market mechanisms and regional variations. Finally, it examined the governance pathways for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation from a holistic perspective. The results indicate that: (1) China's carbon emission trading policy has reduced CO2 emissions by 18% and SO2 emissions by 36% in pilot areas, with an immediate impact on the "carbon mitigation" effect, while the "pollution reduction" effect exhibits a time lag. (2) Higher carbon trading prices lead to stronger "carbon mitigation" effects, and larger carbon market scales are associated with greater "pollution reduction" effects on PM2.5. Governance effects on pollution reduction and carbon mitigation vary among pilot regions: Carbon markets of Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin show significant governance effects in both "pollution reduction" and "carbon mitigation", whereas Guangdong's carbon market exhibits only a "pollution reduction" effect, and Hubei's carbon market demonstrates only a "carbon mitigation" effect. (3) Currently, China's carbon emission trading policy achieves pollution reduction and carbon mitigation through "process management" and "end-of-pipe treatment". This study could provide empirical insights and policy implications for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation, as well as for the development of China's carbon emission trading market.

Herein, we reviewed the main components of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) which are an emerging cheap and environmentally benign alternative for solar energy capture and conversion to electricity. The role of individual parts such as the semiconductor electrode, counter electrode, photosensitizer, electrolyte, and substrate and their contribution to the overall efficiency (η) of DSSCs are discussed. In addition, parameters such as short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and fill factor used to quantify the efficiency of DSSCs are addressed. The highest solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 13 % has been achieved using titanium dioxide as a semiconductor electrode, a triiodide system as a redox couple, and platinum counter electrodes. Semiconductors are made up of materials such as glass, carbon, conductive polymers and other metal oxides have lower efficiencies (< 8 %). In addition, synthetic photosensitizers especially ruthenium complexes have higher efficiencies (10-11 %) compared to natural dyes among which the highest efficiency (4.6 %) was achieved using chlorophyll. The performance of natural dyes based on efficiency of the DSSC is generally in the order: chlorophyll > anthocyanins > carotenoids that is highly attributed to their structure which not only dictates electron release and recombination but also attachment to other components. The DSSC performance is not fixed but rather tunable by variations in the components to achieve desired structural and electronic properties such as firm anchorage between the photosensitizer and the semiconductors, the reduction of the energy band gap by incorporation of other metal salts to extend the absorption range and use of additives that prevent electron recombination with the photosensitizer or any hindrances in the electrolyte redox reactions.

Herein we address the efficiency of the CO2 sorption of ionic liquids (IL) with hydrogen bond donors (e.g., glycols) added as viscosity modifiers and the impact of encapsulating them to limit sorbent evaporation under conditions for the direct air capture of CO2. Ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, and diethylene glycol were added to three different ILs: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium 2-cyanopyrrolide ([EMIM][2-CNpyr]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF4]), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]). Incorporation of the glycols decreased viscosity by an average of 51% compared to bulk IL. After encapsulation of the liquid mixtures using a soft template approach, thermogravimetric analysis revealed average reductions in volatility of 36 and 40% compared to the unencapsulated liquid mixtures, based on 1 h isothermal experiments at 25 and 55 °C, respectively. The encapsulated mixtures of [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/1,3-propanediol and [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/diethylene glycol exhibited the lowest volatility (0.0019 and 0.0002 mmol/h at 25 °C, respectively) and were further evaluated as CO2 absorption/desorption materials. Based on the capacity determined from breakthrough measurements, [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/1,3-propanediol had a lower transport limited absorption rate for CO2 sorption compared to [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/diethylene glycol with 0.08 and 0.03 mol CO2/kg sorbent, respectively; however, [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/diethylene glycol capsules exhibited higher absorptions capacity at ∼500 ppm of CO2 (0.66 compared to 0.47 mol of CO2/kg sorbent for [EMIM][2-CNpyr]/1,3-propanediol). These results show that glycols can be used to not only reduce IL viscosity while increasing physisorption sites for CO2 sorption, but also that encapsulation can be utilized to mitigate evaporation of volatile viscosity modifiers.

Electrification applications in transport and energy supply can significantly reduce carbon emissions. The impact of electrification on carbon emissions reduction varies across countries with different development profiles. In developed countries, with the increase of renewable resources usage in electricity production, the per capita CO2 emissions decrease. For example, Germany increased its share of electricity production from renewable sources from 6.2% to 44%, and its per capita CO2 emissions dropped from 11.2 t to 8.1t. While in developing countries, the per capita CO2 emissions are still increasing with the increase of electrification level. For example, India increased its degree of electrification from 58% to 99%, and its per capita CO2 emissions increased from 0.9 t to 1.9 t. This paper first used LCA data to compare the Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of electric vehicles and fuel vehicles and GHG emissions of electricity plants from different energy sources. Then, this paper used Linear regression to determine how close between electrification and climate change. This research aims to identify the potential of electrification to achieve urbanization and carbon neutrality, as there are few discussions regarding the combination of these three topics at present. This research can confirm the benefit of electrification in reducing carbon emissions, which can promote the broad application of electrification and its development.

This study examines the intricate interplay of political stability, natural resource rent, industrialization, globalization, economic growth, and carbon emissions in nine Arab resource-abundant countries (ANRAC) from 1996 to 2019. Applying advanced statistical approaches, such as the Method of Moment Quantiles Regression (MMQREG) as a baseline estimation approach, along with the inclusion of PCSE, FGLS, and FMOLS, to enhance, to enhance the reliability and stability of the obtained results. The study results suggest that globalization, coupled with the interplay between political stability and economic growth, fosters advancements in environmental conditions and the pursuit of sustainable practices. In contrast, political stability, abundant natural resources, sustained economic expansion, and widespread industrialization are associated with increased CO2 emissions, posing detrimental effects on the environment. Notably, there seems to be a correlation between the concurrent improvement of political stability and economic growth and a reduction in CO2 emissions.

This study enhances data support for CO2 emission reduction strategies across the U.S., targeting the commercial, industrial, residential, and electric power sectors. Despite the availability of numerous predictive models for sector-specific CO2 emission forecasts, a gap remains for a versatile model adept at managing time series data with varied characteristics. We introduce a novel, highly generalizable forecasting model that merges Conformable Fractional Accumulation, seasonal dummy variables, and the time power item to address randomness, seasonality, and nonlinearity in predictions. Our model outshines prevailing competitors, including statistical (AR and ARIMA), machine learning (LSTM, BPNN, and GRU), and grey models (SGM (1,1) and GM (1,1)), in comparative tests. It achieves MAPE values below 5% and 10% for training and testing phases, respectively, across all sectors, surpassing the inconsistent results from benchmark models. Furthermore, the stability and reliability of our model are validated through a systematic robustness verification framework. Notably, leveraging this model's superior predictive performance, we forecast future sectoral CO2 emissions. A detailed analysis of sector-specific influencing factors provides actionable insights for crafting targeted decarbonization policies and plans.

The study utilizes a GIS-Based Multi-Criteria Analysis to evaluate the viability of solar, wind, and biomass energy in Iraq, focusing on enhancing the nation's energy independence and meeting international climate objectives. Detailed spatial analysis revealed specific zones suited for the efficient installation of energy power plants. Zones with an energy surplus factor of less than 0.2 are deemed not viable for development, whereas regions with factors less than 0.4 are ideal for harnessing solar, wind, and biomass resources. Furthermore, zones with surplus factors greater than 0.6 are highly recommended for energy projects. Notably, the results show that strategic development of these zones can cater to between 45% and 68% of the country total energy demand, potentially reducing the CO2 footprint by 0.5. Moreover, with an increase in the construction threshold, the CO2 reduction potential has shown a decrease to 1.29E+08 tones, particularly evident in areas with rigorous construction standards. A plateau in reduction figures is observed once the construction threshold surpasses 3.5, stabilizing between 2.5E+07 tones. As the threshold exceeds 5, a further stabilization is noted, consistently around 2.17E+07 tones, persisting even when the threshold approaches 8. The outcomes underscores the critical role of strategic zoning in maximizing renewable energy potential, highlighting pathways for the country to achieve energy self-sufficiency and make significant strides in climate goals.

Nowadays, we have observed the dynamic development of bio-heating plants that use wood biomass for heating or energy purposes. The result of this process is a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions as well as in the production of biomass ash (BA). Despite the waste nature of BA, it should be carefully analyzed and assessed for various applications, including environmental ones. Due to the features attributed to BA, including its alkaline reaction, the high capacity of its sorption complex, relatively low salinity, and significant content of macro- and microelements, a hypothesis was put forward in this work undertaken about the positive role of BA as an immobilizing factor for Cd-, Pb-, and Zn-contaminated soils. This research was based on a pot experiment in which four series were considered: (1) BA; (2) BA + Cd; (3) BA + Pb; and (4) BA + Zn. BA was used at doses of 30, 60, and 90 mg pot−1, and metals at doses of 2 mg Cd, 100 mg Pb, and 300 mg Zn kg−1 of soil. The test plant was corn grown for green mass. The study took into account the influence of BA on the content of the total forms of heavy metals (Metot) and their available forms (Meav). In the soil without the addition of metals, a significant increase in the content of Cdtot and Cdav, and a decrease in the content of Zntot were observed due to the application of BA. The addition of metals against the background of the BA used resulted in a significant increase in Cdtot, Pbtot, and Zntot, as well as an increase in the available forms of Pbav but a decrease in Znav. However, there was no significant increase in the Cdav content. The obtained results may indicate the potentially immobilizing role of BA only in the case of zinc. They may constitute the basis for further, more detailed research aimed at determining the role of BA in the immobilization of various metals in soil.

Abstract Microbiologically influenced corrosion has become a predominant cause of pipeline and equipment failure in oil and gas fields. This research examines the corrosion behavior of steels with varying chromium contents in simulated shale gas formation water environments. Weight loss testing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Focused Ion Beam (FIB), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were employed. The findings suggest that an elevated Cr content in steel results in a gradual reduction in its uniform corrosion rate in a CO2-SRB coexistence environment. This can be primarily attributed to the significant distribution of Cr content throughout the entire product film, including both biofilm and corrosion products, thereby enhancing the product film's protectiveness. Additionally, the competitive corrosion between CO2 and SRB, as well as the influence mechanism of Cr on corrosion, were discussed.

Abstract This study assesses China's CCUS deployment, pivotal for the nation's carbon neutrality by 2060 and transition to sustainable energy. It explores the social, economic, and industrial impacts, including job creation, product exports, and global CCUS market influence. The paper outlines critical goals for successful CCUS implementation, impacting China's future industrial competitiveness. We employed machine learning to analyze CO2 emissions data from China's power, iron and steel, cement, and oil and gas industries, supplemented by expert consultations. Our findings reveal significant emission characteristics: thermal power dominates the power industry's emissions, contributing over 50% to China's industrial total. The iron and steel sector accounts for over 60% of global emissions in its field, comprising 15-18% of China's emissions. Cement production, with a CO2 emission factor of 0.86, results in approximately 620 kg of CO2 per ton. The oil and gas sector, particularly petrochemicals, represents 9% of national emissions. These insights shape our analysis of the CCUS development pathway in these key sectors. Our analysis of carbon emissions and CCUS development in key Chinese industries, informed by expert consultation, leads to these conclusions: China's CCUS evolution follows three stages. The research, development, and demonstration phase (2020-2025) anticipates CCUS projects scaling to 15 Mt CO2/year. The industrial rollout phase (2025-2035) projects expansion to 50 Mt CO2/year. Full deployment (2035-2050) will see project sizes reaching 1500 Mt CO2/year, with significant milestones of 500 Mt in 2040 and 1500 Mt by 2050. Under an aggressive model, CCUS plays a crucial role in direct emission reductions, targeting 2.5 billion tonnes CO2 by 2050. Regional CCUS strategies align with each province's carbon peak goals, sequestration resources, and industrial structures. Aligned with China's 14th Five-Year Plan, our study underscores the strategic importance of CCUS technology, analyzing its potential and affordability in major sectors like electricity, iron and steel, cement, and oil and gas. We propose a CCUS deployment roadmap for China, detailing strategies for large-scale emission source retrofitting and industry-level source-sink matching. This forms the foundation for the Ministry of Science and Technology's planning of regional CCUS clusters.

Abstract Lakes are important natural sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere, and their nutrient status is a significant driver affecting GHGs production and emission. Nevertheless, when estimating GHGs emissions at regional or national scales, the variations in emission rates caused by differences in nutrient status are often overlooked or not adequately considered. The potential social benefits of eutrophication control in mitigating climate change damage were rarely quantified, leading to largely underestimated benefits generated from water quality improvement. In this study, we compiled a comprehensive dataset on the emission rates of three typical GHGs (i.e., CO2, CH4, and N2O) from China’s lakes (n=356), and their nutrient concentrations, lake morphologies, and climate information. The fitted models between lake GHG emission rates and their drivers were established to upscale national GHGs emissions from lakes and approximate the changes in GHGs emissions under different nitrogen and phosphorus levels. We found that the current GHGs emissions from China’s lakes were 48.44 (31.60‒73.79) Tg CO2-eq·y-1, with CO2 emissions contributing around 52%. Even with a mere 10% reduction in nitrogen concentration in lakes nationwide over 2020‒2050, the estimated decrease in the GHGs emissions over the 30-year period would be 46.9 Tg CO2-eq, avoided climate change damages values could reach $1.5‒4.9 billion (2020 $US). Lake eutrophication controls can present an excellent chance to simultaneously achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of “clean water and sanitation” and “climate action”, accelerating the global progress toward sustainability.

In 2021, Mexico produced approximately 24.2 million tons of white corn, generating 3.6 million tons of corn cob residue. The final disposal of corn cob poses an environmental challenge in certain regions. This study examines the technical–economic feasibility and the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of integrating a small-scale cogenerating gasifier fueled by corn cob into a nixtamalized corn flour manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). This integration enables the generation of heat and electricity from the produced synthesis gas. Moreover, the process yields residual carbon, which can be used as biochar for soil restoration and removing atmospheric CO2. This option holds significance for the corn flour agroindustry in Mexico, as, in 2021, it consumed approximately 601.9 GWh of electrical energy and 938,279 GJ of thermal energy from LP Gas in its manufacturing processes to produce 2.6 million tons of nixtamalized white corn flour. These processes contributed to a total emission of 410,232 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The findings of this study demonstrate a cumulative reduction of 51.7% in CO2 emissions, resulting in economic benefits of USD 85,401 in 2017 for a case study SME that annually produces 1039 tons of corn flour. This study reveals the integration of a gasifier–cogenerator system fueled by corn cob as an economically viable low-carbon technology in the corn flour manufacturing industry.

Nowadays, self-checkouts are becoming increasingly popular in stores and markets. This is simply because they offer customers the convenience of shopping without having to wait in line and provide store owners with an opportunity to increase sales and improve the customer experience. Meanwhile, the sustainability options of the devices have gained more traction, such as reducing the CO2 emissions of the product and production. However, it is initially unknown how to investigate the sustainability of self-service devices due to insufficient research in this area. To address this issue, the different methodologies have been analyzed based on domain-oriented boundaries. The life cycle assessment (LCA) is chosen to assess the sustainability. Then, the inventory analysis is worked out to gather the relevant raw data. Subsequently, the model of the product's life cycle is established in an LCA software tool. The assessment and interpretation is carried out. A case study of self-checkout is conducted in the industrial company and the results shows that recycled material zincor and using solar energy could lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 41.8%.

With growing concerns about air pollution and global warming effects, the emissions of NH3 and greenhouse gases (GHGs) have become significant issues in the pig production industry. In order to discover whether optimizing manure removal strategies could alter the manure decomposition process and benefit the reduction of gas emissions, a scale model approach was used to quantify the gas emissions under controlled conditions. This study compared the gas emission reduction potential of two classic manure removal systems (scraper and pull-plug system) in three manure removal strategies: scraper-I (retaining manure for 24 h), scraper-II (retaining manure for 8 and 16 h) and pull-plug (retaining manure for 44 days). Fresh urine and faeces collected from a gestation sow house were applied to the scale models and then removed through the manure removal systems. The concentrations of gases (NH3, CH4, CO2, and N2O) within the scale model and removed slurry samples were collected and analysed (pH, electric conductivity, dry matter, total nitrogen, total ammonium nitrogen and total carbon). The results showed that emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O from scraper-I were on average 54%, 56% and 25% lower than those from scraper-II, and 71%, 67% and 6% lower than those from pull-plug treatment, respectively. The GHGs emission rates (as CO2-equivalents) of scraper-I and scraper-II were 52% and 26.3% lower than that of pull-plug treatment respectively (P < 0.01). The emissions of NH3 displayed a temporary peak during each application of urine and removal of manure. In pull-plug treatment, the concentrations of NH3, CH4, and CO2 exponentially increased between Day 39 and Day 41. The nitrogen content, both total nitrogen and total ammonium nitrogen, within the slurry under the scraper system exhibited lower values compared to those from the pull-plug system. Conversely, the total carbon content was higher in the former system. Caution is warranted in extrapolating results to full-scale pig housing, given study limitations (e.g. small scale, mimicked scraper activity, no animals, etc.). Nevertheless, the conclusions and findings of this study provide fundamental data for understanding gas emissions from pig house manure management. This insight can guide the design and daily operations of low-emission manure removal systems in gestation sow houses.

New Zealand has committed to a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) from 2005 levels by 2030. Dietary changes within New Zealand could simultaneously improve population health and contribute towards the nation’s emissions reduction target, as agricultural emissions are estimated to account for half of New Zealand’s GHGEs (1) . This research aimed to quantify the GHGEs associated with household purchases of major food groups in New Zealand and identify the sociodemographic characteristics that are associated with per capita household dietary emissions. Household dietary emissions were estimated using the NielsenIQ Homescan (R) consumer panel — a large sample of households within New Zealand who report purchasing data of take-home food and beverages. The sample is nationally representative in terms of broad geographical regions and selected key demographic characteristics. Carbon emission estimates were assigned to 1,908,485 total food and beverage purchases from 1,775 households over one year (2019) using a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) dataset initially constructed in the United Kingdom (UK) and adapted for New Zealand (2) . This LCA dataset contains estimates of greenhouse gas emissions generated over the life cycle of the production of food products from the following stages: farming and processing, transit packaging, consumer packaging, transport, warehouse and distribution, refrigeration, and overheads. Greenhouse gas emissions are expressed in kg of carbon dioxide equivalents per kg of food product over a 100-year time horizon. Total emissions from purchases of major food groups were then estimated. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationships between household variables and per capita dietary emissions. Overall purchases of red and processed meat (35%) and dairy products (19%) were responsible for the greatest proportion of emissions. The age group of the primary household shopper as well as household size were predictors of per capita dietary emissions — households with primary shoppers > 65 years had, on average, 33% (95% CI: 20% to 49%) higher per capita dietary emissions, compared to households with primary shoppers 34 years; and every additional household member was associated with, on average, 11% (95% CI: 9% to 13%) lower per capita dietary emissions. We have shown in this large representative sample of New Zealand households that purchases of just two food groups — red and processed meat, and dairy — were responsible for approximately half of dietary greenhouse gas emissions. Larger households had lower per capita dietary greenhouse gas emissions, and older shoppers had relatively higher greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst similar associations have been reported elsewhere more research is needed to confirm these latter findings. With enhanced understanding of the observed association between age of a household’s primary shopper and per capita dietary emissions, interventions may be devised that encourage shoppers to purchase lower-emitting foods, particularly less meat and dairy.

Iron ore reduction using hydrogen instead of coal is a promising technology for minimizing CO2 emissions in the metallurgical industry. In this study, the hydrogen reduction mechanism and kinetics of boron-bearing iron concentrate were investigated in a fluidized bed at 650 ∼ 850 °C, and the reduction data were quantified with an online gas composition analysis technique. The kinetics parameters were calculated using the model-free method and conventional kinetics model, and the mineral phase composition and micromorphology characteristics of reduced products were analyzed. The results showed that the reduction process of boron-bearing iron concentrate in a fluidized bed can be divided into two periods, with the earlier period was controlled by the spherical shrinking model and the later period was controlled by the three-dimensional diffusion model, and the apparent activation energy was significantly increased from 65.22 kJ/mol to 96.11 kJ/mol. Firstly, the magnetite was rapidly reduced to wüstite and dense metallic iron. With an increase in the thickness of the metallic iron layer, the diffusion of oxygen through the dense iron became the rate-limiting step of the reaction, and the defects within the iron layer played a pivotal role in the following mass transfer process. However, the reduction of ludwigite did not suffer from this restriction since the dense product layer was absent.

A company located in South Sulawesi, intends to mitigate emissions from the Power Plant by constructing an environmentally friendly alternative, namely the Floating Solar Power Plant (FSPP), in Towuti. The development plan involves a feasibility analysis for each configuration of the FSPP, considering technological, economic, and environmental criteria. The selection of the preferred configuration is determined using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, based on input from experts. According to this method, the chosen configuration is the on-grid non-battery Floating Solar Power Plant, with a Net Present Value of Rp. 1,431,159,245,752, an Internal Rate of Return of 9.46%, a Payback Period of 8.916 years, a Profitability Ind ex of 1.299, a system efficiency of 21.56%, a carbon footprint of 35,003 kg CO2, and an emission reduction of 9,136,808,273 kg CO2. Decision analysis, involving open and abandonment scenarios based on fluctuations in industrial electricity prices, was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation, yielding a volatility value of 31.2%. The real options analysis recommends abandonment in the twentieth year, with a decision success potential of 38%, based on the results.

This paper studies the intra-day impacts of wind power on wholesale electricity prices and conventional generation in the UK. Exploiting the variations by hour across years from 2008 to 2019, we differentiate the long-run impact of wind power that is largely due to capacity increases and the short-run impact that is primarily driven by weather conditions. The result shows that the expansion of wind energy significantly decreases the electricity price in most hours except the early morning ramp-up and late evening ramp-down hours. We also estimate the substitutional effect of wind energy on conventional generation technologies. Wind generation is found to displace coal and CCGT generation during peak hours. Consequently, this leads to significant reductions in CO2 emissions. The increased wind generation contributed to 24.5MtCO2 reduction per year over the sample period.

Restrictions on high-GWP refrigerants have made the use of transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems widespread. Using transcritical booster refrigeration cycle in warm climates is unsatisfactory due to its high energy consumption. This paper presents theoretical analysis and performance comparison of three different transcritical CO2 supermarket refrigeration cycle configurations with ejector expansion in Türkiye, which has different climatic regions. Bin-hour data were derived using hourly dry-bulb temperature values for provinces from 7 different regions in Türkiye. The applicability of multi-ejectors to each modeled cycle was also investigated. Annual energy consumption and environmental impact reductions of up to 17% were obtained using ejector expansion cycle compared to booster cycle. Ejector expansion cycles achieved higher performance than booster cycle up to 46% in terms of exergy efficiency at investigated ambient temperatures. Unit product exergy costs of the ejector cycles were found up to 28% lower than booster cycle.

The catalytic and electrochemical hydrogenation of CO2 offers the option of a carbon-neutral cycle for sustainable energy and synthesis of value-added chemicals. The synthesized noble metal-free Cu-InO2@rGO nanocomposite has been characterized by various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirming the spherical shape of Cu-InO2 nanoalloy embedded on rGO, the average size calculated by high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) shows Cu-InO2 (∼ 4 nm) alloy is on rGO surface (∼100 nm). The XRD pattern confirms the Face centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure of Cu-InO2@rGO, and Furrier transform- Infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of Cu-In-O exist in the nanomaterials. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) demonstrates an ultra-low potential of -0.9 V vs. SCE. The bulk electrolysis on Cu-InO2@rGO electrocatalyst demonstrated at a potential of -1.1 V vs. SCE to reach HCOOH with a Faradic yield of 76.10%. Electrochemical CO2 reduction on Cu-InO2@rGO is responsible for the variation of adsorption of CO2 intermediates due to controlled selectivity and inhibiting the formation of H2 and CO. In catalytic hydrogenation used as the same catalyst was found, an excellent yield towards HCOOH is 5.5 mmol. Current studies have highlighted the enhancement in activity along with selectivity for product formation could be due to having a capable active interface from electrocatalysts for low cost and proficient production of fuels.

Copper-based materials exhibit significant potential as catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction, owing to their capacity to generate multicarbon hydrocarbons. The molecular functionalization of Cu electrodes represents a simple yet powerful strategy for improving the intrinsic activity of these materials by favoring specific reaction pathways through the creation of tailored microenvironments around the surface active sites. However, despite its success, comprehensive mechanistic insights derived from experimental techniques are often limited, leaving the active role of surface modifiers inconclusive. In this work, we show that N-heterocyclic carbene-carbodiimide-functionalized Cu catalysts display a remarkable activity for multicarbon product formation, surpassing bare Cu electrodes by more than an order of magnitude. These hybrid catalysts operate efficiently using an electrolyzer equipped with a gas diffusion electrode, achieving a multicarbon product selectivity of 58% with a partial current density of ca. −80 mA cm–2. We found that the activity for multicarbon product formation is closely linked to the surface charge that accumulates during electrocatalysis, stemming from surface intermediate buildup. Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we elucidated the role of the molecular additives in altering the electronic structure of the Cu electrodes, promoting the stabilization of surface CO. Additionally, in situ Raman measurements established the identity of the reaction intermediates that accumulate during electrocatalysis, indicating preferential CO binding on Cu step sites, known for facilitating C–C coupling. This study underscores the significant potential of molecular surface modifications in developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, highlighting surface charge as a pivotal descriptor of multicarbon product activity.

Ni single-atom-decorated nitrogen-doped carbon materials (Ni–Nx-C) have demonstrated high efficiency in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to CO. In this study, Ni–Nx-C active sites were embedded within a carbon membrane via an electrospinning and pyrolysis process. The resulting self-supported carbon membrane hosting Ni–Nx-C sites could be directly utilized as an electrode for the CO2RR. To enhance the CO2RR performance of the carbon membrane, the porous structure of the carbon membrane was fine-tuned by incorporating a pore-forming agent. The optimized porous carbon membrane electrode, K0.66-Ni-NC, achieved an impressive CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) of over 90% within a wide potential range from −0.8 to −1.6 V vs RHE for CO2RR. Additionally, it maintained an FECO of above 90% at −0.8 V vs RHE throughout a 30 h durability test in an H-cell. Further analysis has revealed that the porous structure of the carbon membrane not only facilitates the mass transport of CO2 but also increases the level of exposure of active sites during the CO2RR.

As New Zealand moves towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050, multiple factors must be considered including increased electrical load due to electrification, variability of renewable energy generators, required storage capacity, system economics and limitations on grid transmission capacity. Complex and region-specific interactions between the various design choices involved are likely to require an understanding of a range of optimal and near-optimal designs for proposed micro-grid systems as opposed to a single optimal point. This work develops a novel multiscale optimization algorithm for optimization from a univariate capacity optimization approach to a multivariate one. This enhanced algorithm is applied to a grid-connected hybrid energy system consisting of local wind and solar generation, battery storage, and a limited grid connection for industrial and residential loads. This analysis is repeated for current 2023 and forecasted net zero 2050 grid conditions. Development of local generation allows for a 36.8% reduction of levelized cost of electricity in the 2023 case and a 38.6% reduction in the 2050 case. This results in a projected reduction of 19920 tonnes of CO2/yr. The algorithm and methodology developed are broadly applicable to optimization of next-generation energy grids.

A dinucleating 1,8-naphthyridine ligand featuring fluorene-9,9-diyl-linked phosphino side arms (PNNPFlu) was synthesized and used to obtain the cationic dicopper complexes 2, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-Ph)][NTf2]; [NTf2] = bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide, 6, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-CCPh)][NTf2], and 3, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-OtBu)][NTf2]. Complex 3 reacted with diboranes to afford dicopper μ-boryl species (4, with μ-Bcat; cat = catecholate and 5, with μ-Bpin; pin = pinacolate) that are more reactive in C(sp)–H bond activations and toward activations of CO2 and CS2, compared to dicopper μ-boryl complexes supported by a 1,8-naphthyridine-based ligand with di(pyridyl) side arms. The solid-state structures and DFT analysis indicate that the higher reactivities of 4 and 5 relate to changes in the coordination sphere of copper, rather than to perturbations on the Cu–B bonding interactions. Addition of xylyl isocyanide (CNXyl) to 4 gave 7, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-Bcat)(CNXyl)][NTf2], demonstrating that the lower coordination number at copper is chemically significant. Reactions of 4 and 5 with CO2 yielded the corresponding dicopper borate complexes (8, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-OBcat)][NTf2]; 9, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ-OBpin)][NTf2]), with 4 demonstrating catalytic reduction in the presence of excess diborane. Related reactions of 4 and 5 with CS2 provided insertion products 10, {[(PNNPFlu)Cu2]2[μ-S2C(Bcat)2]}[NTf2]2, and 11, [(PNNPFlu)Cu2(μ,κ2-S2CBpin)][NTf2], respectively. These products feature Cu–S–C–B linkages analogous to those of proposed CO2 insertion intermediate.

Oxygen vacancies (OV) in nonmetallic plasmonic photocatalysts can decrease the energy barrier for CO2 reduction, boosting C1 intermediate production for potential C2 formation. However, their susceptibility to oxidation weakens C1 intermediate adsorption. Herein we proposed a "photoelectron injection" strategy to safeguard OV in W18O49 by creating a W18O49/ZIS (W/Z) plasmonic photocatalyst.

Oxygen vacancies (OV) in nonmetallic plasmonic photocatalysts can decrease the energy barrier for CO2 reduction, boosting C1 intermediate production for potential C2 formation. However, their susceptibility to oxidation weakens C1 intermediate adsorption. Herein we proposed a "photoelectron injection" strategy to safeguard OV in W18O49 by creating a W18O49/ZIS (W/Z) plasmonic photocatalyst. Moreover, photoelectrons contribute to the local multi‐electron environment of W18O49, enhancing the intrinsic excitation of its hot electrons with extended lifetimes, as confirmed by in‐situ XPS and femtosecond transient absorption analysis.

To cope with the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental problems, the transformation from traditional energy to renewable energy is urgent. Solar-driven thermochemical conversion of CO2 and H2O into renewable fuels technology provides a favorable path for alternative energy. However, the temperature/pressure swing required for the reduction and oxidation steps during thermochemical process incurs irreversible energy losses and severe material stresses. Moreover, the two-step redox cycle mode cannot achieve a continuous fuel production in the reactor. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel design of thermochemical reactor integrated with heat recovery for continuous production of renewable fuels. In this design, an oxygen-conducting ceria membrane is employed to conduct oxygen ions, electrons and vacancies induced by the oxygen chemical potential gradient to achieve an isothermal and continuous splitting of CO2 and H2O. At the fuel production side, a counter-flow and tube-in-tube alumina reticulate porous ceramic filling heat exchange design is developed to recover the sensible heat of gas products and excessive reactants. In addition, a comprehensive model is developed by coupling the computational dynamics of flow, radiation, conduction and convection, and is solved by the Monte Carlo method coupled with ANSYS FLUENT software through User-defined Functions. Results indicate that the integrating membrane reactor/heat recovery design can not only realize continuous production of renewable fuels, but also recover sensible heat of gas products, which is beneficial for conversion of solar energy to chemical energy. Optimizing heat recovery design can help reactor achieve a solar-to-fuel efficiency of 10.58%. Moreover, if the theoretical CO2 conversion rate could be achieved, the solar-to-fuel efficiency of reactor can reach as high as 40.43%, which means that such a reactor design has a huge potential in conversion of solar energy into renewable fuels.

The growing population with every passing day sets an alarming situation with respect to the conservation climate protocols. The increasing needs of society also demand a significant enhancement in the manufacturing capacity to augment the situation. However, it's a stringent requirement of the hour to propose sustainable and clean manufacturing processes to realize the goal of carbon neutrality to support a healthy life on the earth. Specifically, the processes that are energy intensive like electric discharge machining (EDM) are of serious concern regarding sustainability viewpoint. The role of the said process cannot be essentially eliminated as advent of new materials of superior characteristics demand the application of EDM for accurate cutting of intricate profiles. Nevertheless, the commonly used oil-based dielectric (kerosene) in EDM releases aerosol, deposit particles, oxides of carbon (CO2 & CO), thus contributing to the environmental contamination. It is pertinent to mention that industries are compelled to tune their processes to achieve the goals of Net-Zero. Therefore, this study thoroughly investigates the potential of nano-graphene mixed rice bran oil to make the EDM process cleaner and sustainable which has never been investigated so far. Moreover, the process has been successfully modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) and optimized by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) which is another novel aspect of this study as it eradicates the need of extensive experimentation. Experimentation has been performed via Taguchi's experimental strategy followed by a detailed explanation of the findings based on process physics. In comparison to the traditional dielectric an improvement of 98.8% in material removal rate (MRR) and 93.9% reduction in specific energy consumption (SEC) are realized if the said novel combination is applied without compromising the quality. CO2 emissions determined for both rice bran oil and kerosene oil have revealed that rice bran oil provides 99.96% lesser CO2 emission in comparison to its counterpart.

Target conditioning is a crucial ingredient of high-power extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source operation in state-of-the-art nanolithography. It involves deforming tin microdroplets into tens of nanometer-thin sheets, sheets which are subsequently irradiated by intense CO2 laser radiation to form a hot, EUV-emitting plasma. Recent experiments have found that a substantial fraction of the initial droplet mass is lost in the deformation phase through fragmentation. The goal of the present study is to investigate, using radiation-hydrodynamic modeling, how variations in the sheet mass affect EUV source power and the laser-to-in-band conversion efficiency (CE). It is found that high-mass sheets can “feed” the plasma with sufficient mass to sustain the production of in-band-emitting charge states over the course of laser irradiation. Low-mass sheets, on the contrary, cannot supply enough mass to sustain this production over the pulse, thus leading to a reduction in in-band power and CE. The dependence of CE on laser energy and target thickness is quantified, and a rather weak reduction of CE with increasing laser energy for high-mass sheets is identified.

The selectivity of multicarbon products in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the spin alignment of neighboring active sites, which requires a spin catalyst that facilitates electron transfer with antiparallel spins for enhanced C‐C coupling. Here, we design a radical‐contained spin catalyst (TEMPOL@HKUST‐1) to enhance CO2‐to‐ethylene conversion, in which spin‐disordered (SDO) and spin‐ordered (SO) phases co‐exist to construct an asymmetric spin configuration of neighboring active sites. The replacement of axially coordinated H2O molecules with TEMPOL radicals introduces spin‐spin interactions among the Cu(II) centers to form localized SO phases within the original H2O‐mediated SDO phases. Therefore, TEMPOL@HKUST‐1 derived catalyst exhibited an approximately two‐fold enhancement in ethylene selectivity during the CO2RR at ‐1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl compared to pristine HKUST‐1. In situ ATR‐SEIRAS spectra indicate that the spin configuration at asymmetric SO/SDO sites significantly reduces the kinetic barrier for *CO intermediate dimerization toward the ethylene product. The performance of the spin catalyst is further improved by spin alignment under a magnetic field, resulting in a maximum ethylene selectivity of more than 50%. The exploration of the spin‐polarized kinetics of the CO2RR provides a promising path for the development of novel spin electrocatalysts with superior performance.

To ensure a fair and extensive comparison of different heating systems four representative buildings including their heat demand for space heating and domestic hot water were defined. A model for the heat production costs has been developed based on existing methods like the VDI 2067 part 1 [1] and the simplified approach for the calculation of the "Levelised Cost of Heat" (LCoH) of the IEA SHC Task 54 "Price Cost reduction in solar thermal systems" [2]. The developed model includes the costs of purchase, installation, operation, maintenance and disposal and was implemented in an EXCEL calculation tool which enables the calculation of the total life cycle costs (LCC), the levelized cost of heat (LCoH) and the CO2 emissions over the lifetime of the system.

The carbon‐free chemical storage and release of renewable energy is an important task to drastically reduce CO2 emissions. The high specific energy density of iron and its recyclability makes it a promising storage material. Energy release by oxidation with air can be realized by the combustion of micron‐sized iron powders in retro‐fitted coal fired power plants and in fixed‐bed reactors under milder conditions. An experimental parameter study of iron powder oxidation with air was conducted based on thermogravimetric analysis in combination with wide‐angle X‐ray scattering and Mössbauer spectroscopy. In agreement with literature the oxidation was found to consist of a very fast initial oxidation of the outer particle layer followed by much slower oxidation due to diffusion of iron ions through the Fe2O3/Fe3O4 layer being the ratelimiting step. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the iron particle before and after oxidation reveal a strong particle morphology transformation. This impact on the reaction was studied by cyclization experiments. Up to 10 oxidation‐reduction cycles show that both, oxidation and reduction rates, increase strongly with cycling due to increased porosity.

Abstract Drilling operations generate CO2 emissions from diesel fuel used to power generators and other equipment on drilling rigs as extraction activities create around 10-15% of total energy-related emissions globally, an equivalent of 5 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Improving operational efficiency is crucial for reducing overall emissions and combating climate change. Therefore, recognizing more efficient approaches and solutions with reduced carbon footprints is essential in creating future business continuity. This paper presents the application of machine learning optimization techniques in carbon emission management through technical limit performance benchmark. A Machine Learning (ML) model utilizing basic drilling parameters such as weight on bit (WOB), rotary speed (RPM), penetration rate (ROP), and torque (TOR) was used to estimate instantaneous Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) within the technical limit of operational performance across the different Lithologies. Supervised learning algorithm with 70:30 data splits using four ML algorithms, including Random Forest, support vector regression, artificial neural network (ANN), and Categories boost, was utilized in the prediction. The estimation was then leveraged to determine the maximum achievable penetration rate baseline for various lithologies based on rock drillability. Enabling a comparative assessment between actual drilling performance against an engineered technical limit drill rate performance as well as the expected greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). A case study using a field dataset showed that the models predicted instantaneous UCS based on the low- cost drilling parameters other than using the high-cost well-log and core sample techniques. Prediction accuracy was within the acceptable margin of error with CatBoost and ANN as best predictors, with correlation coefficient (R2 ) values of 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. The defined baseline performance benchmark improved drilling performance by 30-60% with a reduction in CO2 emissions across the project by 20 tCO2e emissions, equivalent to a 50% reduction in carbon emissions. The result of this research is essential for the continuous improvement in drilling carbon emission, performance monitoring, and improvement of overall drilling performance.

During COP26, Canada joined the Global Methane Pledge aiming to reduce global methane (CH4) emissions by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. Rapid reduction of anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the atmosphere is considered one of the most effective strategies to slow global warming in concert with carbon dioxide mitigation measures. In Canada, a large part of anthropogenic CH4 emissions can be attributed to the oil and gas industry in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), which is the fourth largest reserve of fossil fuel in the world. Recent studies highlighted big discrepancies between CH4 emissions reported in Canada's National Inventory and emissions estimated with approaches using atmospheric measurements for the oil and gas sector. Measuring the isotopic signature of CH4 (δ13CH4) at different atmospheric monitoring stations and comparing these measurements to detailed archives of δ13CH4 from oil and gas wells and associated CH4 leaks in the WCSB could help better characterize the emissions from different CH4 sources over the region. In this study, we compare two independent sets of data: (1) thousands of δ13CH4 of samples from oil and gas production wells and their associated leaks (surface casing vents and ground migration) collected across the WCSB, and (2) atmospheric mixing ratios of CH4 and their δ13CH4 measured successively at three locations across this region between 2016 and 2020 combined with their atmospheric footprints modeled with HYSPLIT-STILT. We observed a gradient in the isotopic signatures of the oil and gas samples within the WCSB with δ13CH4 being more depleted in the Southeast than in the Northwest. The analysis of these samples showed that the isotopic signature of CH4 emitted by the production of fossil fuel depends on the geological formations from which it is extracted. Also, CH4 isotopic signatures vary more depending on the region where CH4 comes from than on the type of fossil fuel extracted (natural gas, oil, heavy oil, shale gas). The atmospheric measurements showed a strong seasonality of δ13CH4 at one of the atmospheric monitoring sites with isotopic signatures associated with thermogenic sources in winter and isotopic signatures associated with a mix of biogenic and thermogenic sources in summer. Using the δ13CH4 archive database from oil and gas samples, we estimated that 28 to 39 % of the CH4 emitted near this site in summer was coming from a biogenic source (most likely wetlands). Ultimately, atmospheric measurements collected during winter combined with their associated HYSPLIT-STILT footprints presented a spatial distribution of δ13CH4 over the WCSB comparable to the one observed in the archive database from the oil and gas sector, confirming that the oil and gas sector is the main source of CH4 in this region.

Poor clearances, misalignments, and carbon deposits in a turbocharger due to high running hours can decrease engine efficiency. This study analyzes the effects of turbocharger reconditioning on the performance and emissions formation of a marine diesel generator engine. The engine test experiments were performed on a university training ship's auxiliary diesel engine with 4309 running hours before and after the TC overhaul. As a result, cylinder peak pressure was increased by a maximum of 3.57 % while fuel saving of 5–8 g/kWh was realized. Lower exhaust gas temperatures and improved charge air pressure by up to 7.7 % were recorded. A significant CO emission reduction of 21.6 % was recorded at idle load whereas NOx and CO2 emissions were reduced to a maximum of 4.86 % and 7.30 % at 50 % engine load. The results indicate that scheduled TC overhaul and maintenance are very useful to improve the engine's fuel economy, and performance and reduce exhaust emissions.

The use of biopolymers has received research attention for the stabilization and erosion control of course-grained soils. However, there are questions remaining on the long-term stability of biopolymer-treated soils under drying and wetting cycles. This work focuses on the performance of xanthan gum (XG) for improving mechanical properties of sands. Biopolymer-treated samples were subjected to cyclic drying/wetting according to the ASTM D559/D559M-15 code designed for soil-cement mixtures. The samples were dissected after each cycle to study the mechanism and progression of the failure. The biopolymer was extracted and studied using rheological and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The outer crust of the specimen seems to prevent intrusion of water inside the sample due to its low hydraulic conductivity. Rheological investigations indicate a reduction in the yield stress of the biopolymer gel in this crust compared to the rest of the specimen. FTIR showed the appearance of adsorbed CO2, which could indicate biological degradation.

The tri-nuclear Pt(II)-Ru(II)-Pt(II)(RuPt2) and Re(I)-Ru(II)-Re(II)(RuRe2) complexes, synthesized from mononuclear Ru(II) complex were explored for efficient energy conversion through water splitting and CO2 reduction. The catalysts show excellent activity, serving as promising platforms for sustainable energy applications. The study focuses on designing, stepwise synthesis of the catalysts with insights into the multiple components’ contribution to enhanced catalytic performance. Photophysical and electrochemical analyses highlight the role of the complexes as photocatalysts, where the Ru(II)-polypyridyl unit acts as photosensitizer and the Pt(II)/ Re(I)-polypyridyl units as catalytic sites. Synergistic effects among the components lead to stability, improved performance and emphasizes the significance of multi-nuclear M-Ru(II)-M[M= Pt(II), Re(I)] catalysts in promoting cleaner and more sustainable energy sources.

Solar energy absorption and storage of integrated ceramic materials is both the absorption of sunlight and storage of sunlight into thermal energy functional materials. In this paper, the effect of Fe2O3 on the solar absorptivity, thermal storage properties, sintering temperature, and physical properties of mullite-based thermal storage ceramics was investigated. The results show that the absorptivity and thermal storage density of the sample AF4 (Bauxite:50 wt%, Clay:50 wt%, Fe2O3:11 wt%) after sintering at 1420 °C are 87.2% and 1116.5 kJ kg−1, respectively; and the unit volume of the AF4 sample can provide the power grid with 918.01 kW h of electricity, save 112.91 kg of coal, and reduce 361.33 kg of CO2 emission. This study systematically elucidated the mechanism of the enhancement of sample absorption caused by Fe3+ doping-induced changes in substrate color, reduction in material forbidden bandwidth, and lattice anharmonic vibration effect, in addition to comprehensively evaluating the feasibility of the optimal AF4 sample for use in solar energy absorbing and storing integrated ceramic materials.

Choosing environmentally benign strategy in product manufacturing is a relevant need that has been influencing all the industrial sectors aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This necessity often collides with the production costs. A different design strategy based on a multi-material approach can result in an economic efficiency playing, at the same time, a fundamental role in reducing the environmental footprint. Taking into account this scenario, an optimisation study was proposed focusing on the minimisation of both costs and environmental impacts of a car's lead anti-intrusion side door inside beam (SDIB) manufactured using a multi-material approach. The materials takeable into account in the executed design strategy were a carbon steel, an aluminium alloy, and a carbon fibre reinforced polymer. The objective of the work was to find a balance between cost efficiency and environmental sustainability throughout the entire product life cycle. Specifically, the input variables in the optimisation analysis were energy consumption, CO2 emissions, resource use and direct production costs. The model was developed taking these multiple factors into account and making possible the minimisation of costs and environmental impact, simultaneously respecting, at the same time, the required product performance.

There is a lack of research in the literature on the application of nanoparticles to different cascade cycle configurations with environmental refrigerants in ultra-low temperature refrigeration applications. This study is the first on the use of nano-refrigerants in cascade refrigeration cycles. In this study, the effect of 2 wt. % of CuO to RE170 and R170-pure refrigerant utilization in cascade vapor compression refrigeration cycle (CVCRC), cascade ejector refrigeration cycle (CERC) and cascade ejector intercooler refrigeration cycle (CEIRC) are investigated to achieve higher performance values in ultra-low temperature applications. For CVCRC, CERC and CEIRC, the increases in terms of coefficient of performance (COP) with the use of nano-refrigerant were found to be 12.77%, 8.20%, and 6.37%, respectively, and 18.55%, 14.05%, and 6.07%, for exergy efficiency. Upon scrutinizing the results with nano-refrigerant in relation to the COP, the analysis revealed that the CEIRC cycle exhibited an improvement ranging from 13.43% to 20.49% in comparison to CERC. Additionally, with nano-refrigerant, the CEIRC cycle demonstrated an increase ranging from 42.39% to 75.41% when compared to CVCRC in COP. It was observed that the utilization of CEIRC led to a 13.03% decrease in kg CO2 emissions in compared to CERC and a reduction of 32.53% compared to CVCRC with using nano-refrigerant.

湖泊、河流等内陆水体是连接陆地生态系统和海洋的"长程碳环路"的重要节点,也是温室气体二氧化碳(CO2)排放源,在调节陆地、海洋间的碳迁移转换中发挥着重要作用。相对于自然水体,城市水体因面积小、水深浅且受监测方法限制,水-气界面碳通量经常被忽略。为探讨我国亚热带城市水体温室气体排放特征,本研究以湖南省长沙市典型城市水体,包括洋湖、西湖、松雅湖、月湖4个湖泊和湘江长沙段为研究对象,分别于2022年4和10月采用光化学反馈-腔增强吸收光谱法(OF-CEAS)和扩散模型法对水-气界面CO2通量进行对比测定。结果表明,长沙城市湖泊与河流春季为CO2排放源,秋季为吸收汇,河流水-气界面CO2通量呈显著季节差异。河湖之间CO2通量在春季表现为显著差异,秋季差异不显著。CO2通量与水体溶解氧、水体总氮浓度等呈显著正相关。2种方法的CO2通量对比测定在湖泊上显著相关,但对河流而言相关性不显著。研究揭示的城市湖泊与河流CO2气体的排放特征有利于深入探究城市水体碳的迁移转化,可对全面了解全球气候变化过程和河湖湿地温室气体减排和调控提供科学支撑。;Inland water bodies, such as lakes and rivers, are important nodes of the long-range carbon loop connecting terrestrial ecosystems and oceans, as well as sources of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Inland water bodies also play an important role in regulating carbon migration between land and sea. Compared with natural water bodies, carbon fluxes at the water-air interface are often overlooked in urban water due to their small sizes, shallow depths, and limitations in monitoring methods. In order to explore the greenhouse gas emission characteristics of such water bodies in China, this study took four typical urban water bodies in Changsha, Hunan Province, including Lake Yang, Lake West, Lake Songya and Lake Yue, and Changsha section of Xiangjiang River as research objects. The CO2 fluxes at the water-gas interface were measured by laser-based gas analyzer that used optical feedback-cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (OF-CEAS) and diffusion model in April and October 2022, respectively. Results showed that lakes and rivers in Changsha city were CO2 sources in spring but CO2 sinks in fall, and there was a significant seasonal difference in CO2 fluxes at the river water-air interface. Moreover, the CO2 flux was positively correlated with the content of dissolved oxygen and total nitrogen. The comparative determination of CO2 fluxes between the two methods was significantly correlated on lakes, but not on rivers. The study reveals that the CO2 emission characteristics of urban lakes and rivers are beneficial to the in-depth investigation of carbon transport and transformation, which can provide scientific support for the comprehensive understanding of global climate change processes and the reduction and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in inland wetlands.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of semicrystalline poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is hindered by the hydrophobic nature and crystallinity of the substrate, and it highly depends on the available interfacial area between substrate and aqueous phase. While most studies leverage particle size reduction to increase interfacial area, this study investigates the use of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) to increase internal surface area in PET, and its impact on the enzymatic hydrolysis yields. Our work shows that scCO2 pretreatment of semicrystalline PET resulted in up to 2-fold higher terephthalic acid (TPA) yield relative to the untreated counterpart using Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC) enzyme. There is a positive correlation between the total pore surface area in the scCO2-pretreated PET samples and the final TPA yield. In addition, preliminary kinetic studies revealed faster initial production of TPA for scCO2-treated PET relative to untreated PET. ScCO2-treated PET samples showed no significant changes in the crystalline content and thermal properties. However, NMR data indicated that scCO2-treated PET has a slightly higher apparent number-average molecular weight (Mn) relative to that of untreated PET. Overall, scCO2 pretreatment led to increased semicrystalline PET susceptibility to HiC enzyme action, resulting in increased TPA yields.

This research examines the potential impact on the procurement sustainability of replacing steel rebars with Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) rebars in the construction industry, focusing on screed pre-cast hollow core topping in a project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted using One Click LCA (Version 0.26.0) software for cradle-to-grave analysis. The assessment covers various stages, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, usage, and recycling. The comprehensive LCA highlights GFRP rebars as a more sustainable alternative to steel, emitting 17% less CO2 equivalent (2e) per kilogram throughout its life cycle. Additionally, GFRP requires substantially less mass compared to steel, resulting in a dramatic reduction in CO2e emissions ranging from 77.89% to 85.26% across different spacing configurations in real-world construction scenarios, as presented in this research case study. These findings suggest that GFRP rebars offer a promising solution for reducing the environmental impact of construction activities while potentially yielding significant cost savings over the project’s life cycle. Integrating environmental considerations into material selection processes can prioritize sustainability without compromising performance or safety, contributing to a more sustainable future for the construction industry globally.

The existing gaps in achieving net zero emissions within the palm oil industry in Malaysia is yet to be studied. Moreover, there are limited studies that evaluate the potential of palm oil biomass utilisation pathways based on emissions reduction capabilities, the cost of emissions reduction, and the technology readiness for implementation. This study analysed decarbonisation pathways for the upstream and midstream segments of the palm oil sector in Malaysia, encompassing oil palm plantations and palm oil mills. Various sources of greenhouse gas emissions in oil palm plantations and palm oil mills were identified and estimates of emissions were determined as theoretical emissions. The current emissions were established based on current best practice in the plantation and mill. Several biomass conversion technologies for the recovery of palm-based by-products and conversion into value-added product to decarbonise the palm oil sector and evaluated strategies to attain net-zero status are considered. In this work, the analysis considered both the existing technologies that are adopted by plantations and mills as well as the emerging technologies that have scope for implementation. With the proposed approach, the current emissions level for crude palm oil (CPO) production in Malaysia is estimated as 1,121.49 kg CO2-eq/t CPO. In current industry practice, empty fruit bunch (EFB) is underutilised as mills are typically located at rural areas with lack of suitable transportation. Besides, the lack of accessibility to the grid also limits the potential of conversion of EFB to electricity for national grid. This work examined various pathways for EFB utilisation under different scenarios evaluating their contribution potential towards net zero target in an energy self-sustained CPO production. As shown in the results, converting EFB to briquette and pellet able to achieve net-zero objective. Furthermore, EFB-biochar and EFB-syngas pathways also exhibit the potential to accomplish the net-zero target. Note that this work also assessed the technologies' readiness levels, identified challenges in implementation, and proposed several recommendations.

Integrating microbial fuel cells (MFC) into constructed wetland systems (CW) has been an efficient wastewater treatment to improve the pollutants removal and regenerate power energy. This study fabricated a sludge biochar material (SBM) to sequestrate the carbon of residual sludge. Thereafter used SBM and modified SBM as the substrate materials to construct three groups of CW-MFC for decreasing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. The water quality improvement in removal efficiency achieved (2.59 %, 3.10 %, 5.21 % for COD; 3.31 %, 3.60 %, 6.71 % for TN; 1.80 %, 7.38 %, 4.93 % for TP) by the application of MFC, SBM, and modified SBM in wastewater treatment, respectively. Additionally, the reduction in global warming potential (GWP) realized 17.2 %, 42.2 %, and 64.4 % resulting from these applications. The carbon flow and fate diagrams showed MFC shifted the gas phase‑carbon flow from CH4 to CO2, and SBM promoted this shift trends. Microbial diversity indicated enrichment of electrochemically active bacteria (EAB), denitrifying bacteria, and phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) by SBM. Metabolic pathways analysis showed that introduction of MFC and SBM exhibited significant increases of key functional genes in metabolic pathway of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). This study highlights the benefit of CW-MFC in and provides a new strategy for removing pollutants and abating GHG emissions in wastewater treatment.

Abstract The strategic target and path to peak CO2 emissions and carbon neutrality, which have been initiated by several countries over the last decade, considerably affected whole energy industry especially oil and natural gas fields. The recoverable shale-gas reserves of Sichuan Basin in China is beyond 1.0×1012 m3. Environmental pollution and carbon emission issues caused by diesel-powered operations cannot be ignored. The electrification of upstream operations has been concerned and applied only in production, processing and transportation. Electrification work towards shale gas was still faced with poor economy when large-power operations such as drilling and fracturing are performed. Due to unpredictable developing progress and high energy-consuming operation, power supply and load demand forecast is quite challenging. Existing operations using coal-based power generation negatively affects environmental-social-governance (ESG) initiatives without green renewable energy. One ESG path to green production and recommended practices towards electrifying recovery were proposed in this paper. Fully electric-powered equipment (2500HHP to 7000HHP pumping units, blending units, manifold etc.) was widely used with 35kV customized power grids. Due to great hydropower in Sichuan Basin, power generation exhibits seasonal fluctuation and focused on peak electricity consumption for civilian use in summer and winter. The hydropower and energy-storage sharing with data centers was applied to deal with seasonal energy supply and fluctuating load especially fracturing operations with great economic advantages. Electrical load variation and power gap between supply and demand were precisely forecasted through machine-learning algorithms under different conditions of drilling and fracturing. At the end of 2022 shale-gas production in Sichuan Basin has increased to 1.39×1010 m3. Hydropower proportion has accounted for 72% of power consumption for shale-gas development with 19 newly-constructed transformer substations, 1145.7 km of 35kV grids and 1197 MVA of grid capacity. The fully electric-powered operation reached almost 40% of all operating pads. It was estimated that hydrocarbon fuels of 6.1×105 ton were replaced and CO2 emission reduction reached more than 7.7×105 ton so far. The detailed recommended practices and lessons learnt from electrifying shale-gas recovery were guidable for the recovery of other unconventional resources.

Abstract This study assessed the capacity of a novel consensus bacterial 6-phytase variant (PhyG) to maintain growth performance of weaned pigs when added to a nutrient-reduced mixed cereal diet with two levels of dietary net energy (NE) reduction applied. A total of 360 newly weaned pigs [Greater York × Norsvin Landrace; initial body weight (BW) 8.4 ± 0.78 kg] were assigned to 60 floor-pens and 5 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design. There were 2 blocks (weaning group), 6 replicate pens per block, and 6 pigs/pen (3 male, 3 female), in total of 12 replications per treatment. Diets were based on wheat, corn, barley, and soybean meal and were offered to pigs in 2 phases in pelleted form (0–14 and 14–35 d post-weaning). Treatments comprised a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC) and 4 negative control (NC) diets supplemented with PhyG. The NC diets were reduced in digestible P, Ca, Na, and digestible amino acids vs. PC, according to the expected contribution of PhyG added at 1,000 phytase units (FTU)/kg (NC1) or 2,000 FTU/kg (NC2), respectively. Each NC1 and NC2 was formulated at two NE reduction levels, designated ‘low’ and ‘high’ (‘low’: -53 to -65 kcal/kg and ‘high’: -73 to -86 kcal/kg, vs. PC at 1,000 and 2,000 FTU/kg PhyG, respectively). Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Means separation was by Tukey’s HSD test. During both phases and overall (0–35 d), average BW, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient- and NE-reduced treatments, were either not different or were improved compared with the PC. Overall ADG, ADFI, and final BW (d 35) were greater in NC2+PhyG 2,000 FTU/kg ‘low’ vs. PC (466 vs. 424 g, 9.9%, 622 vs. 567 g, 9.7%, and 24.7 vs. 23.1 kg, 6.9%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Total feed costs (ingredients price, February 2023) and estimated carbon footprint (CFP; FeedPrint, WUR, The Netherland) per kilogram of BW gain (BWG) were reduced in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient- and NE-reduced treatments vs. PC. Feed costs saving per kg BWG were greater with ‘high’ than ‘low’ NE reduction applied (-0.013 vs. -0.007 €, respectively, vs. PC) with PhyG at 1,000 FTU/kg, and it was greatest in NC2+PhyG 2,000 FTU/kg with ‘low’ NE reduction (-0.036 € vs. PC). Similarly, the CFP was reduced from 2,068 to 1,840 g CO2 eq/kg BWG (-11 %) by NC2+PhyG 2,000 FTU/kg with ‘low’ NE reduction vs. PC. In conclusion, the application of a full nutrient matrix with ‘high’ or ‘low’ NE reduction combined with supplementation of PhyG maintained growth performance of weaned pigs and reduced the total feed costs and carbon footprint per kg BW gain, lead to production and sustainability benefits.

Abstract The majority of oil production at the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) rely on Electrical Submersible Pumping (ESP) systems. One such reservoir in Kuwait with over than 120 producing well equipped with electrical submersible Pumps are exposed to a harsh production environments including corrosive fluids (sweet corrosion due to presence of Co2). Historical data shows that over 40% of all pulled Electrical Submersible Pumps where dismantle inspection and failure analysis (DIFA) were performed in the past 4 to 5 years within the field have failed due to corrosion within the well completion (mainly corrosion in the tubing) or in Electrical Submersible Pump components. When analyzing existing data (reservoir, design, equipment specifications, operation and DIFA) the majority of failed wells equipped with Electrical Submersible Pump show signs of corrosion in the tubing although they rarely appear on the ESP components. Further analysis shows that 80% of these completion (mainly tubing) failures occur between 4 to 18 months where the tubing used in these cases are all found to be of carbon steel metallurgy. Sweet corrosion is one of the major issues for wells equipped with electrical submersible Pump in one of reservoir located in Kuwait. An increase in water cut percentages in the reservoir has led to increased CO2 corrosion rate in the saline formation water (high chloride level). The collected data shows that more than 40% of all pulled electrical submersible Pumps where DIFA have been performed were due to corrosion in the completion components (mainly corrosion hole in the tubing). As a proactive measure, KOC have been installing Internally Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) lined carbon steel tubing for wells that have corrosion related tubing failures. In additional, KOC decided to enhance the Electrical Submersible Pump components specifications to mitigate the risk related to sweet corrosion. This paper shows a field study for 36 cases where Internally Glass Reinforced Epoxy lined carbon steel tubing were used on existing failed wells due to corrosion to evaluate the effectiveness of using GRE lined tubing when exposed to the same harsh environments (sweet corrosion) and the resulting equipment run life. When compared with conventional carbon steel tubing, a significant increase in run life and reduction of numbers of completion failures are recorded. Over all, the average run life for all cases has improved by over 422 days. This study will help ESP operators facing similar challenges to understand the effectiveness of using Internally Glass Reinforced Epoxy lined carbon steel tubing as a replacement for conventional carbon steel tubing towards mitigating sweet corrosion environments.

For the aviation sector, it is extremely important to devise revolutionary solutions in the field of technology to restrain the potential impact of civil aviation on the environment to the level of the established strategic goals of ACARE (FlightPath2050). The introduction of innovative technologies (improvement of the combustion chamber, the introduction of electric hybrid power plants on airplanes, and the use of alternative aviation fuel) will ensure the sustainable growth of air transportation. To assess the effectiveness of advanced technologies, it is extremely important to have a model for calculating global/local emissions that takes into account the parameters of the flight path of conventional and hybrid aircraft, operational characteristics of the aircraft engine and hybrid powerplant, and the features of sustainable fuel. The improved module for calculating emission indices by combining the module for calculating the parameters of the flight path and the results of calculating the thermogas-dynamic calculation of the aircraft engine makes it possible to detect the influence of fuel consumption (engine thrust) on the values of the emission indices. This feature is representative for evaluating the efficiency of hybrid powerplants because the electrification of the aircraft fleet is primarily aimed at reducing fuel consumption. The analysis of simulation results reveals that the fuel consumption and EINOx are significantly reduced (for the climb stage – 25 %; for the descent stage – 30 %) for the hybrid AN26 compared to the conventional AN26. The specified operational measure, in the part of the low-pitch descend, significantly reduces EICO for the hybrid AN26 by an average of 50 % compared to the descend stage for the conventional trajectory. The results of calculations for the entire flight path demonstrate that the use of a hybrid power plant for An26 contributes to an average reduction of fuel consumption by 10 %, NOx emissions by 25 %, water vapor emissions by 10 %, and CO2 by 10 %.

Background and aims To assess development of a robust emissions accounting framework for expansive miombo woodland savannas covering ~2 million km2 of southern Africa that typically are burnt under relatively severe late dry season (LDS) conditions. Methods A detailed site-based study of fuel accumulation, combustion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factor parameters under early dry season (EDS) and LDS conditions along a central rainfall-productivity and associated miombo vegetation structural and floristics gradient, from lower rainfallsites in northern Botswana to higher rainfall sites in northern Zambia. Key results Assembled field data inform core components of the proposed emissions reduction framework: fuel and combustion conditions sampled across the vegetation/productivity gradient can be represented by three defined Vegetation Fuel Types (VFTs); fuel accumulation, combustion and emissions parameters are presented for these. Applying this framework for an illustrative case, GHG emissions (t CO2-e) from EDS fires were one-third to half those of LDS fires per unit area in eligible miombo VFTs. Conclusions Our accounting framework supports undertaking EDS fire management to significantly reduce emissions and, realistically, burnt extent at landscape scales. We consider application of presented data to development of formal emissions abatement accounting methods, linkages with potential complementary woody biomass and soil organic carbon sequestration approaches, and necessary caveats concerning implementation issues.

The Shimensi super-large tungsten polymetallic deposit is located in Late Jurassic- Early Cretaceous Porphyry-Skarn tungsten ore belt in the south Yangtze metallogenic belt. There are 3 types of mineralization: veinlet-disseminated type, thick quartze vein type and hydrothermal crypto-explosive breccia type. Based on geological studies, this paper presents new petrographic, microthermometric, laser Raman spectroscopic and hydrogen and oxygen isotope research of the fluid inclusions from the deposit. The results show that there are five different types of fluid inclusions: liquid-rich inclusions, vapor-rich inclusions, pure liquid inclusions, pure vapor inclusions, and fluid inclusions containing a solid crystal. The homogenization temperatures of the fluid inclusion range from 140℃-270℃, the salinities are 3%-5% NaCleq and the densities of ore-forming fluid range from 0.64 g/cm3 to 0.99 g/cm3. For the analyses of Laser Raman spectroscopic, the ore-forming fluids can be approximated by a Ca2+-Na+-SO42--Cl- fluid system with small amount of CO2, CH4 and N2. Otherwise, the datas of the pressure, pH and Eh show a fluid metallogenic environment of low pressure, weak acid and weak reduction. The values of the homogenization temperature in 3 types of orebodies suggest that the mineralization is characterized by the decrease of the temperature under the condition of the fluid immiscibility. The H-O isotope values are interpreted to indicate that the ore-forming fluids are mainly composed of magmatic water, and also the meteoric water was added with the process of the magma rising.

In recent years, the level of digitalization and intelligence in the energy sector has profoundly changed the management mode of the energy sector. However, in the process of promoting the digital transformation of the energy sector, we also face some difficulties. One of the main manifestations is the lack of energy data sharing, and the difficulty of realizing the convergence and integration of various types of energy data. In addition, there is insufficient mastery of customer-side energy use data and a lag in the perception of customer demand, which requires the improvement and enhancement of energy efficiency diagnosis and energy saving services. At the same time, we have not yet established advanced digital technology monitoring means to grasp the user’s energy use and carbon emissions in real time. Therefore, this paper proposes the study of high-precision accounting methods for regional carbon emissions under the carbon peak goal. Based on the energy consumption and production activities of each region, a greenhouse gas emission inventory is compiled, so that carbon emissions can be accurately calculated. The high-precision accounting method of carbon emissions is analyzed, and by establishing a more complete database and model, and constructing a regional online monitoring system under the peak carbon target, we aim to improve the efficiency of data acquisition and processing, as well as how to combine carbon emission accounting with the peak carbon target, in order to provide support for the formulation of a more effective emission reduction policy. The testing experiments after flow and CO2 concentration measurements show that the accuracy of the experiments on regional carbon emissions is as high as 97.5%.

Radiation from the sun, the level of water, insulating material, and the temperature differential across the water and glass all affect the effectiveness of solar still. In this study, the effect of internal sidewall reflector (ISR), simultaneous thermoelectric heating and cooling system (STHCS), hollow circular fins (HCFs), and nano-CuO mixed PCM (NMPCM) in a double slope SS of four cases: case-I includes SS, case-II includes SS along with STCHS and ISR, case-III includes SS along with STCHS, ISR, and HCFs, case-IV includes SS along with STCHS, ISR, HCFs and NMPCM have been investigated. The evaluations were conducted in Rajshahi, Bangladesh, located at latitude 24°22′N and longitude 88°36′E. The design modification in case IV significantly increases production, a figure that is approximately 118.70% more than the case I, with a daily cumulative distillate of 2.10 L/m2. In comparison to cases II and III, exergy efficiency of case IV is 131.33 and 95.92% higher, respectively. Feasibility of modified SS in case IV is observed for having the 74.89% incremental exergo-economic factor. For cases II, III, and IV, respectively, a reduction of 7.22, 7.90, and 8.41 tons of CO2 emissions is possible attained over lifetime and the payback period is reduced 37.31% compared to cases I. After conducting sustainability analysis this made a crystal-clear picture that case IV shows significant improvements than the others.

Abstract High salinity levels pose a significant challenge to agricultural productivity, as it impairs photosynthesis, water and nutrient uptake, and cellular homeostasis in plants. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are symbiotic microorganisms that can improve plant tolerance to salinity, but their effects on plant photosynthetic efficiency, especially of Photosystem II, are poorly understood. This study examined the impact of AMF inoculation on the growth, physiology, and biochemistry of pistachio plants exposed to salt stress in a greenhouse experiment. The experimental findings demonstrated that that AMF symbiosis increased the growth and the K, Ca, Mg, P, K/Na, and Ca/Na ratios, and reduced the Na and Cl concentrations, of pistachio plants under salinity. AMF inoculation also decreased the electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide levels, and increased the relative water content, water use efficiency, glycine betaine, soluble sugars, alpha-tocopherol, and carotenoids of pistachio plants under salinity. Furthermore, AMF inoculation mitigated the salinity-induced reduction in chlorophyll content, maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm), effective quantum efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv’/Fm’), and photochemical quenching (qP), and the salinity-induced increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and chlorophyll a/b ratio. Additionally, AMF inoculation improved the net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, and reduced the intercellular CO2 concentration, of pistachio plants under salinity. These findings indicate that AMF inoculation enhances the photosynthetic capacity, water relations, and ion homeostasis of pistachio plants, and confers salinity tolerance and improved growth and performance.

Velocity-selective arterial spin labelling (VSASL) MRI is insensitive to arterial transit time. This is an advantage over other perfusion measurements, where long arterial transit times can lead to bias. Therefore, VSASL can be used to study perfusion in the presence of long arterial transit times, such as in the ageing brain, in vascular pathologies, and cancer, or where arterial transit time changes, such as during measurement of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). However, when calculating perfusion (cerebral blood flow, CBF, in the brain) from VSASL signal, it is assumed that images are acquired before the trailing edge of the labelled blood has arrived in the imaging slice. The arrival of the trailing edge of the labelled bolus of blood will cause an underestimation of perfusion. Here we measure bolus duration in young, healthy human brains, both at rest and during elevated CBF. Grey matter bolus duration was 1.61 +/- 0.31 s, but there was a large spatial heterogeneity, with bolus duration being lower in anterior brain regions, with some areas having bolus duration < 1.2 s. We place these results in context of recommendations from a recent consensus paper, which recommends imaging 1.4 s after the label, potentially underestimating CBF in anterior regions. Further, we observed a 0.23 +/- 0.12 s reduction in grey matter bolus duration with 5% CO2 inhalation. These results can be used to inform the experimental design of future VSASL studies, to avoid underestimating perfusion by imaging after the arrival of the trailing edge of the labelled bolus.

ABSTRACT: Wastewater treatment plants play an important role within the urban water cycle to prevent the natural water environment and human health from being negatively affected by human activities. However, wastewater treatment processes, such as effluent discharge and indirect emissions resulting from energy or chemical production, also negatively affect the environment. Footprints have been used to track human influence on the environment in different areas of interest and have been applied to assess the sustainability of wastewater treatment plants. In this article, a comprehensive review of footprint assessment was investigated to evaluate the wastewater treatment process in wastewater treatment plants. The review showed that carbon footprinting was used to assess the sustainability of WWTPs, and that other footprint assessment applications (such as nitrogen and phosphorus footprinting) were also introduced to assess eutrophication of water bodies. To promote the application of footprint assessment, this article regulates the study objectives, frameworks, system boundaries, data processing methods, and the resulting interpretation process. The pros and cons of the footprint assessments were discussed and investigated in detail, examining the CO2 production on each island of the Canary archipelago, and several suggestions were proposed to improve the footprint assessments. Analysis of footprint assessments at different wastewater treatment plants revealed that wastewater treatment technologies and scales had a significant impact on footprints. Furthermore, research hotspots identified using a keyword network diagram showed that the water-carbon-energy nexus was a promising direction for future studies. The purpose of the study is to improve the reduction of the carbon footprint both at the level of direct and indirect emissions factors using new tools and methodologies.

Abstract The effect of a novel consensus bacterial 6-phytase variant (PhyG) without or with a xylanase–β-glucanase (XB) when added to an energy and nutrient-reduced diet on growth performance and production benefit was evaluated in pigs from wean-to-finish. A total of 192 weaned pigs [DanBred x Pi; initial body weight (BW) 7.18 ± 0.38 kg] were randomized to 4 treatments with 12 (4 piglets/pen) and 24 pens (2 pigs/pen) per treatment (1:1 male to female) for nursery and grow-finish phases, respectively. Diets were wheat-corn-barley-rye-soybean meal-based and fed in 5 phases (pre-starter, 7–11 kg, starter, 11–25 kg, grower I, 25–55 kg, grower II, 55–85 kg and finisher, 85–110 kg BW). Treatments comprised: 1) a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC); 2) a negative control (NC1) without added inorganic phosphate, reduced (based on specific PhyG dose) in net energy (NE), calcium (Ca), digestible amino acids (AA) and sodium (Na) vs. PC, supplemented with PhyG at 1,000, 1000, 750, 500 and 500 FTU/kg during pre-starter, starter, grower I, II and finisher phase, respectively (NC1+PhyG ‘low’); 3) a negative control (NC2) without added inorganic phosphate, supplemented with PhyG at 2,000, 2,000, 1,000, 750 and 750 FTU/kg in each phase with reduction in NE, Ca, dig AA and Na vs. PC based on the specific PhyG dose (NC2+PhyG ‘high’); and 4) a negative control (NC3) that was similar to 2) but supplemented with XB to provide 2,400 U/kg xylanase and 304 U/kg β-glucanase, with additional reduction in NE and dig AA based on the contribution of XB vs NC1 (NC3+PhyG ‘low’+XB). Data were analyzed by ANOVA, and means separation was by Tukey’s HSD test. Growth performance in all enzyme-supplemented diets was maintained or improved compared with PC. The NC3+PhyG ‘low’+XB treatment significantly improved performance vs. PC; average daily gain (ADG) and BW were greater vs. PC in starter (620 g and 28.2 kg vs. 557 g and 26.4 kg) and grower I (859 g and 65.1 kg vs. 777 g and 60.0 kg) respectively; feed conversion ratio (FCR) was reduced in grower II vs. PC (2.10 vs. 2.25; P &lt; 0.05). The final BW was 114.5, 114.8, 115.6 and 116.7 kg in PC, NC1+PhyG ‘low’, NC2+PhyG ‘high’ and NC3+PhyG ‘low’+XB, respectively (P &gt; 0.05). Carcass parameters were unaffected by treatments. Compared with PC, NC1+PhyG ‘low’, NC2+PhyG ‘high’ and NC3+PhyG ‘low’+XB conferred a 3.8 to 5.8% reduction in total feed cost (ingredients price, October 2023)/kg BWG and 4.4 to 6.8% reduction in the total carbon footprint (FeedPrint, WUR, The Netherland, CO2 eq., g)/kg BWG. The results confirm the appropriacy of the applied matrix values with PhyG supplementation, with or without XB, in mixed cereal diets from wean-to-finish and highlight the potential feed cost and sustainability benefit of using the phytase alone or in combination with the carbohydrase enzymes.

The conversion of bambara groundnut seed residues into biochar facilitated the bioavailability and retention of more nutrients (C, N, P, K and Mg) after repeated application of biochar. However, the mechanisms of microbially mediated biochar-C degradation and nutrient cycling responses to repeated biochar application, particularly in different hierarchical soil aggregates, are largely unknown. A 20-day incubation experiment was conducted on Ultisols from a 4-year cucumber field trial in Nsukka, Nigeria. The effects of repeated application of bambara seed residue biochar with or without NPK fertilizer on soil aggregate associated electrical conductivity (EC), basal respiration, microbial biomass, and soil enzyme activities were determined. The results showed that the concentration of organic matter in the bulk soils increased with biochar and NPK+biochar treatments. These treatments also increased the soil EC, cumulative CO2 respiration, microbial biomass C and N concentrations, and the activities of tyrosine-aminopeptidase and sulfatase enzymes, compared to the biochar treatment and the control soil. The NPK+biochar treatment contributed 35% more to β-cellobiosidase activity, but the biochar treatment resulted in 85% reduction in N-Acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activity, indicating microbial N mining. The NPK and NPK+biochar treatments accounted for a higher percentage of N-, C and N-, and S- cycle enzyme activities, although their composition was relatively higher with the latter treatment. The overall soil biochemical responses were significantly higher in the micro-aggregates (< 0.25 mm) than in the macro-aggregates (≤ 4.75 - 0.25 mm); least of all in the small macro-aggregates (0.25 - 1.00 mm). Therefore, repeated application of biochar to N-deficient soils generally does not result in positive soil biochemical responses. However, repeated application of biochar together with NPK fertilizer modulates N limitation and optimizes microbial nutrient cycling processes, especially in micro-aggregates.

Despite many years of research, results from prebiotic chemistry experiments—where biologically relevant compounds are formed from simple monomers such as cyanate, CO2, or formaldehyde— still yield complex mixtures with only trace amounts of the molecules of interest. The prevailing idea that life originated from a sequence of chemical reactions, starting from very simple active molecules and evolving into progressively more complex systems, might be incorrect for two reasons: First, after 70 years of experiments, we still lack robust experimental demonstration of such networks; second, small reactive molecules typically do not exist in high concentrations and readily react to form tars and other complex mixtures. Here I adopt an alternative approach, demonstrating that numerous primary metabolites can be derived from tar-like mixtures through the Advanced Reduction Process (ARP). Tars are formed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are widespread in the Universe and likely were the main source of organic carbon on early Earth. Under conditions thought to exist on the prebiotic Earth—characterized by sunlight, an anoxic sulfur-rich atmosphere, and iron-rich dust - PAH suspensions in water are decomposed to succinic, lactic, malonic, and glycolic acids, all known as primary metabolites in all living systems and main components of ubiquitous citric acid cycle. The sum of reaction yields for these biologically important metabolites reaches up to 40%, with individual product yields ranging from 1-15%. The simplicity of this reaction and the ubiquity of PAHs on prebiotic Earth make this process particularly appealing, suggesting it could have occurred on a vast scale on sunlit planetary surfaces. These findings may reveal an overlooked initial step in the origin of life on Earth, and potentially elsewhere in the Universe.

Sperm capacitation involves biochemical and physiological changes that enable sperm to fertilize the oocyte. It can be induced in vitro under controlled conditions that simulate the environment of the oviduct. While extensively studied in mammals, its approach in lizards remains absent. Understanding the mechanisms that ensure reproduction is essential for advancing the implementation of assisted reproductive technologies in this group. We aimed to perform a sperm analysis to determine if capacitation-related changes were induced after incubation with capacitating media. Fifteen males of Sceloporus torquatus were collected during the early stage of the reproductive season. The sperm were isolated from the seminal plasma and then diluted up to a volume of 150 μL using BWW medium to incubate with 5% CO2 at 30 °C for a maximum duration of 3 h. A fraction was retrieved hourly for ongoing sperm assessment. The sperm analysis included assessments of its motility, viability, the capacitation status using the chlortetracycline (CTC) assay, and the acrosome integrity with the lectin binding assay to detect changes during incubation. We found that total motility was maintained up to 2 h post incubation, after which it decreased. However, sperm viability remained constant. From that moment on, we observed a transition to a deeper and less symmetrical flagellar bending in many spermatozoa. The CTC assay indicated a reduction in the percentage of sperm showing the full (F) pattern and an increase in those exhibiting the capacitated (B) and reactive (RA) patterns, accompanied by an elevation in the percentage of damaged acrosomes as revealed by the lectin binding assay. In mammals, these changes are often associated with sperm capacitation. Our observations support the notion that this process may also occur in saurian. While sperm analysis is a valuable method for assessing certain functional changes, additional approaches are required to validate this process.

Grape is an economically important fruit crop worldwide, for which light qualities play a diverse role in vineyard growth and development. However, the regulatory mechanisms between different light qualities and the quality of plant growth at the morphophysiological and pomological levels remain unknown. Therefore, in the current study, we studied plant physiological, biochemical and genetical analysis to investigate the response of all seven light qualities, including red (R), blue (B), white (W), 1-red, 1 blue (1R1B), 2-red, 1-blue (2R1B), 1-red, 2-blue (1R2B), and natural (N, was used as control group) to evaluate 'Kyoho'grape (Vitis labrusca L. × V. vinifera) morphophysiological, pomological traits at light responsive transcriptional pathway, which revealed the possible networking metabolism controlling fruit quality and quantity of grape plant. Our results showed that photosynthetic indicators such as leaf stomata, number of stomata, and longitudinal and transverse diameter of stomata improved under red and blue light qualities as compared to white light. Leaf gas exchange indicators showed that net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, intercellular CO2 concentration rate, total conductance to CO2, stomatal conductance, conductance to water vapor, maximal quantum yield of PS (II), actual photochemical quantum efficiency, electron transfer chain, and non-photochemical quantum efficiency improve under blue and red light. Photosynthetic pigments showed that chlorophyll a and b, carotenoid, and total pigment contents improved under blue and red light. Nutrient elements showed that potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, calcium, iron, and zinc contents improved under blue and red light. Morphological and organic acid indicators such as the appearance of fruit shape, firmness, and titratable acidity improved under blue and light. However, there was a notable increment in the total soluble sugar under blue and red light as compared to natural light. The composition of sugar including (sucrose, fructose, glucose) and organic acids (tartaric acid, citric acid, and malic acid) improved under blue and red light (fruits) and showed notable reductions for tartaric acid under blue and red light (leaves) as compared to natural light. Aromatic compounds showed that esters, aldehydes, acetaldehyde, 2-hexenal, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, butanoic acid, ethyl ester, 1-hexanol, 2-ethyl, 2-propanone, and 1‑hydroxyl, improved under blue and red light. Further, changes in enhanced expression of light-responsive genes including VvCRYI, VvCRY2, VvPHYA, VvPHYB, VvCOP1, VvHY5, VvHYH, and VvPIF4 upregulated under blue and red light, while VvPIF3.1 down-regulated as compared to natural light. Also, chlorophyll synthesis-related genes including VvSGR, VvPAO, and VvCHLH upregulated under blue and red light, while VvNYC1, VvPPH, and VvPOR showed noticeable changes under blue and red light as compared to natural light. Interestingly, most of the relative genes were highly expressed in fruits as compared to leaves. Finally, we have established correlation and principal component analysis for indicators in grapes. Current findings provide novel mechanisms by which different responses of supplementary light control the plant fruit quality of grapes.

Abstract. Ocean acidification is likely to impact all stages of the ocean carbonate pump, i.e. the production, export, dissolution and burial of biogenic CaCO3. However, the associated feedback on anthropogenic carbon uptake and ocean acidification has received little attention. It has previously been shown that Earth system model (ESM) carbonate pump parameterizations can affect and drive biases in the representation of ocean alkalinity, which is critical to the uptake of atmospheric carbon and provides buffering capacity towards associated acidification. In the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), we show divergent responses of CaCO3 export at 100 m this century, with anomalies by 2100 ranging from −74 % to +23 % under a high-emission scenario. The greatest export declines are projected by ESMs that consider pelagic CaCO3 production to depend on the local calcite/aragonite saturation state. Despite the potential effects of other processes on alkalinity, there is a robust negative correlation between anomalies in CaCO3 export and salinity-normalized surface alkalinity across the CMIP6 ensemble. Motivated by this relationship and the uncertainty in CaCO3 export projections across ESMs, we perform idealized simulations with an ocean biogeochemical model and confirm a limited impact of carbonate pump anomalies on 21st century ocean carbon uptake and acidification. However, we highlight a potentially abrupt shift, between 2100 and 2300, in the dissolution of CaCO3 from deep to subsurface waters when the global-scale mean calcite saturation state reaches about 1.23 at 500 m (likely when atmospheric CO2 reaches 900–1100 ppm). During this shift, upper ocean acidification due to anthropogenic carbon uptake induces deep ocean acidification driven by a substantial reduction in CaCO3 deep dissolution following its decreased export at depth. Although the effect of a diminished carbonate pump on global ocean carbon uptake and surface ocean acidification remains limited until 2300, it can have a large impact on regional air–sea carbon fluxes, particularly in the Southern Ocean.

<p dir="ltr">Millennial-scale climatic oscillations have been documented in numerous ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland for the last glacial period. These glacial events, termed Antarctic Isotope Maxima (AIM) and Dansgaard – Oeschger (DO) events in Antarctica and Greenland, respectively, are understood as ocean-mediated mechanisms, with asynchronous progression into warming and cooling. This bipolar seesaw originates from the out-of-phase strengthening and weakening of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). While proxy records provide strong evidence for enhanced AABW formation during AIM events, the mechanism of its formation during these events remains indiscernible. The process of AABW formation, however, is likely to be different from today. In modern times, AABW formation occurs in front of ice-shelves, whereas during glacial periods, the ice sheets extended to the continental shelf, and the ice-shelves were absent. Ice cores allow the reconstruction of an array of environmental conditions. Here, we present new data from a high-resolution coastal ice core record that sensitively captures changes in temperature, sea ice conditions, primary productivity, and atmospheric circulation pattern. The new data provide important insights into the drivers of AIM events, AABW formation, and the evolution of the bipolar seesaw.</p><p dir="ltr">This thesis focuses on the high resolution record of major ions bracketing 26-40 kilo year (ka) Before Present (BP), from Roosevelt Island, West Antarctica. Roosevelt Island is a grounded ice rise, located in the north-east of Ross Ice Shelf, in the Southern Ross Sea. The ice core was drilled to bedrock at 764m, as a part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project. The record has been dated to 753m which captures the past 83 ka BP. The major ion record comprises of concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium, chloride, sulphate, nitrate, and Methane Sulphonic Acid (MSA), with an average resolution of ~25 years.</p><p dir="ltr">We demonstrate that the RICE MSA, sea salt aerosols, and non-sea salt calcium records are sensitive recorders of primary productivity, open-ocean area, and latitudinal position of Southern Hemisphere westerly winds, respectively. Our results suggest that AIM events in the Ross Sea region are driven by open-ocean convection. We test this hypothesis using the outputs from LOVECLIM, an intermediate complexity earth system model, based on contrasting scenarios, with and without open-ocean convection in the Ross Sea region. Our results confirm that open-ocean convection as a prominent mechanism for the formation of AABW in the Ross Sea region during AIM events. </p><p dir="ltr">Availability of high resolution, continuous flow methane data for the AIM 4 event provides an opportunity to examine the relative phasing of the events in RICE and North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) ice cores. We demonstrate that the RICE AIM 4 event leads by over 200 years the Greenland DO 4 event. Our data suggest that the Antarctic lead is caused by the coupled interaction between open ocean convection and local insolation changes, which also highlights the significant role of the Southern Ocean in the evolution of bipolar seesaw. Using non-sea salt calcium data in RICE and other Antarctic ice cores to reconstruct atmospheric circulation pattern, we find an equatorward migration of Southern Hemisphere westerly winds between 31-32 ka BP. This shift evokes large scale consequences that include a reduction in atmospheric CO2 and strengthening of tropical rainfall. This atmospheric rearrangement might be linked to reduced summer insolation, leading to Southern Ocean sea surface cooling and subsequent sea ice expansion.</p>
