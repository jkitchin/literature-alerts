Abstract High‐entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit distinctive catalytic properties owing to their diverse elemental compositions, garnering considerable attention across various applications. However, the preparation of HEO nanoparticles with different spatial structures remains challenging due to their inherent structural instability. Herein, ultrasmall high‐entropy oxide nanoparticles (less than 5 nm) with different spatial structures are synthesized on carbon supports via the rapid thermal shock treatment. The low‐symmetry HEO, BiSbInCdSn‐O 4 , demonstrates exceptional performance for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reaction (eCO 2 RR), including a lower overpotential, high Faraday efficiency across a wide electrochemical range (−0.3 to −1.6 V), and sustained stability for over100 h. In the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, BiSbInCdSn‐O 4 achieves a current density of 350 mA cm −2 while maintaining good stability for 24 h. Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the electron donor–acceptor interactions between bismuth and indium sites in BiSbInCdSn‐O 4 enable the electron delocalization to facilitate the efficient adsorption of CO 2 and hydrogenation reactions. Thus, the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step is reduced to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability. This study elucidates that the spatial structure of metal sites in HEOs is able to regulate CO 2 adsorption status for eCO 2 RR, paving the way for the rational design of efficient HEO catalysts.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction into high‐value chemicals is one of the important solutions to the greenhouse effect and energy crisis. However, the slow kinetic process of eight electrons requires the development of efficient catalysts to improve the yields. Single atom catalysts (SACs) with high activity and selectivity have become an emerging research frontier in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, a catalyst comprised of Cu single atoms loaded on carbon substrate (Cu‐NC) is developed for highly selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane (CH4). The optimal catalyst (Cu‐NC‐1‐4) exhibits a faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 50% for CH4 within a wide potential window from ‐1.3 V to ‐1.8 V (vs. RHE) and the highest FE of CH4 is up to 67.22% at ‐1.6 V (vs. RHE). Meanwhile, the product selectivity of CH4 among all the carbon products reaches 93.00%, and the activity decay can be negligible via the 70‐hour‐stability‐test. The existence of atomic dispersed Cu‐N3 sites was verified by high‐angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF‐STEM) and X‐ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the effective adsorption of the key intermediate *CO on Cu‐N3 sites prompts the generation of CH4.

The direct coupling of nitrate ions and carbon dioxide for urea synthesis presents an appealing alternative to the Bosch-Meiser process in industry. The simultaneous activation of carbon dioxide and nitrate, however, as well as efficient C-N coupling on single active site, poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a novel metal/hydroxide heterostructure strategy based on synthesizing an Ag-CuNi(OH)2 composite to cascade carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions for urea electrosynthesis. The strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure interface integrates two distinct sites for carbon dioxide and nitrate activation, and facilitates the coupling of *CO (on silver, where * denotes an active site) and *NH2 (on hydroxide) for urea formation. Moreover, the strongly coupled interface optimizes the water splitting process and facilitates the supply of active hydrogen atoms, thereby expediting the deoxyreduction processes essential for urea formation. Consequently, our Ag-CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers a high urea yield rate of 25.6 mmol gcat.-1 h-1 and high urea Faradaic efficiency of 46.1%, as well as excellent cycling stability. This work provides new insights into the design of dual-site catalysts for C-N coupling, considering their role on the interface.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction in non‐aqueous solvents is promising due to the increased CO2 solubility of organic‐based electrolytes compared to aqueous electrolytes. Here the effect of nine different salts in propylene carbonate (PC) on the CO2 reduction product distribution of polycrystalline Cu is investigated. Three different cations (tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetrabutylammonium (TBA), and tetrahexylammonium (THA)) and three different anions (chloride (Cl), tetrafluoroborate (BF4), and hexafluorophosphate (PF6)) were used. Chronoamperometry and in‐situ FTIR measurements show that the size of the cation has a crucial role in the selectivity. A more hydrophobic surface is obtained when employing a larger cation with a weaker hydration shell. This stabilizes the CO2‐· radical and promotes the formation of ethylene. CO2 reduction in 0.7 M THACl/PC shows the highest hydrocarbon formation. Lastly, we hypothesize that the hydrocarbon formation pathway is not through C‐C coupling, as the CO solubility in PC is very high, but through the dimerization of the COH intermediate.

Electrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction are important processes to produce hydrogen and low–carbon fuels as renewable energy sources. Here, nanostructured MnMoO4, prepared by the reflux precipitation method, was investigated as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions. Using a combination of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results, a direct band gap of 3.05 eV was obtained experimentally for the prepared MnMoO4. An overpotential of 0.36 V at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec-1 were obtained for the oxygen evolution reaction. At a current density of 3 mA cm-2, overpotentials of 0.39 V and 0.58 V were achieved in the absence and presence of CO2 bubbling into a 0.1 M KOH solution, respectively, emphasizing the poisoning effect of CO2 reduction intermediates for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Based on the obtained results, MnMoO4 could be a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECR) is a promising pathway to producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Despite extensive studies reported, improving CO2 adsorption for local CO2 enrichment or water dissociation to generate sufficient H* is still not enough to achieve industrial‐relevant current densities. Herein, we report a “two‐in‐one” catalyst, defective Bi nanosheets modified by CrOx (Bi‐CrOx), to simultaneously promote CO2 adsorption and water dissociation, thereby enhancing the activity and selectivity of ECR to formate. The Bi‐CrOx exhibits an excellent Faradic efficiency (≈ 100 %) in a wide potential range from ‒0.4 to ‒0.9 V. In addition, it achieves a remarkable formate partial current density of 687 mA cm‒2 at a moderate potential of ‒0.9 V without iR compensation, the highest value at ‒0.9 V reported so far. Control experiments and theoretical simulations revealed that the defective Bi facilitates CO2 adsorption/activation while the CrOx accounts for enhancing the protonation process via accelerating H2O dissociation. This work presents a pathway to boosting formate production through tuning CO2 and H2O species at the same time.

Cu is the most promising metal catalyst for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to multi-carbon products, but the structure sensitivity of the reaction and the stability versus restructuring of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions are still controversial. Here, atomic scale simulations of surface energies and reaction pathway kinetics supported by experimental evidence unveil that CO2RR does not take place on perfect planar Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces but rather on steps or kinks defects, and that these planar surfaces tend to restructure in reaction conditions to the active stepped surfaces. By combining basin hopping global sampling and grand canonical density functional theory, we show that the extremely low CO coverage on (111) and (100) surfaces, originating from sluggish CO2 conversion and unfavorable CO binding, limits the ability of these surfaces to reduce CO2 to multi-carbon products. Steps and kinks at surfaces, despite the lack of decrease in C-C coupling barriers on these sites, exhibit a significant increase in activity arising from beneficial CO2 activation and higher CO coverage. Notably, the square motifs adjacent to defects, not the defects themselves, are the active sites for CO2RR via synergistic effect. In addition, the strong binding of CO on defective sites acts as a thermodynamic driving force for the restructuring of planar surfaces to active stepped terminations under reactive conditions. We evaluate these mechanisms against experiments of CO2RR on UHV-prepared ultraclean Cu surfaces. Overall, our findings highlight the structural sensitivity in steering CO2RR and elucidate the origin of in situ restructuring of Cu catalysts during the reaction. We furthermore feature that the active sites for CO2RR are created under reaction conditions.

Atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) exhibit significant potential as catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. However, the range of products achievable with these NCs has been somewhat constrained. This study introduces an innovative design strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of Cu NCs by engineering their active sites. We achieve this by creating defects on a cubic Cu58 NC through the partial dislocation of Cu atoms at its vertices, leading to the ligand vacancies that exposes multiple Cu sites. Additionally, the dislocation of Cu atoms finely tunes the inner cationic geometries through altered cuprophilic interactions, resulting in discernable changes in their edges and vertices. When tested, these unique arrangements of Cu(I) atoms within the cluster prove effective in determining product specificities during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations correlate the product selectivity toward CH3OH for [Cu58H20(SPr)36(PPh3)7]2+ (Pr = CH2CH2CH3) NC to the enhanced edge Cu reactivity in binding CO and CHO intermediates, compared to [Cu58H20(SPr)36(PPh3)8]2+ and [Cu58H20(SEt)36(PPh3)6]2+ (Et = CH2CH3) NCs. This work underscores the potential of tailored structural designs of atomically precise nanocatalysts in steering electrochemical CO2 reduction toward unconventional products.

Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT = 4‐tert‐butylphenylthiol) with a 26‐atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single‐crystal X‐ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face‐centered cubic‐structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5 nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibits higher catalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity is well interpreted using density functional theory calculations and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, highlighting the influence of GBs and point defects on the properties of metal nanoclusters.

Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese "movable‐type printing technology". Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors form an extensive binuclear metal library. A series of dual‐atom catalysts were prepared by utilizing the edge nitrogen atoms in the C2N cavity as anchoring "pincers" to capture metal atoms. To prove utility, the dual atom catalyst Cu2‐C2N is investigated as electrocatalytic CO2RR catalyst. The synergistic interaction of dual Cu atoms promotes C‐C coupling and guarantees FEC2+ (90.8%) and FEC2H4. (71.7%) at ‐1.10 V vs RHE. DFT calculations revealed the Cu2 site would be subtly flipped during CO2RR for enhancing *CO adsorption and dimerization. We validate that atomic printing strategies are applicable to wide range of metal combinations, representing a significant advancement in the development of IMSCs.

A three-compartment electrolyzer has been developed for the electro-reduction of CO2 to CO in an organic electrolyte, with NaOH and Cl2 produced as byproducts. In order to improve the performance of the electrolyzer, we have prepared an Au/Cu alloy electrode using a novel non-cyanide electroplating method with high porosity. By expanding the specific surface area of the cathode, and providing a large number of active sites for CO2 electro-reduction, the cathodic current density reaches to 92.7 mA·cm−2, and the Faradaic efficiency of CO formation remains stable at 94.0 %. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations analysis identified that alloying tune the electronic structure of the Au and Cu surface, resulting in promoting the activation of CO2.

Abstract Bioelectrochemical synthesis is emerging as an eco-friendly method for CO2 fixation. These systems typically rely on electrochemically regenerated NAD(P)H to provide the necessary reducing equivalents for formate dehydrogenase (FDH) to convert CO2 into formate. However, the efficiency of these systems is currently unsatisfactory due to the unfavorable dynamics of the CO2-to-formate conversion by FDH. In this study, we developed a one-pot cooperative bioelectrochemical system featuring a rhodium-based catalyst [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]2+ (RhIII-complex or [RhIII-H2O]2+) working cooperatively with enzymatic cascades of acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ACDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), formolase (FLS), and d-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase mutant FSAA129S to convert CO2 into several C2+ chemicals. The bifunctional RhIII-complex concurrently catalyzes the reduction of CO2 to formate at a rate of 15.8 mM/h and NADH regeneration at a rate of 0.24 mM/min. The formation of formate is 83.2 times faster than using one of the best aerobic FDH from Clostridium ljungdahlii (ClFDH), resulting in a 3.6 times enhanced methanol production rate of 0.43 mM/h in the bioelectroenzymatic system (RhIII-complex-ACS-ACDH-ADH) compared to that of 0.12 mM/h in tandem enzymatic system (ClFDH-ACS-ACDH-ADH). Bifunctional RhIII-complex also works cooperatively with tandem enzymatic cascades to produce dihydroxyacetone (C3) and L-erythrulose (C4) at the yield of 2.63 mM, and 1.93 mM, respectively. This study leveraged the synthetic capabilities of both electrochemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis, offering an alternative for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction to yield value-added compounds with enhanced productivity.

Carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector make a significant contribution to global greenhouse gases, and understanding the factors that influence these emissions is beneficial for devising effective emission reduction policies. Oil prices are an important influencing factor since the fuel used in the transport sector is primarily based on oil, and fluctuations in oil prices directly impact the sector’s CO2 emissions. Additionally, environmental policies, as a key means of controlling CO2 emissions, can affect the relationship between oil prices and CO2 emissions in the transport sector. Therefore, this study aims to examine the impact of oil prices on CO2 emissions in the transport sector and explore the nonlinear role of environmental policy stringency in this relationship. Based on data from 27 OECD member countries and 6 non-member countries from 1990 to 2019, we used the environmental policy stringency index as a threshold variable to construct a panel threshold regression model. The analysis results indicate a double-threshold effect: when the environmental policy stringency index is low, the impact of oil prices on CO2 emissions in the transport sector is not significant. However, when the index reaches the first threshold, the impact of oil prices significantly increases; upon reaching the second threshold, the effect is further intensified. This paper also analyzes the three subindicators—market-based policies, non-market-based policies, and technology support policies—to clarify the distinct impact mechanisms of different types of environmental policies. Finally, based on the research findings, we propose policy recommendations to achieve carbon dioxide emission reduction targets in the transport sector.

It is important to improve the separation ability of photogenerated electrons and the adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide (CO2) for efficient photoreduction of CO2. Here, we synthesized ZnCdS quantum dots (ZCS-QDs) and cerium dioxide nanosheets (CeO2) using the solvothermal method and calcination method. We combined CeO2 and ZCS-QDs to effectively enhance the charge separation efficiency, and the lifetime of photogenerated electrons was increased 4.5 times. The CO evolution rate of the optimized composite (ZCS-QDs/CeO2) was up to 495.8 μmol g−1 h−1, and it had 100% product selectivity. In addition, the stability remained high after five cycles. The CO2 adsorption capacity of the catalyst surface was observed by in situ FTIR. The test results showed that improving CO2 capture ability and promoting photogenic electron separation had positive effects on enhancing photoreduction of CO2. This study provides a reference for constructing a zero-dimensional–two-dimensional (0D–2D) heterojunction and explores potential CO2 reduction reaction mechanisms.

This study aims to explore the spatial spillover effects of national climate legislation on carbon emission reduction by using cross-country panel data from 2002 to 2021. The results show the following: First, the estimation outcomes confirm the presence of spatial correlations between carbon dioxide emissions and climate legislation across countries. Second, the study shows that the spillover effect of climate legislation on CO2 emissions is significantly negative. Hence, the outcomes indicate that being surrounded by nations with more climate laws positively impacts environmental quality. Third, regarding direct impact and spillover effects, the carbon reduction impact of parliamentary legislative acts is stronger than that of governmental executive orders. Finally, even with the spillover effect, we uncover robust evidence supporting an inverted-U-shaped EKC linkage between carbon emissions and GDP per capita, even under the spatial spillover effect.

Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are a prime concern that needs our attention, not only in megapolitan states but also in developing small states. The increase in GHGs-emission could lead to severe climate change scenarios and global warming. In India, it is measured that the energy sector (68.7%) accounts for a significant GHGs-emission, followed by agriculture (19.6%), industry (6.0%), land use change and forestry (3.8%), and waste sector (1.9%). This article aims to investigate temporal changes and trends in greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions in the energy sector of India. We have used GHGs-emission as Carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent and compared the top per capita emitting states versus their total emissions and vice versa. Most of this increase has occurred in small states, where urbanisation, population growth, and economic expansion have been significant factors. Odisha and Maharashtra were listed as top-emitting states releasing more than 240 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), mainly through industrial energy and electricity-related emissions, respectively, followed by Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal. In contrast, Chhattisgarh was recorded as the top per-capita emitting state, followed by Odisha. Among all the states studied, Lakshadweep has shown a significant trend in GHGs per capita reduction, while the other shows an increasing trend due to a lack of robust and effective legislation. This review will help to seek the attention of policymakers and the government towards the increasing emissions from the small states which are emerging in day to day life.

Indonesia signed the Paris Agreement in 2016, thus actively contributing to tackling climate change has an obligation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The main factor of global climate change is the increase of GHG, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). PT X is committed to supporting Net Zero Emission 2060 by encouraging programs that have a good impact on the environment and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) 13 and supporting the government in handling the climate crisis. The ranking of alternatives is carried out using two structured methods, quantitative analysis using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), considering environmental, economic, and social aspects. used to help make decisions for the implementation of carbon mitigation mechanisms. From the observation of the previous implementation, carbon emissions in the production process were quite high. So it is necessary to make effective carbon mitigation efforts. There are three criteria that influence action decisions, namely environmental criteria, economic criteria and social criteria. The results of the weight value of each criterion are that the environment has the highest weight (0.61), followed by economic criteria (0.20) and social criteria (0.19) from these values indicate that environmental criteria are the most important criteria in decision making. The ranking results show that the Piston Modification Program and the Diesel Engine to Gas Engine Replacement Program are optimal options for short-term implementation. The Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) program should be considered for long-term investment, with the potential for large emission reductions and long-term cost savings.

The ironmaking industry consumes a large amount of fossil fuel derived carbon as heat source, reducing agent of iron ores and carburising agent of reduced iron. Although the demand for drastic decrease of carbon dioxide emission, carbon is an essential element for smelting process of molten iron. The carbon recycling ironmaking process by circulating CO has been already proposed to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the production of molten hot metal is not considered in this process because sufficient amount of carbon does not dissolve in reduced iron by CO. Therefore, our group has suggested a new carbon recycling ironmaking process which can produce hot metal. In this process, free carbon and iron carbides produced by carbon deposition reaction using metallic iron as a catalyst are used. It is known that only Fe3C is obtained as iron carbide by using CO gas, however, Fe5C2 is also produced by adding H2 gas. The composite agglomerated with these carbonaceous materials and fine iron ore (Deposited Carbon-Iron oxide Composite: DCIC) is reduced and melted in a furnace. It is reported that Fe3C in DCIC accelerates the reduction reaction and melting of the composite. In this study, the effects of iron carbides and free carbon on the melting behaviour of DCIC are investigated. Fe3C, Fe5C2 and free carbon were produced by vapour deposition using porous iron whiskers and CO-CO2-H2 gas. These were agglomerated with hematite reagent at a certain ratio to prepare DCIC samples with and without Fe5C2. The samples were heated up to 1300°C in inert atmosphere. The DCIC containing Fe5C2 completely melted and iron nuggets were obtained after the experiment. This behaviour was not observed in the composite without Fe5C2. This indicates that using Fe5C2 is more preferable than Fe3C for molten iron production using DCIC.

Pulverized rock samples are widely used in laboratory experiments, e.g., to assess microbial or abiotic processes in batch incubation tests. However, it is unclear if ball-milled samples accurately reflect in-situ conditions and if observed processes are affected by by-products artificially generated during the sample preparation procedure. As such, this study examined the effects of dry ball milling on the release of gases, which include C1-C4 hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), and low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) from different sedimentary rocks. The experiments involved pulverization using a gas-tight zirconium oxide planetary ball mill followed by wet and dry batch incubation and thermal desorption up to 200 o C. During milling, all sedimentary rocks, except a low organic carbon sandstone sample, yielded methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), H2, CO2, and unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g., ethene (C2H4). Sandstones only yielded H2, CH4, and CO2. Stable carbon isotope signatures of these products are similar to thermogenic gases. The gases were also detected in subsequent wet incubation experiments (after gases from milling had been removed). Additionally, formate, acetate, and citrate, were detected in all samples except for sandstone. Pyruvate, malate, and succinate were also detected in some samples. Thermal desorption products of powdered limestone, shale, and pyrite concretion samples included organic acids, such as acetate and formate, which were higher in milled samples than in crushed particles (∼1 mm). The original geological thermal maturity of the studied sedimentary rock samples was low (below "oil window") and, thus, considerably below "gas window", suggesting that most of the detected gases were generated during ball milling. H2 generated during ball milling may be derived from the reduction of water from fluid inclusion or phyllosilicates, involving the formation of reactive mineral surfaces or radicals. Notably, the concentrations of gaseous hydrocarbons derived from milling are relatively high and comparable to "wet" gases. At the same time, these data indicate that substantial amounts of gases and LWMOAs might be artificially generated during laboratory batch experiments with milled samples. Hence, ball milled rock samples must be used with caution if assessing (bio-)geochemical processes for natural environments.

The construction industry significantly depends on concrete due to its mechanical attributes and economy efficiency. The increase demand for building materials, particularly concrete, has resulted in overproduction of ordinary portland cement (OPC) and consequent significant release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. For addressing these issues, alternative innovative and sustainable materials, such as geopolymer concrete, which utilised waste materials as binding agents have been introduced, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions. Palm oil fuel ash (POFA) contains abundant silicates and aluminates, making it well-suited for use as binder in geopolymer concrete. On the other hand, POFA geopolymer concrete with high volume exhibits reduced early strength development, decreased workability, and an extended setting time. Therefore, this review paper emphasizes the need of including fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) into POFA-based geopolymer concrete. A notable result of the review is that the inclusion of aluminium oxide and iron (III) oxide in FA improves the chloride binding capability, resulting to a dense microstructure with high strength. In addition, the presence of calcium oxide in FA and GGBS enhances the creation of C-S-H, N-A-S-H, and C-A-S-H gels, resulting in a decrease in porosity and an enhancement of the fresh and mechanical characteristics. Furthermore, the use of FA improves the insulation and thermal efficiency of the geopolymer concrete. Therefore, integration of FA and GGBS in POFA geopolymer may enhanced the mechanical and durability qualities. Further study is required to optimize the composition of POFA, FA and GGBS in the mix, and researching new, cost-effective alkaline activators obtained from waste products offers another avenue for boosting the efficiency of geopolymer synthesis.

Solving the world-class problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and potential utilization of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the article provides an overview of technologies for injecting CO 2 into the oil and gas reservoirs to enhance oil recovery and stimulate oil production. Two main methods of carbon dioxide (CO₂) injection are proposed and described in detail. These are the Huff and Puff method, which involves the injection of CO₂ into production wells, and CO₂ injection into injection wells. The technology of injecting carbon dioxide into production wells has a number of advantages, such as the lack of capital costs and low operating costs, quick effect manifested in increased oil rates and efficient use of CO 2 . The general principle of the technology is the controlled supply of carbon dioxide through the mouth of a shut-in production well into the bottomhole formation zone. The efficiency of the technology is achieved primarily through the reduction of oil viscosity and volumetric expansion of oil, the decrease of interfacial tension, and the reduction of relative phase permeability by water. Consequently, residual oil saturation is reduced by the increase in the amount of trapped gas. The second technology for injecting carbon dioxide into injection wells to achieve a positive technological effect requires a larger volume of injection agent and a longer period for evaluation of the effect. The efficiency of the technology and the increase in the oil displacement ratio are achieved through the distribution of large volumes of injected carbon dioxide through low-permeability reservoir channels and involvement of residual oil. The article presents the necessary conditions and main stages of CO 2 injection process organization using the proposed technologies, and describes the composition of the required equipment. Special attention is paid to the necessity of using inhibitors to protect downhole equipment, as well as to the selection of suitable inhibitors, taking into account their physical and chemical characteristics, compatibility with other reagents and reservoir properties. The authors of the article have conducted an expert survey of the market for the availability of specialized equipment in Russia and the services of domestic manufacturers in the field of gas injection technologies. The conclusion of the article highlights the importance of CO 2 injection careful planning and monitoring, as well as the potential of gas-enhanced methods to improve production and reduce environmental impact.

As the threat of climate change due to global warming intensifies, the world is increasingly experiencing extreme weather phenomena. Consequently, the importance of achieving carbon neutrality is expected to grow. Parks and forests play a crucial role in capturing and storing carbon, offering the most eco-friendly spaces that provide convenience and relaxation for users, as well as resilience for cities. They also serve as essential elements of carbon neutrality with their scenic and touristic value. This study focuses on these aspects, reviewing the trends in existing carbon reduction technologies and investigating carbon dioxide capture and utilization technologies that can increase the amount of carbon that parks and forests can capture. These technologies were classified according to six principles, identifying bioconversion technology as the most applicable and dry capture and mineral carbonation technologies as relatively superior. The study analyzes the current policy foundation and shortcomings for the commercialization and business application of these technologies, along with future improvements that need to be addressed. The purpose of this research is to establish a foundation for creating carbon-neutral parks and forests by identifying applicable technologies, assessing policy hurdles, and suggesting improvements, thereby enabling faster and more efficient carbon absorption and storage. According to the findings of this study, by identifying and expanding the application of technologies suitable for parks and forests and improving policies accordingly, it is expected that a more eco-friendly and efficient reduction of carbon dioxide can be achieved.

Carbon sequestration through forestry represents a promising approach to partially counteract anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. Tree growth naturally removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, storing it as biomass. Sustainably managed forests can effectively function as carbon sinks. However, determining optimal forestry policies involves balancing complex ecological dynamics with economic constraints. This study develops differential equation models quantitatively capturing forest growth, timber harvesting, and carbon sequestration dynamics. Logistic models are first adapted to simulate biomass accumulation of representative tree species. Lifecycle growth patterns spanning juvenile to mature phases are incorporated, along with climate effects. Biomass levels are proportionally related to carbon dioxide removal rates from the atmosphere. Deforestation impacts are analyzed by incorporating harvesting-induced biomass reductions. Sustainability constraints are implemented to ensure minimum viable tree densities across harvest rotations. Optimization techniques then identify management guidelines maximizing economic returns given ecological stability considerations. The goal is providing quantitative insights into rotation lengths, planting densities, and allowable cuts upholding both climate change mitigation and commercial demands. Findings can inform science-based forestry policies to leverage forests as sustainable natural carbon sinks.

"Closed Circuit Rebreathers (CCRs) are a type of Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) used predominantly by the diving community. CCR technologies have become prevalent within the commercial, military and technical diving communities over recent years. CCRs work by recycling breathing gas, by-passing the gas through a carbon dioxide (CO2)chemical scrubber and topping the resultant scrubbed gas up with pure oxygen to maintain the oxygen content at a level which supports life. One of the main dangers currently faced by divers using this equipment is the risk of CO2 poisoning if the scrubber fails. This failure occurs due to CO2 breakthrough - where breakthrough is defined as the time until the canister effluent passes through the chemical absorbent unscrubbed. There are a variety of reasons for CO2 breakthrough, and not all of the reasons can be identified by the operator. A better understanding of CO2 absorption within CCRs would lead to a reduction in failures. There are a variety of potential causes of CO2 breakthrough, where breakthrough is defined as the time until the canister effluent passes through the chemical absorbent unscrubbed. Not all of the causes can be compensated for by the operator. A transient computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model investigating the kinetics of flow and CO2 absorption focusing on the chemical reaction between the absorbent soda lime and CO2 is presented in the thesis. It presents the first reported mixture model theory simulation of the CCR scrubber using Ansys CFX 13.0. An extensive review of the design of CCRs, their applications and current modelling techniques identified a need to enhance the simulation of CCRs using the mixture model theory to simulate the chemical reactions occurring within the scrubber system of the CCR. The application of CFD techniques on CCRs allows the in depth analysis of the reaction between soda lime and CO2 using the graphical display provided by the simulated model. The simulation studies undertaken present a transient model with the ability to investigate seven key parameters affecting scrubber performance; geometry, wall temperature, inlet velocity, pressure, CO2 absorption, granule size and material selection. Analyses of the results demonstrate the sensitivity of the parameters to their behaviour on CO2 breakthrough. Due to the requirement of strong coupling between the phases of CO2 and soda lime, the mixture model is the best suited model for the liquid-particle mixture. Analysis of mesh size, mesh type and inflation are made to independently characterise the accuracy of the presented model by means of convergence before further comparisons with experimental data. The importance of mesh refinement is demonstrated as well as the contribution of inflation and grid independence to the accuracy of the model. A versatile model simulating chemical reactions within a CCR canister for different geometrical scrubber designs has been shown to be capable of analysing the design parameters of interest. A CCR scrubber model will bring new learning into the kinetics of CO2 absorption. It may also further the technology of monitoring scrubber duration in real time for a user. Data collected from a user may be fed into the system to allow a visual analysis of the scrubber. The first section of this thesis describes the operational requirements of the CCR system and in order to validate the CFD model, an experimental program was designed where an experimental test rig was manufactured to undertake experiments to study the impact of CO2 breakthrough of various parameters. The system incorporated CO2, O2, humidity and temperature sensors where the rig tested the scrubber’s capacity to absorb CO2 which is pumped in a controlled environment to benchmark the initial designs against existing literature. A review of the state of the art identified five feasible parameters important to scrubber kinetics; (i) geometry, (ii) material selection, (iii) inlet gas velocity, (iv) granule size and (v) packaging of the granules. These results gave an indication to the scrubber’s capacity to absorb CO2. CO2 absorption can be further inferred by placing thermocouples at various places within the canister and using relationship between the reaction and temperature to give an indication of absorption within the scrubber. As the chemical reaction occurs, the temperature rises and water vapour is produced. Through measuring both temperature and humidity, it was found that temperature gave the most consistent indication of CO2> absorption rather than humidity as the higher the humidity levels, the more erratic the humidity results became. The result of the experimental testing is a body of data benchmarked off current literature for validation which is used to compare with a transient CFD model to further the knowledge of CO2 absorption. The development of a CFD model for the CCR scrubber allows the simulation to assist in future designs of CCR system. It allows the simulation of alternative scrubber geometries which may be subjected to external parameters to assess their performance. The advantage to implementing a design through CFD allows the user to simulate alternative CCR scrubber designs before incorporating a manufacturing cost to assess the performance of a given design. This reduces cost, time and can assist the decision of manufacturing a given CCR scrubber. The results demonstrate that the CFD simulation using the mixture model theory is sufficiently reliable to simulate the reaction between CO and soda lime in CCR scrubbers."

In the context of global climate change, all industries have put forward the requirements for carbon emission reduction. The effective use of water resources is the key to achieving carbon emission reduction, so it is particularly important to review the carbon dioxide emission equivalents of water resource utilization behaviors (CEE-WRUBs) of water users. However, existing research on CEE-WRUBs across various water sectors remains inadequate. Therefore, this study integrates the enhanced CEEA method, LMDI decomposition model, and IOA method to analyze CEE-WRUBs across diverse water use terminals. Then seeks their main driving factors and their transfer pattern among different industries, which are crucial to the realization of the global carbon neutrality objective. The results showed that: (1) China's CEE-WRUBs show a significant downward trend. Industrial water use emerges as the primary source of CEE, but the CEE-WRUBs of most industrial water terminals show a fluctuating downward trend. Grains' water use behavior (WRUBs) absorbed the largest CEE, reaching 14,698 Mt in 2020. (2) the water efficiency effect emerges as the predominant driver behind the increase in CEE-WRUBs most of the time, and holding a prominent position. The carbon emission intensity effect primarily steers the reduction of CEE-WRUBs. (3) the largest net outflow sector of WRUBs embodied carbon in 2007-2020 was transformed from basic material heavy industry (-153.54 Mt in 2007) to agriculture (-128.26 Mt in 2020). Most of the WRUBs embodied carbon of agriculture flows into light industry, while most of the WRUBs embodied carbon of basic material heavy industry flows into finishing heavy industry and construction. The methods and results of this study provide a potential reference for investigating the regional water-carbon relationship and advancing the global carbon neutrality objective.

Изучено восстановление диоксида углерода молекулярным водородом в присутствии Fe, Cr-катализаторов, нанесенных на углеродный материал Сибунит, при 400 °С и давлениях) 0,1 и 8,5 МПа. Селективное образование монооксида углерода возможно при соотношении металлов Fe/Cr в катализаторе, равном 1-5. При уменьшении содержания хрома (образец 5Fe-0,25Cr/C) наряду с CO образуются углеводороды C-C с преобладанием метана. Методом просвечивающей электронной микроскопии показано, что основной фазой в катализаторе 5Fe-5Cr/C является хромит железа FeCrO (структурный тип шпинели), препятствующий восстановлению железа и образованию его карбидов, которые, в свою очередь, обеспечивают синтез углеводородов при взаимодействии СO и Н. The reduction of carbon dioxide with molecular hydrogen in the presence of Fe,Cr-containing catalysts supported on Sibunit carbon material at 400C and pressures of 0,1 and 8,5 MPa was studied. Selective formation of carbon monoxide is possible over the catalysts with the ratio Fe: Cr = 1-5. C-C hydrocarbons with a predominance of methane are formed along with CO at decreasing chromium content in the catalyst (5Fe-0,25Cr/C sample). It was shown by transmission electron microscopy that the main phase in 5Fe-5Cr/C catalyst is iron chromite FeCrO (spinel structural type), which prevents the reduction of iron and the formation of its carbides, which, in turn, provide the formation of hydrocarbons upon the interaction of CO and H.

Abstract We build a vehicle purchase and disposal model to analyze a policy that links a new electric vehicle (EV) purchase subsidy with a used gasoline vehicle scrappage requirement. We evaluate the policy based on changes in sales, scrappage, subsidy dollars spent, and emissions reductions. We find that linking a purchase subsidy with a scrappage requirement is expected to result in fewer new EV sales and carbon dioxide emissions reductions relative to a policy without linking. Our modeling reveals that these effects are due to trade‐in vehicle eligibility requirements and opportunity costs lowering additional participation in the linked policy. However, the linked policy significantly increases used vehicle scrappage and is more progressive than the unlinked policy. We find that emissions reductions due to additional scrappage are sensitive to how remaining miles of scrapped vehicles are replaced.

Abstract Background Clostridium autoethanogenum is an acetogenic bacterium that autotrophically converts carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) gases into bioproducts and fuels via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP). To facilitate overall carbon capture efficiency, the reaction stoichiometry requires supplementation of hydrogen at an increased ratio of H 2 :CO to maximize CO 2 utilization; however, the molecular details and thus the ability to understand the mechanism of this supplementation are largely unknown. Results In order to elucidate the microbial physiology and fermentation where at least 75% of the carbon in ethanol comes from CO 2 , we established controlled chemostats that facilitated a novel and high (11:1) H 2 :CO uptake ratio. We compared and contrasted proteomic and metabolomics profiles to replicate continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) at the same growth rate from a lower (5:1) H 2 :CO condition where ~ 50% of the carbon in ethanol is derived from CO 2 . Our hypothesis was that major changes would be observed in the hydrogenases and/or redox-related proteins and the WLP to compensate for the elevated hydrogen feed gas. Our analyses did reveal protein abundance differences between the two conditions largely related to reduction–oxidation (redox) pathways and cofactor biosynthesis, but the changes were more minor than we would have expected. While the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway proteins remained consistent across the conditions, other post-translational regulatory processes, such as lysine-acetylation, were observed and appeared to be more important for fine-tuning this carbon metabolism pathway. Metabolomic analyses showed that the increase in H 2 :CO ratio drives the organism to higher carbon dioxide utilization resulting in lower carbon storages and accumulated fatty acid metabolite levels. Conclusions This research delves into the intricate dynamics of carbon fixation in C. autoethanogenum , examining the influence of highly elevated H 2 :CO ratios on metabolic processes and product outcomes. The study underscores the significance of optimizing gas feed composition for enhanced industrial efficiency, shedding light on potential mechanisms, such as post-translational modifications (PTMs), to fine-tune enzymatic activities and improve desired product yields.

Industrialization and urbanization are amongst the major sources of air pollution. Though high-performance nanomaterials offer compelling advances for air filtration and purification. In this work, several nanomaterials were tested for their ability to remove particulates (PM2.5 and PM10) and VOCs, while evaluating the wear and tear of each material. Pressure had no effect on PM2.5 capture efficiency which was 80% using activated carbon, while carbon nanotubes were more efficient in PM10 capture despite greater pressure drop. Graphene oxide was very effective in the abatement of volatile organic compounds, which was not the case for titanium dioxide which performed as good as activated carbon in the capture of PM2.5 particles but with a pressure drop of the same magnitude. Silver nanoparticles were the most effective in a percent capture of PM10 particles at low pressure drop. Yeoman’s zinc was effective in re-absorbing volatile organic compounds from the dust. The PEI-coated and electro spun nanofibers are capable of capturing PM2.5 and PM10 particles respectively, and at relatively low-pressure reductions. Results from durability studies demonstrated that TiO2 and silver nanoparticles exhibited superior efficiency retention throughout numerous cycles, but PEI-coated nanofibers saw substantial efficiency degradation

Activation of CO2 is the first step towards its reduction to more useful chemicals. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions can lead to high value-added chemical and materials production while helping decrease anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In studies, it was found that copper metal clusters can reduce CO2 to more than thirty different hydrocarbons and oxygenates, yet they lack the required selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT)-based studies are carried out on copper clusters, doped clusters, nano-structures and Cu-based alloy catalysts to assess the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction to generate carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), formaldehyde (H2C=O), methanol (CH3OH) and methane (CH4 ). In this chapter, we will discuss the effect of the adsorption of CO2 on (Sc, Ti, V) metaldoped clusters. DFT studies carried out for these clusters showed a high CO2 adsorption energy, a low activation barrier for its dissociation, and a facile regeneration of the clusters. The reaction energies (dopant-dependent), the mechanisms for reaction, dissociation barriers for CO2, and less desorption energies (dopant dependent) for carbon monoxide (CO) during the activation of CO2 with Cu3X clusters (X= first row transition metals) are discussed in the chapter. C6Li6 is not capable of capturing CO2 molecules but is effective in their storage. The interaction of CO2with superalkalis such as FLi2 , OLi3 , and NLi4 and non-metallic superalkalis such as F2H3 , O2H5, and N2H7 is also included due to its applications.

Germany needs to reduce CO2 emissions from space heating in its old buildings to net zero by 2045 to fulfil its climate goals. However, direct CO2 reduction measures in existing buildings receive relatively little subsidy support from the federal government’s German Development Bank, compared to generous subsidies for energy efficiency measures. This interdisciplinary paper evaluates this phenomenon by comparing costs and CO2 abatement effects of ever higher energy efficiency measures, alongside the costs of direct CO2 reduction through heat pumps and onsite photovoltaics. It uses a set of carefully selected reports on the costs and benefits of renovation to a range of energy efficiency standards in three common types of multi-apartment buildings in Germany, updating these for 2024 construction, energy, and finance costs. The cost of the CO2 saved is extremely high with energy efficiency measures and absurdly high with the highest energy efficiency standards, up to 20 times the cost of CO2 abatement through other means, such as offsite renewables. This reduces markedly with onsite CO2 reduction measures. This paper sets this analysis in the context of asking what social, cultural, and discursive factors extol energy efficiency so highly that policy tends to thwart its own stated goal of deeply reducing CO2 emissions.

Silicon is a vital element in many products today, such as electronic components, solar devices, high-quality alloys, and many others. The growing global demand highlights the need for the development of sustainable production methods to meet this demand as an alternative to the current carbothermic reduction, submerged arc furnace (SAF) based process. An alternative to this is the aluminothermic reduction of quartz in a CaO-SiO2 slag, which not only reduces direct carbon dioxide emissions but also promotes the utilisation of secondary raw materials such as quartz fines, aluminium dross and scrap as well as secondary alumina (SA) from dross recycling. In the current study, the effects of SA and CaF2 additions to slag on the resulting metal composition and metal yield were explored. Results were compared with thermodynamic simulations using FactSage™ 8.1. Experimental results show that, in agreement with thermodynamic simulations, the silicon content of the alloy is increased, while the Ca is decreased for starting slags where CaO-SiO2 is partly replaced by CaF2. Similarly, the addition of SA to the initial slag results in an alloy with a higher silicon content.

Оценено влияние условий получения композитов на их активность и селективность в гидрировании дифенилацетилена (ДФА). Впервые изучена адсорбция гексафторацетилацетоната палладия на ССП из среды СК-С0 с использованием сверхкритической флюидной хроматографии (СКФ-хроматография); показано, что равновесие адсорбции описывается уравнением Ленгмюра. Metal - hyper-cross-linked polystyrene (HCP) composites active in the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons were obtained by impregnation of HCP with palladium and rhodium compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO) followed by their reduction to the metallic state with molecular hydrogen. The influence of the conditions for the preparation of composites on their activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene (DFA) was evaluated. The adsorption of palladium hexafluoroacetylacetonate on HCP from the SC-CO medium was studied for the first time using supercritical fluid chromatography; it is shown that the adsorption equilibrium is described by the Langmuir equation.

By deployment of rapid-scan (second time scale) electrochemical FT-IR reflection–absorption spectroscopy, we studied the reduction of CO2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 in deuterated water at a pD of 3.7. We report on the impact of dynamic changes in the bicarbonate equilibrium concentration in the vicinity of a polycrystalline Cu electrode, induced by step changes in applied electrode potential. We correlate these changes in interfacial composition and concentrations of dissolved species to the formation rate of formate, and provide evidence for the following conclusions: (i) the kinetics for the conversion of dissolved CO2 to formate (formic acid) are fast, (ii) bicarbonate is also converted to formate, but with less favorable kinetics, and (iii) carbonate does not yield any formate. These results reveal that formate formation requires (mildly) acidic conditions at the interface for CO2 to undergo a proton-coupled conversion step, and we postulate that bicarbonate reduction to formate is driven by catalytic hydrogenation via in situ formed H2. Interestingly CO was not observed, suggesting that the kinetics of the CO2 to CO reaction are significantly less favorable than formate formation under the experimental conditions (pH and applied potential). We also analyzed the feasibility of pulsed electrolysis to enhance the (average) rate of formation of formate. While a short positive potential pulse enhances the CO2 concentration, this also leads to the formation of basic copper carbonates, resulting in electrode deactivation. These observations demonstrate the potential of rapid-scan EC-IRRAS to elucidate the mechanisms and kinetics of electrochemical reactions, offering valuable insights for optimizing catalyst and electrolyte performance and advancing CO2 reduction technologies.

The objective of this study is to systematically investigate not only the influence of different additive types—beyond the much-considered case of aluminum-silicate-based additives—but also to carry out an additional comparison between primary and secondary emission mitigation measures during small-scale wood-chip combustion. Hence, combustion trials are realized within a 33-kW combustion plant. Pine wood chips additivated with 1.0 wt%a.r. of four additives have shown promising emission reduction effects in the past; namely kaolin (i.e., aluminum-silicate-based), anorthite (i.e., aluminum-silicate- and calcium-based), aluminum hydroxide (i.e., aluminum-based), and titanium dioxide (i.e., titanium-based). In addition to the primary mitigation measure (i.e., (fuel) additivation), an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) as a common secondary mitigation measure for total particulate matter (TPM) reduction is used for comparison. In addition to standard analyses (e.g., gravimetric determination of TPM emissions), an extended methodology (e.g., characterization of the elemental composition and ultrafine particle fraction of TPM emissions) is applied. The results show that the additivation of wood chips with kaolin and anorthite can lead to an operation of the combustion plant in compliance with the German legal TPM limit values by undercutting the absolute emission level achievable by the ESP. Additionally, kaolin and anorthite achieve significant reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, while kaolin simultaneously, and similarly to ESP, also leads to a shift in the particle size number distribution of PM emissions towards coarser particles. All additives show a significant reduction of potassium (K) emissions by the formation of high-temperature stable K compounds in the resulting ashes.

The implementation of energy-saving measures has a substantial and beneficial impact on the preservation of energy resources as well as the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. This study focuses on the design and experimental analysis of a water-to-air heat recovery system aimed at capturing waste heat from wastewater and transferring it to a fresh cold air stream using heat pipe technology. The research problem addressed in this study is the efficient recovery of low-grade thermal energy from wastewater, which is often underutilized. The prototype heat recovery unit was designed, manufactured, and tested in the laboratory to assess its performance across various operating conditions. The experimental setup included a system where the primary agent, hot water, was heated to 60 °C and circulated through the evaporator section of the heat recovery unit, while the secondary agent, fresh air, was forced through the condenser section. The system’s performance was evaluated under different air velocities, ranging from 3.5 m/s to 4.5 m/s, corresponding to airflow rates of 207.1 m3/h and 268.6 m3/h, respectively. The study employed analytical methods alongside empirical testing to determine the effectiveness of the heat recovery system, with the global heat transfer coefficient calculated for different scenarios. The efficiency of the system varied between 25% and 51.6%, depending on the temperature and speed of the fresh air stream. The most significant temperature difference observed between the inflow and outflow of the fresh air stream was 16.8 °C, resulting in a thermal output of 1553 W. Additionally, the average (mean) overall heat transfer coefficient of the unit was calculated to be 49 W/m2 K, which aligns with values reported in the literature for similar systems. The results demonstrate the potential of the designed system for practical applications in energy conservation and carbon emission reduction.

Abstract Carbon-doped silicon dioxide (SiCOH) film is currently regarded as one of the most promising low-k materials in the integrated circuits (ICs) industry for advanced technology nodes. However, there have been limited studies on the thermal properties of SiCOH compared to its electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, we investigate the thermal conductivity of SiCOH thin films through molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and experimental characterizations. Our findings indicate that the size effect on thermal conductivity at 300 K is negligible when the thickness of SiCOH film is less than 20 nm. Additionally, we observe a contrasting temperature dependence law for the thermal conductivity of SiCOH thin films compared to crystal SiO2 thin films. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing porosity in SiCOH films; specifically, an increase in porosity from 5.35% to 42.77% results in a 60% reduction in thermal conductivity. Moreover, we validate our simulation results by characterizing the thermal conductivity of SiCOH using 3ω method.&#xD;

This paper presents projections on the reduction of CO2 emissions through the implementation of off-grid PV systems on 33 farms located in rural areas of the Departamento del Magdalena, where horticultural activities are performed by small local producers. To achieve this, the emission reduction was estimated for a period of 25 years using the installed PV peak power on each farm, data from the Global Solar Atlas, the emission factor in Colombia for electricity generation and information established in the harmonization project of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). In order to compare the estimations, temperature and solar irradiance data were obtained from 10 farms near the installations, located in 8 municipalities within the department. With these data and through mathematical modeling, the energy generated by each PV system and the projection of non-emitted CO2 emissions were calculated. The results obtained demonstrated that, in both cases, the projections for emission reduction are similar, highlighting that the municipalities of Ciénaga and Sitio Nuevo contribute the highest amount of saved CO2 due to the projections of higher energy production in these locations.

The metal production industry is a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions due to the use of fossil fuels such as coal and coke. To mitigate these emissions and meet climate goals, innovative and sustainable technologies are required. Molten salt electrolysis is a promising technology that directly produces metals from their precursor sulfides or oxides using electricity. When combined with renewable electricity and an inert anode, the electrolysis process can be carbon neutral. This paper presents the results of two pilot-scale studies on the electrolytic reduction of metal oxides and sulfides in molten salts. The first study focuses on the electrolytic reduction of chalcopyrite in molten NaCl-KCl salt. The results demonstrate that in situ separation of copper, iron, and sulfur is possible, enabling the extraction of all valuable elements without CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the findings underscore the capability to eliminate impurities like zinc, antimony, arsenic, and mercury from the electrolysis product. The second study investigates the electrolytic reduction of pure/synthetic chemicals of wüstite, hematite, and magnetite, as well as a magnetite-type iron ore in molten NaOH salt. The findings reveal a stepwise reduction of iron oxides from high valence to low valence, ultimately leading to the production of metallic iron electrolytically. Notably, this study underscores the challenges associated with the selection of an economically viable and durable inert anode material for efficient oxygen generation. These results indicate that molten salt electrolysis provides a sustainable and green route for base metal production. The use of this technology has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in the metal production industry, contributing to achieving climate goals.

Aim. To identify specific features of production and use of transportation biofuels in selected developing countries, as well as to assess the potential of bioethanol industry development in the Russian Federation (RF). Objectives . To generalize the experience of production and use of transport biofuels in Brazil, China and Indonesia; to determine the specifics of biofuel industry development in the mentioned developing countries. Methods. The methods of system analysis, comparative analysis, method of expert evaluations, mathematical, statistical methods were applied in the process of research. Results. The specificity of biofuel industry development in Brazil, China and Indonesia is shown. The production and use of transportation biofuels in these countries is carried out within the framework of a systemic state policy focused on diversification of energy consumption, promotion of renewable energy sources, reduction of pollutant emissions and stimulation of economic growth. Opportunities and risks for the development of production and use of transportation biofuels have been identified. The opportunities include, first of all, the formation of additional demand for agricultural products (including waste) and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector. At the same time, the production of first-generation transportation biofuels can negatively affect food security, reorienting agricultural producers from the production of “food” to the production of “raw materials for the energy sector”, and natural ecosystems, contributing to the involvement of new land plots in agricultural turnover. Conclusions. System analysis of the accumulated experience of production and use of transport biofuels in Brazil, China and Indonesia indicates the promising development of bioethanol industry in Russia. At the same time, the realization of this direction should not contribute to the strengthening of anthropogenic impact on the environment and adversely affect the availability of food.

Soil carbon (C) cycling under anoxic conditions is mechanistically linked to dissimilatory iron (Fe) reduction, which could be regulated by exogenous dissolved organic matter (DOM). However, the impact of complex exogenous DOM on soil microbial activity and C-Fe coupling in paddy soils remains underexplored. With a 100-day microcosm experiment, we determined that the molecular composition of DOM derived from organic fertilizers and biochar on paddy soil affects soil microbial community, Fe reduction, and C emissions. Our results indicated that biochar-DOM significantly promoted Fe reduction and accelerated CH4 and CO2 emissions, and organic manure-DOM increased soil CO2 emissions, which was closely related to the molecular composition of exogenous DOM. DOM molecules with high aromaticity (AImod) and high DBE, including lignins-vascular plant-derived polyphenols, lignins-polycyclic aromatics (PA), and condensed aromatics-PA, promoted soil Fe reduction and CH4 emissions by enriching soil Fe-reducing bacteria (FeRB), reducing methanotrophs, and facilitating r-strategists at the early stage of incubation. Conversely, DOMs with low AImod, low DBE and high H/C, such as lignins-highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and proteins-aliphatic compounds, enhanced CO2 emissions by facilitating recalcitrant C degradation and CH4 oxidation at the late stage of incubation. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the molecular composition of DOMs derived from organic amendments in regulating soil Fe reduction and C emissions. The findings offer novel insights into the effective utilization of agricultural resources and the mitigation of soil C emissions.

The European decarbonization goals and requirement for energy independence are mostly relying on intermittent renewable energy sources for electrification. A numerical model was developed to simulate the operation of a steam generator, allowing a study of the potential impacts of retrofitting existing coal-fired power plants to operate with biomass or coal–biomass mixtures on combustion parameters and CO2 emissions. The results obtained using the operational parameters of the Sines power plant indicate that a mixture of 25% coal and 75% pine sawdust allow operation at λ = 1.8, demonstrating that a small amount of coal allows operation near the coal combustion parameters (λ = 1.9). These conditions have the drawback of a reduction of 8.7% in adiabatic flame temperature but a significant reduction of 57.5% in CO2 emissions, considering the biomass as carbon-neutral.

The catalytic cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides to produce valuable cyclic carbonates represents a simple and promising strategy for CO2 utilization, circumventing the ineffective CO2 reduction process. Despite current progresses, there remains an impending demand for highly‐active, cost‐effective and stable catalysts especially the ideal heterogeneous catalytic systems. Herein, we report the preparation of heteroatom‐containing zeolites through a two‐step process comprising of framework dealumination and subsequent heteroatom incorporation, and their catalytic applications in CO2 cycloaddition to epoxides. Characterization results reveal the successful incorporation of heteroatoms into framework to derive Lewis acidic M‐Beta zeolites (M=Ti, Zr or Hf). The as‐prepared M‐Beta Lewis acids show remarkable performance in the model reaction of CO2 cycloaddition to propylene oxide with the assistance of potassium iodide under solvent‐free conditions. The reaction parameters have been optimized employing Ti‐Beta catalyst and the substrate scope has been investigated. Finally, the impact of Lewis acidity on the cycloaddition reaction is discussed and the actual bifunctional Ti‐Beta/KI catalyst system is proposed, which is of important significance for the understanding of CO2 catalytic cycloaddition to epoxides.

Conveni-pack, a Daikin product, is an integrated refrigeration, cooling and heating system that recovers heat from the refrigeration to heat up the space. It additionally functions as a heatpump when additional heating is needed in winter and provides cooling in summer. In 2019, Daikin launches a new model that uses CO2 as refrigerant, next to the existing R-410A model. The CO2 version has comparable COP to the R-410A model so that TEWI is considerably lower and therefore an excellent product to reduce CO2 emissions and meet the requirements set by the European F-gas regulation. Daikin Europe N.V. has engaged in an EU funded project (LIFE) in which the reduction of the CO2 emissions using an integrated system in real shops across Europe and the impact of the raw materials used will be investigated. During 2020 – 2022, DENV will monitor 20 systems in real applications and research the potential of thermal storage to further reduce emissions.

The reaction of I with BH3∙SMe2 (1 : 1) in toluene affords the product of hydroboration of one formate group [(ArBIG-bian)Al(μ-OC(H)O)(OB(H)OCH3)Li(Thf)]2 (II), while the reaction of I with BH3∙SMe2 (1 : 2) is accompanied by reduction of both formate groups and gives complex [(ArBIG-bian)Al(OBOCH3)2OLi2(Thf)2BH4]2 (III), methoxyboroxine (CH3OBO)3 and, presumably, compound [(ArBIG-bian)AlOCH3]. The reaction of I with one equivalent of ammonia in THF gives adduct [(ArBIG-bian)Al(NH3)(μ-OC(H)O)2Li(Thf)2] (IV), in which ammonia is coordinated to the aluminum atom, while the key bonds in I have not undergone ammonolysis.

During the pyrometallurgical processes, a substantial quantity of high-temperature ironmaking and steelmaking slags, generated at temperatures ranging from 1400 to 1600°C, is wasted, as the heat contained in these slags is released into the environment during the tapping process without effective utilisation. On the other hand, a significant amount of energy is required to reheat the cold materials for the manufacturing of glass and mineral-wool, often necessitating the addition of high-silica materials to facilitate the production process. In this study, an innovative approach is presented to harness the heat present in molten metallurgical slags to directly produce new raw materials for glass and mineral-wool manufacturing while simultaneously reducing energy consumption and mitigating CO2 emissions. The theoretical amount of waste glass that can be effectively added in the process has been estimated via thermodynamic calculation. Experimental assessments were conducted to examine the impact of high-silica waste materials on the dissolution, melting and fluidity. Potential recipes for glass and mineral-wool manufacturing were suggested and an assessment of the energy savings, and reduction in CO2 emissions with manufacturing of glass and mineral-wool using this innovative approach were included. It was determined that the processes could lead to a reduction of over 26 kg of CO2 emissions per 100 kg of new material used, primarily due to the utilisation of heat from slag and the accelerated smelting process.

The No. 3 coal seam in the Yuxi Coal Mine has a measured maximum gas content of 25.59 m3/t, along with a maximum gas pressure of 2.9 MPa, indicating its high risk to gas and outbursts. To mitigate outburst risks of the coal seam, the 1301 working face has been implemented with gas pre-drainage measures by grid boreholes from underlying roadways. After one year of extraction, it was confirmed that the gas content at all 33 test sites was below 8 m3/t, meeting the outburst prevention standards. However, during subsequent coal tunnel excavation, the gas desorption index K1 value frequently exceeded the standard, resulting in numerous occurrences of abnormal gas emission or small-scale outbursts. To tackle the challenges associated with safe excavation following the first-round regional outburst prevention measures, a research and industrial trial of CO2 gas fracturing (CO2-Frac) technology for secondary outburst prevention and rapid excavation was completed. The results show that the dual-hole and high-pressure (185 MPa) CO2-Frac considerably contributes to outburst prevention. K1 exceedances per hundred meters of tunnel excavations were from an average of 2.54 without CO2-Frac to an average of 0.28 after the new technology was implemented, leading to an eight-fold reduction. Additionally, the monthly excavation footage increased from an average of 81.64 m without CO2-Frac to an average of 162.42 m with CO2-Frac, resulting in a two-fold improvement. The dual-hole and high-pressure CO2-Frac is an advanced technology for safe and efficient excavation for secondary outburst elimination in highly outburst-prone coal seams in the Yuxi Coal Mine, with potential for widespread application in similar coal seam conditions.

The catalytic applications of micron Cu powder are limited due to its large particle size and small specific surface area. Modifying micro-Cu powder to achieve a high catalytic performance is a challenge in the application of micron copper. In this work, micro-Cu was used to synthesize a CeO2–Cu catalyst, and the phase composition and surface pore structure were analyzed using XRD, BET, etc. The CO2 hydrogenation performance of the CeO2–Cu catalyst was analyzed in comparison with CeO2 and Cu, and we found that the CeO2–Cu catalyst exhibited a synergistic effect between Cu and cerium, resulting in a much higher hydrogenation performance at 500 °C than CeO2 or Cu alone. H2-TPR and TEM characterization revealed that the CeO2–Cu catalyst formed interfacial interactions with a relatively large Ce–Cu interface, where cerium oxide could promote the reduction of CuO and lower the reduction temperature. Additionally, cerium oxide formed a confinement structure for Cu, and the CeO2–Cu catalyst exhibited a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, thereby promoting the CO2 hydrogenation performance. Cu–CeO2 interaction provides valuable insights into the catalytic application of micron Cu powder.

Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a rapidly evolving technology that extracts CO2 directly from ambient air. This study presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of integrating DAC in HVAC systems, which can reduce indoor CO2 concentration and improve energy efficiency of HVAC systems. The DAC equipment is modeled in Modelica based on isotherm and thermodynamic equations, and pressure drop curves of the CO2 sorbent described in literature. The model is validated with data from the literature, and then integrated into a typical HVAC system available in Modelica Buildings library. The HVAC system is a Variable Air Volume (VAV) with reheater system for a one-floor office building with standard ASHRAE 2006 control sequences. Demand control ventilation strategies are designed to reduce the outdoor air flowrates when indoor CO2 concentrations are lower than the threshold, which is to maximize the benefits of integrating DAC. Four cases are proposed to assess the impacts of integrating DAC and DCV in HVAC systems in 8 different ASHRAE climate zones in the USA. The results show that by integrating DAC unit into the HVAC system, the average indoor CO2 concentration can be significantly reduced by over 45% against the baseline without a DAC unit. By integrating DCV, 0.39-21.66% of annual energy savings and 226-9539 kg carbon emissions reduction are observed across different climate zones. The highest energy savings are found to be achieved with cold climatic conditions while the lowest energy savings occur with favorable weather.

ConspectusCarbon dioxide (CO2) is recognized as a greenhouse gas and a common waste product. Simultaneously, it serves as an advantageous and commercially available C1 building block to generate valuable chemicals. Particularly, carboxylation with CO2 is considered a significant method for the direct and sustainable production of important carboxylic acids. However, the utilization of CO2 is challenging owing to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Recently, organic electrosynthesis has emerged as a promising approach that utilizes electrons or holes as environmentally friendly redox reagents to produce reactive intermediates in a controlled and selective manner. This technique holds great potential for the CO2 utilization.Since 2015, our group has been dedicated to exploring the utilization of CO2 in organic synthesis with a particular focus on electrochemical carboxylation. Despite the significant advancements made in this area, there are still many challenges, including the activation of inert substrates, regulation of selectivity, diversity in electrolysis modes, and activation strategies. Over the past 7 years, our team, with many great experts, has presented findings on electrochemical carboxylation with CO2 under mild conditions. In this context, we primarily highlight our contributions to selective electrocarboxylations, encompassing new reaction systems, selectivity control methods, and activation approaches.We commenced our research by establishing a Ni-catalyzed electrochemical carboxylation of unactivated aryl halides and alkyl bromides in conjunction with a useful paired anodic reaction. This approach eliminates the need for sacrificial anodes, rendering the carboxylation process sustainable. To further utilize the widely existing yet cost-effective alkyl chlorides, we have developed a deep electroreductive system to achieve carboxylation of unactivated alkyl chlorides and poly(vinyl chloride), allowing the direct modification and upgrading of waste polymers.Through precise adjustment of the electroreductive conditions, we successfully demonstrated the dicarboxylation of both strained carbocycles and acyclic polyarylethanes with CO2 via C–C bond cleavage. Furthermore, we have realized the dicarboxylative cyclization of unactivated skipped dienes to produce the valuable ring-tethered adipic acids through single-electron reduction of CO2 to the CO2 radical anion (CO2•–). In terms of the asymmetric carboxylation, Guo's and our groups have recently achieved the nickel-catalyzed enantioselective electroreductive carboxylation reaction using racemic propargylic carbonates and CO2, paving the way for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargylic carboxylic acids.In addition to the aforementioned advancements, Lin's and our groups have also developed new electrolysis modes to achieve regiodivergent C–H carboxylation of N-heteroarenes dictated by electrochemical reactors. The choice of reactors plays a crucial role in determining whether the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagents are formed anodically, consequently influencing the carboxylation pathways of N-heteroarene radical anions in the distinct electrolyzed environments.

Integrating CO2 capture and utilization by dry reforming methane (ICCU-DRM) technology is promising in concentrating and utilizing diluted CO2 from flue gas, which depends on developing Dual Functional Materials (DFMs) with adsorption and catalytic sites. Ni-Ca materials are widely applied in ICCU-DRM due to their excellent catalytic and CO2 adsorption properties. Nevertheless, the challenge remains that oxygen in the actual flue gas would oxidize the active Ni, leading to a delay in the DRM stage. In this work, Cu-promoted, ZrO2-stabilized Ni-Ca based DFMs were developed, which suppressed the delay and enhanced the performance of the DRM reaction. Attribute to the excellent reducing properties, Cu could be rapidly reduced in the CH4 atmosphere and further promote the reduction of NiO to the catalytically active Ni monomers by activating methane to generate reactive hydrogen (H*). What's more, attributed to the disappearance of delay times, it is accompanied by a satisfying yield distribution with a 0.11 decrease in H2/CO ratio and an improvement in conversion, especially CH4 conversion with an increase of more than 10%. In addition, the bifunctional material also exhibits favorable cycling stability due to the stabilizers.

The depletion of high-grade hard and lumpy chrome ores has forced Zimbabwean ferrochrome producers to resort to low-grade friable ores that have an average of 28 per cent fines against a set limit of 12 per cent. Submerged open arc furnaces currently in use are associated with eruptions within the furnace because of the high amounts of fines, high energy consumption, as well as high SO2 and CO2 emissions. Traditionally employed agglomeration methods such as pelletising and the use of coke in the furnace have been discarded because of the pressure to lower operational costs and to achieve higher profit margins. This research aims to develop a method to incorporate low-grade friable ore fines and unprocessed coal into production while lowering CO2 and SO2 emissions through a closed direct current (DC) arc furnace. The closed DC arc furnace could incorporate the friable ores and coal while maintaining above 90 per cent reduction rates. Preliminary findings also show that energy consumption could be reduced by up to 35 per cent by incorporating a pre-heating and pre-reduction system using the flue gases from the furnace. In the proposed circuit, the cost of production per ton of ferrochrome might be potentially lowered by an average of 30 per cent.

The CO2 footprints in the production of Mn-ferroalloys and silicon/ferrosilicon are correlated with the fossil carbon consumption. The CO2 emissions may be reduced in the Mn-ferroalloy process by increasing the degree of prereduction and reduction of carbonate materials, while the silicon/ferrosilicon process is optimised based on silicon yield. By changing the fossil reductant into biogenic reductants, the global warming potential will be decreased even more. Even if the reductants are biogenic reductants, there will still be a global warming potential (GWP) in eg the electrode consumption and the CH4 emissions in the charcoal production. To reduce the use of fossil reductants there are also more disruptive technologies like the use of H2 that at least for the silicon production is on a very low technology readiness level (TRL). Using metallothermic processes will reduce the use of carbon but requires carbon neutral metal reductants. Electrowinning can have low CO2 emissions, and the electrowinning of pure Mn is a technology of high TRL. Salt and oxide electrolysis is under investigation for both Mn and Si production however the research is still on a low TRL. The use of CCS/CCU (carbon capture storage/utilisation) is a part of obtaining carbon neutral processes. Last, the energy mix used for these energy demanding processes is discussed.

Ecosystems that experience elevated CO2 (eCO2) are crucial interfaces where intricate interactions between plants and microbes occur. This study addressed the impact of eCO2 and a N supply on faba bean (Vicia faba L.) growth and the soil microbial community in auto-controlled growth chambers. In doing so, two ambient CO2 concentrations (aCO2, daytime/nighttime = 410/460 ppm; eCO2, 550/610 ppm) and two N supplement levels (without a N supply—N0—and 100 mg N as urea per kg of soil—N100) were applied. The results indicated that eCO2 mitigated the inhibitory effects of a N deficiency on legume photosynthesis and affected the CO2 assimilation efficiency, in addition to causing reduced nodulation. While the N addition counteracted the reductions in the N concentrations across the faba beans’ aboveground and belowground plant tissues under eCO2, the CO2 concentrations did not significantly alter the soil NH4+-N or NO3−-N responses to a N supply. Notably, under both aCO2 and eCO2, a N supply significantly increased the relative abundance of Nitrososphaeraceae and Nitrosomonadaceae, while eCO2 specifically reduced the Rhizobiaceae abundance with no significant changes under aCO2. A redundancy analysis (RDA) highlighted that the soil pH (p < 0.01) had the most important influence on the soil microbial community. Co-occurrence networks indicated that the eCO2 conditions mitigated the impact of a N supply on the reduced structural complexity of the soil microbial communities. These findings suggest that a combination of eCO2 and a N supply to crops can provide potential benefits for managing future climate change impacts on crop production.

Mono- and di-substituted cerium oxide catalysts, viz. Ce0.95Cu0.05O2-δ, Ce0.90Cu0.10O2-δ, Ce0.90 Cu0.05Mn0.05O2-δ, Ce0.85Cu0.10Mn0.05O2-δ, and Ce0.80Cu0.10Mn0.10O2-δ, were synthesized via a one-step urea-assisted solution combustion method. The elemental composition and textural and structural properties of the catalysts were determined by various physical, electronic, and chemical characterization techniques. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction showed that co-doping of copper and manganese ions into the CeO2-δ lattice improved the reducibility of copper. Powder XRD, XPS, HR-TEM, and Raman spectroscopy showed that the catalysts were a singled-phased, solid-solution metal oxide with a cerium oxide cubic fluorite (cerianite) structure, and evidence of oxygen vacancies was observed. Catalytic results in the preferential oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream showed that complete CO conversion occurred between 150 and 180 °C. Furthermore, at 150 °C, Ce0.90Cu0.05Mn0.05O2-δ, Ce0.90 Cu0.10O2-δ, and Ce0.85Cu0.10Mn0.05O2-δ catalysts were the most active, achieving complete CO conversion and CO2 selectivity of 81, 79, and 71%, respectively. The catalysts performed moderately in the presence of CO2 and water, with the Ce0.90Cu0.05Mn0.05O2-δ catalyst giving a CO conversion of 80% in CO2, which decreased to about 60% when water was added.

The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations triggers a transient response in climate, leading to global temperature rise. As the climate warms, extreme events intensify. Given the global significance of the Amazon and the increasing efforts for environmental recovery in the region, this study aimed to understand the relationship between local land-use changes and the occurrence of extreme climate events in an area influenced by mining activities within the Brazilian Legal Amazon. Additionally, it sought to assess the impact of water deficit on the photosynthesis and growth of fast-growing species used in the reclamation of mining areas, growing under elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. Results suggested that large-scale deforestation has a regional impact occasionally outweighing local effect. Significant trends reveal a general pattern of drought that has been more intense in the north of the study area, regardless of land cover, whether preserved or deforested. Moreover, the dry season is getting drier, but the wet season is not getting wetter over the entire area, and extreme events are becoming more frequent. Regarding the impact on vegetation, our findings do not provide substantial evidence that the assessed species used in the reclamation of mining areas in the region will be profoundly impacted by the rise in atmospheric CO2 and intense drought events— particularly concerning plant growth and biomass production. Nonetheless, they might be affected by extreme heat. Ultimately, notable attention is directed towards a considerable reduction in the emergence of Pigeon pea individuals, which declined by half in resource-rich environments (elevated atmospheric CO2 and irrigation). This decline is likely a consequence of interspecific competition within the chambers and may indicate a shift in the composition of developing vegetation. Keywords: Climate-change. Drought.

In this work, we studied the synthesis and properties of catalytic chemisorbents based on titanium dioxide with additions of ZnO and γ-Al2O3. The goal was to obtain chemisorbents with desired performance characteristics and evaluate their potential in destructive hydrogenation of organo-sulfur compounds. Their sulfur capacity and hydrogenating capacity were measured by the static method with carbon disulfide absorption. Textural and morphological characteristics were deter-mined with the use of X-ray phase analysis, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and scanning electron microscopy. It was also found that addition of alumina did not give additional reflections on the X-ray pattern, in contrast to introduction of zinc oxide. It was found that addi-tion of zinc oxide significantly increased the values of the specific surface area, many times more than expected, according to additivity principle. Conversely, addition of alumina did not give the expected increase in surface area. The one and the other were explained through active interaction of phases. The ratios of components for obtaining chemisorbents with optimal strength properties were established. It was found that a composite consisting of titanium and aluminum oxides was more resistant to sulfurization than one with additions of zinc oxide. SEM and low-temperature ni-trogen adsorption/desorption methods confirmed the mesoporous structure of the studied samples, while the sample containing gamma alumina showed a more pronounced desorption branch to-gether with the surface consisting of spherical formations arranged in a regular order. The sample with zinc oxide had slit-like pores in its volume. Hydrogenation of thiophene with gaseous hydro-gen was carried out for the studied composites. Chromatographic analysis of the resulting product was performed. It was proven that composites based on titanium, zinc, and aluminum oxides not only had sorption properties with respect to organosulfur compounds, but also catalyzed their de-structive hydrogenation. Thus, it was established that the studied samples were chemisorbents. The study provides insight into synthesis and properties of catalytic titania-based chemisorbents, high-lighting the influence of additives and their potential for organosulfur reduction reactions.

In 2023, the CO2 growth rate was 3.37 +/- 0.11 ppm at Mauna Loa, 86% above the previous year, and hitting a record high since observations began in 1958, while global fossil fuel CO2 emissions only increased by 0.6 +/- 0.5%. This implies an unprecedented weakening of land and ocean sinks, and raises the question of where and why this reduction happened. Here we show a global net land CO2 sink of 0.44 +/- 0.21 GtC yr-1, the weakest since 2003. We used dynamic global vegetation models, satellites fire emissions, an atmospheric inversion based on OCO-2 measurements, and emulators of ocean biogeochemical and data driven models to deliver a fast-track carbon budget in 2023. Those models ensured consistency with previous carbon budgets. Regional flux anomalies from 2015-2022 are consistent between top-down and bottom-up approaches, with the largest abnormal carbon loss in the Amazon during the drought in the second half of 2023 (0.31 +/- 0.19 GtC yr-1), extreme fire emissions of 0.58 +/- 0.10 GtC yr-1 in Canada and a loss in South-East Asia (0.13 +/- 0.12 GtC yr-1). Since 2015, land CO2 uptake north of 20 degree N declined by half to 1.13 +/- 0.24 GtC yr-1 in 2023. Meanwhile, the tropics recovered from the 2015-16 El Nino carbon loss, gained carbon during the La Nina years (2020-2023), then switched to a carbon loss during the 2023 El Nino (0.56 +/- 0.23 GtC yr-1). The ocean sink was stronger than normal in the equatorial eastern Pacific due to reduced upwelling from La Nina's retreat in early 2023 and the development of El Nino later. Land regions exposed to extreme heat in 2023 contributed a gross carbon loss of 1.73 GtC yr-1, indicating that record warming in 2023 had a strong negative impact on the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to mitigate climate change.

In the pursuit of sustainable mobility and the decarbonization of transport systems, public authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the impact of travel speed on emissions within both low-speed and high-speed environments. This study critically examines the evidence concerning emission impacts associated with speed limit changes in different traffic environments by conducting a systematic review of the literature in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 25 studies that met the eligibility criteria were assessed. The results reveal mixed evidence for reducing emissions through speed limit reductions in low-speed areas. However, emerging evidence suggests that reduced urban speeds may abate emissions through enhanced traffic flow and a shift in modal preferences away from personal vehicle use. Additionally, in urban areas, minor observed emission reduction per vehicle can add up to large overall reductions due to the high number of vehicles. In high-speed contexts, the evidence is much clearer, showing that reduced speed limits correlate with significant reductions in NOx, CO2, and particulate matter emissions. The extent of these reductions is highly variable and contingent upon the specific speed limits or limit reductions, the local context, the vehicle type, and the baseline types and levels of pollutants. Notably, there is a lack of research on the effects of speed on emissions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), highlighting a critical area for future investigation. The findings of this study underscore the potential environmental benefits of speed management policies and advocate for the promotion of smoother and less aggressive driving behavior to mitigate emissions and enhance sustainable mobility in both low-speed and high-speed settings.

Abstract. Restoration of drained and extracted peatlands can potentially return them to carbon (C) sinks, thus acting as significant climate change mitigation. However, whether the restored sites will remain C sinks or switch to sources with a changing climate is unknown. Therefore, we adapted the CoupModel to simulate soil atmosphere exchanges and the associated ecosystem CO2 fluxes of a restored bog. The study site was a peatland in eastern Canada that was extracted for eight years before restoration. The model outputs were first evaluated against three years (representing 14–16 years post restoration) of eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), surface energy fluxes, soil temperature profiles, and water table depth data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the response of the simulated CO2 fluxes to the thickness of the newly grown mosses. The validated model was then used to assess the sensitivity of changes in climate forcing. CoupModel reproduced the measured surface energy fluxes and showed high agreement with the observed soil temperature, water table depth, and NEE data. The simulated NEE varied slightly when changing the thickness of newly grown mosses and acrotelm from 0.2 to 0.4 m but showed significantly less uptake for a 1 m thickness. The simulated NEE was -95 ± 19 g C m-2 yr-1 over the three evaluation years, and -101 ± 64 g C m-2 yr-1, ranging from -219 to +54 g C m-2 yr-1 with an extended 28-year climate data. After 14 years of restoration, the peatland has a mean C uptake rate similar to pristine sites, but with a much larger interannual variability, and under dry years, the restored peatland can switch back to a temporary C source. The model predicts a moderate reduction of CO2 uptake, but still a reasonable sink under future climate change conditions if the peatland is ecologically and hydrologically restored. The ability of CoupModel to simulate the CO2 dynamics and its thermal-hydro drivers for restored peatlands has important implications for emission accounting and climate-smart management of drained peatlands.

This study explores the impact of technological change and renewable energy adoption on Mexico's economy using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. As global concerns about climate change intensify, reducing carbon emissions has become a priority, but traditional CGE models often predict significant economic costs associated with fossil fuel restrictions. In this analysis, we modify the conventional CGE framework to incorporate increasing returns to scale and endogenously modeled technological change, reflecting the real-world diffusion of renewable energy technologies in developing countries like Mexico. By accounting for these factors, our model demonstrates that a combined policy of carbon taxation and renewable energy subsidies can achieve significant CO2 reductions without negatively impacting economic welfare. However, while the environmental benefits—such as reduced emissions of particulates, SO2, and NOx—are substantial, the overall welfare gains remain modest, and the policy's success depends on effective government implementation and potential trade impacts. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers in Mexico and other developing nations seeking to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability through strategic carbon emission reduction policies.

Abstract More than half of the world’s rivers experience occasional, seasonal, or permanent drying, and this may increase because of climate change. Drying, i.e., severe reduction in water flow even leading to streambed desiccation, can have a profound impact on the available aquatic habitat, biodiversity, and functions of rivers. Yet, to date, it is unclear whether similar drying events in comparable climate zones result in similar changes in ecosystem processes, such as river metabolism or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, we synthesise the detected effects of drying on gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), as well as on the emissions of GHGs (CO2 , CH4 , and N2 O) in rivers and streams. We examined the current available scientific literature detailing the impact of drying on these variables when measured either in the field or in the laboratory. We extracted data from 30 studies analysing GPP and ER responses, and data on GHG emissions from another 35 studies. Then, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether the magnitude and direction of the effects varied across the systems and climate zones studied, or according to the type (natural or human-induced) and severity of drying. In general, drying enhanced GPP (under low flows) and CH4 emissions, and decreased CO2 and N2 O emissions. The hydrological phases throughout streambed drying (low water flow, isolated pools, or desiccation) had differential effects on metabolism and GHG emissions. The effects of drying were generally more severe when it induced desiccation, rather than just periods of low flow. Desiccation strongly reduced GPP, likely because of the die-off of algae, while its negative effect on ER was smaller. Greater decrease in GPP than in ER under desiccation would lead to increase in CO2 emissions; our results showed accordingly that desiccation increased CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of the effects varied depending on the study type. Experimental studies conducted in micro- and mesocosms demonstrated greater effects than field studies, thus the extrapolation of results from these to real conditions should be done with caution. Overall, the effects’ direction was inconsistent across climate zones, except for the Mediterranean climate zone, where drying was showing a negative effect on both metabolism and GHG emissions. Our synthesis may contribute to identifying the worldwide trends and patterns of drying on riverine functions associated to global change impacts on river and stream ecosystems.

To utilize the sensible heat of hot roasted iron ore pellets with no CO2 emission in the production of metallized pellets for direct steelmaking, the pellets were reduced in H2 during their cooling process with variable cooling rates. When the cooling rate decreased from 5.2 °C/min to 2.0 °C/min, the total iron content, reduction degree, and iron metallization degree of the pellets increased continuously from 74.0 wt%, 52%, and 31.1% to 84.9 wt%, 93.4%, and 89.2%, respectively. However, the compressive strength of the pellets increased initially from 2100 N/p to 2436 N/p and then decreased considerably to 841 N/p. As the cooling rate decreased, more Fe2O3 was reduced to Fe with diminishing FeO and Fe2SiO4. The porosity of the pellets increased from 23.9% to 54.3%, with higher distribution uniformity of pores. The morphology of metallic iron particles also transited from a layered form to a spherical form and lastly to a porous reticular form. Meanwhile, the metallic iron particles in the pellets grew evidently with more uniform distributions. When the cooling rate was 3.7 °C/min, the resulting metallized pellets had the reduction degree of 74.2%, iron metallization degree of 66.9%, and the highest compressive strength of 2436 N/p, in association with the spherical morphology and relatively large size of metallic iron particles.

Background: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a chronic condition caused primarily by human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, leading to recurrent growths in the respiratory tract. These types of papilloma can cause significant morbidity due to airway obstruction, often requiring frequent surgical interventions. Traditional treatments, including surgical removal and adjunctive therapies like antivirals and immune modulators, often fail to prevent recurrence, impacting the patient’s quality of life. Case description: This report presents a 25-year-old female with a long-standing history of RRP, diagnosed at age 2. Despite numerous interventions, including CO2 laser ablations, interferon therapy, HPV vaccination, and a laryngotomy with tracheal reconstruction, the patient continued to experience severe airway obstruction requiring frequent surgeries. In 2023, intravenous therapy with bevacizumab, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor was introduced, leading to a significant reduction in the frequency of surgical interventions from 8 to 4 per year. This reduction improved the patient’s respiratory function and quality of life, highlighting bevacizumab’s therapeutic potential. Conclusion: The case underscores the debilitating nature of RRP and the challenges of its management. Bevacizumab, by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has shown promise in reducing papilloma growth and the need for frequent surgeries. This case supports the inclusion of bevacizumab as an adjunctive therapy in RRP treatment, warranting further research to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety.

The aim of this experiment is to explore the effect of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on methane reduction in the rumen, and its impact on anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME). Using mixed rumen fluid from four Angus cattle fistulas, this study conducted an in vitro fermentation. Adding Na2SO4 to the fermentation substrate resulted in sulfur concentrations in the substrate of 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1.0%, 1.2%, 1.4%, 1.6%, 1.8%, 2.0%, 2.2%, and 2.4%. The gas production rate and methane yield were measured using an in vitro gas production method. Subsequently, the fermentation fluid was collected to determine the fermentation parameters. The presence of ANME in the fermentation broth, as well as the relationship between the number of bacteria, archaea, sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), ANME, and the amount of Na2SO4 added to the substrate, were measured using qPCR. The results showed that: (1) the addition of Na2SO4 could significantly reduce CH4 production and was negatively correlated with CO2 production; (2) ANME-1 and ANME-2c did exist in the fermentation broth; (3) the total number of archaea, SRB, ANME-1, and ANME-2c increased with the elevation of Na2SO4. The above results indicated that Na2SO4 could mitigate methane production via sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (S-DAMO) in the rumen. In the future management of beef cattle, including sodium sulfate in their diet can stimulate S-DAMO activity, thereby promoting a reduction in methane emissions.

This paper examines the impact of ten microeconomic factors on hotel business success. This research encompassed a sample of 115 small, family-operated hotels situated in rural regions of the Western Balkan countries (WBC). This research was based on the assumption that factors such as the size of the hotel, age, solvency, liquidity, labour productivity, capital productivity, CSR, and reduction of CO2 emissions exhibit a positive influence on business success, whereas leverage, indebtedness, and energy consumption have a negative effect on the business success of hotels. The findings revealed that business success from the previous period, size, liquidity, and CSR exhibit a positive influence on business success, whereas leverage, capital productivity, and indebtedness demonstrate a negative effect. Conversely, the age of the hotel and labour productivity were not found to significantly influence business success, as did energy consumption. In the context of sustainable development, a positive CSR impact means that tourists value this behaviour of the hotel, while a lack of a statistically significant impact of energy consumption implies either that hotels do not implement efficient measures of energy efficiency or that energy efficiency may not be a crucial factor in attracting guests or influencing their loyalty. The findings also show that labour productivity expressed conventionally does not have a statistically significant impact on hotel business success. However, when expressed in a way that respects the concept of sustainable development and CSR, workforce productivity is a significant factor in hotel business success. Due to the problem of multicollinearity, the influence of CO2 emissions was not examined. The findings suggest the following two groups of key measures: 1. Policymakers must work on ensuring more favourable conditions under which hotels can borrow, as well as on ensuring adequate infrastructure; 2. They must work on improving the strategy for maintaining liquidity to avoid the high costs of short-term loans and increasing size in order to further utilise economies of scale. These two microeconomic factors have the greatest impact on the business success of hotels.

In this study, the concept of symmetry is employed to implement an intelligent fuzzy traffic signal control system for complex intersections. This approach suggests that the implementation of reduced fuzzy rules through the reduction method, without compromising the performance of the original fuzzy rule base, constitutes a symmetrical approach. In recent decades, urban and city traffic congestion has become a significant issue because of the time lost as a result of heavy traffic, which negatively affects economic productivity and efficiency and leads to energy loss, and also because of the heavy environmental pollution effect. In addition, traffic congestion prevents an immediate response by the ambulance, police, and fire brigades to urgent events. To mitigate these problems, a three-stage intelligent and flexible fuzzy traffic control system for complex intersections, using a novel hybrid reduction approach was proposed. The three-stage fuzzy traffic control system performs four primary functions. The first stage prioritizes emergency car(s) and identifies the degree of urgency of the traffic conditions in the red-light phase. The second stage guarantees a fair distribution of green-light durations even for periods of extremely unbalanced traffic with long vehicle queues in certain directions and, especially, when heavy traffic is loaded for an extended period in one direction and the short vehicle queues in the conflicting directions require passing in a reasonable time. The third stage adjusts the green-light time to the traffic conditions, to the appearance of one or more emergency car(s), and to the overall waiting times of the other vehicles by using a fuzzy inference engine. The original complete fuzzy rule base set up by listing all possible input combinations was reduced using a novel hybrid reduction algorithm for fuzzy rule bases, which resulted in a significant reduction of the original base, namely, by 72.1%. The proposed novel approach, including the model and the hybrid reduction algorithm, were implemented and simulated using Python 3.9 and SUMO (version 1.14.1). Subsequently, the obtained fuzzy rule system was compared in terms of running time and efficiency with a traffic control system using the original fuzzy rules. The results showed that the reduced fuzzy rule base had better results in terms of the average waiting time, calculated fuel consumption, and CO2 emission. Furthermore, the fuzzy traffic control system with reduced fuzzy rules performed better as it required less execution time and thus lower computational costs. Summarizing the above results, it may be stated that this new approach to intersection traffic light control is a practical solution for managing complex traffic conditions at lower computational costs.

The development of new building elements, such as concrete and mortar with sustainable materials, which produce a lower carbon footprint, is an achievable milestone in the short term. The need to reduce the environmental impact of the production of cement-based materials is of vital importance. This work focuses on the evaluation of the life-cycle assessment, production costs, mechanical performance, and durability of three mortars and three concrete mixtures in which mixed recycled aggregates (MRAs) and biomass bottom ash from olive waste (oBBA) were included to replace cement and aggregates. Powdered MRA and oBBA were also applied as complementary cementitious materials with a reduced environmental footprint. Chemical and physical tests were performed on the materials, and mechanical performance properties, life-cycle assessment, and life-cycle cost analysis were applied to demonstrate the technical and environmental benefits of using these materials in mortar and concrete mixtures. This research showed that the application of MRA and oBBA produced a small reduction in mechanical strength but a significant benefit in terms of life-cycle population and environmental costs. The results demonstrated that finding long-term mechanical strength decreases between 2.7% and 14% for mortar mixes and between 1.7% and 10.4% for concrete mixes. Although there were small reductions in mechanical performance, the savings in environmental and monetary terms make the feasibility of manufacturing these cement-based materials feasible and interesting for both society and the business world. CO2 emissions are reduced by 25% for mortar mixes and 12% for concrete mixes with recycled materials, and it is possible to reduce the cost per cubic meter of mortar production by 20%, and the savings in the cost of production of a cubic meter of concrete is 13.8%.

Today, economic development is inseparably linked with global environmental problems. So, the search for their solutions without adverse influence on economic growth became relevant. The energy transition can ambiguously affect the pace and dynamics of economic growth. The purpose of this work is to identify the influence of the dynamics of investment in renewable energy on economic growth for groups of developed and developing countries and verification of the following hypotheses: for developing countries, the growth of investments in the renewable energy stimulates economic growth. For developed countries, the growth of investments in the renewable energy inhibits economic growth. Research results: with an increase in the share of income invested in the capital of renewable energy by 1% in developed countries the rate of economic growth will decrease by 0.0001%; while in developing countries — will increase by 0.0001%. The indicated reduction in the rate of economic growth for developed countries can be considered as a “payment” for the preference of the future state of ecology before the current receipt of additional release. As for developing countries, the energy transition positively affects the pace of economic growth. The fourth energy transition is a solution for global environmental problems caused by the CO2 emissions. The fourth energy transition based on the expansion of renewable energy sources and the displacement of fossil fuel is necessary since it is important for sustainable development of current and future generations.

The increase in atmospheric CO2 leads to global warming and ecological environment deterioration. Carbon storage modeling and assessment can promote the sustainable development of the ecological environment. This paper took Xinjiang as the study area, analyzed the spatial and temporal evolution of land use in four periods from 1990 to 2020, explored the spatial relationship of carbon stocks using the InVEST model, and coupled the GMOP model with the PLUS model to carry out multiple scenarios for the future simulation of land use in the study area. We found (1) Over time, the types with an increasing area were mainly impervious and cropland, and the types with a decreasing area were grassland, snow/ice, and barren; spatially, the types were predominantly barren and grassland, with the conversion of grassland to cropland being more evident in the south of Northern Xinjiang and north of Southern Xinjiang. (2) The evolutionary pattern of terrestrial carbon stocks is increasing and then decreasing in time, and the carbon sink areas are concentrated in the Tarim River Basin and the vicinity of the Ili River; spatially, there are differences in the aggregation between the northern, southern, and eastern borders. By analyzing the transfer in and out of various categories in Xinjiang over the past 30 years, it was obtained that the transfer out of grassland reduced the carbon stock by 5757.84 × 104 t, and the transfer out of Barren increased the carbon stock by 8586.12 × 104 t. (3) The land use layout of the sustainable development scenario is optimal under the conditions of satisfying economic and ecological development. The reduction in terrestrial carbon stocks under the 2020–2030 sustainable development scenario is 209.79 × 104 t, which is smaller than the reduction of 830.79 × 104 t in 2010–2020. Land optimization resulted in a lower loss of carbon stocks and a more rational land-use layout. Future planning in Xinjiang should be based on sustainable development scenarios, integrating land resources, and achieving sustainable economic and ecological development.

Growing impact on the environment and the rising demand for water, energy and raw materials that has resulted from the worldwide expansion of industry, put the principles of sustainability and cleaner production in a front line, as emergent activity. The textile industry consumes a high amount of energy and generates an enormous quantity of wastewater-worldwide, it generates 20 % of industrial wastewater and 8 % of greenhouse gas (GHG), while cotton production uses large amounts of pesticides, water and fertilizers. Many aspects of sustainable textile industry are not related only to production process itself (product quality and its market price, production process, supply of raw materials and its costs), but also to nus products, energy and water consumption, equipment service time, occupational health, and environmental issue. Thus, successful companies in textile production are driven by the basic principles of sustainable development and implementation of good manufacturing practice and cleaner production principles. This paper presents main principles of environmental protection in textile industry to be adopted toward sustainable production; these principles consider minimization of water, energy, virgin raw materials and chemicals usage, which results in reduction of the CO2 emissions, toward climate neutral production and business. Described company increases the share of sustainable/renewable materials and recycled materials, by accomplishing its own sustainability goals concerning environmental issue.

The linear nature of the current plastics economy and increasing demand for polymers poses a pressing global problem. In this work, we explore the environmental and economic performance of a circular alternative for polymer production through chemical plastic recycling following the waste-to-methanol-to-olefins (WMO) route. We assess the life-cycle environmental impacts and techno-economic feasibility of this novel circular production route (CPR) in 2020 and 2050, and compare them to the existing linear production route (LPR), deploying naphtha steam cracking for olefin production, and a mix of landfill and incineration as end-of-life treatment. Our results showcase that CPR could enable significant impact reductions, notably in 2050 assuming a low-carbon electricity mix based on renewables. However, the shift from linear to circular comes with burden-shifting, increasing the impacts relative to LPR on five environmental indicators in 2020 (i.e., terrestrial and freshwater eutrophication, particulate matter formation, acidification, and metal/mineral resources use). From the techno-economic viewpoint, we found that ethylene from waste polymers could become competitive with fossil ethylene when deployed at large scale. Moreover, it is significantly cheaper than its green analogs, which deploy methanol-to-olefins with green methanol from captured CO2 and electrolytic H2, showcasing the potential of implementing high-readiness level technologies to close the loop for polymers.

The fast fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment at every stage of the product life cycle. There is a lack of research in the literature on the impact of fast fashion on the environment through logistics and transport. In this area, the greatest environmental impact is caused by air emissions, which is very important from the point of view of climate change. Therefore, this article deals with the analysis of the carbon footprint resulting from the fast fashion logistics process. The identification and assessment of fast fashion companies&#039; sustainability efforts in the area of transport-related emissions and sustainable transformation strategies was conducted using a case study method for selected brands (H&amp;M Group; Inditex, Shein). The study uses secondary data available in non-financial reports from 2023. After analyzing the data and content in non-financial reports on transport-related emissions, sev-eral important conclusions emerge. As a dominant practice, companies emphasize their reliance on external frameworks and standards, in particular the Global Reporting Initiative and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Companies prioritize reducing emissions from significant factors, such as production processes. The data disclosed in the reports (scope 1, 2, 3) are not clearly formulated, but they can be used to calculate the level of CO2 emission reduction/increase. The ar-ticle contains recommendations for companies to improve their reporting by including additional indicators expressing the efficiency of transport-related emissions.

Importance Impaired exercise capacity is a cardinal manifestation of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Aficamten Compared to Placebo in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive HCM (SEQUOIA-HCM) is a pivotal study characterizing the treatment effect of aficamten, a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, on a comprehensive set of exercise performance and clinical measures. Objective To evaluate the effect of aficamten on exercise performance using cardiopulmonary exercise testing with a novel integrated measure of maximal and submaximal exercise performance and evaluate other exercise measures and clinical correlates. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a prespecified analysis from SEQUOIA-HCM, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Patients were recruited from 101 sites in 14 countries (North America, Europe, Israel, and China). Individuals with symptomatic obstructive HCM with objective exertional intolerance (peak oxygen uptake [pVO 2 ] ≤90% predicted) were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from January to March 2024. Interventions Randomized 1:1 to aficamten (5-20 mg daily) or matching placebo for 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 24 in integrated exercise performance, defined as the 2-component z score of pVO 2 and ventilatory efficiency throughout exercise (minute ventilation [VE]/carbon dioxide output [VCO 2 ] slope). Response rates for achieving clinically meaningful thresholds for change in pVO 2 and correlations with clinical measures of treatment effect (health status, echocardiographic/cardiac biomarkers) were also assessed. Results Among 282 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [12.9] years; 115 female [40.8%], 167 male [59.2%]), 263 (93.3%) had core laboratory–validated exercise testing at baseline and week 24. Integrated composite exercise performance improved in the aficamten group (mean [SD] z score, 0.17 [0.51]) from baseline to week 24, whereas the placebo group deteriorated (mean [SD] z score, −0.19 [0.45]), yielding a placebo-corrected improvement of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.25-0.46; P &amp;lt;.001). Further, aficamten treatment demonstrated significant improvements in total workload, circulatory power, exercise duration, heart rate reserve, peak heart rate, ventilatory efficiency, ventilatory power, and anaerobic threshold (all P &amp;lt;.001). In the aficamten group, large improvements (≥3.0 mL/kg per minute) in pVO 2 were more common than large reductions (32% and 2%, respectively) compared with placebo (16% and 11%, respectively). Improvements in both components of the primary outcome, pVO 2 and VE/VCO 2 slope throughout exercise, were significantly correlated with improvements in symptom burden and hemodynamics (all P &amp;lt;.05). Conclusions and Relevance This prespecified analysis of the SEQUOIA-HCM randomized clinical trial found that aficamten treatment improved a broad range of exercise performance measures. These findings offer valuable insight into the therapeutic effects of aficamten. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05186818

The steel industry is facing challenges on a global scale that include depletion of resources, huge energy consumption, and the emission of CO2. The demand for iron products is increasing due to the increased infrastructural development. Zimbabwe produced cast iron from scrap metals. However, there is currently a shortage of scrap, and yet Zimbabwe is rich in limonite ores that are currently being underutilised. The possibility of using limonite ore as a sustainable feed for pig iron production was investigated by preparing some limonite ore carbon composite pellets. The results showed that the addition of coal to the limonite ore and calcium carbonate mix to form the composite pellets resulted in a decrease in the drop number as well as the dry compressive strength of the composite pellets. This research aims to improve the physical properties of the green pellets by the careful addition of hydroxyethyl cellulose as a binder that was found to improve the physical properties of the green pellet. This is important for materials handling during the production process of the composite pellets. Results showed that the drop number was substantially improved by the addition of 0.4 wt per cent hydroxyethyl cellulose while the dry compression strength improved from 2.5 kg/pelIet to around 23 kg/pellet irrespective of the amount of binder added. The binder improved the physical strength of the iron-carbon composite pellets enough to allow for large-scale production of the pellets that can be an alternative and sustainable feed for cast iron production. However more results on the indurated compression strength and other properties such as the reduction degradation index, swelling index, and the reducibility test are required.

The heavy metal and soluble salt content in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) negatively affects the leaching safety of cementitious material, thereby impacting their corrosion resistance and durability. In this study, an MSWI FA washing pretreatment was conducted to obtain WFA1, and a low-carbon, low-cost cementitious material (FBM) was prepared in combination with bottom ash (BA). The optimal ratio parameters determined through orthogonal experiments were a mass ratio of 51% blast furnace slag (BFS), 17% BA, 20% WFA1, and 12% flue gas desulfurized gypsum (FGDG). The FBM containing WFA1 exhibited strong macroscopic performance, with a compressive strength of 37.42 MPa for FB2 at 28 days. The leaching concentrations of Pb, Zn, As, and Cd met the standards for underground Class II water quality. The leaching concentrations of Cl– and SO42– were in the ranges of 90–200 mg/L and 20–100 mg/L, respectively. The reduction in the BFS/BA ratio led to decreased polymerization degree (RBO=0.310) and chain length (MCL=2.627) of C–(A)–S–H gel, along with a decrease in Al [VI] content in ettringite (22.63%). Furthermore, Cl– played a stronger role than SO42– in the generation of Friedel's salt. The economic benefit of producing one ton of FB2 was calculated to be 38.60 USD, with CO2 emission of only 10.97 kg. The ultimate aim of this study was for waste-generating enterprises to achieve internal synergy in the disposal of solid and hazardous waste, thereby creating a "zero-waste company and group."

The fast fashion industry significantly impacts the environment at every stage of, a product’s life cycle. The transport of products to wholesalers and stores, as one of the stages of the product life cycle, is often overlooked during the analysis of their carbon footprint. Therefore, research is needed on the impact of fast fashion on the environment through its logistics and transport, especially in relation to air emissions. This article attempts to determine how extensively fast fashion companies disclose the impact of their transport operations on their overall corporate carbon footprint, determine the proportion of total emissions attributed to transport, and evaluate the effectiveness of companies’ efforts to mitigate their transport-related environmental impact. This research used a case study method on selected brands (H&M Group, Inditex, Shein), using secondary data available in non-financial reports for 2023. As a result of the analysis of their non-financial reports on transport emissions, several key findings have been presented. Companies predominantly rely on external frameworks and standards, particularly the Global Reporting Initiative. However, the level of detail of the data presented varies. The priority for the surveyed companies is to reduce emissions from significant sources, such as production processes. The data disclosed in the reports (scope 1, 2, 3) must be clearly formulated and can be used to calculate the level of their CO2 emission reduction or increase. Companies should improve their environmental reporting by including indicators of their transport-related emissions. This approach provides a comprehensive view of their environmental impact, highlighting absolute values and efficiency metrics.

Returning straw to the field is a crucial practice for enhancing soil quality and increasing efficient use of secondary crop products. However, maize straw has a higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio compared to other crops. This can result in crop nitrogen loss when the straw is returned to the field. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how different methods of straw return affect maize (Zea mays L.) farmland. In this study, a field experiment was performed with three treatments (I, no straw returned, CK; II, direct straw return, SR; and III, straw returned in deep furrows, ISR) to explore the effects of the different straw return modes on soil carbon and nitrogen content and greenhouse gas emissions. The results indicated that the SR and ISR treatments increased the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the topsoil (0–15 cm). Additionally, the ISR treatment boosted the contents of total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3−-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and DOC in the subsurface soil (15–30 cm) compared with CK. When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, the ISR treatment led to an increase in CO2 emissions. However, SR and ISR reduced N2O emissions, with ISR showing a more pronounced reduction. The ISR treatment significantly increased leaf and grain biomass compared to CK and SR. The correlation analyses showed that the yield was positively correlated with soil DOC, and soil greenhouse gas emission was correlated with soil NO3−-N. The ISR technology has great potential in sequestering soil organic matter, improving soil fertility, and realizing sustainable agricultural development.

Melatonin (MT) is a multifunctional hormone that enhances crop resilience against various abiotic stresses. However, its regulatory mechanism of osmotic tolerance in forage oats (Avena sativa) plants under water-limited scenarios is still unclear. This study aimed to delineate the impact of MT pretreatment on the morphological, physiological, and biochemical functions of oat seedlings under osmotic stress. Our findings demonstrated that exogenous treatment of MT noticeably elevated leaf area while decreasing the root/shoot ratio of oat seedlings subjected to osmotic stress. Osmotic-induced 38.22% or 48.37% decrease in relative water content could be significantly alleviated by MT pretreatment on day 7 or day 14, respectively. MT treatment also significantly mitigated osmotic-induced decreases in photosynthetic parameters including net photosynthetic rate, stomatic conductance, and intercellular CO2 concentration as well as various chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, which could contribute to enhanced accumulations of free proline and soluble sugars in seedlings after being subjected to a prolonged duration of osmotic stress. Furthermore, MT markedly improved antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase along with the accumulation of ascorbic acid contributing to a significant reduction in reactive oxygen species under osmotic stress. In addition, the MT application induced a 978.12%, 33.54%, or 30.59% increase in endogenous MT, indole acetic acid, or gibberellic acid content under osmotic stress but did not affect the accumulation of abscisic acid. These findings suggest that an optimal concentration of MT (100 μmol·L−1) could relieve osmotic stress via improvement in osmotic adjustment, the enzymatic antioxidant defense system, and endogenous hormonal balance, thereby contributing to enhanced photosynthetic functions and growth of oat seedlings under water-limited conditions.

Oil and gas production from very low permeability shale reservoirs became a reality in the 1990s when Mitchel Energy developed novel fracking techniques, but the road ahead was very challenging until around 2008 when oil and gas production from low permeability shale reservoirs became a significant component of total oil and gas production in the US The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that in 2023, about 3.04 billion barrels (or about 8.32 million barrels per day) of crude oil were produced directly from tight-oil resources in the United States. This was equal to about 64% of total US crude oil production in 2023. Also, the current ultimate amount of oil production from such reservoirs is in the range of 3 to 8% of the in-place oil. Furthermore, the production rates from such reservoirs decline rapidly; thus, there is a compelling need for techniques to produce at least some of the enormous amounts of the remaining reservoir oil. The classical waterflooding or gas flooding used in conventional reservoirs is not plausible in unconventional shale reservoirs because the injection fluid displacement velocities are extremely small which prohibits oil displacement through any injection-production well pattern. Therefore, creative and imaginative approaches are needed to increase oil production without relying on injecting large quantities of water or gas to produce additional incremental oil. The current techniques include two vastly different cyclic injection-production methods—known as the huff-n-puff process. The first method involves injecting either CO2 or rich gas in a multi-stage, hydraulically fractured, production well and soaking for a few days, then producing the same well which generally would yield substantially increased oil flow rates. The second method involves injecting low concentrations of aqueous solutions containing surfactants or mutual solvents. This method is also applied as a huff-n-puff process similar to the gas injection huff-n-puff process. The gas injection huff-n-puff process requires expensive high-pressure injection compressors while solvent injection huff-n-puff requires simpler and less expensive water injection pumps. The mechanism of oil mobilisation by gas injection is generally due to mass transfer across gas-oil interface by molecular diffusion resulting in oil swelling, miscibility, viscosity reduction, and favourable shift in residual oil saturation in the oil relative permeability function. On the other hand oil mobilisation by surfactant solutions or mutual solvents includes reduction of the oil-water interfacial tension in the surfactant case, wettability alteration by surfactant and mutual solvents, and shift in residual oil saturation in the relative permeability function. Additionally, using a brine containing a mutual solvent or a surfactant results in substantial additional oil recovery first by cleaning the micro- and macro-fracture flow paths in the stimulated reservoir volume followed by changes in IFT, wettability, and irreducible oil solubilisation. In this paper we will present laboratory results, mathematical modelling concepts, and field results to illustrate each of the above processes.

Background: Thirty years ago, the first attempt by Saliba and colleagues was made to reduce the negative effects (hypercarbia) of exogenous surfactant (ES) by slowing its administration. Sixteen years later, we observed the first less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) attempt by Kribs and colleagues. Many studies, since that time, have tried to minimize the invasiveness of ES and subsequent cerebral blood flow perturbations through studies using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We sought to address this medical challenge by identifying a less problematic modality of ES administration by delivering multiple aliquots of ES instead of a single one, as typically performed. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a different way of administering ES using more aliquots could be a safe alternative that should be assessed in further studies. Methods: Patients between 26 + 0 and 35 + 6 weeks of gestational age (GA) requiring ES administration were enrolled (April 2023–February 2024). Differently fractioned doses were delivered according to an arbitrary standard dosage (0.3 mL per aliquot in babies < 29 weeks; 0.6 mL in babies ≥ 29 weeks), while NIRS and transcutaneous CO2 (tCO2) monitoring were always performed. ES’s effectiveness was assessed based on the reduction in the Oxygen Saturation Index (OSI) after administration. Persistent desaturation, bradycardia, and airway obstruction were defined as adverse effects and used to evaluate safety during ES administration, as well as variability in NIRS-rSO2 values and tCO2. Results: Twenty-four patients were enrolled with a median GA of 29 weeks (IQR 4.5) and BW of 1223 ± 560 g. In addition, 50% of the cohort received fewer than three aliquots, whereas the other 50% received more than three. Monitoring was started before the procedure and continued 30′ after the last ES aliquot administration. The variability in NIRS-SpO2 values was significantly higher in the group (p = 0.007) with a lower number of aliquots administered. Similarly, increased NIRS-rSO2 values (p = 0.003) and increased tCO2 levels (p = 0.005) were observed in infants who underwent an ES split after the administration of a low number of aliquots. Conclusions: Our data obtained from the group with > 3 fractionated doses of ES seem to justify the preparation of a more robust study, as the combination of reduced NIRS variability and reduced tCO2 maximum levels is consistent with more stable cerebral blood flow during the challenging time of ES administration.
