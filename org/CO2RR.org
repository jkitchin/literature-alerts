Porous Cu foam electrodes, suitable for cathodic CO2 reduction, were deposited in an acidic sulphate solution with different additives to obtain structures with a high real surface area and an adequate mechanical stability. The influence of the electrodeposition time and solution composition on the porosity parameters, microstructure and stiffness of Cu 3D structures was evaluated. Neither ammonium acetate nor polyethylene glycol were found to be effective additives to the Cu sulphate electrolyte to achieve the main objectives. Only the presence of Cl– ions in the deposition solution resulted in a threefold increase in the real surface area and the achievement of a sufficient mechanical stability of the Cu 3D structure. The latter effect is related to the specific influence of Cl– ions during the electrodeposition process on the microstructural characteristics, such as the size of micropores in the walls of holes and crystallite aggregates that form dendritic branches. These structural changes, in contrast to the Cu samples deposited in a solution without additives, resulted in larger real surface areas, while the denser structures deposited in the presence of Cl– ions ensured the mechanical stability of the 3D structure.

The addition of polar functional groups to porous structures is an effective strategy for increasing the ability of metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture CO2 by enhancing interactions between the dipoles of the polar functional groups and the quadrupoles of CO2. However, the potential of MOFs grafted to polar functional group to activate CO2 has not been investigated in the context of CO2 electrolysis. In this study, we report a mixed‐ligand strategy to incorporate various functional groups in the MOFs. We found that substituents with strong polarity led to increased catalytic performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction for these polarized MOFs. Both experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that the presence of polar functional groups induces a charge redistribution in the micropores of MOFs. We have shown that higher electron densities of sp2‐carbon atoms in benzimidazolate ligands reduces the energy barrier to generate *COOH, which is simultaneously controlled by the mass transfer of CO2. Our research offers an effective method of disrupting local electron neutrality in the pores of electrocatalysts/supports to activate CO2 under electrochemical conditions.

Abstract Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction technology offers an effective way to convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, presenting a sustainable solution for carbon emissions. Current electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction technologies encounter significant issues such as salt precipitation and hydrogen evolution, which prevent energy conversion efficiency, selectivity, current density, and stability from simultaneously meeting industrial standards. In recent years, researchers have discovered that increasing the CO 2 pressure on the gas supply could enhance the coverage of the catalyst and activate more CO 2 reduction reaction sites on the catalyst surface, which provides a practical and effective approach for optimizing the energy conversion and mass transfer. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of the development history and current status of high-pressure CO 2 electrocatalytic reduction technology, focusing on its reaction devices, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, we summarize and offer insights into the most promising research avenues to propel the field forward.

Copper-based materials play a vital role in the electrochemical transformation of CO 2 into C 2 /C 2+ compounds. In this study, cross-sectional octahedral Cu 2 O microcrystals were prepared in situ on carbon paper electrodes via electrochemical deposition. The morphology and integrity of the exposed crystal surface (111) were meticulously controlled by adjusting the deposition potential, time, and temperature. These cross-sectional octahedral Cu 2 O microcrystals exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) production through CO 2 reduction. In a 0.1 M KHCO 3 electrolyte, the Faradaic efficiency for C 2 H 4 reached 42.0% at a potential of −1.376 V vs. RHE. During continuous electrolysis over 10 h, the FE (C 2 H 4 ) remained stable around 40%. During electrolysis, the fully exposed (111) crystal faces of Cu 2 O microcrystals are reduced to Cu 0 , which enhances C-C coupling and could serve as the main active sites for catalyzing the conversion of CO 2 to C 2 H 4 .

Rational design of robust photocatalytic systems to direct capture and in-situ convert diluted CO2 from flue gas is a promising but challenging way to achieve carbon neutrality. Here, we report a new type of host-guest photocatalysts by integrating CO2-enriching ionic liquids and photoactive metal-organic frameworks PCN-250-Fe2M (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Mn) for artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction in gas-solid phase. As a result, [Emim]BF4(39.3 wt%)@PCN-250-Fe2Co exhibits a record high CO2-to-CO reduction rate of 313.34 μmol g−1 h−1 under pure CO2 atmosphere and 153.42 μmol g−1 h−1 under diluted CO2 (15%) with about 100% selectivity. In scaled-up experiments with 1.0 g catalyst and natural sunlight irradiation, the concentration of pure and diluted CO2 (15%) could be significantly decreased to below 85% and 10%, respectively, indicating its industrial application potential. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that ionic liquids not only benefit CO2 enrichment, but also form synergistic effect with Co2+ sites in PCN-250-Fe2Co, resulting in a significant reduction in Gibbs energy barrier during the rate-determining step of CO2-to-CO conversion. Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction from fuel gas is promising but challenging for carbon neutrality. Here, the authors report a host-guest system by integrating CO2-enriching ionic liquids and photoactive metal-organic frameworks, greatly enhancing CO2-to-CO conversion efficiency.

Abstract The EU policies related to CO 2 emission strictly define the stages of carbon neutrality achieving. According to these regulations, all production installations that emit carbon dioxide will be charged additional emission fees from 2026 to fully in 2035. Analysis of the increasing emission fees shows that in some industries incurring such additional costs will result in a lack of profitability of the products. Industries directly related to the food sector, such as nitrogen fertiliser production, are strategic in the economies of all countries. Nitrogen fertilisers are produced from ammonia, which is synthesised on a large scale from hydrogen and nitrogen. Hydrogen is produced by natural gas reforming with water vapour resulting in syngas (mixture of H 2 , CO, CO 2 , H 2 O), which CO in the next step reacts with water vapour (water gas shift reaction) producing H 2 and CO 2 . CO 2 is separated from hydrogen using the Benfield method. The analysis of the Benfield process (one process of hydrogen production) shows a possible way to reduce CO 2 emission by optimising heat balance. It was shown that in the proposed technology the heat recovery reaches 89%, while the level below 30% was reported for other available technologies. The proposed solution is based on recirculation and reuse of heat, which is lost in other technologies. The analysis is for a process balance in a medium-sized hydrogen production installation. The analysis considers also the correlations with other installations thermally linked to hydrogen production. The economic balance showed the great financial benefits of this solution. In the scenario discussed, the CO 2 emission factor was reduced by 20%. Graphical Abstract

The protonation of CO is recognized as the rate-determining step in the generation of C1 products during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on Cu surfaces. Despite its importance, the detailed mechanism and the precise proton source for this elementary step remain elusive and are under intense debate. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been used to investigate such a mechanism. However, semi-local functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level face significant challenges in accurately describing adsorbate-metal interactions and surface stability. In this work, we employed the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), a method based on many-body perturbation theory, to overcome these limitations. We coupled the RPA framework with the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation to model solvation effects and incorporated a surface charging method to account for the influence of the electrochemical potential. Our study reveals that, in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, adsorbed water at the surface acts as the proton source for the reduction of *CO to *COH over a wide range of potentials via the Grotthuss mechanism. At highly negative potentials, solvent water becomes the primary proton donor, with multiple competing mechanisms observed. In contrast, DFT-GGA functionals not only significantly underestimate the reaction barriers for *COH formation but also consistently predict solvent water as the proton source across all the potentials of interest. Additionally, RPA offers distinct insights into H2O adsorption and highlights the significant range of reducing potential within which surface *OH can exist, which is crucial for accurate CO2RR modeling. These potential-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic data illustrate a pronounced divergence between the mechanistic insights offered by RPA and those derived from DFT-GGA functionals. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on proton transfer in CO2RR and establish a framework for future theoretical studies of electrochemical processes.

This paper considers the design of two combustion chambers of a gas turbine engine running on natural gas. One combustion chamber has 32 burners, and the other has 136 nozzles located in two rows in the flame tube head. A major contributor to global warming is considered to be the significant emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily CO2, including those emitted by gas turbine engines and power plants. The reduction of carbon dioxide levels by developing a set of structural measures in the combustion chamber is one of the urgent tasks of engine construction which requires a solution in order to meet modern environmental requirements for gas turbine engines serving as blower drives for gas compressor units. The presented research is dedicated to the analysis of influence of changes in combustion chamber design on reduction of СО2 level in exhaust gases of gas turbine engine NK-16ST. Two modifications of the combustion chamber are considered. The first one was a serial combustion chamber with diffusion combustion, the second one was a modernized combustion chamber with a modified front device. Each of the chambers considered was tested as part of the engine. During the study, combustion products were sampled directly in the exhaust shaft and their concentrations, including the CO2 content, were determined. As a result of this work, it was confirmed that there is a possibility to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the engine combustion products up to 20 % without affecting the engine parameters. This reduction in carbon dioxide content was made possible by reducing the completeness of fuel combustion in the combustion chamber. The obtained data on changes in CO2 concentration can be useful in selecting the most suitable mode of engine operation, and the presented approaches to combustion processes organization can be used by developers in designing combustion chambers of natural gas-fired gas turbine engines.

The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high-value organic chemicals by the microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system relies heavily on the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials. In this work, CO2 reduction for acetate production was greatly boosted by decorating the carbon felt cathode using the Fe–Mn bimetallic oxides, using an enriched anaerobic mixed culture dominated by the homoacetogen Acetobacterium wieringae. In comparison with the unmodified carbon felt as the cathode in the MES reactor, modification with MnFe2O4 increased the acetate production rate from 28 to 78 g/(m2·d), higher than those with MnO at 59 g/(m2·d) and Fe2O3 at 62 g/(m2·d), and the relative abundance of A. wieringae increased dramatically from 51 to 87% in the biofilm. This was probably due to the mediated electron uptake via the redox cycles of Mn(III)/(II) and Fe(III)/(II), improved specific surface area, and enhanced hydrophilicity of the cathode, benefiting from the synergistic effect of Fe and Mn ions. Overall, this study provides a facile and promising electrode modification strategy for MES with Fe–Mn bimetallic oxides for efficient CO2 conversion and acetate production, bringing the world closer to achieving carbon neutrality.

Abstract With the growing urgency of global climate issues, reducing carbon dioxide emissions has become a crucial component of the sustainable energy transition. Innovative technologies are receiving increased focus, with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) emerging as a promising solution to mitigate the environmental impacts of fossil fuel consumption and industrial emissions. As nations strive to meet ambitious carbon reduction targets, the exploration of effective CCS applications becomes paramount. However, despite the potential of CCS, significant challenges persist in its widespread implementations due to limited information especially on long term wellbore integrity. This paper aims to offer insights and provide a comparative analysis on how cementing designs being the key to wellbore integrity and long-term zonal isolation will be affected when exposed to carbon dioxide (CO2). Extensive lab testing has been conducted comparing conventional API cement versus a CO2 resistant cement design that has been developed especially for wells with CO2 or CCS application for a period across one month. Both cementing designs were tested for mechanical properties, gas permeability, porosity, XRD and water analysis under non-CO2 exposure and CO2 exposure condition. Additional testing including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), computed tomography (CT) scans and phenolphthalein testing were also performed on both the designs under CO2 exposure condition. To simulate the aging or extended exposure time of carbonic acid attack, acetic acid which is a stronger acid was chosen as the main acid catalyst to conduct solubility testing. Through the month-long period, extensive data sets were gathered through a series of lab testing, providing insightful comparison of a conventional API cement and CO2 resistant cement design after being exposed to CO2. Both qualitative and quantitative data has provided interesting evidence that the conventional API cement goes through a more severe carbonation (i.e., CO2 attack) as compared to a CO2 resistant cement design. Analysis on each of the testing and observations done through the suite of test that was conducted shall be presented in greater detail within this paper. As the energy industry navigates the imperative of reducing carbon footprints, the novel information presented in this paper aims to guide practitioners and researchers towards more effective and innovative cementing solutions. Ultimately, the incorporation of CO2 resistant cement slurry design signifies a pivotal step in fortifying wellbore integrity for CCS application.

In order to achieve low cost, and reduce energy consumption during regeneration, a novel ionic liquid phase change absorbent composed of tetraethylenepentamine [TEPA] imidazole [Im] and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DGME) and water was designed for CO2 capture applications. The absorbent [TEPAH][Im]+DM+H2O can achieves a CO2 absorption capacity of 2.08 mol CO2/mol ILs, the rich phase volume accounts for 15.6 vol%, and the mass fraction of CO2 is 99 %, this greatly reduces the regenerative volume of the absorption system, showing the potential of energy saving and emission reduction. After five absorption–desorption cycles, the regeneration efficiency of the system remained above 96 %. The CO2 capture mechanism was analyzed using both 13C NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate its underlying processes. The cation [TEPAH]+ and the anion [Im]- each undergo a reaction with CO2 to produce carbamate, followed by hydrolysis of carbon dioxide to yield carbonate. The absorption system's phase transition behavior primarily arises from variations in CO2 product solubility across solvents. Moreover, the ionic liquid facilitated the conversion of CO2 into quinazoline-2,4 (1H, 3H)-dione with a remarkable yield of 98 %. Even after five cycles, the ILs maintained substantial catalytic activity.

With the excessive use of fossil fuels, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have risen dramatically in recent decades, leading to serious environmental and social issues linked to global climate change. The emergence of renewable energy sources, such as solar, tidal, and wind energy, has created favorable conditions for large-scale electricity production. Recently, significant attention has been drawn to utilizing renewable energy to catalyze the conversion of CO2 into fuels, producing substantial industrial feedstocks. In these CO2 conversion processes, the structure and performance of catalysts are critical. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, offering advantages such as high surface area, porosity, exceptional functionality, and high conversion efficiency. This article provides a comprehensive review of structural regulation strategies for copper-based MOFs, highlighting innovative mechanisms like synergistic bimetallic catalysis, targeted doping strategies, and the construction of heterostructures. These novel approaches distinguish this review from previous studies, offering new insights into the electrocatalytic performance of copper-based MOFs and proposing future research directions for improved catalyst design.

Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a promising way to convert methane and carbon dioxide into syngas, which can be further utilized to synthesize value-added chemicals. One of the main challenges for the DRM process is finding catalysts that are highly active and stable. This study explores the potential use of Ni-based catalysts modified by Ga. Different Ni-Ga/(Mg, Al)Ox catalysts, with various Ga/Ni molar ratios (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1), were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. The catalysts were tested for the DRM reaction to evaluate their activity and stability. The Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox and its Ga-modified Ni-Ga/(Mg, Al)Ox were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman techniques. The test of catalytic activity, at 700 °C, 1 atm, GHSV of 42,000 mL/h/g, and a CH4: CO2 ratio of 1, revealed that Ga incorporation effectively enhanced the catalyst stability. Particularly, the Ni-Ga/(Mg, Al)Ox catalyst with Ga/Ni ratio of 0.3 exhibited the best catalytic performance, with CH4 and CO2 conversions of 66% and 74%, respectively, and an H2/CO ratio of 0.92. Furthermore, the CH4 and CO2 conversions increased from 34% and 46%, respectively, when testing at 600 °C, to 94% and 96% when the catalytic activity was operated at 850 °C. The best catalyst’s 20 h stream performance demonstrated its great stability. DFT analysis revealed an alteration in the electronic properties of nickel upon Ga incorporation, the d-band center of the Ga modified catalyst (Ga/Ni ratio of 0.3) shifted closer to the Fermi level, and a charge transfer from Ga to Ni atoms was observed. This research provides valuable insights into the development of Ga-modified catalysts and emphasizes their potential for efficient conversion of greenhouse gases into syngas.

In the context of increasing concerns regarding the amplification of the thermal effects of climate change, the Council of the European Union has proposed the reduction (up to the elimination) of the use of fossil fuels. For this purpose, the implementation of new ecological (renewable) fuels is being analyzed to reduce the carbon dioxide footprint, natural gas being the transition fuel. Also, in the next period, an increase in the demand for methane, the exploitation of condensate deposits, those with natural gas mixed with acid gases (containing hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen), as well as oil deposits with associated natural gas, which will require their treatment (to eliminate saline or non-saline water, mechanical impurities, of condensate and acid gases). At the same time, the exploitation of offshore deposits in deep waters will be emphasized, which will lead to the location of treatment equipment on the seabed. The present work discusses the simulation of natural gas treatment processes, focusing on the separation from methane (in the supersonic field) of water, condensate, and acid gases.

In this research, a novel phase change material (PCM), containing dodecanoic acid-tetradecanoic acid-dodecanol ternary mixture, designated as pure mixture, dispersed with two carbon-based nanoparticles, i.e., graphene nanoplatelets - multiwall carbon nanotube and graphene nanoplatelets-titanium dioxide, with 1% weight fraction, is prepared and is designated as nanoparticle-enriched-phase change material. The chemical and thermal analysis of pure ternary mixture and nanoparticle-enriched-phase change material was conducted using X-ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscopy, Differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared, Thermo gravimetric analyser and Thermal conductivity analyser techniques. The pure mixture possess melting and freezing temperature of 15.6°C and 8.4°C with a melting-freezing latent heat (LH) of 131.5 J/g and 125.4 J/g, respectively. The thermal conductivity exhibited a significant increase of 187.6% in the case of pure mixture with graphene nanoplatelets- multiwall carbon nanotube and 41.7% for pure mixture with graphene nanoplatelets-titanium dioxide. Moreover, the PCM remained thermally stable in both cases, even with the incorporation of nanoparticles. The melting as well as freezing LHs were reduced by about 18.17% and 18.02% for graphene nanoplatelets- multiwall carbon nanotube dispersed PCM and, 12.49% and 9.49% for graphene nanoplatelets- titanium dioxide dispersed PCM, respectively, in comparison with the pure mixture. Similarly, the melting/freezing temperatures, gets also reduced by 9.6%/8.3% and 10.9%/8.3%, respectively, for both mixtures. The pure mixture with graphene nanoplatelets- multiwall carbon nanotube exhibited a substantial decrease in both charging and discharging times, with reductions of 28.48% and 18.73%, respectively, in comparison to pure mixture, at an air inlet velocity of 3 m/s.

The attainment of "carbon peaking" and "carbon neutrality" is of utmost significance for the optimal progress of China's economy. As the main channel for green finance, the carbon reduction effectiveness of green credit policy is worth discussing. This article constructs an analytical framework for green credit, carbon emissions and technological advancement. Based on panel data from 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2012 to 2021, this article uses the mediation effect model and the Spatial Durbin Model to investigate the transmission mechanism and spatial spillover effect of green credit policies on carbon emissions. According to baseline regression model results, our study revealed that overall, carbon emissions were reduced by green credit. The spatial spillover effect of green credit on carbon emissions points to the interconnectedness of different regions in terms of environmental impact. The significant negative indirect effect indicates that the increase of local green credit also has a significant inhibitory effect on surrounding carbon dioxide emissions. It suggests that efforts to reduce carbon emissions in one area can have positive consequences for neighboring regions as well. Green credit is able to reduce carbon emissions indirectly via technological advancement, according to the mechanism testing mediation effect model. This paper presents policy recommendations for relevant departments.

This study dedicated to a novel method for synthesizing silicon-carbon (Si/C) and silicon dioxide-carbon (SiO2/C) nanocomposite anodes for lithium-ion batteries, utilizing industrial copper slags from the Almalyk Mining and Metallurgical Complex as a cost-effective source of SiO2. The synthesized nanocomposites address key challenges in lithium-ion battery anodes, including the volumetric expansion of silicon and its low conductivity, by leveraging the high lithiation capacity of silicon combined with the structural stability and conductivity of carbon. Amorphous SiO3 was extracted from copper slags via ammonium fluoride (NH4F) treatment and subsequently reduced to metallurgical-grade silicon through carbothermal reduction. The resulting SiO2/C and Si/C composites were thoroughly characterized using SEM, XRD, and electrochemical analyses, demonstrating improved electrochemical performance, favorable particle size distribution, and stability. This approach not only reduces material costs but also promotes environmental sustainability by repurposing industrial waste, offering promising candidates for high-performance lithium-ion battery anodes.

Abstract The electrochemical synthesis for value‐added chemicals and fuels via carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) offers an effective route to close the anthropogenic carbon cycle and store renewable energy. Currently, the copper‐based catalyst is still the only choice for generating various CO 2 RR species beyond two electron products. However, the wide range of CO 2 RR products generated on copper leads to low selectivity, and their low concentrations in electrolytes pose great costs in the downstream purification process and significantly challenge the scalability of this technology. To make this technology economically viable, enhancing product selectivity is crucial. In this review, we identify the primary CO 2 RR species and discuss the latest insights into the reaction mechanisms controlling CO 2 RR selectivity. Then, we examined factors that affect CO 2 RR selectivity. Emphasizing these factors in catalyst design, we highlight the importance of advanced technologies to expand our knowledge and prospects for the future of the CO 2 RR.

Abstract Formic acid (FA) has emerged as a promising candidate for hydrogen energy storage due to its favorable properties such as low toxicity, low flammability, and high volumetric hydrogen storage capacity under ambient conditions. Recent analyses have suggested that FA produced by electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) using low‐carbon electricity exhibits lower fugitive hydrogen (H 2 ) emissions and global warming potential (GWP) during the H 2 carrier production, storage and transportation processes compared to those of other alternatives like methanol, methylcyclohexane, and ammonia. eCO 2 RR to FA can enable industrially relevant current densities without the need for high pressures, high temperatures, or auxiliary hydrogen sources. However, the widespread implementation of eCO 2 RR to FA is hindered by the requirement for highly stable and selective catalysts. Herein, the aim is to explore and evaluate the potential of catalyst engineering in designing stable and selective nanostructured catalysts that can facilitate economically viable production of FA.

This study presents a dynamic multi-factor correlation analysis method designed to predict provincial carbon dioxide emissions (CDE) within China’s Bohai Rim region, including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning. By employing the sliding window technique, dynamic correlation curves are computed between various influencing factors and CDE at different time intervals, thereby facilitating the identification of key feature attributes. A novel metric, the Consistency Index of Influencing Factors (CIIF), is introduced to evaluate the consistency of these factors across regions. Furthermore, the Accurate Predictive Capability Indicator (APCI) is defined to measure the impact of different feature categories on the prediction accuracy. The findings reveal that models relying on a single influencing factor exhibit limited accuracy, whereas combining multiple factors with diverse correlation features significantly improves the prediction accuracy. This study introduces a refined analytical framework and a comprehensive indicator system for CDE prediction. It enhances the understanding of the complex factors that influence CDE and provides a scientific rationale for implementing effective emission reduction strategies.

Capturing the correct dynamics at the Coarse-Grained (CG) scale remains a central challenge in the advancement of systematic CG models for soft matter simulations. The Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE), rooted in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, provides a robust framework for incorporating friction and stochastic forces into CG models, that are lost due to the reduction in degrees of freedom. Leveraging recent advancements in Automatic Differentiation (AD) and reformulating the non-Markovian GLE using a colored noise ansatz, we present a top-down approach for accurately parameterizing the non-Markovian GLE for different coarse-grained fluids that accurately reproduces the velocity-autocorrelation function of the original All-Atom (AA) model. We demonstrate our approach on two different fluids namely, SPC/E water and carbon dioxide which have distinct structure and dynamical characteristics. Importantly, by being end-to-end differentiable, this approach offers a simplified and efficient solution to achieving accurate CG dynamics, effectively bypassing the complexities inherent in most bottom-up methods.

Stabilizing specific intermediates to produce CH4 remains a main challenge in solar‐driven CO2 reduction. Herein, g‐C3N4 is modified with saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x = 12, 11, 9) to tailor the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 in high selectivity. Increased lacuna of phosphotungstates leads to higher CH4 yield and selectivity, with a superior CH4 selectivity of 80% and 40.8 μmol·g‐1·h‐1 evolution rate for PW9/g‐C3N4. Conversely, g‐C3N4 and PWx alone show negligible CH4 production. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 follows a tandem catalytic process. CO2 is initially activated on g‐C3N4 to form *CO intermediates, meanwhile photogenerated electrons derived from g‐C3N4 transfer to PWx. Then the reduced PWx captures *CO, which is subsquently hydrogenated to CH4. With the injection of two photogenerated electrons, PW9 is capable of adsorbing and activating *CO. However, the reduced PW12 and PW11 are incapable of adsorbing *CO due to the small energy of occupied molecular orbitals, which is the reason for the poorer activity of PWx/g‐C3N4 (x = 12, 11) compared with that of PW9/g‐C3N4. This work provides new insights to regulate highly selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 by utilizing lacuna of polyoxometalates to enhance the interaction of metals in polyoxometalates with key intermediates.

Abstract PETRONAS encounters an imperative strategy in rising gas demand which requires the development of gas fields with high CO2 content. However, this strategy poses a significant challenge, given that the ensuing CO2 emissions are anticipated to surpass the designated reduction limits crucial for attaining net zero carbon emissions by 2050. To uphold sustainable development, the emphasis now turns to the pivotal necessity of decarbonisation through the sequestration of CO2, whether within depleted gas reservoirs or saline aquifers. This study explores the feasibility of implementing in-situ CO2 recycling for sequestration as a fit for purpose developmental strategy for a Malaysian gas field characterised by an initial CO2 content of ~60 per cent. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing key field parameters, the study aims to optimise cumulative gas production while effectively managing CO2 storage. A robust compositional dynamic model is constructed, incorporating specialised CO2 storage features. The model facilitates the recycling of produced CO2 between gas producers and CO2 injectors, while the introduction of CO2 tracers for each well enables the differentiation of CO2 sources, enhancing shutdown strategies and parameter optimisation. The principal objective of this investigation is to assess the viability of simultaneous gas production and CO2 injection within the same geological formation during the field's developmental stages. The study's findings obtain a baseline scenario yielding an ultimate recovery factor of approximately 73 per cent from an initial gas in-place of ~3.40 TSCF, in the absence of CO2 injection. Notably, the focus on sequestration modelling introduces critical constraints related to CO2 mole fraction in the production well stream and the separation efficiency of surface facilities. Against this backdrop, the feasibility of recycling produced CO2 emerges as a technologically and economically viable option for gas field development. By optimising the integration of net hydrocarbon production and CO2 storage capacity, a scenario is identified that achieves 100 per cent CO2 separation efficiency and an 80 per cent mole fraction cutoff. This optimised approach results in a net effective storage capacity of 1.3 TSCF and a gas reserve potential of 2.1 TSCF, representing a reduction of approximately 14 per cent compared to the baseline scenario. Additionally, net hydrocarbon production is estimated at 0.9 TSCF, underscoring the impact of in-situ CO2 injection on overall production. This study introduces an innovative development that aligns high CO2 gas field production with ambitious net zero carbon emission targets. By seamlessly integrating CO2 sequestration, the approach not only mitigates emissions but also prevents the need for transporting CO2 to flaring streams. Furthermore, the study proposes for a well-coordinated Field and Storage Development Plan (FSDP), which enhances the asset values through snergistic developments by unlocking of additional gas reserves and supported by CO2 management practices.

Prolonged electroencephalographic depression during surgery is associated with poor outcomes for patients. However, the published literature on electroencephalographic depression caused by a sudden increase in the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) is lacking. We report four patients who were scheduled for laparoscopic liver surgery under general anesthesia. During the process of EEG monitoring with Sedline, four patients experienced electroencephalographic depression closely after a sudden increase in PETCO2. The four patients showed that electroencephalographic depression mainly manifested as a slow in EEG frequency, a reduction in the amplitude and power of EEG, and a decrease in spectral edge frequency. Patient state index was elevated in three cases. To summarize, our patients showed EEG depression when PETCO2 suddenly increased, which suggests that clinical doctors should be alert to electroencephalographic depression when the PETCO2 abruptly increases. EEG monitoring devices should be applied in patients with possible hypercapnia. Anesthesiologists must comprehensively interpret the raw EEG, spectral edge frequency, and density spectral array data, in addition to patient sedation index values.

Spain has been the largest pork producer in the EU in recent years, leading to significant pig slurry (PS) production that requires proper management to prevent environmental impacts. The objectives of this study were to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia emissions and to characterize the PS in storage pond systems. A straw cover pond (SP) and addition of effective microorganisms (EMs) in a biological pond (BP) were used to treat the slurries. During two periods (autumn and spring), PS was characterized and GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O) and NH3 emissions were measured with a dynamic chamber. After 5 weeks of storage, BP achieved a reduction of 96% for CO2, 98% for CH4 and 59% for NH3 compared to the control pond (CP) in spring, while SP presented a 74% reduction for CO2 in autumn, and 60% and 97% reductions for CH4 and NH3, respectively, in spring. Additionally, the PS samples showed a decreasing trend for EC, dry matter, COD, BOD5, total N, NH4+-N, Org.-N, NO3−-N, and PO43− during both seasons. This preliminary study shows promise in reducing GHG/NH3 emissions and improving PS properties, but further replication is recommended. Varying straw cover thickness, optimizing EM dose, and a pH reduction may enhance outcomes.

Stabilizing specific intermediates to produce CH4 remains a main challenge in solar‐driven CO2 reduction. Herein, g‐C3N4 is modified with saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x = 12, 11, 9) to tailor the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 in high selectivity. Increased lacuna of phosphotungstates leads to higher CH4 yield and selectivity, with a superior CH4 selectivity of 80% and 40.8 μmol·g‐1·h‐1 evolution rate for PW9/g‐C3N4. Conversely, g‐C3N4 and PWx alone show negligible CH4 production. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 follows a tandem catalytic process. CO2 is initially activated on g‐C3N4 to form *CO intermediates, meanwhile photogenerated electrons derived from g‐C3N4 transfer to PWx. Then the reduced PWx captures *CO, which is subsquently hydrogenated to CH4. With the injection of two photogenerated electrons, PW9 is capable of adsorbing and activating *CO. However, the reduced PW12 and PW11 are incapable of adsorbing *CO due to the small energy of occupied molecular orbitals, which is the reason for the poorer activity of PWx/g‐C3N4 (x = 12, 11) compared with that of PW9/g‐C3N4. This work provides new insights to regulate highly selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 by utilizing lacuna of polyoxometalates to enhance the interaction of metals in polyoxometalates with key intermediates.

ABSTRACT Ethanol is a promising product for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), as ethanol as a value‐added product can help to enable the near‐term feasibility of this technique, thus Power‐to‐ethanol can act as a pioneering process for the CO 2 RR. Furthermore, CO 2 RR offers a green production process for ethanol in addition to biomass fermentation. However, the formation of ethanol via electrolysis often competes with ethylene production, which makes the selective formation of ethanol more difficult. We show that this problem can be circumvented by using a bimetallic catalyst that provides abundant *CO and thus activates an alternative and selective reaction path for ethanol. However, this study was carried out in an aqueous‐fed H‐type electrolyzer, which has mass transport limitations and thus insufficient current densities. To solve this issue, the studied catalyst is transferred to a gas diffusion electrode. Here we emphasize that, in addition to other relevant parameters, the choice of the binder also can have a high impact on the performance of the electrode. As an outlook, various enhanced reactor designs and their influence on ethanol formation are presented.

Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), whose atmospheric volume has been increasing, is the principal greenhouse gas (GHG) that causes global warming and climate change. Climate change from increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) has broad health and environmental influences. Human-emitted GHGs constitute a significant cause of global warming. The main objective of this article is to assess the influence of technological innovation, economic growth, fossil energy use, renewable energy consumption, and globalisation on CO 2 emissions (CO 2 Es) in South Africa over the observation period 1990–2020. The Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) estimator was implemented to examine the relationship between the constituents. The study results indicate that economic growth, fossil energy use, technological innovation, and globalisation boost CO 2 Es, whereas renewable energy consumption reduces CO 2 Es. The output of the canonical cointegrating regression and fully modified least squares estimators also supports the output of the DOLS estimator. We concluded that, in South Africa, a rise in economic growth, fossil energy use, technological innovation, and globalisation results in an upsurge in CO 2 Es. In contrast, an increase in renewable energy consumption leads to a reduction in CO 2 Es. This research work contributes to the discourse on CO 2 Es in the South African context. The study recommends that policymakers in South Africa should design policies that foster the formation of a low-carbon country, the consumption of renewable energy, and the implementation of environment-friendly technological innovations that reduce the use of fossil energy.

China’s coal-based energy structure and its large proportion of the manufacturing industry have resulted in China having the highest CO2 emissions in the world, accounting for about one-third of the world’s total emissions. Achieving the carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, while maintaining economic development, presents a significant challenge. Industrial parks, as core units of industrial clusters, are major sites for energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Thus, industry parks with great carbon reduction potential are crucial for China’s carbon reduction efforts. This review systematically examines the current state of the carbon emissions of industrial parks in China and analyzes the situation and challenges faced in the low-carbon transition of these parks. Then, the major pathways, technologies, and key policies for the low-carbon transition are summarized based on the current situation. This paper assists in the low-carbon development of industrial parks and promotes the proposal and implementation of carbon emission reduction strategies.

Tea sector is a major contributor to Kenya’s economy through foreign exchange via export. However, extensive amount of energy is required to produce one kilogram of tea, making tea processing energy-intensive. Comparing greenhouse gas emissions from different types of energy consumed in tea factories is imperative to enable policymakers make informed intervention in emission reduction. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tea factories is one of the pathways to meeting Kenya’s nationally determined 32% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 and commitment to the Paris Agreement. This paper assesses greenhouse gas emissions from different sources of energy used in four tea factories in Kenya. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission factor is used to calculate the total emissions of each type of energy used for 5 years. Life cycle assessment using SimaPro 8 software, Eco-indicator 99 method and Eco invent database was used to assess the specific compound causing the emission. The findings reveal that the 5-year greenhouse gas emissions by biogas, solar, wood, briquettes, and electricity are 336.111, 7.108, 3057.729, and 1,338.28 kg CO 2 /MWh, respectively. Firewood has the highest concentration of carbon dioxide, while solar energy has the least. Analysis of variance confirms significant difference (0.05>p = 0.0272) in greenhouse gas emissions from the different energy sources. Post-hoc analyses shows a significant difference in emissions between solar and firewood (p<0.0125) and no significant difference between other sources of energy. The key environmental hotspot is the energy intensive processes such as drying involved in tea production and processing, which leads to consumption of fossil fuel in the factories. To reduce such key hotspot, switching to renewable energy sources is key. Sustainability in the tea sector can therefore be achieved through switching to macadamia briquettes as a source of thermal energy and a combination of electricity and solar for electrical energy.

In heavy oil thermal recovery processes, higher pressure usually leads to low dryness and expansion difficulty for the injected steam in thermal recovery processes, which will result in lower oil recovery and more carbon emissions. This paper proposed a new CO2-inducing method to accelerate the steam chamber expansion, based on a core flooding experiment and numerical simulation. First, the CO2 showed significant viscosity reduction at high pressure in the PVT test. In the core flooding experiment, the CO2 provided strong flow conductivity in porous media for the thermal flooding, as the CO2 pre-injection restrained the steam condensation. Using the CO2-inducing method, CO2 pre-injection before steam built a fast flow channel in a relatively higher permeability layer and reduced the thermal injection pressure by about 1.0~2.4 MPa. As a result, the steam overlap around the injection wells became slower and the gravity drainage process was able to heat and displace the heavy oil above the channel. Furthermore, the CO2 gas trapped at the top reduced heat loss by about 12.4%. The field numerical simulation showed that this new method improved thermal recovery by 7.5% and reduced CO2 emissions by about 18 million kg/unit for the whole process. This method changes the conventional thermal expansion direction by CO2 inducing effect and fundamentally reduces heat loss, which provides significant advantages in low-carbon EOR.

Abstract Despite repeated calls to reduce CO2 emissions, asset managers continue to invest heavily in carbon-intensive assets, creating hidden carbon bombs within their equity portfolios. Timely tracking of portfolio carbon footprints is essential as a dynamic tool for monitoring companies' efforts to reduce carbon reduction. However, the availability and quality of firm-level CO2 emissions data present significant challenges in measuring financed emissions. As a result, potential climate-related risks for asset managers are likely to be severely underestimated. This study analyses CO2 emissions embodied in the equity portfolios of 105 Chinese asset managers from 2010 to 2020. Results show that over 50% of financed emissions comes from carbon-intensive assets, primarily emitted by individual high-emitting companies. Positively, some managers have reallocated capital towards High-tech Industries and Advanced Services during the period, and achieved over 50% reduction in carbon intensity. Comparison between asset managers' commitments versus actual mitigation actions shows that five out of six leading asset managers in China have failed to take their mitigation actions, despite their commitment to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI). Our qualitative analysis provide scientific evidence for China's asset managers in measuring companies’ portfolio carbon footprints and supporting their decarbonization pathways.

Abstract Steels have a proven track record of safe operation in steam power plants for decades. Interest in developing supercritical CO2 power cycles as a more efficient and sustainable alternative to steam cycles has driven a need to understand steel performance in these new environments. In particular, the potential of the high temperature CO2 environment to influence the creep behavior of the steel must be determined. Prior research on this topic between the 1960s and 1980s found conflicting conclusions, but nevertheless raised the possibility that carburization during CO2 exposure may strongly affect the creep behavior. This raises concerns particularly for thin-sectioned components such as compact heat exchangers, where even small rates of carburization can become problematic over long operating lifetimes. To shed light on this issue, this research investigates the creep behavior of austenitic stainless steel 347H and 309H (a higher Cr alternative) at 650°C. Specimens of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm thickness were tested to further assess the effect of steel thickness. Both steels show a reduction in creep life in CO2 relative to air, with 309H showing slightly better performance than 374H. Analysis is ongoing to determine the reason for degraded creep properties.

Nowadays, emissions from internal combustion engines are a relevant topic of investigation, taking into account the continuous reduction of emission limits imposed by environmental regulatory agencies around the world, obviously as the result of earnest studies that have pointed out the impact on the human health of high levels of contaminants released into the environment. Over recent years, the use of biofuels has contributed to attenuating this environmental issue; however, new problems have been raised, such as NOx emissions tend to increase as the biofuel percentage in the fuel used in engines increases. In this research, the emissions of a compression ignition internal combustion engine modeled as a variable volume reactor with homogeneous combustion were numerically investigated. To analyze the combustion process, a detailed kinetics model tailored specifically for this purpose was used. The kinetics model comprised 30,975 chemical reactions involving 691 chemical species. Mixtures of fuel surrogates were then created to represent the fuel used in the Brazilian fuel marketplace, involving (i) fossil diesel—“diesel A”, (ii) soybean diesel—“biodiesel”, and (iii) hydrotreated vegetable oil— “HVO”. Surrogate species were then selected for each of the aforementioned fuels, and blends of those surrogates were then proposed as mixture M1 (diesel A:biodiesel:HVO—90:10:0), mixture M2 (diesel A:biodiesel:HVO—85:15:0), and mixture M3 (diesel A:biodiesel:HVO—80:15:5). The species allowed in the kinetics model included all the fuel surrogates used in this research as well as the target emission species of this study: total hydrocarbons, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, soot, and soot precursors. When compared to experimental trends of emissions available in the literature, it was observed that, for all the proposed fuel surrogates blends, the numerical approach performed in this research was able to capture qualitative trends for engine power and the target emissions in the whole ranges of engine speeds and engine loads, despite the CO and NOx emissions at specific engine speeds and loads.

Abstract The strategic imperative of PETRONAS in addressing the escalating gas demand in Malaysia necessitates the development of gas fields characterised by high CO2 content. However, this strategy poses a formidable challenge, as the resulting CO2 emissions are poised to exceed targeted reduction limits necessary for achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. To ensure sustainable development, the focus shifts to the critical imperative of decarbonisation through CO2 sequestration, either within depleted gas reservoirs or saline aquifers. This paper systematically examines the feasibility of utilising depleted gas reservoirs as CO2 sequestration sites, primarily investigating the anticipated relationship between the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) and storage capacity under various aquifer strength drive mechanisms through simulation modelling for well and field levels. Accordingly, a robust compositional simulation model is formulated, incorporating specialised CO2 storage features to assess the viability of CO2 injection within the same geological formation post the field's developmental stages. An uncertainty study is conducted to evaluate EUR and potential CO2 injection as pivotal factors in any development plan and CO2 handling management. The study findings reveal a discernible correlation between the EUR/Storage ratio and Aquifer Strength Index (ASI) offering a valuable tool for accurately estimating the storage capacity of depleted gas reservoirs. Simulation results underscore the critical importance of understanding aquifer performance and strength during the production field life of a depleted gas reservoir for effective planning of CO2 storage projects. The paper further suggests enhancing the conventional volumetric storage calculation approach by incorporating a multiplier (E-factor) to account for the impact of aquifer strength and improve storage capacity estimation during the early stages of development planning. Machine learning models including Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression shows a prediction of 90 per cent accuracy for the E-factor using different water-gas ratio (WGR) and ASI numbers. Simulation outcomes indicate that this E-factor, ranging from 0.3 to 1.3 is contingent upon reservoir aquifer strength, with higher aquifer strength resulting in a smaller E-factor and vice versa. Neglecting or underestimating this factor during early planning stages may lead to inaccurate anticipation of CO2 storage potential, escalating the risk of development and potentially resulting in unsuccessful project implementation with substantial economic consequences. This study introduces an innovative approach considers uncertainties associated with aquifer strength and its consequential impact on CO2 injection plans. Notably, the findings of our research illuminate a compelling correlation between the EUR/Storage ratio and aquifer strength, providing a valuable tool for precise estimation of storage capacity in depleted gas reservoirs. This strategic approach is fortified by meticulous CO2 management practices, ensuring the successful implementation of projects, and mitigating economic risks.

Abstract. In order to reduce aviation's CO2 emissions and comply with current climate targets, the European Union plans a mandatory quota of 2 % sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, rising up to ≥70 % SAF by 2050. In addition to a reduction of life cycle CO2 emissions, the use of SAF can also have a positive impact on particle emissions and contrail properties. In this study we present observations from the ECLIF3 (Emission and CLimate Impact of alternative Fuels) aircraft campaign, which investigated exhaust and contrail characteristics of an Airbus A350-941 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines. For the first time, non-volatile and total particle emissions of 100 % HEFA-SPK (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids–synthetic paraffinic kerosene) SAF, a blended fuel and a reference Jet A-1 fuel were measured in flight. A maximum reduction in non-volatile particle number emissions of ∼41 % compared to the reference Jet A-1 fuel was measured at low cruise engine power settings when using 100 % HEFA-SPK. The reduction decreases to ∼29 % for typical cruise engine settings and to ∼22 % at high cruise engine power settings. The size of non-volatile particles was slightly smaller for HEFA-SPK compared to Jet A-1. We show a comprehensive analysis of the hydrogen content of globally available fuels. Our results demonstrate the impact of the fuel composition in terms of its aromatic, hydrogen, and sulfur content as well as of the effect of engine power settings on particle emissions. We demonstrate that the use of HEFA-SPK can significantly reduce particle emissions and thus contrail ice particles and therefore can provide an aviation climate benefit.

Abstract The determination of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDTs) is important for the development of traffic emission reduction strategies. This study quantified the CO2 emissions from 5,996 HDTs on different road types using a bottom-up approach combined with the application of the International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) model based on 1.24 million trajectory points. A correlation analysis was conducted on the hourly traffic flow, driving mileage, speed, and CO2 emissions of HDTs in the urban area of Kunming, China. The traditional emission intensity allocation method was improved by establishing a high-resolution (1 × 1 km) emission inventory using trajectory points and the road network density. The results indicated that higher driving speeds can reduce CO2 emissions, but HDTs typically maintain speeds of 40–60 km/h, with emission coefficients around 500 kg/km; HDTs complying with China III standards are significant contributors to CO2 emissions; Regional CO2 emissions from HDTs are highly influenced by traffic flow and driving distances; Vehicle restriction policies contribute to increased nighttime emissions; A pollution spatial allocation method based on trajectory point density and road network density better reflects the regional spatial distribution of CO2 emissions from HDTs; CO2 spatial distribution is predominantly concentrated in the southeast of urban areas, primarily influenced by urban industrial layout.

This study examines the intricate relationship between economic growth and European environmental degradation via the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). Our results contest the traditional inverted U-shape model of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, indicating that the theory may not be consistently applicable across European countries. Utilizing CS-ARDL and MMQR modelling, we reveal substantial regional disparities. Western European nations demonstrate a typical Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) pattern in the short term, characterized by an initial increase in emissions alongside GDP development, followed by a subsequent fall. Conversely, Eastern and Balkan nations exhibit a U-shaped connection, described by an early decline in emissions followed by a subsequent increase as their development levels increase. The influence of renewable energy differs, as it decreases emissions in the short term in Western Europe. However, its long-term impacts are variable, especially when contrasted with its more pronounced effect on emissions in Eastern and Balkan countries. Furthermore, trade openness intensifies environmental degradation in the short-term across all regions, although its long-term impact diminishes, particularly concerning greenhouse gases (GHG). The relationship between renewable energy and trade openness is substantial for the short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, but this effect declines with time. The results indicate that a uniform environmental policy throughout Europe may lack efficacy. Customized strategies to expedite the transition in Western Europe and more specific interventions in Eastern Europe are essential to harmonize economic progress with environmental sustainability. Future research should examine the determinants of the diminishing long-term effects of renewable energy and the interplay between trade and environmental policies.

Managing asbestos waste presents a significant challenge due to the widespread industrial use of this material, and the serious health and environmental risks it poses. Despite its unique properties, such as resistance to high temperatures and substantial mechanical strength, asbestos is a material with well-documented toxicity and carcinogenicity. Ensuring the safe removal and disposal of asbestos-containing materials (ACM) is crucial for protecting public health, the environment, and for reducing CO2 emissions resulting from inefficient waste disposal methods. Traditional landfill disposal methods have proven inadequate, while modern approaches—including thermal, chemical, biotechnological, and mechanochemical methods—offer potential benefits but also come with limitations. In particular, thermal techniques that allow for asbestos degradation can significantly reduce environmental impact, while also providing the opportunity to repurpose disposal products into materials useful for cement production. Cement, a key component of concrete, can serve as a sustainable alternative, minimizing CO2 emissions and reducing the need for primary raw materials. This work provides insights into research on asbestos waste management, offering a deeper understanding of key initiatives related to asbestos removal. It presents a comprehensive review of best practices, innovative technologies, and safe asbestos management strategies, with particular emphasis on their impact on sustainable development and CO2 emission reduction. Additionally, it discusses public health hazards related to exposure to asbestos fibers, and worker protection during the asbestos disposal process. As highlighted in the review, one promising method is the currently available thermal degradation of asbestos. This method offers real opportunities for repurposing asbestos disposal products for cement production; thereby reducing CO2 emissions, minimizing waste, and supporting sustainable construction.

Abstract. Monitoring, reporting, and verification frameworks for greenhouse gas emissions are being developed by countries across the world to keep track of progress towards national emission reduction targets. Data assimilation plays an important role in monitoring frameworks, combining different sources of information to achieve the best possible estimate of fossil fuel emissions and, as a consequence, better estimates for fluxes from the natural biosphere. Robust estimates for fossil fuel emissions rely on accurate estimates of uncertainties corresponding to different pieces of information. We describe prior uncertainties in CO2 and CO fossil fuel fluxes, paying special attention to spatial error correlations and the covariance structure between CO2 and CO. This represents the first time that prior uncertainties in CO2 and the important co-emitted trace gas CO are defined consistently, with error correlations included, which allows us to make use of the synergy between the two trace gases to better constrain CO2 fossil fuel fluxes. CO:CO2 error correlations differ by sector, depending on the diversity of sub-processes occurring within a sector, and also show a large range of values between pixels within the same sector. For example, for other stationary combustion, pixel correlation values range from 0.1 to 1.0, whereas for road transport, the correlation is mostly larger than 0.6. We illustrate the added value of our definition of prior uncertainties using closed-loop numerical experiments over mainland Europe and the UK, which isolate the influence of using error correlations between CO2 and CO and the influence of prescribing more detailed information about prior emission uncertainties. For the experiments, synthetic in situ observations are used, allowing us to validate the results against a “truth”. The “true” emissions are made by perturbing the prior emissions (from an emission inventory) according to the prescribed prior uncertainties. We find that using our realistic definition of prior uncertainties helps our data assimilation system to differentiate more easily between CO2 fluxes from biogenic and fossil fuel sources. Using improved prior emission uncertainties, we find fewer geographic regions with significant deviations from the prior compared to when using default prior uncertainties (32 vs. 80 grid cells of 0.25°×0.3125°, with an absolute difference of more than 1 kg s−1 between the prior and posterior), but these deviations from the prior almost consistently move closer to the prescribed true values, with 92 % showing an improvement, in contrast to the default prior uncertainties, where 61 % show an improvement. We also find that using CO provides additional information on CO2 fossil fuel fluxes, but this is only the case if the CO:CO2 error covariance structure is defined realistically. Using the default prior uncertainties, the CO2 fossil fuel fluxes move farther away from the truth in many geographical regions (with 50 % showing an improvement compared to 94 % when advanced prior uncertainties are used). With the default uncertainties, the maximum deviation of fossil fuel CO2 from the prescribed truth is about 7 % in both the prior and posterior results. With the advanced uncertainties, this is reduced to 3 % in the posterior results.

As the world’s largest producer of construction waste, China’s recycling and related policies are of the biggest concern to the world. However, the effective disposal and reuse of this waste has become an important issue since currently China still has a very low recycling ratio compared to developed countries, and most of the waste concrete was only simply broken and used as low-grade recycled aggregates for subgrade cushion, cement stabilized crushed stone, and filler wall. In this paper, a concrete cycle model focusing on how to effectively recycle and utilize waste concrete is put forward to prepare high quality recycled concrete, especially through a series of technical means, such as effective separation, carbon sequestration, and reactivation. Producing high quality recycled concrete can not only replace traditional concrete but also effectively reduce the consumption and waste of raw materials. What’s more, the calculation results show a potential of significantly carbon sink; for every ton of recycled cement produced, the CO2 emission could be reduced by 0.35–0.77 tons compared to ordinary Portland cement, corresponding to a reduction of 47%–94%; and for every ton of recycled concrete produced, the CO2 emission could be reduced by 0.186 tons compared to normal concrete. A yearly CO2 sequestration of 1.4–3.08 gigatonnes could happen if the ordinary Portland cement could be replaced by the recycled cement around the world. Taking the currently accumulated construction and demolition (C&D) wastes globally, the production of recycled cement, recycled aggregates, and recycled concrete could induce a significant carbon sink in the world.

Purpose: This paper reviews ways that artificial intelligence could be used to make business aviation operations most fuel-efficient, cheapest in cost of operation, and smallest in terms of ecological footprint. The research elaborated possible ways of using AI in the spheres of flight planning, predictive maintenance, fuel management, emission tracking, and compliance in business aviation. Methodology: It was also empirical case-study-oriented research that investigated the impacts of AI-driven technologies on business aviation operators, basically NetJets, VistaJet, and Flexjet. The impacts are from route optimization to predictive maintenance, fuel management, and compliance with regulations. Information such as fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and operational efficiency was obtained before and after the adoption of AI technologies. Findings: The fuel savings from AI-driven systems are reaching a point of salience, at 9 to 14% in the various cases, with associated reductions in CO2 emissions. AI-powered predictive maintenance resulted in a 20% reduction in unscheduled events, thereby bettering the availability of fleets. Artificial intelligence increased overall efficiency and improved decisions for in-flight, real-time operations management while conforming to regulatory requirements in reporting. Additionally, AI is going to bring tremendous values in optimizing SAFs and aircraft energy-efficient technology to make flying sustainable. Unique Contribution to Theory, Policy, and Practice: This work contributes to AI in aviation by demonstrating its practical application in reducing environmental impacts and operational costs in business aviation. It provides a framework for integrating AI into aviation management systems and highlights the importance of public-private cooperation for wider AI adoption. The findings are valuable for policymakers, business aviation operators, and industry leaders aiming to advance sustainability and regulatory compliance

Control-data exergy-based Resource Efficiency (RE) analysis is applied to investigate resource use and efficiency improvements in the cement industry to understand what insights can be gained into the efficiency of clinker manufacturing and possible decarbonisation options when having full access to material and energy flows from the manufacturing plant control system. Mapping of the resources in and out of the clinker manufacturing section showed that total resource input is dominated by the flow of fuels, with the clinker burning section constituting the most energy and emissions-intensive part of the process. The plant is found to have an annual mean RE of 47.8% in compound operation, and 38.3% in direct operation. Three improvement options are identified: recycling of dust, reduction of heat transfer losses across the kiln, and optimisation of the plant’s continuous operation, with heat losses reduction having the largest improvement potential in terms of the overall plant RE and the reduction of CO2 emissions. Despite providing a detailed representation of the real-time operation capable of identifying potential improvement interventions, the use of control-data is found to be highly intensive and time-consuming. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate whether the same level of insights into the efficiency and potential for decarbonisation of clinker manufacturing could be gained using less data.

The article presents the concept of concrete durability based on the system of concrete resistance classes to ERC exposure included in the proposed standardization documents (EN 206-1 together with EN 206-100 and Eurocode 2). According to the ERC concept, the performance properties of concrete are tested using recognized test methods, and the results are assessed on the basis of criteria independent of the composition of the tested concrete. The ERC durability concept is open to new technical and standardization solutions in the field of concrete composition (new additives) and cement and should replace the generally applicable prescriptive solutions. This solution is important from the point of view of reducing the emissions of the cement industry (production of multi-component cements and the use of new non-clinker main ingredients) and reducing the carbon footprint of concrete (CO2 reduction classes of concrete according to prEN 206-1)

Abstract Hydrogen energy has been hailed as a versatile energy of the future that could aid the transition to net-zero emissions. It has large potential as an alternate fuel source for mobility and power, heating and feedstock for the industry. The energy carrier is produced from water electrolysis technology using different types of electrolyzer (i.e., Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) or Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs)) for hydrogen separation process. In this energy research journey, PETRONAS has jointly worked with SLB to evaluate the feasibility of using SOECs for green hydrogen production. The study's focus is to explore integrating SOECs into existing industrial facilities creating hybrid systems, specifically with available flue gas from combustion process e.g. power generation. This allows for the utilization of waste heat from existing processes to enhance overall energy efficiency in hydrogen production. To understand hydrogen production and its utilization in the existing facility, the full system including existing gas turbines, solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs), a hydrogen compression train, and a temperate cooling water system were modeled in a process simulation software. The model also included a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) to recover the energy from gas turbine exhaust gases to heat water feed to produce saturated steam which will be the feed to SOEC. Several configurations considering heat integrations were explored, including heat recovery from SOEC product stream. Various sensitivities were run for different configurations of the process to study hydrogen purity, hydrogen blending, overall power required, water required in the overall process, and power produced by the hydrogen generated from SOEC and CO2 emission values in all the configuration. The results were compared and evaluated to help assess how variation in parameters affect the performance or outcome. The results were evaluated for blending the produced hydrogen with the existing export gas before and after export gas compression and how it influences the hydrogen purity. Hydrogen blending with the fuel gas to the gas turbine also helped in overall reduction of CO2 emission. It was observed that additional cooling of the hydrogen stream to achieve better hydrogen purity did not significantly help in reducing CO2 emissions when hydrogen is used as fuel gas; therefore, cooling with temperate water system can be considered. All the cases were compared and evaluated for expanding the application of green hydrogen technologies in the facility considering viability and reduction in emissions. The study was a part of a collaborative research initiative by the industry players to accelerate the development and deployment of SOEC technologies in existing facilities. The results from the study provided an overall understanding of adding SOEC in the facility and valuable insights to the stakeholders to make well-informed choices on the configuration.

The rapid growth in the aviation sector has prompted the industry to act and develop new and sustainable business models due to the greenhouse gases and waste generated inherently by the sector. In this context, this study provides an assessment of identifiable areas and determinants of circular economy in an airline company, considering its environmental impacts. As a result of the assessment, it has been observed that the airline company conducts initiatives in reduction, reuse, and recycling, along with the management of cabin materials and waste segregation. Action plans are in place regarding the reduction, substitution, or elimination of single-use plastics in material selection. In order to mitigate both the environmental and economic impacts of paper consumption, the company is undertaking digitalization efforts within its business processes. The weight of aircraft is a crucial factor in the amount of fuel consumed and the quantity of CO2 emissions released. Therefore, airlines prefer to use lightweight materials inside the aircraft to reduce weight. Plastic catering materials are among these lightweight options. Unfortunately, due to the adverse environmental impacts of plastics, reducing their usage and, if possible, phasing them out are essential measures that airlines need to take. Consequently, the airline company under this study has removed the plastic outer packaging of the packaged materials used in the cabin. Furthermore, it continues its efforts to remove plastic materials used during catering services or replace them with biodegradable alternatives.

The production and consumption of protons by an electrocatalyst will, under certain conditions, generate localized microenvironments with properties distinct from those of the bulk solution. These local properties are particularly impactful for reactions involving proton-coupled electron transfer, where the generation of locally basic or acidic environments may significantly influence the energy efficiency and reaction selectivity of the electrocatalyst. Whereas local pH environments have been observed and characterized in reductive half-reactions, including the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, the incompatibility of conventional techniques and materials has limited studies in oxidative half-reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which provides the reducing equivalents for solar-to-fuels electrolysis. With the straightforward parameters bulk pH, buffer composition and pKa, and mass transport, we develop a model for describing local pH as a function of current density regardless of the microscopic details of the mechanism. Using an acid-stable PbOx OER catalyst, we observe the formation and dissipation of pH gradients during the OER and validate the model with voltammetric and potentiometric studies. The model predicts how local acidic environments can develop over a narrow OER current density window, thus providing further motivation for the development of OER catalysts that are stable to acid, even when operating in basic aqueous conditions. More generally, the model is not restricted to the OER and is useful for determining the onset of local pH gradients for other electrocatalytic reactions that involve the consumption or generation of protons in energy conversion reactions.

Copper (Cu)-based nanocatalysts play crucial roles in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) for sustainable energy resources. Particularly, Cu-based nanostructures incorporating Au and Ag are promising, offering enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. However, precise control over the structure and composition of heterostructures remains challenging, hindering the development of highly efficient catalysts. Herein, we present a silver (Ag) transition-layer-mediated approach to synthesize ternary heterostructures with two specific morphologies, namely, Au/Ag–Cu-side and Au/Ag–Cu-tip, which exhibit different Ag–Cu interface epitaxial patterns. The two heterostructures achieve high C2 product selectivity in ECO2RR. Especially, the Au/Ag–Cu-side structure achieves 50.3% C2 selectivity with 35.5% ethanol, while the tip structure shows higher ethylene selectivity. Our study reveals the impact of the Ag layer in directing deposition sites on heterostructure growth and further facilitating the design of multicomponent Cu-based catalysts with enhanced structural integrity and ECO2RR performance.

Representatives of the colorless sulfur bacteria of the genus Beggiatoa use reduced sulfur compounds in the processes of lithotrophic growth, which is accompanied by the storage of intracellular sulfur. However, it is still unknown how the transformation of intracellular sulfur occurs in Beggiatoa representatives. Annotation of the genome of Beggiatoa leptomitoformis D-402 did not identify any genes for the oxidation or reduction of elemental sulfur. By searching BLASTP, two putative persulfide dioxygenase (PDO) homologs were found in the genome of B. leptomitoformis. In some heterotrophic prokaryotes, PDO is involved in the oxidation of sulfane sulfur. According to HPLC-MS/MS, the revealed protein was reliably detected in a culture sample grown only in the presence of endogenous sulfur and CO2. The recombinant protein from B. leptomitoformis was active in the presence of glutathione persulfide. The crystal structure of recombinant PDO exhibited consistency with known structures of type I PDO. Thus, it was shown that B. leptomitoformis uses PDO to oxidize endogenous sulfur. Additionally, on the basis of HPLC-MS/MS, RT-qPCR, and the study of PDO reaction products, we predicted the interrelation of PDO and Sox-system function in the oxidation of endogenous sulfur in B. leptomitoformis and the connection of this process with energy metabolism.

There is a worldwide concern about the increase in vehicles’ exhaust emissions of traditional fuels and the rise in fuel prices. Nablus city is a major city in the West Bank, Palestine with peculiar topography and traffic congestion. This increases fuel consumption and the gas emission of the diesel operated public transport (PT) shared-taxi vehicles. This paper investigates the viability of introducing hybrid vehicles to the urban shared-taxis in highly congested areas with peculiar topography. Interviews were conducted and questionnaires were distributed among PT drivers and route managers to obtain the operational and cost characteristics of each route. The existing expenses and revenues and gas emissions of diesel vehicles were analyzed. Expenses-revenues analysis revealed that there is no immediate urgency in switching all diesel-fuel shared-taxis to hybrid; therefore, two scenarios were developed. The first was replacing old PT cars (2009 or older) with hybrid vehicles, which provided an average financial saving of 20.9% with a reduction in exhausts emission of CO2-equivalent by 33%. The second scenario included replacing PT vehicles with production dates from 2009-2014, which produced financial savings of 15% and reduction of exhaust emissions by 35%. The comparison showed a preference for the first scenario at the current time, while implementing other scenarios gradually. The first scenario is simple and close to reality; as old vehicles should typically be replaced. The study recommends using hybrid vehicles for new shared-taxis introduced to the service, and establishing national level policies to encourage the use of alternative fuels for the transportation sector, focusing on PT. However, several critical factors must be considered, including topography and route characteristics.

This study investigates the potential of potassium feldspar-phosphate-based geopolymer concrete as a sustainable replacement to traditional concrete, addressing the environmental concerns associated with CO2 emissions during cement production. While geopolymer concrete offers a promising path towards sustainability, its performance often falls short of Portland cement concrete. This study investigates the use of nanoalumina in improving the performance of geopolymer concrete. A ternary mix was formulated with potassium feldspar powder, metakaolin and rice husk ash, incorporating varying percentages of nanoalumina geopolymer concrete mixes. The mechanical characteristics of the resulting geopolymer composites were assessed through compressive and split tensile strength tests. The findings revealed that a 4% nanoalumina dosage (GC-N4) yielded the most significant improvement in strength and durability. The GC-N4 mix performed superior in all metrics, demonstrating the highest compressive (41.82 MPa) and split tensile (3.7 Mpa) strengths. Reduction in water absorption and durability aspects were also optimum in GC-N4. These results highlight the potential of incorporating nanoalumina into a ternary mix of potassium feldspar powder, metakaolin and rice husk ash to significantly enhance the overall performance of geopolymer concrete, promoting its wider adoption as a sustainable construction material.

ABSTRACT In the face of escalating global warming and intensified human activities, it is crucial to quantitatively assess the combined impacts of future climate change (CC) and land use change (LUCC) on runoff. This study employed simulation results of future CC and LUCC in the Min-Tuo River Basin, utilizing the CMIP6 and cellular automata (CA)-Markov models in conjunction with the SWAT model to project runoff changes under various scenarios. The findings indicate an anticipated increase in both precipitation and average temperature in the future. Projected LUCC involves a reduction in arable land and grassland, alongside expansion of other land cover types. Changes in basin runoff are predominantly influenced by precipitation, with a higher likelihood of extreme events as CO2 emissions increase. Across four emission scenarios, the impact of future CC on basin runoff varies from −5.21 to +6.09%, while future LUCC's contribution ranges from +0.05 to +0.07%. When both factors are considered, the overall trend indicates a decrease in future runoff changes, ranging from −0.27 to +0.17%. These findings underscore the greater influence of CC on runoff compared with LUCC, thereby providing a scientific foundation for ecological conservation and water resources management in the basin.

This systematic literature review has as its aim to discuss how the use of micro fulfilment centers can help logistics and supply chain professionals in alleviating the urban last mile logistics problem. This systematic literature review adapts the SALSA approach, the PRISMA 2009 checklist, and the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram, while its validity is based on the utilization of the qualitative CASP checklist. In addition to the above, certain inclusion/exclusion criteria were used. The findings of this review underline that micro fulfilment centers are a key new approach in terms of alleviating the last mile logistics problem, in urban areas where space is extremely limited via a reduction in CO2 emissions, the use of new technologies not only in operations but also in the delivery of goods and the increase in customer satisfaction. This is an original and breakthrough literature review as it covers a gap in the existing literature that has to do with the role of micro fulfilment centers in urban areas in terms of alleviating the last mile logistics problem, a topic about which not much have been written until now as it is quite novel. This literature review gives a clear path for the researcher of the future in terms of approaching the urban last mile logistics problem via the lens of the use of micro fulfilment centers, while it contributes to the urban logistics industry in several ways.

The adaption of the phylum Chloroflexota to various geochemical conditions is thought to have originated in primitive microbial ecosystems, involving hydrogenotrophic energy conservation under ferruginous anoxia. Oligotrophic deep waters displaying anoxic ferruginous conditions, such as those of Lake Towuti, and their sediments may thus constitute a preferential ecological niche for investigating metabolic versatility in modern Chloroflexota. Combining pore water geochemistry, cell counts, sulfate reduction rates, 16S rRNA genes with in-depth analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes, we show that Chloroflexota benefit from cross-feeding on metabolites derived from canonical respiration chains and fermentation. Detailing their genetic contents, we provide molecular evidence that Anaerolineae have metabolic potential to use unconventional electron acceptors, different cytochromes and multiple redox metalloproteins to cope with oxygen fluctuations, and thereby effectively colonizing the ferruginous sediment-water interface. In sediments, Dehalococcoidia evolved to be acetogens, scavenging fatty acids, haloacids and aromatic acids, apparently bypassing specific steps in carbon assimilation pathways to perform energy-conserving secondary fermentations combined with CO2 fixation via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our study highlights the partitioning of Chloroflexota populations according to alternative electron acceptors and donors available at the sediment-water interface and below. Chloroflexota would have developed analogous primeval features due to oxygen fluctuations in ancient ferruginous ecosystems.

Abstract Batch drilling is not a new concept to Oil and Gas Industry, however thorough studies and analysis were conducted to adopt Batch vs Standard drilling methodology in unconventional wells project. The application of batch drilling resulted in huge cost saving up to 30% of total well cost. Thus, enhancing the sustainability by reducing the Footprint Impact by re-using same mud in each section for the clusters and reducing the rig flat time. Unconventional Pad wells consists of 10 wells with 10m spacing in a single row,identical for unconventional reservoir.The wells were drilled in 3batches.This was achieved by spudding on well A and drilling and cementing the first section 16" Hole.The rig is then skid to well B to start drilling the first section again,meanwhile in well A is nipple down the Diverter,install wellhead section offline.This operation is repeated till well #10 in the last corner, optimizing the materials/services and applying the lessons learned from each section, improving the operations well by well. The wells were completed with 30% improvement of well performance. Applying Batch drilling technique in Unconventional Pad wells has had great savings up to 13% of cost and 7% of duration per well that will finally save the cost of 1 complete well from the 10 wells in the cluster, more savings were achieved by recycling same mud system for each section to be used for the next well requiring treatment only, additional many operations can be shifted offline as: - Pickup and makeup drill string and BHA - Nipple up diverter - Nipple wellhead sections/ Christmas tree - Run mutli-shot gyro survey - Rigless Cementing The Batch drilling aimed to optimize time and learning curve for the drilling team at site for the same section drilled.Several Simultaneous Operation (SIMOP) between drilling and Fraccing is decided from the very beginning.Utilization of triple catwalk helped improve performance in tripping by 50% and the rig setback area was sufficient to skid with pipes on the rack, thus eliminating the tripping time. This technique has also showed a huge impact by reducing CO2 emissions due to less resources required, compared with standard rig move. This concept was transferred to all the fields resulting in savings of 70MM$ across 10 batches. First time implemented in Onshore Abu Dhabi UNCONVENTIONAL wells, In terms of HSE, reduce crew exposure to high-risk operations such as pickup and laydown drill string, lifting heavy equipment during the moving and minimizing rig footprint impact owing to the reduction of CO2 emissions

Abstract To improve the economics of critical components, such as receivers and heat exchangers, for Generation 3 (Gen 3) concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, research was conducted to understand how manufacturing impacts the high-temperature performance of various tube production routes. Gen 3 CSP components are expected to require the use of heat-resistant nickel- based alloys due to the elevated operating temperatures in designs carrying molten salt or supercritical CO2. INCONEL alloy 740H (alloy 740H) was investigated as an alternative to UNS N06230 (alloy 230) as it possesses superior high-temperature creep strength which can lead to overall reductions in material cost. A key challenge is understanding how autogenous seam welding with and without re-drawing can be used to manufacture thin-wall tubing for CSP receivers and heat-exchangers to further reduce costs over traditional seamless production routes. Alloy 740H welded tube was successfully fabricated and re-drawn to several relevant tube sizes. Since traditional mechanical testing samples could not be removed from the thin-wall tubing, full-sized tubes were used for tensile, fatigue, and vessel testing (internally pressurized creep- rupture) which was critical to understanding the weld performance of the manufactured product forms. The generated vessel test data exhibited a creep strength reduction when compared to wrought product with no clear trend with temperature or test duration. It was found that redrawing the welded tubes improved the creep strength to approximately 82% of the wrought material performance and elevated temperature tensile and fatigue behavior exceeded 85% of the design minimums. Detailed, post-test characterization found that nano-sized carbides formed during the laser seam-welding process remained stable after multiple solution-annealing steps, which restricted grain growth, and impacted the time-dependent performance. This paper will focus on the time-dependent behavior of the examined welded and redrawn tubes, supporting metallographic evidence, and give perspective on future considerations for using alloy 740H in CSP components.

Abstract Anaerobic digestion is a common method for managing liquid manure and other biomasses, generating biogas as a renewable energy source. The resulting digestate can be processed into organic fertilizers to enhance nutrient recycling, but its environmental impact warrants investigation. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to examine the impact of fertilizers derived from cattle slurry and grass-clover co-digestion on global warming (measured in CO2 equivalent) compared to untreated cattle slurry. The different treatments analyzed include untreated cattle slurry, digestate, liquid fractions from digestate separation, and an enriched liquid nitrogen-sulfur product derived from post-processing of biogas and drying the solid fraction. The functional units of this study were 100 kg of total nitrogen in the final organic fertilizer (FU1) with the cradle-to-processing gate boundary and the harvesting 1 ton of spring barley dry matter (FU2) with the cradle-to-field application boundary. The carbon footprint ranged from 24 to 49% of the baseline scenario for FU1, and from -6 to 177% of the baseline scenario for FU2. The main contributors to the carbon footprint of fertilizers included greenhouse gas emissions from storage and field application. However, biogas production from anaerobic digestion, together with the concurrent mitigation of CH4 emissions during storage, contributed most to a reduction in the overall global warming potential associated with anaerobic digestate and its liquid fraction. This study showed large climate prospects in replacing untreated slurry as organic fertilizer with alternatives resulting from its anaerobic digestion and post-treatment.

This perspective focuses on the characterization of supported metal catalyst by operando and CO infrared (IR) spectroscopy. CO IR spectroscopy is a powerful technique to probe catalyst surfaces, and is used to identify single atom catalysts, estimate metal surface availability to the gas phase, and measure catalyst Lewis acidity. However, the interpretation of CO IR spectra on metal surfaces is not trivial, and influenced by dipole-dipole interactions among CO molecules at medium to high coverage. Such phenomenon results in spectral distortions, such as intensity transfer among IR bands, appearance of spurious bands, and shifts in band position. Dipole-dipole interactions have been widely investigated and understood in the 1950s–90s, but the implications for operando spectroscopy have been seemingly overlooked in literature, with a few exceptions. Inspired by seminal studies in the field, I propose here the use of mixed isotopic streams, such as diluted 13CO in 12CO, to reduce dipole coupling effects and retrieve more information from operando IR spectra in reactions involving CO, such as CO oxidation or hydrogenation reactions. Similarly, mixed 13CO2/12CO2 streams may be applied in CO2 hydrogenation, where adsorbed CO is commonly observed. The proposed name of the technique is Mixed Isotope Operando IR Spectroscopy, MIOIRS. In this perspective, I will first summarize the nature of dipole-dipole interactions in adsorbed CO layers, and their effects on CO IR spectra. Then, I will briefly describe how diluted isotopic mixtures of CO can partially break the coupling among adsorbates and reduce spectral distortion. In both sections, I will give a few showcases of the implications of vibrational coupling in heterogeneous catalysts characterization. Finally, I will discuss the possible implications of MIOIRS for the detection and quantification of defect and surface sites on metal nanoparticles, the characterization of bimetallic nanoparticles surfaces, and the kinetics of CO intermediates adsorbed on different active sites. Notably, MIOIRS may be expanded to other reactions in which adsorbates have strong permanent dipoles, such as in self-catalytic reduction for NOx abatement.

The increasing number of on-road automobiles as a result of an exponential increase in population and lifestyle places enormous strain on depleted fossil petroleum fuel, energy security, and environmental stability. This situation drives researchers to find an alternative source to replace petroleum diesel. Biodiesel is one of the promising viable substitutes. However, biodiesels may not always fulfill the EN 14214 standard due to differences in fuel properties. This could cause issues with engine operation and emissions. This study therefore aims to use novel nano-silica (SiO2) additives extracted from rice husk to improve its fuel properties. Also focuses on the influence of additives on the operation of the compression ignition (CI) engine. The Adansonia digitata methyl esters (ADME) were made by transesterification process, The physicochemical properties of the fuels with and without additives were measured as per ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards methods, and nano silica was analyzed by Thermogravimetry (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET), X-ray diffractometer (XRD. Barret-Joyner Halenda (BJH) pore diameter, specific surface area, and pore volume of SiO2 were observed to be 19.3 nm, 502.24 m2 /g, and 0.761 cm3 /g, respectively. At 400 and 800 ppm dose levels, the oxidation induction period (OIP) increased dramatically, peaking at 10.03 h. The stability of ADME has significantly improved, as evidenced by these results, meeting the >3 h and >8 h standard limits set by ASTM D6751 and EN 14214, respectively. The viscosity of B100 decreased with increasing additive content, from 4.62 mm2 /s for neat B100 to 2.21 mm2 /s for 400 ppm. Cetane number (CN) (60 to 64). All nano-fuel blends used in engine tests were prepared by an ultrasonication process. The results revealed that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) at maximum brake powers (BP) for B20, B20+SiO2, B100, and B100+SiO2 fuels were 29.9, 28.2, 28.44, and 27.1%, respectively, and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was reduced as the load increased. The peak heat release rate (HRR) of the B100+SiO2 and B20+SiO2 are slightly higher by 2.9 and 2.6%, respectively, than the neat B100 at medium BP. However, in-cylinder gas pressure (CGP) increased following the order of B20+SiO2<B20<B100<B100+ SiO2<B0. Moreover, the exhaust emissions of nano-fuel blends exhibited a greater reduction of CO, THC, CO2, NOX, and particulate matter (PM) compared to B20 and B100. Overall, this study recommends that SiO2 nano-additive is a good substitute fuel additive to use with biodiesel and its blends because of the improved properties of biodiesel, decreased emissions, and increased engine performance efficiency

Our understanding of cardiovascular haemodynamics and the factors that govern it is vital for appreciating the workings of a healthy physiological system, as well as elucidating the pathophysiology behind disease and identifying potential treatment options. A recent article in The Journal of Physiology by Watanabe et al. (2024) sought to contribute to this field by exploring the impact of passive hyperthermia on human circulation and the underlying central and peripheral mechanisms. It has traditionally been believed that blood circulation is driven by the pressure created by the heart (Furst & González-Alonso, 2023). In hyperthermia, cardiac output is increased, and the traditional perspective would suggest that this is mainly due to an increased heart rate, supplemented by central mechanisms such as increased left ventricular systolic function. However, studies have shown that an increased heart rate alone is not sufficient to increase cardiac output (Joyce & Wang, 2021). Also, central mechanisms exert their effects with increases in core temperature at rest, which would not explain the increase in cardiac output seen with peripheral hyperthermia that does not affect core temperature. Therefore, it appears that other factors are involved in increasing cardiac output in peripheral hyperthermia, potentially including increased blood velocity or increased systemic vascular conductance. The exact mechanisms and their relationship to central forces are not well elucidated, and this is what Watanabe et al. (2024) set out to understand. The main aim set by Watanabe et al. (2024) was to explore how single-leg, two-leg, and whole-body hyperthermia affect peripheral and systemic circulation, as well as the metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses. They also aimed to investigate the factors affecting central haemodynamic changes in hyperthermia. Their hypothesis was that passive hyperthermia increases cardiac output, not due to central mechanisms like left ventricular contractility, but rather due to peripheral haemodynamic changes. The researchers enrolled eight young healthy males, and each participant was randomly assigned four counterbalanced protocols. These were 3 h of no heating as a control, 3 h of single-leg heating, 3 h of two-leg heating and 2.5 h of whole-body heating. The latter is shorter due to participant discomfort leading to early termination. The heating was provided using a water-perfused garment, and extensive measurements were taken throughout the protocols. To evaluate leg, arm, and head haemodynamics, ultrasound was used to measure blood flow at the common femoral artery, brachial artery, and common and internal carotid arteries. To evaluate cardiac function, echocardiography was used. Participants also underwent blood sampling, as well as respiratory, metabolic, blood pressure, and heart rate measurements. In single-leg heating, the study found that blood flow only increased in the leg. The two-leg and whole-body heating protocols, however, showed increased blood flow to both legs and forearms, with whole-body heating also leading to increased extracranial blood flow. None of the heating trials showed a significant difference in anterior cerebral blood flow. This finding is particularly interesting given the progressive increase in cardiac output across protocols. These results suggest that local mechanisms controlling blood flow differ across body sites, and that increased cardiac output alone does not increase perfusion. Importantly, the authors found that blood velocity increased to a greater extent than vessel diameter size, indicating that velocity predominantly contributed to the observed increase in blood flow. Additionally, there was a progressive increase in systemic vascular conductance across all heating protocols, along with increased blood kinetic energy in both two-leg and whole-body heating. Using correlational analysis, the authors showcased that increased local temperature was associated with increased local blood flow and vascular conductance. Further analysis suggests that increased cardiac output is linked with not only the aforementioned factors but also increased blood velocity and kinetic energy in the limbs and head. This supports the study's hypothesis and highlights that peripheral mechanisms may be more important than previously thought. Evaluating cardiac function revealed some key findings. Left ventricular ejection fraction and heart rate increased in all heating sessions. However, alongside the increase in heart rate was a reduction in left ventricular filling and ejection times. Despite this, stroke volume was increased or maintained in all heating protocols. This finding is likely to be due to an increase in venous return to the heart, with an increase in left ventricular end diastolic volume and a reduction in the end systolic volume. Collectively, these results indicate that hyperthermia not only drives heart rate but crucially increases venous return to enhance cardiac output. This goes against existing literature, which suggests hyperthermia reduces preload (Wilson & Crandall, 2011), possibly due to factors such as the method of assessing preload, environmental conditions, and participant characteristics. Further research would help to confirm this result. A unique finding was that whole-body heating increased left ventricular twist and untwisting rate, an effect not seen with leg-only heating. This suggests that systemic hyperthermia may engage more comprehensive cardiac adjustments, and that peripheral heating increases cardiac output without necessarily relying on central cardiac mechanisms. These findings come together to suggest an alternative model of circulation, contrary to the traditional cardio-centric view. The study found that respiratory and metabolic responses only changed in the whole-body heating protocol. There was an increase in oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, pulmonary ventilation, and end-tidal O2 pressure. In contrast, these changes were not observed in leg-only heating, yet cardiac output still increased. This differentiation suggests that metabolic and respiratory factors are not essential for increasing blood flow in peripheral hyperthermia, thereby strengthening the hypothesis of the study. However, it also shows the ongoing role of central mechanisms in certain hyperthermia conditions. This study is thoughtfully planned and provides robust data supporting the hypothesis. However, it should be noted that there are some limitations. One such limitation is the small and specific sample size of young healthy males. Although this is understandable in the context of an initial study exploring physiology in a normal state, it does reduce the generalisability of the results to other populations such as females and older groups with cardiovascular illness. Additionally, many measurements were derived using ultrasound, which tends to have a degree of inter-operator variability. It is unclear whether one or more operators were involved in conducting these measurements. However, the authors provide a thorough explanation of the ultrasound techniques used. Furthermore, the study did not directly measure right heart function or venous flow to the heart, instead inferring venous return data from their left ventricular recordings. Although this may lead to inaccuracies, similar techniques have been previously used and support this method. The authors also acknowledged that they used correlational analysis to evaluate the link between cardiac output and peripheral circulation, appropriately highlighting that this does not establish causation. The authors provide us with new insights into how human circulation is controlled, in a field where specific mechanisms behind heat-related changes are not well understood. With a deeper understanding of peripheral haemodynamics and the relationship with cardiac output, we are better positioned to conduct future research and explore treatment options for cardiovascular disease. For example, one can evaluate these findings in the context of heart failure and the potential use of lower limb heating to improve cardiac output. Although this has been previously studied (Inoue et al., 2012), there is a dearth of literature. Another interesting possibility is the use of the measurements from this study, such as blood kinetic energy, as markers of disease onset and progression, given their suggested importance. This is an important study from Watanabe et al. (2024), employing a well thought out methodology to suggest that peripheral mechanisms in passive hyperthermia are key to controlling blood circulation. They demonstrate that increases in cardiac output are linked with increases in local velocity and kinetic energy of blood flow secondary to heat, rather than central mechanisms. While there are some limitations to the research, the findings provide new insights into the study of human circulation and establish a platform for further research. This should include further physiological research in diverse populations to confirm the results, as well as clinical research to understand changes found in pathology and to identify possible treatment options.
